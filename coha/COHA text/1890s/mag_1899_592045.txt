AUTUMN IN FRANCONIA . II . THAT afternoon I took the Landaff Valley round , down the village street nearly to the junction of Gale River and Ham Branch , then up the Ham Branch ( or Landaff ) Valley to a crossroad on the left , and so back to the road from the Profile Notch , and by that home again . The jaunt , which is one of our Franconia favorites , is peculiar for being substantially level ; with no more uphill and downhill than would be included in a walk of the same distance - perhaps six miles - almost anywhere in southern New England . The first thing a man is likely to notice as lie passes the last of the village houses , and finds himself skirting the bank of Ham Branch ( which looks to be nearly or quite as full as the river into which it empties itself ) , is the color of the water . Gale River is fresh from the hills , and ripples over its stony bed as clear as crystal . The branch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a fiat meadowy valley , where it has taken on a rich earthy hue , to which it might be natural to apply a less honorable sounding word , perhaps , if it were a question of some neutral stream , in whose character and reputation I felt no personal , friendly interest . Just as I came to it , that afternoon , I saw to my surprise a white admiral butterfly sunning itself upon an alder leaf . I hope the reader knows the species , - Limenitis Art hemis , sometimes called the banded purple , - one of the prettiest and showiest of New England insects , four black or blackish wings crossed by a broad white band . It was much out of season now , I felt sure , both from what my entomological friends had told me , and from my own recollections of previous years , and I was seized with a foolish desire to capture it as a sort of trophy . It lay just beyond my reach , and I disturbed it , in hopes it would settle nearer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stick toward it , aiming not wisely but too well , and this time startled it so badly that it rose straight into the air , sailed across the stream , and came to rest far up in a tall elm . " You were never cut out for a collector of insects , " I said to myself , recalling my experience of the forenoon ; but I was glad to have seen the creature , - the first one for several years , - and went on my way as happy as a child in thinking of it . In the second half of a man 's century he may be thankful for almost anything that , for the time being , lifts twoscore of years off his back . The best part of most of us , I think , is the boy that was born with us . So far I am a Wordsworthian - " And I could wish my days to be Bound each to each by natural piety . " A little way up the valley we come to an ancient mill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I remember an old one , and a fright that I once had upon it . With a fellow itinerant - a learned man , whose life was valuable - I stopped here to rest of a summer noon , and my companion , with an eye to shady comfort , clambered over the edge of the bridge and out upon a joist which projected over the stream . There he sat down with his back against a pillar and his legs stretched before him on the joist . He has a theory , concerning which I have heard hini discourse more than once , - something in his own attitude suggesting the theme , - that when a man , after walking , " puts his feet up , " he is acting not merely upon a natural impulse , but in accordance with a sound physiological principle ; and in accordance with that principle he was acting // now , as well as the circumstances of the case would permit . We chatted awhile ; then he fell silent ; and after a time I turned my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seat was barely wide enough to hold him . What if he should move in his sleep , or start up suddenly on being awakened ? I looked at the rocks below , and shivered . I dared not disturb him , and could only sit in a kind of stupid terror and wait for him to open his eyes . Happily his nap did not last long , and came to a quiet termination ; so that the cause of science suffered no loss that day ; but I can never go by the place without thinking of what might have happened . Here , likewise , on an autumnal f orenoon , two or three years ago , I had another memorable experience ; nothing less ( nothing more , the reader may say ) than the song of a hermit thrush . It was in the season after bluebirds and hermits had been killed in such dreadful numbers ( almost exterminated , we thought then ) by cold and snow at the South . I had scarcely seen a hermit all the year , and was approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I heard a thrush 's voice . I stopped instantly . The note was repeated ; and there the bird stood in a low roadside tree ; the next minute he began singing in a kind of reminiscential half-voice , - the saul of a year 's music distilled in a few drops of sound , - such as birds of many kinds so frequently drop into in the fall . That , too , I am sure to remember as often as I pass this way . In truth , all my Franconia rambles ( I am tempted to write the name in three syllables , as I sometimes speak it , following the example of Fishin ' Jimmy and other local worthies ) , - all my " Francony " rambles , I say , are by this time full of these miserly delights . It is really a gain , perhaps , that I make the round of them but once a year . Some things are wisely kept choice . " Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare . " To get all the goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again , till every corner of it is alive with memories ; but do not see it too often , nor make your stay in it too long . The hermit thrush 's voice is all the sweeter because he is a hermit . This afternoon I do not cross the bridge , but keep to the valley road , which soon runs for some distance along the edge of a hackmatack swamp ; full of graceful , pencil-tipped , feathery trees , with here and there a dead one , on purpose foi ' woodpeckers and hawks . A hairy woodpecker is on one of them at this moment , now hammering the trunk with his powerful beak ( hammer and chisel in one ) , now lifting up his voice in a way to be heard for half a mile . To judge from his ordinary tone and manner , Dryobates villosus has no need to cultivate decision of character . Every word is peremptory , and every action speaks of energy and a mind made up . In this larch swamp , though I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , a good many things . Here grows much of the pear-leaved willow ( Salix balsamifera ) . I notice a few bushes even now as I pass , the reddish twigs each with a tuft of yellowing , redstemmed leaves at the tip . Here , one June , a Tennessee warbler sang to me ; and there are only two other places in the world in which I have been thus favored . Here , - a little farther up the valley , - on a rainy September forenoon , I once sat for an hour in the midst of as pretty a flock of birds as a man could wish to see : south-going travelers of many sorts , whom the fortunes of the road had thrown together . Here they were , lying by for a day 's rest in this favorable spot ; flitting to and fro , chirping , singing , feeding , playfully quarreling , as if life , even in rainy weather and in migration time , were all a pleasure trip . It was a sight to cure low spirits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a barn which stands here // in the woods , quite by itself , and watched them till I almost felt myself of their company . I have forgotten their names , though I listed them carefully enough , beyond a doubt , but it will be long before I forget my delight in the birds themselves . Ours may be an evii world , as the pessimists and the preachers find so much comfort in maintaining , but there is one thing to be said in its favor : its happy days are the longest remembered . The pain I suffered years ago I can not any longer make real to myself , even if I would , but the joys of that time are still almost as good as new , when occasion calls them up . Some of them , indeed , seem to have sweetened with age . This is especially the case , I think , with simple and natural pleasures ; which may be considered as a good reason why every man should be , if lie can , a lover of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the world about him . The less artificial our joys , the more likelihood of their staying by us . Not to blink at the truth , nevertheless , I must add a circumstance which , till this moment , I had clean forgotten . I was still watching the birds , with perhaps a dozen species in sight close at hand , when suddenly I observed a something come over them , and on the instant a large hawk skimmed the tops of the trees . In one second every bird was gone , - vanished , as if at the touch of a necromancer s wand . I did not see them fly ; there was no rush of wings ; but the place was empty ; and though I waited for them , they did not reappear . Two or three , indeed , I may have seen afterward , but the flock was gone . My holiday , at all events , or that part of it , was done , - shadowed by a hawk 's wing . Undoubtedly a few minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however ; and anyhow , it bears out my theory of remembered happiness , that this less cheerful part of the story had so completely passed out VOL . LXXXIII. - NO. 496. 14 of mind . Memory , like a sundial , had marked only the bright hour . Beyond this lonely barn the soil of the valley becomes drier and sandier . Here are two or three houses , with broad hayfields about them , in which live many vesper sparrows . No doubt they have lived here longer than any of their present human neighbors . Even now they flit along the wayside in advance of the foot-passenger , running a space , after their manner , and anon taking wing to alight upon a fence rail . Their year is done , but they linger still a few days , out of love for the ancestral fields , or , it may be , in dread of the long journey , from which some of them will pretty certainly never come back . All the way up the road , though no mention has been made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright-colored hills beyond the river , - sugar-maple orchards all in yellow and red , a gorgeous display , - or upon the mountains in front , Kinsman and the more distant Moosilauke . The green meadow is a good place in which to look for marsh hawks , -* as well as of great use as a foreground , - and the hill woods beyond are the resort of pileated woodpeckers . I have often seen and heard them here , but there is no sign of them to-day . Though these fine birds are generally described - one book following another , after the usual fashion - as frequenters of the wilderness , and though it is true that they have forsaken the more thickly settled parts of the country , I think I have never once seen them in the depths of the forest . To the best of my recollection none of our Franconia men have ever reported them from Mount Lafayette or from the Lonesome Lake region . On the other hand , we meet them with greater or less regularity in the more open valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Landaff Valley , but on the outskirts of the village toward Littleton and on the Bethlehem road . In this latter place I // Autumn in remember seeing a fellow prancing about the trunk of a small orchard tree within twenty rods of a house ; and not so very infrequently , especially in the rum-cherry season , they make their appearance in the immediate vicinity of the hotel ; for they , like some of their relatives , notably the sapsucker , are true cherrybirds . In Vermont , too , I have found their freshly cut " peck-holes " on the very skirts of the village . And at the South , so far as I have been able to observe , the story is the same . About Natural Bridge , Virginia , for example , a loosely settled country , with plenty of woodland but no extensive forests , the birds were constantly in evidence . In short , untainable as they look , and little as they may like a town , they seem to find themselves best off , as birds in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of Thoreau 's mind , we may say : lovers of the wild , they are yet not quite at home in the wilderness , and prefer the woodman 's path to the logger 's . Not far ahead , on the other side of the way , - to return to the Landaff Valley , - is a red maple grove , more brilliant even than the sugar orchards . It ripeus its leaves earlier than they , as we have always noticed , and is already past the acme of its annual splendor ; so that some of the trees have a peculiarly delicate and lovely purplish tint , a real bloom , never seen , I think , except on the red maple , and there only after the leaves have begun to curl and fade . Opposite it ( after whistling in vain for a dog with whom , in years past , I have been accustomed to be friendly at one of the houses - he must be dead , or gone , or grown reserved with age ) , I take the crossroad before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I stop under a favorite pine tree to enjoy the prospect and the stillness : no sound but the chirping of crickets , the peeping of hylas , and the hardly less musical hammering of a distant carpenter . Franconia . Along the wayside are many gray birches ( of the kind called white birches in Massachusetts , the kind from which Yankee schoolboys snatch a fearful joy by " swinging off " their tops ) , the only ones I remember about Franconia ; for which reason I sometimes call the road Gray Birch Road ; and just beyond them I stop again . Here is a bit for a painter : a lovely vista , such as makes a man wish for a brush and the skill to use it . The road dips into a little hollow , turns gently , and passes out of sight within the shadow of a wood . And above the overarching trees rises the pyramidal mass of Mount Cannon , its middle part set with dark evergreens , which are flanked on either side with broad patches of light yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its level rays flood the whole mountain forest with light . Into the shadow I go , following the road , and after a turn or two come out at a small clearing and a house . " Rocky Farm , " we might name it ; for the land is sprinkled over with huge boulders , as if giants had been at play here . Whoever settled the place first must have chosen the site for its outlook rather than for any hope of its fertility . I sit down on one of the stones and take my fill of the mountain glory : Garfield , Lafayette , Cannon , Kinsman , Moosilauke , - a grand horizonful . Cannon is almost within reach of the hand , as it looks ; but the arm might need to be two miles long . Just here the road makes a sudden bend , passes again into light woods , and presently emerges upon a little knoll overlooking the upper Franconia meadows . This is the noblest prospect of the afternoon , and late as the hour is growing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house at this point also - amid gaze upon it . The green meadow is spread at my feet , flanming maple woods range themselves beyond it , and behind them , close at hand , loom the sombre mountains . I had forgotten // that this part of the road was so " viewly , " to borrow a local word , and am thankful to have reached it at so favorable a moment . Now the shadow of the low hills at my back overspreads the valley , while the upper world beyond is aglow with light and color . It is *lve o'clock , and I must be getting homeward . Down at the valley level the evening chill strikes me , after the exceptional warmth of the day , and by the time Tucker Brook is crossed the bare summit of Lafayette is of a ( leep rosy purple , - the rest of the world sunless . The day is over , and the remaining miles are taken somewhat hurriedly , although I stop below the Profile House farn to look for a fresh bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open at this late date , many as the plants are , - and at one or two other places to pluck a tempting maple twig . Sated with the magnificence of autumnal forests , hill after hill splashed with color , the eye loves to withdraw itself now and then to rest upon the perfection of a blossom or a leaf . Wagonloads of tourists come down the Notch road , the usual nightly procession , some silent , some boisterously singing . Among the most distressing of all the noises that human beings make is this vulgar shouting of " sacred music " along the public highway . This time the hymn is Jerusalem the Golden , after the upper notes of which an unhappy female voice is vainly reaching , like a boy who has lost his wind in shinning up a tree , and with his last gasping effort still finds the lowest branch just beyond the clutch of his fingers . " I know not , oh , I know not , " I hear her shriek , and then a lucky turn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to the still small voice of the brook , which , whether it " knows " or not , has the grace to make no fuss about it . Let that one human discord be forgotten . It had been a glorious day ; 211 few lovelier were ever made : a day without a cloud ( literally ) , and almost without a breath ; a day to walk , and a day to sit still ; a long feast of beauty ; and withal , it had for me a perfect conclusion , as if Nature herself were setting a benediction upon the hours . As I neared the end of my jaunt , the hotel already in sight , Venus in all her splendor hung low in the west , the full moon was showing its rim above the trees in the east , and at the same moment a vesper sparrow somewhere in the darkening fields broke out with its evening song . Five or six times it sang , and then fell silent . It was enough . The beauty of the day was complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less delightful : mild , still , and cloudless ; so that it was l ) leasant to lounge upon the piazza in the early morning , looking at Lafayette , - good business of itself , - and listening to the warble of a bluebird , the soft chips of myrtle warblers , or the distant gobbling of a turkey down at one of the river farms ; while now and then a farmer drove past from his morning errand at the creamery , with one or two tall milk-cans standing behind him in the open , one-seated carriage . If you see a man on foot as far from the village as this , you may set him down , in ornithological language , as a summer resident or a transient visitor . Franconians , to the manner born , are otherwise minded , and will " hitch up " for a quarter of a mile . As I take the Notch road after breakfast the temperature is summer-like , and the foliage , I think , must have reached its brig1*test . Above the Profile House farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Franconia Valley lies exposed , I seat myself on the wall , inside the natural hedge that borders the highway , to admire the scene : a long verdant meadow , flanked by low hills covered , mile after mile , with vivid reds and yellows ; splendor beyond words ; a pageant glorious to behold , but happily of brief dura // tion . Human senses would weary of it , though the eye loves color as the palate loves spices and sweets , or , by force of looking at it , would lose all delicacy of perception and taste . Even yet the world , viewed in broad spaces , wears a clean , fresh aspect ; but near at hand the herbage and shrubbery are all in the sere and yellow leaf . So I am saying to myself when I start at the sound of a Hudsonian chickadee 's nasal voice speaking straight into my ear . The saucy chit has dropped into the low poplar sapling over my head , and surprised at what he discovers underneath lets fall a hasty Sick-a-day-day . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cousin , our familiar blackcap . In fact , I might say of him , with his dirty brown headdress , what I was thinking of the roadside vegetation : he looks dingy , out of condition , frayed , discolored , belated , frost-bitten . But I am delighted to see him , - for the first time at any such level as this , - and thank my stars that I sat down to rest and cool off on this hard but convenient boulder . A chipmunk thinks I have sat here long enough , and feels no bashfulness about telling me so . Why should he ? Frankness is esteemed a point of good manners in all natural society . A man shoots down the hill behind me on a bicycle , coasting like the wind , and another , driving up , salutes him by name , and then turns to cry after him in a ringing voice , " How be ye ? " The emphatic verb bespeaks a real solicitude on the questioner 's part ; but he is half a mile too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the moon . Presently two men in a buggy come up the road , talking in breezy up-country fashion about some one whose name they use freely , - a name well known hereabout , - and with whom they appear to have business relations . " He got up this morning like a - thousand of brick , " one of them says . A disagreeable person to work for , I should suppose . And all the while a child behind the hedge is taking notes . Queer things we could print , if it were allowable to report verbati in . When this free . spoken pair is far enough in the lead I go back to the road again , traveling slowly and keeping to the shady side , with my coat on my arm . As the climb grows steeper the weather grows more and more like August ; and hark I a cicada is shrilling in one of the forest trees , - a long-drawn , heat-laden , midsummer cry . I will tell the entomologist about it , I promise myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to interest her . ( But she takes it as a matter of course . It is hard to bring news to a specialist . ) So I go on , up Hardscrabble and Little Hardscrabble , stopping like a shortwinded horse at every water-bar , and thankful for every bird-note that calls me to a halt between times . An ornithological preoccupation is a capital resource when the road is getting the better of you . The brook likewise must be minded , and some of the more memorable of the wayside trees . A mountain road has one decided and inalienable advantage , I remark inwardly : the most perversely opinionated highway surveyor in the world can not straighten it . How fast the leaves are falling , though the air scarcely stirs among them . In some places I walk through a real shower of gold . Theirs is an easy death . And how many times I have been up and down this road ! Summer and autumn I have traveled it . And in what pleasant company ! Now I am alone ; but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are having a pretty good time of it , I think , - the trees , the brook , the winding road , the yellow birch leaves , and the human pilgrim , who feels himself one with them all . I hope they would not disown a poor relation . It is ten o'clock . Slowly as I have come , not a wagonload of tourists has // caught up with me ; and at the Bald Mountain path I leave the highway , having a sudden notion to go to Echo Lake by the way of Artist 's Bluff , so called , a rocky cliff that rises abruptly from the lower end of the lake . The trail conducts me through a veritable fernery , one long slope being thickly set with perfectly fresh shield - ferns , - Aspidiuin spinulosum and perhaps A. dilatat ? un , though I do not concern myself to be sure of it . From the bluff the lake is at my feet , but what mostly fills my eye is the woods on the lower side of Mount Cannon . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in them : so soft , so bright , so various in their hues , - dark green , light green , russet , yellow , red , - all drowned in sunshine , yet veiled perceptibly with haze even at this slight distance . If there is anything in nature more exquisitely , ravishingly beautiful than an old mountainside forest looked at from above , I do not know where to find it . Down at the lakeside there is beauty of another kind : the level blue water , the clean gray shallows about its margin , the reflections of bright mountains - Eagle Cliff and Mount Cannon - in its face , and soaring into the sky , on either side and in front , the mountains themselves . And how softly the ground is matted under the shrubbery and trees : twin - flower , partridge berry , creeping snowberry , gold - thread , oxalis , dwarf cornel , checkerberry , trailing arbutus . The very names ought to be a means of grace to the pen that writes them . White - throats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I sit on a spruce log , but for some reason there are few birds here to-day . The fact is exceptional . As a rule , I have found the bushes populous , and once , I remember , not many days later than this , there were fox sparrows with the rest . I am hoping some time to find a stray phalarope swimming in the lake . That would be a sight worth seeing . The 213 lake itself is always here , at any rate , especially now that the summer people are gone ; an ( l if the wind is right and the sun out , so that a man can sit still with comfort ( to-day my coat is superfluous ) , the absence of other things does not greatly matter . This clean waterside must have many four-footed visitors , particularly in the twilight and after dark . Deer and bears are common inhabitants of the mountain woods ; but for my eyes there are nothing but squirrels , with once in a long while a piece of wilder game . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fox . Once I was alone , in the wood-road to Sinclair 's Mills . I rounded a curve , and there the fellow stood in the middle of the way smelling at something in the rut . After a bit ( my glass had covered him instantly ) he raised his head and looked down the road in a direction opposite to mine . Then he turned , saw me , started slightly , stood quite still for a fraction of a minute ( I wondered why ) , and vanished in the woods , his white brush waving me farewell . He was gone so instantaneously that it was hard to believe he had really been there . That was a pretty good look ( at a fox ) , but far less satisfying than the other of my Franconia experiences . With two friends I had come down through the forest from the Notch railroad by a rathet blind loggers ' trail , heading for a pair of abandoned farms , grassy fields in which it is needful to give heed to one 's steps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing a fox was not more than five or six rods before us , feeding in the grass . Her eyes were on her work , the wind was in our favor , and notwithstanding two of us were almost wholly exposed , we stood there on the edge of the forest for the better part of half an hour , glasses up , passing comments upon her behavior . Evidently she was lunching upon insects , - grasshoppers or crickets , I suppose , - and so taken up was she with this // agreeable employment that she walked directly toward us and passed within ten yards of our position , stopping every few steps for a fresh capture . The sunlight , which shone squarely in her face , seemed to affect her unpleasantly ; at all events she blinked a good deal . Her manner of stepping about , her motions in catching her prey , - driving her nose deep into the grass and pushing it home , - and in short her whole behavior , were more catlike than doglike , or so we all thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor did she betray the slightest grain of suspiciousness or wariness , never once casting an eye about in search of possible enemies . A dog in his own dooryard could not have seemed less apprehensive of danger . As often as she approached the surrounding wood she turned and hunted back across the field . We might have played the spy upon her indefinitely ; but it was always the same thing over again , and by and by , when she passed for a little out of sight behind a tuft of bushes , we followed , careless of the result , and , as it seemed , got into her wind . She started on the instant , ran gracefully up a little incline , still in the grass land , turned for the first time to look at us , and disappeared in the forest . A pretty creature she surely was , and from all we saw of her she might have been accounted a very useful farm-hand ; but perhaps , as farmers sometimes say of unprofitable cattle , she would soon have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not fearless , - like a woodchuck that once walked up to me and smelled of my boot , as I stood still in the road near the Crawford House , - but simply off her guard ; and our finding her in such a mood was simply a bit of good luck . Some day , possibly , we shall catch a weasel asleep . In a vacation season , like our annual fortnight in New Hampshire , there is no predicting which jaunt , if any , will turn out superior to all the rest . It may b ea longer and comparatively newer one ( although in Franconia we find few new ones now , partly because we no longer seek them - the old is better , we are apt to say when any innovation is suggested ) ; or , thanks to something in the day or something in the mood , it may be one of the shortest and most familiar . And when it is over , there may be a sweetness in the memory , hut little to talk about ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes naturally into a notebook . In other words , the best walk , for us , is the one in which we are happiest , the one in which we feel the most , not of necessity the one in which we see the most ; or , to put it differently still , the one in which we do see the most , but with " that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude . " Whatever we may call ourselves at home , among the mountains we are lovers of pleasure . Our day 's work is to he happy . We take our text from the good Longfellow , as theologians take theirs from Scripture - " Enjoyment , and not sorrow , is our destined end . " We are not anxious to learn anything ; our thoughts run not upon wisdom ; if we take note of a plant or a bird , it is rather for the fun of it than for any scholarly purpose . We are boys out of school . I speak of myself and of the man I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects , of course , are more serious - minded . " No day without a beetle , " is their motto , and their absorption , even in Franconia , is in adding to the world 's stock of knowledge . Let them be respected accordingly . Our creed is more frankly hedonistic ; and their virtue - I am free to confess it - shines the brighter for the contrast . This year , nevertheless , old Franconia had for us , also , one most welcome novelty , the story of which I have kept , like the good wine , - a pretty small glassful , // I am aware , - for the end of the feast . I had never enjoyed the old things better . Eight or nine years ago , writing - in this magazine - of June in Francoma , I expressed a fear that our delight in the beauty of nature might grow to be less keenly felt with advancing age ; that we might ultimately be driven to a more scientific use of the outward world , putting the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge , in the place of rapturous contemplation . So it may yet fall out , to be sure , since age is still advancing , but as far as present indications go , nothing of the sort seems at all immninent . I begin to believe , in fact , that things will turn the other way ; that curiosity will rather lose its edge , and the power of beauty strike deeper and deeper home . So may it be ! Then we shall not be dead while we live . Sure I am that the glory of mountains , the splendor of autumnal forests , the sweetness of valley prospects , were never more rapturously felt by me than during the season just ended . And still , as I started just now to say , I had special joy this year in a new specimen , an additional bird for my memory and notebook . The forenoon of September 26 , my fourth day , I spent on Garnet Hill . The grand circuit of that hill is one of the best esteemed of our longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , having to speed the pace a little uncomfortably for the last four or five miles ; but times have begun to alter with us , or perhaps we have profited by experience ; for the last few years . at any rate , we have made the trip an all-day affair , dining on Sunset Hill , and loitering down through the Landaff Valley - with a side excursion , it may be , to fill up the hours - in the afternoon . This trip , being , as I say , one of those we most set by , I was determined to hold in reserve against the arrival of my fellow foot-traveler ; but there is also a pleasant shorter course , not round the bill , but , so to speak , over one side of it : out by the way of what I call High Bridge Road ( never having heard any name for it ) , and back by the road - hardly more than a lane for much of its length - which traverses the hill diagonally on its northeastern slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the Franconia Inn . I left the Littleton road for the road to the Streeter neighborhood , crossed Gale River by a bridge pitched with much labor at a great height above it ( a good indication of the swelling to which mountain streams are subject ) , passed two or three retired valley farms ( where were eiott or ten sleek young calves , one of which , rather to my surprise , ate from my hand a sprig of mint as if she liked the savor of it ) , and then began a long , steep climb . For much of the distance the road - narrow and very little traveled - is lined with dense alder and willow thickets , excellent cover for birds . It was partly with this place in my eye that I had chosen my route , remembering an hour of much interest here some years ago with a large flock of migrants . To.day , as it happened , the bushes were comparatively birdless . White-throats and snowbirds were present , of course , and ruby-crowned kinglets , with a solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prospect , however , without being magnificent or - for Franconia - extensive , was full of attractiveness . Gale River hastening through a gorge overhung with forest , directly on my right , Streeter Pond farther away ( two deer had been shot beside it that morning , as I learned before night , - news of that degree of importance travels fast ) , and the gay-colored hills toward Littleton and Bethlehem , - maple grove on maple grove , with all their banners flying , - these made a delightsome panorama , shifting with every twist in the road and with every rod of the ascent ; so that I had excuse more // than sufficient for continually stopping to breathe and face about . In one place I remarked a goodly bed of coltsfoot leaves , noticeable for their angular shape as well as for their peculiar shade of green . I wished for a 1 ) lossom . If the dandelion sometimes anticipates the season , why not the coltsfoot ? But I found no sign of flower or bud . Probably the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it so seldom that all my ideas about it are no better than guesswork . Along the wayside was maidenhair fern , also , which I do not come upon any too often in this mountain country . Midway of the hill stands a solitary house , where I found my approach spied upon through a crack between the curtain and the sash of what seemed to be a parlor window ; a flattering attention which , after the manner of high public functionaries , I took as a tribute not to myself , but to the role I was playing . No doubt travelers on foot are rare on that difficult , out-of-the-way road , and the walker rather than the man was what filled my lady 's eye ; unless , as may easily have been true , she was expecting to see a peddler 's pack . At this point the road crooks a sharp elbow , and henceforth passes through cultivated country , - orchards and ploughed land , grass fields and pasturage ; still without houses , however , and having a pleasant natural hedgerow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great congregation of sparrows and myrtle warbiers , with sapsuckers , flickers , downy woodpeckers , solitary vireos , and I forget what else , though I sat on the wall for some time refreshing myself with their cheerful society . I agreed with them that life was still a good thing . Then came my novelty . I was but a little way past this aviary of an apple orchard when I approached a pile of brush , - dry branches which had been heaped against the roadside bank some years ago , and up through which bushes and weeds were growing . My eyes sought it instinctively , and at the same moment a bird moved inside . A sparrow , alone ; a sparrow , an ( l a new one ! " A Lincoln finch ! " I thought ; and just then the creature turned , and I saw his forward parts : a streaked breast with a bright , well-defined buff band across it , as if the streaks had been marked in first an ( l then a wash of yellowish had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finch ! He was out of sight almost before I saw him , however , arid after a bit of feverish waiting I squeaked . He did not come up to look at me , as I hoped lie would ( 10 , but the sudden noise startled him , and he moved slightly , enough so that my eye again found him . This time , also , I saw his head and his breast , and then he was lost again . Again I waited . Then I squeaked , waited , and squeaked again , louder and longer than before . No answer , and no sign of movement . You might have sworn there was no bird there ; and perhaps you would not have perjured yourself ; for presently I stepped up to the brush-heap and trampled it over , and still there was no sign of life . Above the brush was a low stone wall , and beyond that a bare ploughed field . How the fellow had slipped away there was no telling . And that was the end of the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln finch . It was a shabby interview he had granted me , after keeping me waiting for almost twenty years ; but then , I repeated for my comfort , I had seen him . He was less confusingly like a song sparrow than I had been prepared to find him . His general color ( one of a bird 's best marks in life , hard as it may be to derive an exact idea of it from printed descriptions ) , gray with a greenish tinge , - a little suggestive of Henslow 's bunting , as it struck me , - this , I thought , supposing it to be constant , ought to catch the eye at a glance . Henceforth I should know what to look for , and might expect better luck ; although , if this particular bird 's beha // vior was to be taken as a criterion , the books had been quite within the mark in emphasizing the sly and elusive habit of the species , and the consequent difficulty of prolonged and satisfactory observation of it . rhe Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a congener of the song sparrow and the swamp sparrow , a native mostly of the far north , and while common enough as a migrant in many parts of the United States , is , or is generally supposed to be , something of a rarity in the Eastern States . Meanwhile , having beaten the brush over , and looked up the roadside and down the roadside and over the wall , I went on my way , stopping once for a feast of blackberries , - as many and as good as a man could ask for , long , slender , sweet , and dead ripe ; and at the top of the road I cut across a hayfield to the lane before mentioned , that should take me back to the Sugar Hill highway . Now the prospects were in front of me , there was no more steepness of grade , I had seen Tom Lincoln 's finch , ' and the day was brighter than ever . Every sparrow that stirred I must put my glass on ; but not one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove not far from the Franconia Inn , I found myself all at once in the midst of one of those traveling flocks that make so delightful a break in a bird-lover 's day . I was in the midst of it , I say ; but the real fact was that the birds were passing through the grove between me and the sky . For the time being the branches were astir with wings . Such minutes are exciting . " Now or never , " a man says to himself . Every second is precious . At *liis precise moment a warbler is above your head , far up in the topmost bough perhaps , half hidden by a leaf . If you miss him , he is gone forever . If you make " I named it Tom 's Finch , " says Audubon , " in honor of our friend Lincoln , who was a great favorite among us. " him out , well and good ; he may be a rarity , a prize long waited for ; or , quite as likely , while busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass along unnoticed . In this game , as in any other , a man must run his chances ; though there is skill as well as luck iii it , without doubt , and one player will take a trick or two more than another , with the same hand . In the present instance , so far as my canvass showed , the " wave " was made up of myrtle warbiers , blackpolls , baybreasts , black-throated greens , a chestnut-side , a Maryland yellow-throat , redeyed vireos , solitary vireos , one or more scarlet tanagers ( in undress , of course , and pretty late by my reckoning ) , rubycrowned kinglets , chickadees , winter wrens , goldfinches , song sparrows , and flickers . The last three or four species , it is probable enough , were in the grove only by accident , and are hardly to be counted as part of the south-bound caravan . Several of the species were in good force , and doubtless some species eluded me altogether . No man can look all ways at once ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but that of the ears as well . All the while the birds hastened on , flitting from tree to tree , feeding a minute and then away , following the stream . I was especially glad of the haybreasts , of which there were two at least , both very distinctly marked , though in nothing like their spring plumage . I saw only one other specimen this fall , but the name is usually in my autumnal Franconia list . The chestnut - side , on the other hand , was the first one I had ever found here at this season , and was correspondingly welcome . After all , a catalogue of names gives but a meagre idea of such a flock , except to those who have seen similar ones , and amused themselves with them in a similar manner . But I had had the fun , whether I can make any one else appreciate it or not , and between it and my // joy over the Lincoln finch I went home in high feather . Five days longer I followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes too quickly for me to name him , I thought of Mielospiza uncolni . Once , in ( lee ( l , on the Bethlehem road , I believed that I really saw a bird of that species ; but it was in the act of disappearing , and no amount of pains or patience - or no amount that I had to spare - could procure me a second glimpse . On the sixth day came my friend , the second foot-passenger , and was told of my good fortune ; and together we began forth*vith to walk - and look at sparrows . This , also , was vain , until the morning of October 4 . I was out first . A robin was cackling from a tall treetop , as I stepped upon the piazza , and a song sparro*v sang from a cluster of bushes across the way . Other birds were there , and I went over to have a look at them two or three white-throats , as many song sparrows , and a white-crown . Then by squeaking I called into sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , to be found in such a place ) , and directly afterward up hopped a small grayish sparrow , seen at a glance to be like my bird of nine days before , - like him in looks , but not in behavior . He conducted himself in the most accommodating manner , was full of curiosity , not in the least shy , and afforded me every opportunity to look him over to my heart 's content . In the midst of it all I heard my comrade 's footfall on the piazza , and gave him a whistle . He came at once , wading through the wet grass in his slippers . He knew from my attitude - so he firmly declared afterward - that it was a Lincoln finch I was gazing at ! And just as he drew near , the sparrow , sitting in full view and facing us , in a way to show off his peculiar marks to the best advantage , uttered a single cheep , thoroughly distinctive , or at least quite unlike any sparrow 's note with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the song sparrow 's tut . Then he dropped to the ground . " Yes , I saw him , and heard the note , " my companion said ; and he hastened into the house for his boots and his opera-glass . In a few minutes he was back again , fnlly equipped , and we set ourselves to coax the fellow into making another display of himself . Sure enough , he respondecl almost immediately , and we had another satisfying observation of him , though this time he kept silence . I was especially interested to find , what I had on general considerations suspected , that Lincoln finches were like other members of their family . Take them right ( by themselves , and without startling them to begin with ) , and they could be as complaisant as one could desire , no matter how timid an ( l elusive they might be undci different conditions . Our bird was certainly a jewel . For a while lie pleased us by perching side by side with a song sparrow . " You see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying ; " you may know me partly by that . " And we fancied we should know him thereafter ; but a novice 's knowledge is only a novice 's , as we were to be freshly reminded that very day . Our jaunt was round Garnet Hill , the all-day expedition before referred to . I will not rehearse the story of it ; hut while we were on the farther side of the hill , somewhere in Lisbon , we found the roadsides swarming with sparrows , - a mixed flock , song sparrows , field sparrows , chippers , and white-crowns . Among them one of us by and by detected a grayish , smallish bird , and we began hunting him , from bush to bush and from one side of the road to the other , carrying on all the while an eager debate as to his identity . Now we were sure of him , and now everything was unsettled . His breast was streaked and had a yellow band across it . His color and size were right , as well as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no difficulty whatever in picking him out at a glance after losing him in a flying bunch ; but some of his motions were pretty song-sparrow-like , and what my fellow observer was most staggered by , he showed a blotch , a running together of the dark streaks , in the middle of the breast , - a point very characteristic of the song sparrow , but not mentioned in book descriptions of Melospiza lincolni . So we chased him and discussed him ( that was the time for a gun , the professional will say ) , till he got away from us for good . Was he a Lincoln finch ? Who knows ? We left the question open . But I believe he was . The main reason , not to say the only one , for our uncertainty was the pectoral blotch ; and that , I have since learned , is often seen in specimens of Melospiza lincolni . Why the manuals make no reference to it I can not tell ; as I can not tell why they omit the same point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " popular " magazine articles , many things must no doubt be passed over for lack of room . In any case , it is not the worst misfortune that could befall us to have some things left for our own finding out . And after all , the question was not of supreme importance . Though I was delighted to have seen a new bird , and doubly delighted to have seen it in Franconia , the great joy of my visit was not in any such fragment of knowledge , but in that bright and glorious world ; mountains and valleys beautiful in themselves , and endeared by the memory of happy days among them . Sometimes I wonder whether the pleasures of memory may not be worth the price of growing old .
