txt A copy of Thomas C. Platt 's statement , printed in THE Nsw-YORK TIMES yesterday , was shown to Mayor Strong , and he was asked whether he desired to make any comment on it . The Mayor read aloud the paragraph which said : " The conduct of the chiefs of the present reform administration has been a thousand times more disgraceful than any of the known transactions of Tammany Hall . " Commenting on this remark of ex-Senator Platt , Col. Strong said : " The author of the above expression did not make the statement unless he thought it was true , and the Mayor of New-York will give $500 for any authentic information . that will prove a case of bribery and corruption having been committed by any one of his appointees , or the subordinates of those appointees . " The Mayor next referred to the following portion of Mr. Platt 's interview : " It is no secret that positions with salaries of thousands of dollars a year have been offered to Republican leaders to betray the organization . " Replying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 for any well authenticated case substantiating this statement . Referring to the statement that " neither is it a secret iohat men who obtained places are threatened with dismissal ; or have been dismissed , when they failed to obey the orders of the bolting bosses , " the Mayor said he would give $500 to any one who will establish the fact that an employe of the City Government has been dismissed or threatened with dismissal by any of the Commissioners if he did not comply with the orders of the so-called Brookfield faction , and that the offer would hold good as long as he remained in office . " This administration , " said Mayor Strong , is specially directed by the people to enforce a government of strict integrity and honesty , and to free the city and its departments from corruption of all kinds , and I will welcome any information concerning any of the statements in reference to dishonesty in any department of the city , of any kind wherever shown , so that it may be at once stopped . " Among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tax Department , Mr. Einstein of the Dock Department , Col. Grant of the Police Department , Mr. Plimley , Commissioner of Jurors ; George Wanmaker , in a responsible position in the Department of Public Charities ; Mr. Bulkley , in the Park Avenue Improvement Commission ; Mr. Mamilton , in the Subway Board , and Mr. Healy , in the Mayor 's Marshal 's office , who are supposed to sympathize with the majority element of the County Committee , and who can give personal evidence of the entire independence with which they have been at liberty to act , and who are as much respected by me as any of the other Commissioners , and they all will cheefully , I have no doubt , bear witness that they have never once been consulted as to any position they should take in their public appointments . " Personally I have taken no active part in the questions of difference between the two factions in the Republican County Committee . From the start to the present moment . I have refrained from taking such part , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever intimated to any man that he should act with either faction . There is no Republican in the City of iNew-York who has called at the Mayor 's office who has received from me an intimation that he should act with either of these factions , and this applies as well to the Democratic factions that united with the Republicans in the election of 1894 . " The people are the best judges as to whether honest methods of administration have been introduced into the City Government , and as to whether the principles of former years have been eliminated or not . " In the appointments of this administration I have merely followed out the directions of the platform upon which I was elected , which was the platform adopted by the Republican nominating County Convention , and which instructed me to conduct the city 's affairs upon business principles regardless of other considerations . " DIFFERENT AFTER MAYOR 'S OFFER . Mr. Lauterbach Thinks Ile Can Win Some of Col. Strong 's Money . " The charges of bribery made by Mr. Platt in his statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee , early yesterday , " will not be left unsubstantiated . " Mr. Platt 's statement in this regard was general . I will particularize . In due course of time , within two or three days , I will make public a list of persons who have been approached with offers of bribes in the form of lucrative positions to betray their organization . " The list will contain from twenty to twenty-five names , and each man wha was approached will tell of the circumstances with minuteness . I am busy now preparing a , detailed statement in regard to the enrollmeht . The question of bribery will be reached and dealt with later . " When the offers which the Mayor made were shown to Mr. Lauterbach last night by a reporter for THE NEW-YORK TIMES , he replied : ' That 's a good deal of money , but I think I can satisfy some reasonable men that I am entitled to some of the Mayor 's money . That must be after I have had time to go over the various specifications , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to Bribery He Should Be Careful How He Talks . William Brookfield , who is going to the Mediterranean , and who will be a passenger on the Fuerst Bismarck to-day , said yesterday , in speaking of Mr. Platt 's state-ment : " I regard Mr. Platt 's influence now as a standing menace to good government . " Eulogizing the administration ' . and honesty of purpose of Mayor/ Stiong , - Mr. Brookfield said that the Mayor 's efforts toward fairness and decent government had been made , despite the efforts of Mr. Platt . " It seems to me , " he said , " that Mr. Platt 's talk of bolting comes . with poor grace from the man who was the chief among bolters . To him more than to any other person belongs the responsibility for the debauched and degraded condition of Republican politics in this country . " Mr. Platt quotes me as having remarked that it was fortunate for the Republican Party that the Electoral vote of the State of New-York would not be required for the Republican President next November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the belief that it is a fortunate thing that a Republican President can be elected without the aid of New-York State , because in the present condition of affairs within the Republican Party of the city and the State , the people are so disgusted as to make them indifferent as to which party shall succeed . " As to bribery . Mr. Platt should be careful how he talks . If he were deprived of a power to levy contributions upon corporations and disburse them his own way , his power as a political leader would disappear . Without patronage he would be weak indeed . In all probability a single appointment - from Gov . Morton saved him from political annihilation . If the Governor had appointed a man inimical to the political fortunes of Mr. Platt as State Superintendent of Public Works , Mr. Platt would to-day be an unimportant factor in the State of New-York . " Charles Stewart Smith . " Mr. Platt , " said Charles Stewart Smith , " is striving to cover up a crime against the suffrage , and through it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been partly revealed , and to discount the effect of further exposure he raises a counter-cry . " John E. Milholland , John E. Milholland. after denying that his Committee of Five Hundred was made up largely of the old Industrial Alliance , and discussing the charges of bolting made in Mr. Platt 's statement , said : " Mr. Platt says , speaking of the Mayor 's administration , that bribery and corruption have stalked through the streets day and night , and that it is no secret that positions with salaries of thousands of dollars a year have been offered to Republican leaders to betray the organization . " I fear that , with the memory of the Lexow committee disclosures ringing in our ears , the decent citizens will pause before accepting this reckless statement . It is , however , a fair sample of the whole interview . I know why he made this statement . He sees at last that a serious movement has started again , and he fears a rival organization . He knows that his own fraudulent organization will not stand twenty-four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take an intei est in fair play . " " I have nothing to say , " declared Gen. C. H. T. Collis , Commissioner of Public Works . " I do not concern myself with Mr. Platt 's utterances and am not to be drawn into a controversy . What Mr. Platt says does not interest me . I have no time for troubling about such matters . Just now I have all I can attend to in looking after the Spring work of my department . " MR . PLATT THE BOLTER , HE SAYS . Cornelius N. Bliss Comments on the Ex-Senator 's Published Statement . " Mr. Platt has made statements in his interview published this morning , " said Cornelius N. Bliss yesterday , " that nobody better than he knows to be untrue . He talks about ' voters ' and men who wish to ' rule or ruin . ' Mr. Platt has been a ' voter ' and an exponent of the ' rule or ruin ' policy ever since I have known him . He bolted from Garfield , from Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization in this city when it was rehabilitated by the Committee of Thirty . " He was not personally a member of that organization , and had no right to interfere , as he is not a voter in this city , although he had his henchmen in the body , and he opposed the Committee of Thirty to the utmost extent of his power , and was only prevented from breaking up the party in his county by the shrewder members of the State Committee calling a halt . " This surrender , however , was only for a moment ; he fastened on the city organization again when the Republican Party had joined heartily in the campaign of the Committee of Seventy , which redeemed this  --  city from Tammany misrule , intending to control , through the machine , the patronage of the Strong administration . Failing in this , he bolted again , in connection with members whose only desire was to possess the spoils of office . He and his friends as persistently pursued the ' rule or ruin ' policy ever since and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held , which have been proved beyond question to be largely fraudulent . " It may be that Republicans will submit to the rule of this man and his County Committee ' . They would have the public think that every one who opposes their demands is a bolter and a sinner . But whatever comes of the party , as the result of the doings of these men , Mr. Platt will be responsible . " Mr. Platt says that he is honestly for Gov . Morton for President . That I am not inclined to doubt , but I fear the Governor will get little comfort from an advocate who deliberately so acts as to make it impossible for self-respecting men to he allied with him even for a good purpose . It has been the general opinion of Republicans that Mr. Morton would be presented to the National Convention as the candidate of New-York for the Presidency . His candidacy is popular , so far as his own personality goes ; but , if to advocate Mr. Morton 's nomination is to adopt Mr. Platt as leader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of Mr. Morton 's best friends will hesitate to commit themselves to the enterprise . " I have carefully avoided in the pending political controversy making personal comment upon Mr. Platt , and I regret being nqw drawn into a controversy ; but , as he has seen fit to refer to me in public journals in an unjustifiable way , I feel obliged to take notice of his action , which I believe will be condemned by every respectable citizen .
