txt Those members of Congress who were of the opinion a few months ago that they would never consent to an increase of the public indebtedness by an issue of bonds will undoubtedly be called upon to reconsider their former opinion and to adopt a new one as the alternative of an appalling deficiency of means at the disposal of the Secretary of the Treasury . Corporations that are in better apparent condition than the Treasury of the United States are going into the hands of receivers from day to day , and might be saved if they could borrow money . The United States Government would find ready creditors all over the Union if it would decide to borrow , and it must borrow or be distressed . The men who are opposing the suggestion that the country should be run on borrowed money forget that the Treasury is now using for current expenses the fund obtained by borrowing money . The fund secured by sales of bonds to provide for resumption is being daily used up to meet current obligations . When that is drawn upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another element of annoyance may be added to the situation . Men who now ask for a bond issue were most determined in their opposition to that suggestion less than a year ago . The idea that it was necessary was treated as a suggestion made by selfish and scheming men , interested principally in providing a new lease of life for national banks . If the bond issue could have been made months ago , the Treasury would have been much easier , and the necessity for providing new and immediate sources of revenue would not have been so pressing . It will be several months before the Treasury can begin to realize any benefits from the new Tariff bill , if its passage should be followed by an increa Re of importations . Secretary Carlisle has now asked for the permission to issue bonds . With that power he can obtain money at once and stop using up the redemption fund , that bids fair to be exhausted unless a bond issue is permitted . Alid the bond issue must be allowed , even if all the schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Appropriations . The Treasury net balance to-day declined to the low figure of $88,914,096 , of which =.024,796 is in gold and $6.889,300 is in currency . This is the lowest point ever reached by the Treasury , but each successive day only makes it lower . At the beginning of the fiscal year the net balance was $122,500,000 , and at the commencement of December it was $95,000,000 . As stated in these dispatches from time to time , little hope is entertained that the receipts will increase to any material extent during the next few months . January is the heaviest month in the year for Treasury expenditures . Nearly $6,000,000 of interest will have tp be paid during January , besides a considerable amount for sugar bounties , aside from the orainary expenses of the Government , which include pensions . With these heavy disbursements in sight and receipts continuing to . decline , experts at the Treasury figure a net loss for January of twelve or thirteen million dollars , leaving the net balance Feb. 1 not over $76,000,000 . Many accounts , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suspended or postponed , because of the depleted condition of the Treasury . This class of accounts , which include public works , public buildings , adjudicated claims , &c.,; has been estimated to foot up more than $100,000,000.
