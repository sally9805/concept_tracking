txt THINK that every man ought to work for his living , without exception , and that when he has once avouched his willingness to work , society should provide him with work and warrant him a living . I do not think any man ought to live by an art . A man 's art should be his privilege , when he has proven his fitness to exercise it , and has otherwise earned his daily bread ; and its results should be free to all . There is an instinctive sense of this , even in the midst of the grotesque confusion of our economic being ; people feel that there is something profane , something impious , in taking money for a picture , or a poem , or a statue . Most of all , the artist himself feels this . He puts on a bold front with the world , to be sure , and brazens it out as Business ; but he knows very well that there is something false and vulgar in it ; and that the work which can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . He can , of course , say that the priest takes money for reading the marriage service , for christening the new-born babe , and for saying iMe last *Alice for the dead ; that the physician sells healing ; that justice itself is paid for ; and that he is merely a party to the thing that is and must be . He can say that , as the thing is , unless he sells his art he can not live , that society will leave him to starve if he does not hit its fancy in a picture , or a poem , or a statue ; and all this is bitterly true . He is , and he must be , only too glad if there is a market for his wares . Without a market for his wares he must perish , or turn to making something that will sell better than pictures , or poems , or statues . All the same , the sin and the shame remain , and the averted eye sees them still , with its inward vision . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would rather not make believe otherwise ; and in trying to write of Literature as Business I am tempted to begin by saying that Business is the opprobrium of Literature . II . LITERATURE is at once the most intimate and the most articulate of the arts . It can not impart its effect through the senses or the nerves as the other arts can ; it is beautiful only through the intelligence ; it is the mind speaking to the mind ; until it has been put into absolute terms , of an invariable sigilificance , it does not exist at alL It can not awaken this emotion in one , and that in another ; if it fails to express precisely the meaning of the author , if it does not say him , it says nothing , and is nothing . So that when a poet has put his heart , much or little , into a poem , and sold it to a magazine , the scandal is greater than when a painter has sold a picture to a patron , or a sculptor has modelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less intimate than the poet ; they are more exterior to their work ; they are less personally in it ; they part with less of themselves in the dicker . It does not change the nature of the case to say that Tennyson and Longfellow and Emerson sold the poems in which they couched the most mystical messages their genius was charged to bear mankind . They submitted to the conditions which none can escape ; but that does not justify the conditions , which are none the less the conditions of hucksters because they are imposed upon poets . If it will serve to make my meaning a little clearer we will suppose that a poet has been crossed in love , or has suffered some real sorrow , like the loss of a wife or child . He pours out his broken heart in verse that shall bring tears of sa // cred sympathy from his readers , and an editor pays him a hundred dollars for the right of bringing his verse to their notice . It is perfectly true that the poem was not written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was sold for them . The poet must use his emotions to pay his provisiou bills ; he has no other means ; society does not propose to pay his bills for him . Yet , and at the end of the ends , the unsophisticated witness finds the transaction ridiculous , finds it repulsive , finds it shabby . Somehow he knows that if our huckstering civilization did not at every momeut violate the eternal fitness of things , the poet 's song would have been given to the world , and the poet would have been cared for by the whole human brotherhood , as any man should be who does the duty that every man owes it . The instinctive sense of the dishonor which money-purchase does to art is so strong that sometimes a man of letters who can pay his way otherwise refuses pay for his work , as Lord Byron did , for a while , from a noble pride , and as Count Tolstoy has tried to do , from a noble conscience . But Byron 's publisher profited by a generosity which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collects the copyright which her husband foregoes ; so that these two eminent instances of protest against business in literature may be said not to have shaken its money basis . I know of no others ; but there may be many that I am culpably ignorant of . Still , I doubt if there are enough to affect the fact that Literature is Business as well as Art , and almost as soon . At present business is the only human solidarity ; we are all bound together with that chain , whatever interests and tastes and principles separate us , and I feel quite sure that in writing of the Man of Letters as a Man of Business , I shall attract far more readers than I should in writing of him as an Artist . Besides , as an artist he has been done a great deal already ; and a commercial state like ours has really more concern in him as a business man . Perhaps it may sometimes be different ; I do not believe it will till the conditions are different , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confidently appeal to the reader 's imagination with the fact that there are several men of letters among us who are such good men of business that they can command a hundred dollars a thousand words for all they write ; and at least one woman of letters who gets a hundred and fifty dollars a thousand words . It is easy to write a thousand words a day , and supposing one of these authors to work steadily , it can be seen that his net earnings during the year would come to some such sum as the President of the United States gets for doing far less work of a much more perishable sort . If the man of letters were wholly a business man this is what would happen ; he would make his forty or fifty thousand dollars a year , and be able to consort with bank presidents , and railroad officials , and rich tradesmen , and other flowers of our plutocracy on equal tennis . But , unfortunately , from a business point of view , he is also an artist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disable him from delighting it uninterruptedly . " No rose blooms right along , " as the English boys at Oxford made an American collegian say in a theme which they imagined for him in his national parlance ; and the man of letters , as an artist , is apt to have times and seasons when he can not blossom . Very often it shall happen that his mind will lie fallow between novels or stQries for weeks and months at a stretch ; when the suggestions of the friendly editor shall fail to fruit in the essays or articles desired when the muse shall altogether withhold herself , or shall respond only in a feeble dribble of verse which he might sell indeed , but which it would not be good business for him to put on the market . But supposing him to be a very diligent and continuous worker , and so happy as to have fallen on a theme that delights him and bears him along , he may please himself so ill with the result of his labors that he can do nothing less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's work , a month 's work . I know one man of letters who wrote to-day , and tore up tomorrow // for nearly a whole summer . But even if part of the mistaken work may be saved , because it is good work out of place , and not intrinsically bad , the task of reconstruction wants almost as much time as the production ; and then , when all seems done , comes the anxious and endless process of revision . These drawbacks reduce the earning capacity of what I may call the highcost man of letters in such measure that an author whose name is known everywhere , and whose reputation is commensurate with the boundaries of his country , if it does not transcend them , shall have the income , say , of a rising young physician , known to a few people in a subordinate city . In view of this fact , so humiliating to an author in the presence of a nation of business men like ours , I do not know that I can establish the man of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man after alL He must still have a low rank among practical people ; and he will be regarded by the great mass of Americans as perhaps a little off , a little funny , a little soft ! Perhaps not ; and yet I would rather not have a consensus of public opinion on the question ; I think I am more comfortable without it . Iv . THERE 1S this to be said in defence of men of letters on the business side , that literature is still an infant industry with us , and so far from having been protected by our laws it was exposed for ninety years after the foundation of the republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods . It is true that we now have the international copyright law at last , and we can at least begin to forget our shame ; but literary property has only forty-two years of life under our unjust statutes , and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them , as it would seek out and punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them , and recover damages , if he can . This may be right enough in itself ; but I think , then , that all property should be defended by civil suit , and should become public after forty-two years of private tenure . The Constitution guarantees us all equality before the law , but the law-makers seem to have forgotten this in the case of our infant literary industry . So long as this remains the case , we can not expect the best business talent to go into literature , and the man of letters must keep his present low grade among business men . As I have hinted , it is but a little while that he has had any standing at all . I may say that it is only since the war that literature has become a business with us . Before that time we had authors , and very good ones ; it is astonishing how good they were ; but I do not remember any of them who lived by literature except Edgar A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived ; it was largely upon loans . They were either men of fortune , or they were editors , or professors , with salaries or incomes apart from the small gains of their pens ; or they were helped out with public offices ; one need not go over their names , or classify them . Some of them must have made money by their books , but I question whether any one could have lived , even very simply , upon the money his books brought him . No one could do that now , unless he wrote a book that we could not recognize as a work of literature . But many authors live now , and live prettily enough , by the sale of the serial publication of their writings to the magazines . They do not live so nicely as successful tradespeople , of course , or as men in the other professions when they begin to make themselves names ; the high state of brokers , bankers , railroad operators , and the like is , in the nature of the case , beyond their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not want the chief seats in the synagogue ; it is certain they do not get them . Still , they do very fairly well , as things go ; and several have incomes that would seem riches to the great mass of worthy Americans who work with their hands for a livingwhen they can get the work . Their // incomes are mainly from serial publication in the different magazines ; and the prosperity of the magazines has given a whole class existence which , as a class , was wholly unknown among us before the war . It is not only the famous or fully recognized authors who live in this way , but the much larger number of clever people who are as yet known chiefly to the editors , and who may never make themselves a public , but who do well a kind of acceptable work . These are the sort who do not get reprinted from the periodicals ; but the better recognized authors do get reprinted , and then their serial work in its completed form appeals to the readers who say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not great , and if an author rested his hopes upon their favor he would be a much more embittered man than he now generally is . But he understands perfectly well that his reward is in the serial and not in the book ; the return from that he may count as so much money found in the road  --  a few hundreds , a very few thousands , at the most . V. I DOUBT , indeed , whether the earnings of literary men are absolutely as great as they were earlier in the century , in any of the English-speaking countries ; relatively they are nothing like as great . Scott had forty thousand dollars for " Woodstock , " which was not a very large novel , and was by no means one of his best ; and forty thousand dollars had at least the purchasing powers of sixty thousand then . Moore had three thousand guineas for " Lalla IRookh , " but what publisher would be rash enough to pay twenty-five thousand dollars for the masterpiece of a minor poet now ? The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return to the author that the magazine makes , and there are but two or three authors who find their account in that form of publication . Those who do , those who sell the most widely in book form , are often not at all desired by editors ; with difficulty they get a serial accepted by any principal magazine . On the other hand , there are authors whose books , com pared with those of the popular favorites , do not sell , and yet they are eagerly sought for by editors ; they are paid the highest prices , and nothing that they offer is refused . These are literary artists ; and it ought to be plain from what I am saying that in belleslettres , at least , most of the best literature now first sees the light in the magazines , and most of the second best appears first in book form . The old-fashioned people who flatter themselves upon their distinction in not reading magazine fiction , or magazine poetry , make a great mistake , and simply class themselves with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the best . Of course this is true mainly , if not merely , of belles - lettres ; history , science , politics , metaphysics , in spite of the many excellent articles and papers in these sorts upon what used to be called various emergent occasions , are still to be found at their best in books . The most monumental example of literature , at once light and good , which has first reached the public in book form is in the different publications of Mark Twain ; but Mr. Clemens has of late turned to the magazines too , and now takes their mint mark before he passes into general circulation . All this may change again , but at present the magazines-we have no longer any reviews-form the most direct approach to that part of our reading public which likes the highest things in literary art . Their readers , if we may judge from the quality of the literature they get , are more refined than the book readers in our community ; and their taste has no doubt been cultivated by that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known these they are men of aesthetic conscience , and of generous sympathy . They have their preferences in the different kinds , and they have their theory of what kind will be most acceptable to their readers ; but they exercise their selective function with the wish to give them the best things they can . I do not know one of them  --  and it has been my good fortune to know them nearly all-who would print a wholly inferior thing for the sake of an inferior class of readers , though they may sometimes decline a good thing // because for one reason or another they believe it would not be liked . Still , even this does not often happen ; they would rather chance the good thing they doubted of than underrate their readers ' judgment . New writers often suppose themselves rejected because they are unknown ; but the unknown man of force and quality is of all others the man whom the editor welcomes to his page . He knows that there is always a danger that the reigning favorite may fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , he is passing away , and that if the magazine is not to pass away with the men who have made it , there must be a constant infusion of fresh life . Few editors are such fools and knaves as to let their personal feeling disable their judgment ; and the young writer who gets his manuscript back may be sure that it is not because the editor dislikes him , for some reason or no reason . Above all , he can trust me that his contribution has not been passed unread , or has failed of the examination it merits . Editors are not men of infallible judgment , but they do use their judgment , and it is usually good . The young author who wins recognition in a first - class magazine has achieved a double success , first , with the editor , and then with the best reading public . Many factitious and fallacious literary reputations have been made through books , but very few have been made through the magazines , which are not only the best means of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both bread and fame to him . If I insist a little upon the high office which this modern form of publication fulfils in the literary world , it is because I am impatient of the antiquated and ignorant prejudice which classes the magazines as ephemeral . They are ephenieral in form , but in substance they are not ephemeral , and what is best in them awaits its resurrection in the book , which , as the first form , is so often a lasting death . An interesting proof of the value of the magazine to literature is the fact that a good novel will have wider acceptance as a book from having been a magazine serial . I am not sure that the decay of the book is not owing somewhat to the decay of reviewing . This does not now seem to me so thorough , or even so general as it was some years ago , and I think the book oftener comes to the buyer without the warrant of a critical estimate than it once did . That is never the case with material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic , who is bound by the strongest ties of honor and interest not to betray either his employer or his public , has judged it , and his practical approval is a warrant of quality . VI . UNDER the regime of the great literary periodicals the prosperity of literary men would be much greater than it actually is , if the magazines were altogether literary . But they are not , and this is one reason why literature is still the hungriest of the professions . Twothirds of the magazines are made up of material which , however excellent , is without literary quality . Very probably this is because even the highest class of readers , who are the magazine readers , have small love of pure literature , which seems to have been growing less and less in all classes . I say seems , because there are really no means of ascertaining the fact , and it may be that the editors are mistaken in making their periodicals two-thirds popular science , politics , economics , and the timely topics which I will call contemporanics ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , their efforts in this direction have narrowed the field of literary industry , and darkened the hope of literary prosperity kindled by the unexampled prosperity of their periodicals . They pay very well indeed for literature ; they pay from five or six dollars a thousand words for the work of the unknown writer , to a hundred and fifty dollars a thousand words for that of the most famous , or the most popular , if there is a difference between fame and popularity ; but they do not , altogether , want enough literature to justify the best business talent in devoting itself to belles-lettres , to fiction , or poetry , or humorous sketches of travel , or light // essays ; business talent can do far better in drygoods , groceries , drugs , stocks , real estate , railroads , and the like . I do not think there is any danger of a ruinous competition from it in the field which , though narrow , seems so rich to us poor fellows , whose business talent is small , at the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the subject of agreement between the editor and the author ; it is either suggested by the author , or is the fruit of some suggestion from the editor ; in any case the price is stipulated beforehand , and it is no longer the custom for a well-known contributor to leave the payment to the justice or the generosity of the publisher ; that was never a fair thing to either , nor ever a wise thing . Usually , the price is so much a thousand words , a truly odious method of computing literary value , and one well calculated to make the author feel keenly the hatefulness of selling his art at all . It is as if a painter sold his picture at so much a square inch , or a sculptor bargained away a group of statuary by the pound . But it is a custom that you can not always successfully quarrel with , and most writers gladly consent to it , if only the price a thousand words is large enough . The sale to the editor means the sale of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine is also a publisher of books , the republication of the material is supposed to be his right , unless there is an understanding to the contrary ; the terms for this are another affair . Formerly something more could be got for the author by the simultaneous appearance of his work in an English magazine , but now the great American magazines , which pay far higher prices than any others in the world , have a circulation in England so much exceeding that of any English periodical , that the simultaneous publication can no longer be arranged for from this side , though I believe it is still done here from the other side . VII . I THINK this is the case of authorship as it now stands with regard to the magazines . I am not sure that the case is in every way improved for young authors . The magazines all maintain a staff for the careful examination of manuscripts , but as most of the material they print has been engaged , the number of volunteer contributions that they can use is very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not use fifty in the course of a year . The new writer , then , must be very good to be accepted , and when accepted he may wait long before he is printed . The pressure is so great in these avenues to the public favor that one , two , three years , are no uncommon periods of delay . If the young writer has not the patience for this , or has a soul above cooling his heels in the courts of fame , or must do his best to earn something at once , the book is his immediate hope . How slight a hope the book is I have tried to hint already , but if a book is vulgar enough in sentiment , and crude enough in taste , and flashy enough in incident , or , better or worse still , if it is a bit hot in the mouth , and promises impropriety if not indecency , there is a very fair chance of its success ; I do not mean success with a self-respecting publisher , but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and is not openly smirched by it . I will not talk of that kind of book , however , but of the book which the young author has written out of an unspoiled heart and an untainted mind , such as most young men and women write ; and I will suppose that it has found a publisher . It is human nature , as competition has deformed human nature , for the publisher to wish the author to take all the risks , and he possibly proposes that the author shall publish it at his own expense , and let him have a percentage of the retail price for managing it . If not that , he proposes that the author shall pay for the stereotype plates , and take fifteen per cent . of the price of the book ; or if this will not go , if the author can not , rather than will not do it ( he is commonly only too glad to do anything he can ) , then the publisher offers him ten per cent . of the retail price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he fully believes in the book , he will give ten per // cent . from the first copy sold , and pay aU the costs of publication himself . The book is to be retailed for a dollar and a half , and the publisher is very well pleased with a new book that sells fifteen hundred copies . Whether the author has as much reason to be so is a question , but if the book does not sell more he has only himself to blame , and had better pocket in silence the two hundred and twenty-five dollars he gets for it , and bless his publisher , and try to find work somewhere at five dollars a week . The publisher has not made any more , if quite as much as the author , and until a book has sold two thousand copies the division is fair enough . After that , the heavier expenses of manufacturing have been defrayed , and the book goes on advertising itself ; there is merely the cost of paper , printing , binding , and marketing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publisher . The author has no right to complain of this , in the case of his first book , which lie is only too grateful to get accepted at alL If it succeeds , he has himself to blame for making the same arrangement for his second or third ; it is his fault , or else it is his necessity , which is practically the same thing . It will be business for the publisher to take advantage of his necessity quite the same as if it were his fault ; but I do not say that he will always do so ; I believe he will very often not do so . At one time there seemed a probability of the enlargement of the author 's gains by subscription publication , and one very well-known American author prospered fabulously in that way . The percentage offered by the subscription houses was only about half as much as that paid by the trade , but the sales were so munch greater that the author could very well afford to take it . Where the book-dealer sold ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so in the case of Mark Twain 's books ; and we all thought it reasonable he could do so with ours . Such of us as made experiment of him , however , found the facts illogical . No book of literary quality was made to go by subscription except Mr. Clemens 's books , and I think these went because the subscription public never knew what good literature they were . This sort of readers , or buyers , were so used to getting something worthless for their money , that they would not spend it for artistic fiction , or indeed for any fiction all , except Mr. Clemens 's , which they probably supposed bad . Some good books of travel had a measurable success through the book agents , but not at all the success that had been hoped for ; and I believe now the subscription trade again publishes only compilations , or such works as owe more to the skill of the editor than the art of the writer . Mr. Clemens himself no longer offers his books to the public in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , to publish on the half-profits system , but it is very common in England , where , owing probably to the moisture in the air , which lends a fairy outline to every prospect , it seems to be peculiarly alluring . One of my own early books was published there on these terms , which I accepted with the insensate joy of the young author in getting any terms from a publisher . The book sold , sold every copy of the small first edition , and in due time the publisher 's statement came . I did not think my half of the profits was very great , but it seemed a fair division after every imaginable cost had been charged up against my poor book , and that frail venture had been made to pay the expenses of composition , corrections , paper , printing , binding , advertising , and editorial copies . The wonder ought to have been that there was anything at all coming to me , but I was young and greedy then , and I really thought there ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made the best of it , of course , and took the account to the junior partner of the house which employed me , and said that I should like to draw on him for the sum due me from the London publishers . He said , Certainly ; but after a glance at the account he smiled and said he supposed I knew how much the sum was ? I answered , Yes ; it was eleven pounds nine shillings , was not it ? But I owned at the // same time that I never was good at figures , and that I found English money peculiarly baffling . He laughed now , and said , It was eleven shillings and nine pence . In fact , after all those charges for composition , corrections , paper , printing , binding , advertising , and editorial copies , there was a most ingenious and wholly surprising charge of ten per cent . commission on sales , which reduced my half from pounds to shillings , and handsomely increased the publisher 's half in proportion . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the fault of the half-profits system , it was the fault of the glad young author who did not distinctly inform himself of its mysterious nature in agreeing to it , and had only to reproach himself if he was finally disappointed . But there is always something disappointing in the accounts of publishers , which I fancy is because authors are strangely constituted , rather than because publishers are so . I will confess that I have such inordinate expectations of the sale of my books which I hope I think modestly of , that the sales reported to me never seem great enough . The copyright due me , no matter how handsome it is , appears deplorably mean , and I feel impoverished for several days after I get it . But then , I ought to add that my balance in the bank is always much less than I have supposed it to be , and my own checks , when they come back to me , have the air of having been in a conspiracy to betray me . No , we literary men must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the distress we feel from our publisher 's accounts is simply idiopathic ; and I for one wish to bear my witness to the constant good faith and uprightness of publishers . It is supposed that because they have the affair altogether in their hands they are apt to take advantage in it ; but this does not follow , and as a matter of fact they have the affair no more in their own hands than any other business man you have an open account with . There is nothing to prevent you from looking at their books , except your own innermost belief and fear that their books are correct , and that your literature has brought you so little because it has sold so little . The author is not to blame for his superficial delusion to the contrary , especially if he has written a book that has set everyone talking , because it is of a vital interest . It may be of a vital interest , without being at all the kind of book people want to buy ; it may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second hand ; there are such fatal books ; but hearing so much , and reading so much about it , the author can not help hoping that it has sold much more than the publisher says . The publisher is undoubtedly honest , however , and the author had better put away the comforting question of his integrity . The English writers seem largely to suspect their publishers ( I can not say with how much reason , for my English publisher is Scotch , and I should be glad to be so true a man as I think him ) ; but I believe that American authors , when not flown with flattering reviews , as largely trust theirs . Of course there are rogues in every walk of life . I will not say that I ever personally met them in the flowery paths of literature , but I have heard of other people meeting them there , just as I have heard of people seeing ghosts , and I have to believe in both the rogues and the ghosts , without the witness of my own senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are wicked publishers , but in the ease of our books that do not sell , I am afraid that it is the graceless and inappreciative public which is far more to blame than the wickedest of the publishers . It is true that publishers will drive a hard bargain when they can , or when they must ; but there is nothing to hinder an author froni driving a hard bargain , too , when he can , or when he must ; and it is to be said of the publisher that he is always more willing to abide by the bargain when it is made than the author is ; perhaps because he has the best of it. , But he has not always the best of it ; I have known publishers too generous to take advantage of th' innocence of authors ; and I fancy that if publishers had to do with any race less diffident than authors , they would // have won a repute for unselfishness that they do not now enjoy . It is certain that in the long period when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our corsairs on the high seas of literature who paid a fair price for the stranger craft they seized ; still oftener they removed the cargo , and released their capture with several weeks ' provision ; and although there was undoubtedly a good deal of actual throatcutting and scuttling , still I feel sure that there was less of it than there would have been in any other line of business released to the unrestricted plunder of the neighbor . There was for a long time even a comity among these amiable buccaneers , who agreed not to interfere with each other , and so were enabled to pay over to their victims some portion of the profit from their stolen goods . Of all business men publishers are probably the most faithful and honorable , and are only surpassed in virtue when men of letters turn business men . Publishers have their little theories , their little superstitions , and their blind faith in the great god Chance , which we all worship . These things lead them into temptation and adversity , but they seem to do fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do not make above the usual ninety-five per cent . of failures , and more publishers than authors get rich . I have known several publishers who kept their carriages , but I have never known even one author to keep his carriage on the profits of his literature , unless it was in some modest country place where one could take care of one 's own horse . But this is simply because the authors are so many , and the publishers are so few . If we wish to reverse their positions , we must study how to reduce the number of authors and increase the number of publishers ; then prosperity will smile our way . VIII . SOME theories or superstitions publishers and authors share together . One of these is that it is best to keep your books all in the hands of one publisher if you can , because then he can give them more attention and sell more of them . But my own experience is that when my books were in the hands of three publishers they sold quite as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I approached in question of this venerable belief , laughed at it . This bold heretic held that it was best to give each new book to a new publisher , for then the fresh man put all his energies into pushing it ; but if you had them all together , the publisher rested in a vain security that one book would sell another , and that the fresh venture would revive the public interest in the stale ones . I never knew this to happen , and I must class it with the superstitions of the trade . It may be so in other and more constant countries , but in our fickle republic , each last book has to fight its own way to public favor , much as if it had no sort of literary lineage . Of course this is stating it rather largely , and the truth will be found inside rather than outside of my statement ; but there is at least truth enough in it io give the young author pause . While one is preparing to sell his basket of glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to part with all to one dealer or not ; and if he kicks it over , in spurning the imaginary customer who asks the favor of taking entire stock , that will be his fault , and not the fault of the question . However , the most important question of all with the man of letters as a man of business , is what kind of book will sell the best of itself , because , at the end of the ends , a book sells itself or does not sell at all ; kissing , after long ages of reasoning and a great deal of culture , still goes by favor , and though innumerable generations of horses have been led to water , not one horse has yet been made to drink . With the best , or the worst , will in the world , no publisher can force a book into acceptance . Advertising will not avail , and reviewing is notoriously futile . If the book does not strike the popular fancy , or deal with some universal interest , which need by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums and the cymbals shall be beaten in vain . // The book may be one of the best and wisest books in the world , but if it has not this sort of appeal in it , the readers of it , and worse yet , the purchasers , will remain few , though fit . The secret of this , like most other secrets of a rather ridiculous world , is in the awful keeping of fate , and we can only hope to surprise it by some lucky chance . To plan a surprise of it , to aim a book at the public favor , is the most hopeless of all endeavors , as it is one of the unworthiest ; and I can , neither as a man of letters nor as a man of business , counsel the young author to do it . The best that you can do is to write the book that it gives you the most pleasure to write , to put as much heart and soul as you have about you into it , and then hope as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great multitude of your fellow-men . That , and that alone , is good business for a man of letters . The failures in literature are no less mystifying than the successes , though they are upon the whole not so mortifying . I have seen a good many of these failures , and I know of one case so signal that I must speak of it , even to the discredit of the public . It is the case of a novelist whose work seems to me of the best that we have done in that sort , whose books represent our life with singular force and singular insight , and whose equipment for his art , through study , travel , and the world , is of the rarest . He has a strong , robust , manly style ; his stories are well knit , and his characters are of the flesh and blood complexion which we know in our daily experience ; and yet he has failed to achieve one of the first places in our literature ; if I named his name here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest part of my readers . I have never been able to account for his want of success , except through the fact that his stories did not please women , though why they did not , I can not guess . They did not like them for the same reason that they did not like Dr. Fell ; and that reason was quite enough for them . It must be enough for him , I am afraid ; but I believe that if this author had been writing in a country where men decided the fate of books , the fate of his books would have been different . The man of letters must make up his mind that in the United States the fate of a book is in the hands of the women . It is the women with us who have the most leisure , and they read the most books . They are far better educated , for the most part , than our men , and their tastes , if not their minds , are more cultivated . Our men read the newspapers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them read the magazines . If they do not always know what is good , they do know what pleases them , and it is useless to quarrel with their decisions , for there is no appeal from them . To go from them to the men would be going from a higher to a lower court , which would be honestly surprised and bewildered , if the thing were possible . As I say , the author of light literature , and often the author of solid literature , must resign himself to obscurity unless the ladies choose to recognize him . Yet it would be impossible to forecast their favor for this kind or that . Who could prophesy it for another , who guess it for himself ? We must strive blindly for it , and hope somehow that our best will also be our prettiest ; but we must remember at the same time that it is not the ladies ' man who is the favorite of the ladies . There are of course a few , a very few , of our greatest authors , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the help of the largest reading-class among us ; but I should say that these were chiefly the humorists , for whom women are said nowhere to have any warm liking , and who have generally with us come up through the newspapers , and have never lost the favor of the newspaper readers . They have become literary men , as it were , without the newspapers ' readers knowing it ; but those who have approached literature from another direction , have won fame in it chiefly by grace of the women , who first read them , and then made their husbands and fathers read them . Perhaps , then , and as a matter of business , it would be well for a serious author , when he finds that he is not pleasing the women , and probably never will please them , to turn humorous // author , and aim at the countenance of the men . Except as a humorist he certainly never will get it , for your American , when he is not making money , or trying to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Ix . I HOPE that I have not been hinting that the author who approaches literature through journalism is not as fine and high a literary man as the author who comes directly to it , or through some other avenue ; I have not the least notion of condemning myself by any such judgment . But I think it is pretty certain that fewer and fewer authors are turning from journalism to literature , though the erttertte cordiale between the two professions seems as great as ever . I fancy , though I may be as mistaken in this as I am in a good many other things , that most journalists would have been literary men if they could , at the beginning , and that the kindness they almost always show to young authors is an effect of the selfpity they feel for their own thwarted wish to be authors . When an author is once warm in the saddle , and is riding his winged horse to glory , the case is different they have then often no sentiment about him ; he is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would willingly see Pegasus buck under him , or have him otherwise brought to grief and shame . They are apt to gird at him for his unhallowed gains , and they would be quite right in this if they proposed any way for him to live without them ; as I have allowed at the outset , the gains are unhallowed . Apparently it is unseemly for an author or two to be making half as much by their pens as popular ministers often receive in salary ; the public is used to the pecuniary prosperity of some of the clergy , and at least sees nothing droll in it ; but the paragrapher can always get a smile out of his readers at the gross disparity between the ten thousand dollars Jones gets for his novel , and the five pounds Milton got for his epic . I have always thought Milton was paid too little , but I will own that he ought not to have been paid at all , if it comes to that . Again , I say that no man ought to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art if not to the artist ; but as yet there is no means of the artist 's living otherwise , and continuing an artist . The literary man has certainly no complaint to make of the newspaper man , generally speaking . I have often thought with amazement of the kindness shown by the press to our whole unworthy craft , and of the help so lavishly and freely given to rising and even risen authors . To put it coarsely , brutally , I do not suppose that any other business receives so much gratuitous advertising , except the theatre . It is enormous , the space given in the newspapers to literary notes , literary announcements , reviews , interviews , personal paragraphs , biographies , and all the rest , not to mention the vigorous and incisive attacks made from time to time upon different authors for their opinions of romanticism , realism , capitalism , socialism , Catholicism , and Sandemanianism . I have sometimes doubted whether the public cared for so much of it all as the editors gave them , but I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken my share of the common bounty . A curious fact , however , is that this vast newspaper publicity seems to have very little to do with an author 's popularity , though ever so much with his notoriety . Those strange subterranean fellows who never come to the surface in the newspapers , except for a contemptuous paragraph at long intervals , outsell the famousest of the celebrities , and secretly have their horses and yachts and country seats , while immodest merit is left to get about on foot and look up summer board at the cheaper hotels . That is probably right , or it would not happen ; it seems to be in the general scheme , like millionairism and pauperism ; but it becomes a question , then , whether the newspapers , with all their friendship for literature , and their actual generosity to literary men , can really help one much to fortune , however much they help one to fame . Such a question is almost too dreadful , and though I have asked it , I // will not attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether if the newspapers can make an author they can also unmake him , and I feel pretty safe in saying that I do not think they can . The Afreet once out of the bottle can never be coaxed back or cudgelled back ; and the author whom the newspapers have made can not be unmade by the newspapers . Perhaps he could if they would let him alone ; but the art of letting alone the creature of your favor , when he has forfeited your favor , is yet in its infancy with the newspapers . They consign him to oblivion with a rumor that fills the land , and they keep visiting him there with an uproar which attracts more and more notice to him . An author who has long enjoyed their favor , suddenly and rather mysteriously loses it , through his opinions on certain matters of literary taste , say . For the space of five or six years he is denounced with a unanimity and an incisive vigor that ought to convince him there is something wrong . If he thinks it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abiding constancy , while ridicule , obloquy , caricature , burlesque , critical refutation and personal detraction follow unsparingly upon every cxmression , for instance , of his belief that romantic fiction is the highest form of fiction , and that the base , sordid , photographic , commonplace school of Tolstoy , Tourgu6nief , Zola , Hardy , and James , are unworthy a moment 's comparison with the school of Rider Haggard . All this ought certainly to unmake the author in question , and strew his disjecta membra wide over the realm of oblivion . But this is not really the effect . Slowly but surely the clamor dies away , and the author , without relinquishing one of his wicked opinions , or in anywise showing himself repentant , remains apparently whole ; and he even returns in a measure to the old kindness : not indeed to the earlier day of perfectly smooth things , but certainly to as much of it as he merits . I would not have the young author , from this imaginary case , believe that it is well either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , it will not only be better taste , but it will be better business for him to keep it altogether out of his mind . There is only one whom he can safely try to please , and that is himself . If he does this he will very probably please other people ; but if he does not please himself he may be sure that he will not please them ; the book which he has not enjoyed writing , no one will enjoy reading . Still , I would not have him attach too little consequence to the influence of the press . I should say , let him take the celebrity it gives him gratefully but not too seriously ; let him reflect that he is often the necessity rather than the ideal of the paragrapher , and that the notoriety the journalists bestow upon him is not the measure of their acquaintance with his work , far less his meaning . They are good fellows , those poor , hard-pushed fellows of the press , but the very conditions of their censure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must often have more zeal than knowledge in it . x . WHETHER the newspapers will become the rivals of the magazines as the vehicle of literature is a matter that still remains in doubt with the careful observer , after a decade of the newspaper syndicate . Our daily papers never had the habit of the feitilleton as those of the European continent have it ; they followed the English tradition in this , though they departed from it in so many other things ; and it was not till the Sunday editions of the great dailies arose that there was any real hope for the serial in the papers . I suspect that it was the vast demand for material in their pages-twelve , eighteen , twenty - four , thirty - six - that created the syndicate , for it was the necessity of the Sunday edition not only to have material in abundance ; but , with all possible regard for quality , to have it cheap ; and the syndicate , when it came into being , imagined a means of meeting this want . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could for simultaneous publication in their Sunday editions , // which had each its special field , and did not compete with another . I do not think the syndicate began with serials , and I do not think it is likely to end with them . It has rather worked the vein of interviews , personal adventnre , popular science , useful information , travel , sketches , and short stories . Still it has placed a good many serial stories , and at pretty good prices , but not generally so good as those the magazines pay the better sort of writers ; for the worse sort it has offered perhaps the best market they have had out of book form . By the newspapers , the syndicate conceives , and perhaps justly , that something sensational is desired ; yet all the serial stories it has placed can not be called sensational . It has enlarged the field of belles-lettres , certainly , but not permanently , I think , in the case of the artistic noveL As yet the women , who form the largest , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken very cordially to the Sunday edition , except for its social gossip ; they certainly do not go to it for their fiction , and its fiction is mainly of the inferior sort with which boys and men beguile their leisure . In fact the newspapers prefer to remain newspapers , at least in quality if not in form ; and I heard a story the other day from a charming young writer of his experience with them , which may have some instruction for the magazines that less wisely aim to become newspapers . He said that when he carried his work to the editors they struck out what he thought the best of it , because it was what they called magaziny ; not contemptuously , but with an instinctive sense of what their readers wanted of them , and did not want . It was apparent that they did not want literary art , or even the appearance of it ; they wanted their effects primary ; they wanted their emotions raw , or at least saignarttes from the joint of fact , and not prepared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt advanced the prosperity of the short story by increasing the demand for it . We Americans had already done pretty well in that kind , for there was already a great demand for the short story in the magazines ; but the syndicate of Sunday editions particularly cultivated it , and made it very paying . I have heard that some short-story writers made the syndicate pay more for their wares than they got from the magazines for them , considering that the magazine publication could enhance their reputation , but the Sunday edition could do nothing for it . They may have been right or not in this ; I will not undertake to say , but that was the business view of the case with them . In spite of the fact that short stories when gathered into a volume and republished would not sell so well as a novel , the short story flourished , and its success in the periodicals began to be felt in the book trade : volumes of short stories suddenly began to selL But now again , it is said the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their adversity in book form threatens to affect them in the magazines ; an editor told me the other day that he had more short stories than he knew what to do with ; and I was not offering him a short story of my own , either . A permanent decline in the market for a kind of literary art which we have excelled in , or if we have not excelled , have done some of our most exquisite work , would be a pity . There are other sorts of light literature once greatly in demand , but now apparently no longer desired by editors , who ought to know what their readers desire . Among these is the travel sketch , to me a very agreeable kind , and really to be regretted in its decline . There are some reasons for its decline besides a change of taste in readers , and a possible surfeit . Travel itself has become so universal that everybody , in a manner , has been everywhere , and the foreign scene has no longer the charm of strangeness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so ridiculous as we used ; and perhaps from an instinctive perception of this altered mood writers no longer appeal to our sentiment or our humor with sketches of outlandish people and places . Of course this can hold true only in a general way ; the thing is still done , but not nearly so much done as formerly . When one // thinks of the long line of American writers who have greatly pleased in this sort , and who even got their first fame in it , one must grieve to see it obsolescent . Irving , Curtis , Bayard Taylor , Herman Melville , Ross Browne , 1k Marvell , Longfellow , Lowell , Story , Mr. James , Mr. Aldrich , Colonel Hay , Mr. Warner , Mrs. Hunt , Mr. C. W. Stoddard , Mark Twain , and many others whose names will not come to me at the moment , have in their several ways richly contributed to our pleasure in it ; but I can not now fancy a young author finding favor with an editor in a sketch of travel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work would have to be of the most signal importance and brilliancy to overcome the editor 's feeling that the thing had been done already ; and I believe that a publisher if offered a book of such things , would look at it askance , and plead the wellknown quiet of the trade . Still , I may be mistaken . I am rather more confident about the decline of another literary species , namely , the light essay . We have essays enough and to spare , of certain soberer and severer sorts , such as grapple with problems and deal with conditions ; but the kind that I mean , the slightly humorous , gentle , refined , and humane kind , seems no longer to abound as it once did . I do not know whether the editor discourages them , knowing his readers ' frame , or whether they do not offer themselves , but I seldom find them in the magazines . I certainly do not believe that if anyone were now to write essays such as Mr. Warner 's " Backlog Studies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes them . Nobody seems to write the sort that Colonel Higginson formerly contributed to the periodicals , or such as Em*rson wrote . Without a great name behind it , I am afraid that a volume of essays would find few buyers , even after the essays had made a public in the magazines . There are , of course , instances to the contrary , but they are not so many or so striking as to make me think that the essay could not be offered as a good opening for business talent . I suspect that good poetry by wellknown hands was never better paid in the magazines than it is now . I must say , too , that I think the quality of the minor poetry of our day is better than that of twenty-five or thirty years ago . I could name half a score of young poets whose work from time to time gives me great pleasure , by the reality of its feeling , and the delicate perfection of its art , but I will not name them , for fear of passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have certainly no reason to be discouraged , whatever reason the poets themselves have to be so , and I do not think that even in the short story our younger writers are doing better work than they are doing in the slighter forms of verse . Yet the notion of inviting business talent into this field would be as preposterous as that of asking it to devote itself to the essay . What book of verse by a recent poet , if we except some such peculiarly gifted poet as Mr. Whitcomb Riley , has paid its expenses , not to speak of any profit to the author ? Of course , it would be rather more offensive and ridiculous that it should do so than that any other form of literary art should do so ; and yet there is no more provision in our economic system for the support of the poet apart from his poems , than there is for the support of the novelist apart from his noveL One could not make any more money by writing poetry than by writing history , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich men , and able to afford the luxury of writing history , the poets have usually been poor men , with no pecuniary justification in their devotion to a calling which is so seldom an election . To be sure , it can be said for them that it costs far less to set up poet than to set up historian . There is no outlay for copying documents , or visiting libraries , or buying books . In fact , except as historian , the man of letters , in whatever walk , has not only none of the expenses of other men of business , but none of the expenses of other artists . He has no such outlay to make for materials , or models , or studio rent as the painter or the sculptor has , and his income , such as it is , is immediate . If he strikes the fancy of the editor // with the first thing he offers , as he very well may , it is as well with him as with other men after long years of apprenticeship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the longer apprenticeship the better , he may practically need none at all . Such are the strange conditions of his acceptance with the public , that he may please better without it than with it . An author 's first book is too often not only his luckiest , but really his best it has a brightness that dies out under the school he puts himself to , but a painter or a sculptor is only the gainer by all the school he can give himself . XI . IlK view of this fact it becomes again very hard to establish the author 's status in the business world , and at moments I have grave question whether he belongs there at all , except as a novelist . There is , of course , no outlay for him in this sort , any more than in any other sort of literature , but it at least supposes and exacts some measure of preparation . A young writer may produce a brilliant and very perfect romance , just as he may produce a brilliant and very perfect poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what we used to call the novel of manners , a writer can only produce an inferior book at the outset . For this work he needs experience and observation , not so much of others as of himself , for ultimately his characters will all come out of himself , and he will need to know motive and character with such thoroughness and accuracy as he can acquire only through his own heart . A man remains in a measure strange to himself as long as he lives , and the very sources of novelty in his work will be within himself ; he can continue to give it freshness in no other way than by knowing himself better and better . But a young writer and an untrained writer has not yet begun to be acquainted even with the lives of other men . The world around him remains a secret as well as the world within him , and both unfold themselves simultaneously to that experience of joy and sorrow that can come only with the lapse of time . IJntil he is well on toward forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great novel , although he may have accumulated them . The novelist , then , is a man of letters who is like a man of business in the necessity of preparation for his calling , though he does not pay store-rent , and may carry all his affairs under his hat , as the phrase is . He alone among men of letters may look forward to that sort of continuous prosperity which follows from capacity and diligence in other vocations ; for story-telling is now a fairly recognized trade , and the storyteller has a money-standing in the economic world . It is not a very high standing , I think , and I have expressed the belief that it does not bring him the respect felt for men in other lines of business . Still our people can not deny some consideration to a man who gets a hundred dollars a thousand words . That is a fact appreciable to business , and the man of letters in the line of fiction may reasonably feel that his place in our civilization , though he may owe it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has something of the character of a vested interest in the eyes of men . There is , indeed , as yet no conspiracy law which will avenge the attempt to injure him in his business . A critic , or a dark conjuration of critics , may damage him at will and to the extent of their power , and he has no recourse but to write better books , or worse . The law will do nothing for him , and a boycott of his books might be preached with immunity by any class of men not liking his opinions on the question of industrial slavery or antipa*dobaptism . Still the market for his wares is steadier than the market for any other kind of literary wares , and the prices are better . The historian , who is a kind of inferior realist , has something like the same steadiness in the market , but the prices he can command are much lower , and the two branches of the novelist 's trade are not to be compared in a business way . As for the essayist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are nowhere in the competition for the favor of readers . The reviewer , // indeed , has a pretty steady call for his work , but I fancy the reviewers who get a hundred dollars a thousand words could all stand upon the point of a needle without crowding one another ; I should rather like to see them doing it . Another gratifying fact of the situation is that the best writers of fiction who are most in demand with the magazines , probably get nearly as much money for their work as the inferior novelists who outsell them by tens of thousands , and who make their appeal to the innumerable multitude of the less educated and less cultivated buyers of fiction in book-form . I think they earn their money , but if I did not think all of the higher class of novelists earned so much money as they get , I should not be so invidious as to single out for reproach those who did not . The difficulty about payment , as I have hinted , is that literature has no objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may so express it . A poem , an essay , a novel , even a paper on political economy , may be worth gold untold to one reader , and worth nothing whatever to another . It may be precious to one mood of the reader , and worthless to another mood of the same reader . How , then , is it to be priced , and how is it to be fairly marketed ? All people must be fed , and all people must be clothed , and all people must be housed ; and so meat , raiment , and shelter are things of positive and obvious necessity , which may fitly have a market price put upon them . But there is no such positive and obvious necessity , I am sorry to say , for fiction , or not for the higher sort of fiction . The sort of fiction which corresponds to the circus and the variety theatre in the show-business seems essential to the spiritual health of the masses , but the most cultivated of the classes can get on , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great pity , and I should be very willing that readers might feel something like the pangs of hunger and cold , when deprived of their finer fiction ; but apparently they never do . Their dumb and passive need is apt only to manifest itself negatively , or in the form of weariness of this author or that . The publisher of books can ascertain the fact through the declining sales of a writer ; but the editor of a magazine , who is the best customer of the best writers , must feel the market with a much more delicate touch . Sometimes it may be years before he can satisfy himself that his readers are sick of Smith , and are pining for Jones ; even then he can not know how long their mood will last , *nd he is by no means safe in cutting down Smith 's price and putting up Jones 's . With the best will in the world to pay justly , he can not . Smith , who has been boring his readers to death for a year , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will at once be a prime favorite again ; and Jones , whom they have been asking for , may do something so uncharacteristic and alien that it will be a fiat failure in the magazine . The only thing that gives either writer positive value is his acceptance with the reader ; but the acceptance is from month to month wholly uncertain . Authors are largely matters of fashion , like this style of bonnet , or that shape of gown . Last spring the dresses were all made with lace berthas , and Smith was read ; this year the butterfly capes are worn , and Jones is the favorite author . Who shall forecast the fall and winter modes ? XII . IN this inquiry it is always the author rather than the publisher , always the contributor rather than the editor , whom I am concerned for . I study the difficulties of the publisher and editor only because they involve the author and the contributor ; if they did not , I will not say with how hard a heart I should turn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of literature is for the makers of literature , not the purveyors of it . After all , and in spite of my vaunting title , is the man of letters ever a business man ? I suppose that , strictly speaking , he never is , except in those rare instances where , through need or chQice , he 4s the publisher as well as // the author of his books . Then he puts something on the market and tries to sell it there , and is a man of business . But otherwise he is an artist merely , and is allied to the great mass of wageworkers who are paid for the labor they have put into the thing done or the thing made ; who live by doing or making a thing , and not by marketing a thing after some other man has done it or made it . The quality of the thing has nothing to do with the economic nature of the ease ; the author is , in the last analysis , merely a workingman , and is under the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick or sad , and can not work , if he is lazy or tipsy and will not , then he earns nothing . He can not delegate his business to a clerk or a manager ; it will not go on while he is sleeping . The wage he can command depends strictly upon his skill and diligence . I myself am neither sorry nor ashamed for this ; I am glad and proud to be of those who eat their bread in the sweat of their own brows , and not the sweat of other men 's brows ; I think my bread is the sweeter for it . In the meantime I have no blame for business men ; they are no more of the condition of things than we workingmen are ; they did no more to cause it or create it ; but I would rather be in my place than in theirs , and I wish that I could make all my fellow-artists realize that economically they are the same as mechanics , farmers , day-laborers . It ought to be our glory that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not choately there before ; that at least we fashion or shape something anew ; and we ought to feel the tie that binds us to all the toilers of the shop and field , not as a galling chain , but as a mystic bond also uniting us to Him who works hitherto and evermore . I know very well that to the vast multitude of our fellow-workiugmen we artists are the shadows of names , or not even the shadows . I like to look the facts in the face , for though their lineaments are often terrible , yet there is light nowhere else ; and I will not pretend , in this light , that the masses care any more for us than we care for the masses , or so much . Nevertheless , and most distinctly , we are not of the classes . Except in our work , they have no use for us ; if now and then they fancy qualifying their material splendor or their spiritual dulness with some artistic presence , the attempt is always a failure that bruises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of the world , he is the less an artist , and if he fashions himself upon fashion , he deforms his art . We all know that ghastly type ; it is more absurd even than the figure which is really of the world , which was born and bred in it , and conceives of nothing outside of it , or above it . In the social world , as well as in the business world , the artist is anomalous , in the actual conditions , and he is perhaps a little ridiculous . Yet he has to be somewhere , poor fellow , and I think that he will do well to regard himself as in a transition state . He is really of the masses , but they do not know it , and what is worse , they do not know him ; as yet the common people do not hear him gladly or hear him at alL He is apparently of the classes ; they know him , and they listen to him ; he often amuses them very much ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know it or not , he knows that he is not of their kind . Perhaps he will never be at home anywhere in the world as long as there are masses whom he ought to consort with , and classes whom he can not consort with . The prospect is not brilliant for any artist now living , but perhaps the artist of the future will see in the flesh the accomplishment of that human equality of which the instinct has been divinely planted in the human souL@@89513 THE TEACHING OF THE UPANISHADS . AMONGST the most precious spiritual gifts to the English-speaking people of this century must be counted the monumental series of the Sacred Books of the East , edited by Professor Max MUller . That even the most important of these writings should have failed to make any general or influential impression on the time is perhaps hardly matter of wonder : first , because their line of thought lies on other than modern tracks ; secondly , because their appeal is to those higher or transcendental qualities or faculties of the soul which at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been largely and intelligently represented . Pythagoras , Socrates , the Christ , were strangers to their generation , and could hardly be popularly understood or appreciated . Their intelligent expositors were few . This must at all times necessarily be the case . An abnormal outlook does not imply a corresponding faculty in the following , even with those who regard it in a friendly manner , and any appeal to the highest intuitive powors and capacities of the human soul can receive only a partial recognition in view of the material aims of the masses and their insistence upon selfish and individual interests . The most valuable of all the writings referred to above are , undoubtedly , those of the Ved*nta , which concentrate the doctrine of the Vedas in their most significant import . The Yedas themselves are based upon ceremonial and regulated observance , are for those in that state of religious development which " seeks after a sign ; " but the Yed*nta , as laid down in the Upanishads , is for those who , capable of passing immediately from the outward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract , and are independent of the vehicle of form for their better understanding and appreciation of it . The term " Upanishad " appears to be of uncertain origin and meaning . It may be derived from a Sanskrit root signifying a session or assembly , as of pupils with an instructor . It is , however , more significantly used as indicating doctrine , or secret doctrine , and this may be considered its ulterior meaning . These doctrines were first delivered to disciples or students orally through successive generations , and were only at a subsequent period committed to writing in the Sanskrit tongue of ancient India . They are very numerous , but , with minor differences , inculcate the same principles , and are essentially identical in teaching . They are broadly referred to a period six hundred years before the birth of Christ , but it is highly probable that , in one form or another , they owe their origin to a still more remote period in the " dark backward and abysm of time . " These writings have heretofore been regarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more perceptive intelligence , might have been reasonably expected , too much as mere literary curiosities , and have been spoken of as embodying the earliest inchoate thinking of mankind . Far from being the tentative efforts of a primitive humanity to grasp a higher range of being , loftier forms and views of life , they appear to me to lie on the highest planes of thought which the human mind has ever reached , and to indicate the greatest elevation possible to concrete being by raising it and identifying it with the Essentially Existent by the progressive laws of a spiritual evolution . It seems strange that nobody in this century , so far as I am aware , has seen and accepted these marvelous writings in their practical importance as the guides of life , to be appropriated reverentially as substantially identical in utterance , though from another // point of view , with those which the most advanced amongst mankind have agreed to stamp with a sacred authority , excepting the German philosopher Schopenhauer . We find Orientalists as accomplished and mature as Sir Monier Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Indian Wisdom he speaks of the " fanciful etymologies , far-fetched allegories , and puerile conceits which bewilder the reader of the Upanishads , " without making any attempt to investigate their more recondite meaning . Other Orientalists treat these writings either as curiosities of a capricious fancy , or fossils , as it were , in the half-forgotten stages of the moral advancement of mankind , to be regarded by students of the historic evolution of the race as so much material for scholarship in the book of universal knowledge , but without any thought of their real present value and importance . Mr. Gough , for example , in his Philosophy of the Upanishads , - a useful and valuable book in many respects , - regards them with a cold and scholastic eye , indifferent , apparently , to their high worth , their profound truth and transcendent spiritual consequence . He says , in his preface to that work , " The Upanishads are so many Songs before Sunrise , ' - spontaneous effusions of awakening reflection , half poetical , half metaphysical , that precede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkers to construct a thoroughly intelligible conception of the sum of things . " I should have thought the term least of all applicable to these elaborate and highly matured fruits of searching thought and profound reflection would be that of spontaneity . " Spontaneous effusions " might be a description suited to the gushes of verse from the boardingschool which sometimes find a place in the corners of country newspapers , but , applied to these writings , it is about as unhappy a designation as could be found in the dictionary . Neither do I know where , how , and by what means we have , in modern times , advanced in abstract directions on the principles here laid down . Have we arrived at anything more definite , absolute , or real , which appeals to the innermost feelings , or even to the reasoning powers , with a more assured response ; or have we now aims more noble ; or have we reached any grander moral conceptions , any larger modes of thought and life , than are here set before us ? Certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler as " an admirable interpreter of the imperfect materials before him , " who , evidently , without the least appreciation of the luminous intelligence of these treatises , speaks of them as fostering " baseless dreams , " to the great detriment of the people holding their tenets , - a verdict about as fair as it would be to confuse the exalted and self-immolating religion of Jesus Christ with the low form of the popular modern profession of it . It is needless to dwell upon the remissness in scholarship to discern the true value of these precious records of human thought in its spiritual elevation . People do not find what they do not seek and do not want . It is enough that those who look for and desire to know truths to live by and to feed upon will treasure the rich harvest of thought herein contained in their innermost storehouse of precious things , amongst the soul 's most valuable spiritual treasures . Of course , many difficulties in detail arise in a minute study of these treatises , as is the case with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian religion , but the principles laid down in them are in themselves so absolutely sound and secure that we may well relegate their apparent defections to the margin of our imperfect comprehension , as belonging to habits of thought and modes of regarding things educationally different from our own . To determine their " philosophy " from an academic point of view is about as wise and as useful // as to attempt to define that of the Sermon on the Mount . If they have no intrinsic , practical value , if they make no true appeal to the human soul on their own basis , they have no raisom d ' *tre , and may very fitly be consigned at once to the " place of weeds and worn-out faces . " As to the capability of the ancient Hindu people to deal with these matters , one need only enter upon a study of their more scholastic philosophies , that of Kapila , for example , to learn how closely they could reason , how they anticipated every objection , with what penetrative , nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at issue , and with what a tenacious and unrelaxing grasp they adhered to their logical course , as a sleuthhound in pursuit of his prey . Amidst all the varieties of sacred rite , observance , ceremonial , or other form which have ever existed , there is to be recognized one sole aim and intention . In fact , there has never been but one religion in the history of mankind . It may be characterized in very exclusive terms . It is that of a recognition of the Divine in the human , or , conversely , the human considered in its relationship to the Divine or Infinite and Omnipotent Being . The words " our Father " imply all that every religion taught or seeks to teach . The oldest and the latest doctrines are but an acknowledgment and enforcement of this principle , an expression of this accepted fact , namely , that as there are everywhere around us the signs and vestiges of an intelligent force at work , and that force , both in extent and power , infinitely superior to our own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be a conscious and intelligent Mover , Controller , Creator , Dissolver , in whose essence we live and move and If the professor would include the philosophy of Kapila in the denomination of the Ved*nta , and we accept the premises of that philosophy , his terms would be less open to question . This philosophy , in one word , attributes an evolutionary and developmental have our being . The scope and object of every form of religion , pushed to its ultimate significance , are to secure a perfect unity or identity with the Divine Essential Being , of which our own is but a conditioned manifestation . This being the case , we propose to examine the teaching of the Ved*nta from this point of view . No fantastic theosophical speculations , no empirical assumptions , here occupy and bewilder the mind or mock it with changeful and flickering delusions . These writings are purely scientific , logical , experimental . Their authority only awaits general confirmation by practical proof , by the most spiritually discerning , and this proof is within reach of confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , but everything we know is based upon the transcendental . " It is the ground we do not tread upon which supports us , " says the Taoist ; and all our knowledge must necessarily be based upon that which we do not know . In a letter to the present writer , the learned professor , to whom we owe so much , says , " The Yedanta is the only solution of all our religious and philosophical difficulties . " Perhaps the terms are too inclusive ; but I am very sure of this : if the solution be not found there , it will be found nowhere else.1 No more penetrative or profounder appeal can be made to the vivifying power which underlies our spiritual being than one finds in these weighty discourses . The Yed*nta embraces the compendium of all philosophies , the end of all intellectual and moral research ; it embodies the highest wisdom , the most profound knowledge of the soul and the basis of life , attainable by human faculties . It wastes no time or labor , for it defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted theories of modern science , but says that this manifestation of , creative energy is solely for the disenfranchisement of soul from matter ; and when this is perfectly accomplished , the action of nature ceases . // sible and what is impossible to finite being , and very distinctly marks the line where research must cease to conditioned inquiry . It leads us , as it were , to the very line and border of the Unknown Beyond . We are placed on the brink of the sensible universe , and look over it into the immeasurable caverns of the Infinite . We seem to feel by unmistakable presentation the very walls of our limitation . With this revelation - for it undoubtedly is one - the mind , awed and wondering , stands before the impassable , the impenetrable veil . The Source of Life and Nature is clearly indicated . The soul cowers before the Ineffable , the Inscrutable , and places a reverent hand on its lips in a solemnized silence . From this attitude it is ultimately raised by a new presentment . A resplendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaims , " I am a part , as much and as necessary as any other part . All is good , all is God . There can be only one Infinite , one Eternal , one Almighty , comprehending All , including All . Infinite Being can not contradict itself . by a negation . O my soul , tat tvam* asi , that art thou ! I am also that Being than whom there is no other , than whom* there is nothing greater , beyond whom there is nothing . " To be more special , the central teaching of the Upanishads may be put into a few words . It is that of the divinely luminous Atman ( an aspect of Brahman , or Essential Being ) , existing universally , but to be grasped and appropriated by the mind as the elemental vital principle existing within it . It is almost impossible by verbal definition to explain the significance of the word in its entirety . Only a close reading and study of the V'edantic writings will enable one to grasp it fully . The principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained till the whole being is permeated by it and transformed into its substance , exactly as is conveyed by the Gospel parable of the leaven . A divine knowledge and perception ilhi mine the soul . All is seen under the light of one aspect , the Eternal , the Allpervading . This " Knowledge " ( as it is called in the Yed*nta ) attained , the human is abandoned ; the Essential and Infinite absorb and annihilate the conditioned and limited existence ; the Eternal and Unconditioned are entered upon . When the soul has thus discovered its true nature , destiny , and being , it suffers no more sorrow , no more pain . It is lost in nameless bliss , and has reached a state to which no terms of mundane existence can apply , and is said to have passed into perfect darkness to all mortal ideas or conceptions . It will be seen that this form of doctrine is related to that of Plato in his exposition of the Ideal and the progressive stages by which it is reached . Still more clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John , as the " Light which lighteth every man ; " with which may be compared the following from the Yed*nta : " Now that light which shines above this heaven , higher than everything , in the highest world , beyond which there are no other worlds , that is the same light which is within man . " ( K/i*ndogya-up , in. xiii . 7 . ) Again it finds an exposition in some of the writings of the Alexandrian " Fathers . " Later it may be discovered as the " mystical " teaching of the " Friends of God " in the fifteenth century , represented by Eckhart , Tauler , and others . It found succeeding development in the Port-Royalists , Madame Gnyon , Molinos , and the so-called Quietists of the French and Spanish schools . Finally it obtained utterance in the teaching and doctrines of the early Quakers , as represented by George Fox , Robert Barclay , and others . It is also illustrated in the writings of William Law in the last century . It may thus be seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is based and founded in the religious nature of man , a spontaneous growth or outburst which often , without any trace- // 182 able connection , manifested itself at various points isolated in time and place . In fact , this doctrine contains the kernel of all forms of religion , all of which are merely subsidiary and accessory to it , as has been already stated , - the soul 's relationship to and connection with Divine Infinite Being , and , in its practical aspect , the way this is to be found . By its light the Christian scheme becomes clear , reasonable , philosophic : not the innocent suffering for the guilty in unjust reprisal , but the divine struggling through the human in the progressive stages of spiritual evolution . This divine element ( the Atman of the Ved*nta ) is to be dwelt upon and appropriated until the whole mass is leavened . Not that the soul is in itself changed , but it arises to new perceptions , new intelligence . It sees its divine nature and substance , and by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual life . The position of the soul as regards this Knowledge is explained by a familiar illustration . A king 's son is placed , at his birth , among peasants , and grows up amongst them as one of them . As long as they do not know that he is the son of a king , and he does not know it , he remains a peasant ; but as soon as they and he are made aware of the circumstance of his birth , he is no more a peasant , but a prince . It is thus with the soul . Once finding out its divine origin as the offspring of the Eternal , and therefore its divine nature , it is at once raised to the same rank and dignity according to its grade of perception of this fact . This doctrine , as teaching that the whole universe is the act or expression of the Deity or Essential Being , does not therefore recognize the existence of absolute evil to the soul . All that exists must have a good end and result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see and accept this , and do not bring their lives into harmonious relationship with it , must go from existence to existence until the les*on has been learnt , the divine element , August , universal and absolute , recognized and accepted , the mortal passed into the immortal , the temporal and the material lost in the spiritual . I have said that these writings are scientific . They are not mere speculation , even when they leave the region of the sensible and material . They draw the mind naturally from the real to the ideal . I mean the ideal in the Platonic sense , and not the imaginative . They distinctly recognize the line beyond which the human faculties can not pass . They do not attempt to define the indefinite , to explain that which is inexplicable ; but they lead us to the very source and origin , the essentially unconditioned , and , indicating its presence unmistakably before us , bid us pause and regard it thoughtfully until it assumes its due proportions and importance , until its infinite proportions and stupendous importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of Vital Energy by material investigation to the level of a child 's effort to find out the constitution of its doll by pulling it to pieces , when , alas ! there is nothing to be seen therein but barren sawdust . Of course the modern physicist , as well as the Vedantist , knows and accepts the fact that there is a point at which his inquiry must terminate ; but when he has reached that point , there is a dead blank , an unbroken , irresponsive silence ; tace ii sole , - the sun is silent , as Dante says . There is no more to be seen or known . Research collapses . The physical inquirer sits down under the vague impression of undetermined and unintelligent forces , each blindly combating for the mastery . Here the contemplative study of the Vedantist begins . When we have traced the sensation to the sensorium , our inquiries terminate , but the Vedantist goes further . He does not confuse the eye or the ear with the impressions conveyed by them . He knows as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connec The Teaching of the Upanishads. // 1893 . The Teaching of the Upanishads. tion between them . We have the impression conveyed to the brain by the nervous system ; then another takes it up . What is it ? Who is it ? Behind this sense of hearing and the impression conveyed by it is the Hearer , the Universal Hearer ; behind the eye and its imagery is the Universal Seer , and so behind the other senses the One Universal Perceiver . It is this Essential Intelligence which is the only matter of interest and inquiry to the Vedantist . His mode is neither transcendental nor empirical : it is strictly inductive . From the concrete he arrives at the abstract . Sensation in all its divarications is but the channel by which the One Universal Perceiver is reached . This is the Perceiver of all perceptions , the Thinker of all thoughts , the divine Mover and Controller . He sees its manifestations in every atom of matter , through every particle of space . To him its courses need not be specially defined , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to this or that channel or duct of this Divine Force , when he knows it is universally diffused ? Essential Being , Brahman , is always before him ; he seeks to identify himself with ill , to be it by casting off forms and conditions , as the snake casts off its skin , to use a Vedantic simile . He looks upon it with a fixity of gaze like that with which the saint in Dante 's Purgatory regards the Deity , - as one who would say , D ' altro non calme , for nothing else I care ; for by this entrance into the being of the Primal Existence the true destiny of the soul is accomplished . His creed is neither vague nor fanciful . He recognizes an unmistakable Intelligent Power around him , weaving , unweaving , by the law of a strict evolution ; and on this Intelligent Power he leans and builds his life , resting on that which is , though he can apprehend it only in part , and by this means his soul is enlarged and elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its complex mechanism and varied relationships , and sees it all as the emanation of an Infinite Power illumined by the light of its own splendor . By long looking the vision becomes clearer and clearer , just as the practiced eye of the astronomer finally observes that in the configuration of a planet of which an untrained sight receives no sensible impression . Having thus given some indications of the broad teaching of the Ved*nta , I shall now proceed to enter into a more special consideration of some passages of the Upanishads in illustration of their doctrines . The direct mode of the Vedantist in arriving at the limits of the knowable is typically exemplified in the following conversation between a pupil and his preceptor , the former of which seeks information as to the manner of the entrance of Essential Being into material organisms . The father says to his son , " Fetch me from thence a fruit of the nyagrodha-tree. " 1 " Here is one , sir . " " Break it . " " It is broken , sir . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitesimal . " " Break one of them . " " It is broken , sir . " " What do you see there ? " " Not anything , sir . The father said , " My son , that subtile essence which you do not perceive there , of that very essence this great nyagrodhatree exists . " After another instance of intimate and inseparable mixture amounting to homogeneity , derived from salt dissolved in water , the father pursues : - " Here also in this body , forsooth , you do not perceive the True ( that is , primary or Essential Being ) , but there indeed it is . That which is the subtile essence , in it all that exists has its self . It is the True . It is the Self , and thou , O Svetaketu , art it . " // There is no haze or uncertainty over that which can be known and that which it is useless to seek to know . The line of possible inquiry is distinctly laid down ; there is no attempt made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscrutable force must be accepted here alike by the wise and the ignorant . This force is the one central fact , beside which all others are merely subsidiary or accessory ; so important and all-absorbing is it to the Vedantist that he sees no other . The mere dwelling upon it is the beginning of an education , and raises the soul at once to an attitude of attention and receptiveness , into , rapport with the Spirit of Nature , which inaugurates a dawn of true light , and places all human inquiry on its right basis and in due relationship , as a search after the primary law or principle beyond which it can not go . The last paragraph in the above quotations assures the pupil that this essential principle is the same that constitutes the substantial nucleus of his own being , which is also diffused throughout the universe . As further illustrative of Vedantic teaching , the following may be quoted : " All this is Brahman . Let a man meditate on that ( visible world ) as beginning , ending , and breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a creature of will . According to what his will is in this world , so will he be when he has departed this life . Let him therefore have this will and belief . " The intelligent , whose body is spirit , whose form is light , whose thoughts are true , whose nature is like ether ( omnipresent and invisible ) ; from whom all works , all desires , all sweet odors and tastes proceed , - he who embraces all this , who never speaks and is never sur-prised , " He is my self within the heart , smaller than a corn of rice , smaller than a mustard seed , smaller than a canary seed or the kernel of a canary seed . He also is my self within the heart , greater than the earth , greater than the sky , greater than heaven , greater than all these worlds . " He from whom all works , all desires , all sweet odors and tastes proceed , who embraces all this , who never speaks , who is never surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brahman . When I shall have departed from hence I shall obtain him ( that self ) . He who has this faith has no doubt . " The word " self " in these passages is that by which Professor Max Muller translates *tman . I must refer the reader to his preface for his reasons for so doing . He admits it is a mere term of convenience , and perhaps it is as good as any other in the language , though without explanation it must fail to convey any meaning of the original . The context alone , as in paragraphs two , three , and four , illustrates its significance better than any attempt to define accurately the meaning of the term . In such passages as the above there is revealed to the mind a conceptional view of the subtle underlying force and vitality in the universe not to be found so clearly and definitely expressed in any modern writing . We are brought , so to speak , into the very presence of the Eternal , and may exclaim with Jacob at Luz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I knew it not . " We are , as it were , sensibly enfolded in the arms and pressed to the bosom of the Infinite . We are all offspring , from one source , we are all parts of the same Being . The Divine Possibilities are laid open within us . The Power that created the universe can be but one , and we must be a part of that Power . There is no other existence but the eternal one , and every soul that lives must be of that nature and consistency . Thus we have the foundational basis of religion and science , the clue to and confirmation of that instinctive feeling which underlies the questioning soul , that religion and science properly viewed // and accepted must be one and the same thing . There is here distinctly laid down a purely scientific axiom , that Will is the instrumental author of being . The power of willing marks the difference between chaos and creation , between the ainorphous and the structural . It is the primary principle of evolution . " Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vedantist . " Meditate on Will . " Every organism is endowed with the power of choosing that which is necessary to perform its particular function as an individual . Every divarication is the inauguration of the extension of this eclectic faculty , and marks a new stage of development . The Vedantist sees this distinctly , and gives the choosing principle a name . It is Brahman , the Self , within every creature that gives its individuality , and yet holds it inseparably conjoined to the whole . Can anything go deeper ? Wherein have we learnt more than these primitive sages saw and specified ? Have we not here all that any doctrine of evolution can teach us , clearly and comprehensively laid down ? The knowledge of the soul 's universality as Essential Being by a prescient overpassing of the mortal limits is conveyed in the following paragraphs - " That Self is a bank , a boundary , so that these worlds may not be confounded . Day and night do not pass that bank , nor old age , death , and grief ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , for the world of Brahman is free from all evil . " Therefore , he who has crossed that bank , if blind , ceases to be blind ; if wounded , ceases to be wounded ; if afflicted , ceases to be afflicted . Therefore , when that bank has been crossed , night becomes day indeed , for the world of Brahman is lighted up once for all . " And that world of Brahman belongs to those only who find it by abstinence ; for them there is freedom in all the worlds . " The " boundary " above indicated is that between the conditioned and the unconditioned . An apprehension of the latter being attained , - that is , of the soul 's real nature and essential liberty , - the mortal falls from it ; the immortal and eternal are i*evealed as constituting its proper sphere ; the boundaries of time and space are broken down ; it enters upon a divine freedom , and henceforward can not be touched by the shifting casualties of the terrestrial existence . The mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being is put before us in the answer given to Saunaka , a great householder , who went to inquire of the sage Angiras* " Sir , " said Saunaka , " what is that which if it is known , everything else becomes known ? " The sage answered , " Two kinds of knowledge must be known , - this is what all who know Brahman tell us , - the higher and lower knowledge . " He proceeds to say that the lower knowledge is that of the Vedas , grammar , science , etc. ; but the higher knowledge is that by which the indestructible ( Brahman ) is reached . " That which can not be seen nor seized , which has no family and no caste , no eyes nor ears , no hands nor feet , the eternal , the omnipresent ( all-pervading ) , infinitesimal , that which is imperishable , - that it is which the wise regard as the source of all beings . " As the spider sends forth and draws in its thread , as plants grow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head and the body , thus does everything here arise from the indestructible . " Perhaps there is nothing more happily expressed in the Vedanta than the similes and illustrations given by way of figures or symbols of interior meaning . Here we have one that elucidates the gradations by which we go from the known to the unknown in our progress towards the Infinite Ideal - " As a caterpillar , after having reached a blade of grass , and after having made another approach ( to another blade ) , // draws itself together towards it , thus does this Self , after having thrown off this body and dispelled all ignorance , and after making another approach ( to another body ) , draw himself togethef towards it . " And as a goldsmith , taking a piece of gold , turns it into another newer and more beautiful shape , so does this Self , after having thrown off this body and dispelled all ignorance , make unto himself another newer and more beautiful shape . " Could anything be put into better form or be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressed utterance . The Yedantist goes on to say - " Now , as a man is like this or like that , according as he acts and according as he behaves , so will he be : a man of good acts will become good ; a man of bad acts , bad . He becomes pure by pure deeds , bad by bad deeds . " And here they say that a person consists of desires . And as his desire , so is his will ; and as is his will , so is his deed ; and whatever deed he does , that will he reap . " And here there is this verse : To whatever object a man 's own mind is attacked , to that he goes strenuously together with his deed ; and having obtained the end ( the last results ) of whatever deed he does here on earth , he returns again from that world ( which is the temporary reward of his deed ) to this world of action . ' " So much for the man who desires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , not desiring , freed from desires , is satisfied in his desires , or desires the Self only , his vital spirits do not depart elsewhere ; being Brahman , he goes to Brahman . " On this there is this verse : When all desires which once entered his heart are undone , then does the mortal become immortal , then he obtains Brahman . ' " And as the slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill , dead and cast away , thus lies this body ; but that disembodied immortal spirit is Brahman , is only light . " The extinction of personal desires here laid down is the abuse of the ascetic ; but , however mistaken and travestied in modern Brahmanism , is clear enough in meaning to the thoughtful . It is not the prostration of inaction , but a recognition of the eternal , universal claim , and an abandonment and total submission to it . It is an acceptance of the rule of higher Being , of absolute law , and a merging of the soul into it without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thus relinquishing the standpoint of its own personality that the soul enters into the Essential Principle of the universe . It is thus that the seeker of the true soul , the immortal and essential " Self " within us as it is without , leaving the concrete and limited , unites himself with this unbounded Being , and becomes one with it . But what a sublime exposition is this of Divine Truth ! Is it not convincing that the voice of Truth has never been silent in the history of mankind ; that it is always and perpetually speaking ? Surely there is something here which points to the highest in man , and enables him to claim an assimilative union with his Creator . We may proceed in our exposition of Vedantic teaching by continuing the quotation from the same Upanishad : - " The small old path stretching far away has been found by me . On it sages who know Brahman move on to the Svarga - loka ( heaven ) , and thence higher on , as entirely free . " In a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most trustworthy mode of interpreting obscure passages is by carefully collating them with parallel or analogous readings . It is astonishing how much light may be thrown on such passages by this means . Necessarily , the writings must be well grasped in their entirety before this can be done . Such a knowledge of them // once attained , a comparison of various readings will often be found clearly illustrative , when even the splendid commentary of Sankarach*rya fails to enlighten us . The " path stretching far away " is the way of truth , the " narrow way " of the Gospels , as we find by referring to another Upanishad as follows : " The true prevails , not the untrue ; by the true the path is laid out , the way of the gods on which the old sages , satisfied in their desires , proceed to where there is that highest place of the True One . " That ( true Brahman ) shines forth grand , divine , inconceivable , smaller than small ; it is far beyond what is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave ( of the heart ) among those who see it even here . " It will be seen that the statements made in the above passages are strictly in accordance with law and rule . There is nothing catastrophic or cataclysmic in this elevation . It is one of progress and gradual advancement , - evolution , in fact , beginning with the material and ending in the spiritual , and then going by progressive stages to the Highest . To proceed with the Bri. - upanishad : " On that path they say that there is white , or blue , or yellow , or green , or red ; that path was found by Brahman , and on it goes whoever knows Brahman , and who has done good and obtained splendor . " The colors here specified doubtless symbolize the divarication of the Creative Energy , just as we are told in another place , " The sun , which has no color , produces all colors . " Thus the sages approach Brahman by means of his manifestation , his created works ; " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conic to what appears to be a paradoxical statement , which has been found very puzzling by some European students of the Yed*nta . It is this : - " All who worship what is not knowledge enter into blind darkness ; those who delight in knowledge enter , as it were , into greater darkness . " There are , indeed , those unblessed worlds covered with blind darkness . Men who are ignorant and not enlightened go , after death , to those worlds . " It would seem strange that if those who worship the negation of knowledge sink into profound darkness , those who delight in knowledge should enter still greater darkness . But here the difficulty evidently turns on what is meant by the term " darkness . " The signification of darkness here is undoubtedly that of the senses . That is to say , the ignorant , in the Yedic sense ( those who do not know Brahman ) , who have not left the domain of the senses , are still held in the sensuous bond , are still in the light - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have abandoned the r ? ahn of sense for the higher illumination of the spirit are plunged into an unknown and inconceivable obscurity considered with respect to material or sensible light , which therefore is fitly designated as darkness to the mortal apprehension . " Mystics , " so called , of various times and places , have often used the same figure . In the Rose Garden of the Suflist Mahmud Shabistari we find : - " This blackness , if you know it , is the light of very Being : In the land of darkness is the wellspring of life . " It is also definitely expressed by Lord Herbert of Cherbury in his Sonnet of Black Beauty , as follows : - " rhon still abidest so entirely one That we may know thy blackness is a spark Of light inaccessible , and alone Our darkness which can make us think it dark . " The sage proceeds : - " If a man understands the Self , saying , I am He , ' what could he wish or desire that he should pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a man understands // and accepts the fact that he is not an independent and isolated individual , but of the nature and substance of the very Creator himself , why should he wish to return to the limitations of the body , with its varying liabilities to pain and suffering ? Once understood his identity with the Divine Ruler whilst the soul is narrowly confined to the restriction of the body , he must then recognize that he also is of the same essential quality ; just as the Hebrew prophet said to the people , " Ye are the sons of the living God ; " and David , " Ye are gods , and all of you are children of the most High ; " the latter quoted and confirmed by Jesus Christ , according to the evangelist . This , then , is a question of spiritual perception , or " Knowledge , " as the Vedantist terms it . " While we are here we may know this ; if not , I am ignorant , and there is great destruction . Those who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If a man clearly beholds this Self as God , and as the lord of all that is and will be , then he is no more afraid . " He behind whom the year revolves with the days , him the gods worship as the light of lights , as immortal time . " He in whom the five beings and the ether rest , him alone I believe to be the Self : I who know believe him to be Brahman ; I who am immortal believe him to be immortal . " They who know the life of life , the eye of the eye , the ear of the ear , the mind of the mind , they have comprehended the ancient primeval Brahman . " By the mind alone is it to be perceived ; there is in it no diversity . He who perceives therein any diversity goes from death to death . " This eternal being that can never be proved is to be perceived in one way only ; it is spotless , beyond the ether , the unborn Self , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has discovered him , practice wisdom . Let him not seek after many words , for that is a mere weariness of the tongue . " The " five beings " spoken of in the above extract have been variously explained . They may be the five orders of spiritual beings . *y own interpretation is that they are meant for the five senses , with the mind ( " ether " ) . The passage would then mean , he in whom mortal being rests ; that is , the Deity , or Brahman . The phrase " there is diversity " would say that Essential Being is homogeneous , so to speak , inclusive , of one sole nature and quality , and can not therefore be divided . He who looks upon individual being as something self-existent , complete in itself , and not as a part of eternal , universal being , still remains in the conditional and mortal , the transitory and perishable . The similes used to express the homogeneity of being are , as salt dissolved in water , so universal Being pervades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the universally distributed ether is not made otherwise or different or obtains another denomination by being inclosed in a jar from that which is external to the vessel , so this universal Being maintains its unity under all forms of divarication . These sublime words need no further explanation . Their import is clear enough in the light of what has been already stated . I have thus laid down some of the broader principles of the teaching of the Ved*nta , and I think they are sufficient to make its spirit and doctrines clearly understood . There is no doubt this must be placed in the world 's category of revelations , whatever may be the precise significance attached to that term . It is exactly in the line of evolution of the highest idea of religion in the soul of man . It contains in its essence the dawn or nucleus of the most profound and intrinsic sentiment of Christianity ; that is , God in man , to be discovered by the highest spiritual intelligence , that subtle faculty of the soul which rules our reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Teaching of the Upanishads . According to the Ved*nta , the object and raison d ' *tre of mundane existence are that the soul may be able to supersede and renounce material life and every temporal attachment , living only in that which is divine , eternal , immutable . The Brahmanical state thus attained - termed in later Buddhism Nirvana - is , however , not , as is sometimes supposed , annihilation , but the contrary , an unlimited , pure , impersonal life , and one , therefore , which no language has terms to explain ; of which , indeed , the human soul , in its present state , has no faculty for the apprehension . This is the highest form of religion . For those clinging to the mortal and individual being ; who look to rewards and punishments as their directing and governing influences ; who love not the Divine Being for its own sake , its intrinsic desirableness and loveliness , but seek for personal happiness and to escape suffering merely , - these , by a life of appropriate acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , but terminable , since their acts , life , and thoughts still keep the individuated and postulate range . Those who , by their own will and desire , do not reach the eternal and unchangeable state are born again and again into varied forms of terminable life , according to their deeds : some as wise and good persons in the upward progress , and others , the wicked , as noxious animals , or even as stocks and stones ; just as we are told in the book of Revelation in the New Testament that death changes no nature . " He that is unjust , let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still : and he that is holy , let him be holy still . " Much which to the Western mind is desirable , and perhaps in itself innocuous , the Vedantist says , for him is evil , because it makes demands upon and fosters the mortal and material part of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does not want to gain the world in any of its forms , but to leave it in all . It is by withdrawing himself from it that he seeks to do this . It may be added that tenderness to every creature that lives , kindness and helpfulness , with every sort of social goodness , are inculcated to the utmost . But it must at the same time be allowed that the active virtues are not dwelt upon and enforced with the same degree of prominence which they obtain in the Christian religion . Perhaps the Yed*nta is too purely abstract and intellectual in its nature . In fact , Vedantic teachings are no substitute for Christianity , but bear upon the more developed teachings of Christ as revealing how entirely accordant with law those teachings are , how secure are their foundations on the very basis of nature and being . The Yed*nta throws a flood of light , to the reflective mind , on the union , the absolute union , of the soul of man with the Being of God , and herein is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Christian religion . There is no antagonism in any one point , so far as I know , between the two religions ; the Brahmanical form dwelling upon principles common to both . They would seem to be but different aspects of the same high truth , mutually illuminative , though from different points of view . A person might be a Brahmin in faith without abandoning Christianity , and a Brahmin might be a Christian without sacrificing anything of his creed , or , as he would call it , Knowledge . Indeed , it would seem to me that both must be benefited , each by the presentation of the other . In using the term " Brahmin " here , I mean the Vedantist , and not the formalist of to-day ; as also , by " Christianity , " I do not mean its modern representative , but the religion of Jesus Christ as taught and exemplified by him . Thus we may be said to have here the practical solutiQn of the main problem of life , the soul 's function and destiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tal , from the material to the spiritual , by the laws of a natural evolution , to pass beyond the limits of the senses into the realm of pure Essential Being . " The sun does not shine there , nor the moon August , and the stars , nor these lightnings , and much less this fire . When He shines , everything shines after Him ; by his light all this is lighted . " ( Katha-upanishad , ii . v. 15. )
