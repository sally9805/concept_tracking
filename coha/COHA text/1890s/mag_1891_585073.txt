txt S GM E eight or ten years ago it was by no means difficult for one who knew where to go and how to hunt , to get excellent shooting in northwestern Wyoming . Large game was there moderately abundant , with the exception of buffalo . The latter had just been exterminated , but , bleaching in the sun , the ghastly evidences of man 's sordid and selfish policy lay exposed at every step . Indian troubles of a very formidable character did a great deal toward keeping the game intact in this portion of the country by keeping the white man out , and while other parts of Wyoming grew , and towns sprang up with rapid growth to become in an incredibly short time cities , involving in destruction , as the past sad history shows , the wild animals in their vicinity , this Northwestern portion remained unsettled and acted as an asylum to receive within its rocky , mountain ranges and vast sheltering forests , the scattering bands of elk and deer fleeing from annihilation and the encroaching haunts of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some instances unquestionably before , cattlemen , not inaptly styled pioneers of civTnese two had a commanding position .

And now , as I propose to give some hunting experiences of those days , if will accompany me to Billinos on you the Northern Pacific Railway , the nearest town to my ranch and the Mecca to which the devout cattle-man drives his wagon for supplies , I will introduce you to the foot - hills and mountains , and some of the adventures therein . After four days on a sleeping car it is a delightful release to tumble out on a frosty September morning , and being guided to where the ranch wagon and crew are bivouacked just outside the limits of the rapidly growing town , to get on* 's breakfast on terra-firma . No time is now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little band of horses are rounded together , and when we have jumped into our saddles , the cook , who always handles the reins , gives a crack of his whip , and we take our departure from civilization . A couple of miles takes us to a primitive wire-rope ferry , where we cross the Yellowstone River , which at this season of the year is low and clear ; in a few minutes we are over , and ascending the bluffs on the other side take our last look at the beautiful valley we are leaving behind . By night we reach Pryor 's Creek , and picking out as good a camping place as possible , the mules are soon unhitched and with the horses turned loose to graze . While the cook is preparing the evening meal I bag a few prairie chickens to give variety to the fare . Breakfasting at daylight the next morning , we are soon under way again , with Pryors Mountains in the distance as our goal for this day 's journey . Toward evening the white tepees of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pryors Mountains . Passing them , not without paying a slight tribute in the way of tobacco and such other gifts as our copper-colored friends generally demand , we fairly enter Pryors Gap , and there , in a delightful amphitheatre , we again make camp . This evening we must have trout for supper , so all hands go to work and we are soon rewarded with a fine mess of trout from the head waters of Pryors Creek . The next day , as we reach the summit of the Gap , one of the most beautiful views in the country opens out . The great main range of the Rocky Mountains stretches before us , its rugged , snow-capped peaks glistening in the morning sun , and we long to be there , but many a long mile still intervenes . and forty-four miles of desert has to be crossed to-day . This is always an arduous undertaking . It is monotonous in the extreme , and men and animals are sure to suffer for want of good water , for after leaving Sage Creek on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be had until Stinking Water River * is reached . But all things must have an end , and at last , late in the evening , we find ourselves encamped on the banks of that stream , beautiful despite its unfortunate name . Fording the river the next morning , not a very terrifying operation in its present low stage , we climb the steep bank and soon begin our long ascent of the divide that separates us from our ranch and Greybull River . Accompanied by an immense amount of expletives , and very bad language , the mules are finally induced to gain the summit . Here even the most casual observer could not fail to be impressed with the magnificent and apparently indefinite expanse of mountain scenery , that , turn which way he will , meets his view . However , we have no time to linger , and picking our way among the countless buffalo wallows which indent the level surface of the summit , the wagon , with its wheels double locked , is soon groaning and creaking down the descent , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its junction with Greybull , we are soon inside our own fence , and are joyously welcomed by the dogs . Here , too , I find my trusty friend and companion of all my hunting trips , Tazwell Woody , a grizzled veteran of the mountains , who * Bancroft in his account of the early explorations of wyoming refers to this river as follows : " It is a slander to use this non-descriptive name for an inoffensive stream . The early trappers took it from the Indians , who , in their peculiar fashion , called it the river that ran hy the stinking water , ' referring to had-smelling hot springs on its hanks . " // once long ago claimed Missouri as his home . From the ranch to the mountains is a comparatively short trip , for one day 's travel to the westward would place you well up on their slopes . Let me say of this portion of the range that it is the most rugged , broken , and precipitous of its whole extent , and the charm of overcoming its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiled and sweated in surmounting the difficulties of mountain travel from a pure love of nature in its wildest and grandest form . Experience having taught me long ago that it was well-nigh impossible to get good specimens of all the different varieties of big game on any one trip , I made up my mind to devote a certain amount of time each year to one variety . By this means their habits could be studied more closely , and the main point never lost sight of . In a short paper like this I may best take up the chief of these varieties one by one , and without regard to the time of their occurrence tell something of my experiences with each . And first , as to perhaps the shyest , the Rocky Mountain sheep . In the pursuit of Rocky Mountain sheep , the hunter , to be successful , must have a fondness for the mountains , a sure foot , good wind , and a head which no height will turn . These requisites , with patience and perseverance , will , sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ample returns . Sometimes , however , the unexpected will happen , and the following tale will serve as an example . We were camping well up in the mountains , and almost any hour of the day sheep could be seen with the glasses . I was after sheep ; it was my intent , business , and purpose to get some if possible , and all my energies were concentrated in that direction . There were two fine rams in particular that we could see about a mile and a half from camp occupying the slope of a rocky point or promontory that jutted out from a spur of the range . These two had a commanding position , for while it seemed impossible to get to them from above , they could see every movement from below or on each side of them . However , after studying the country for two days , I found that by ascending the mountain behind them , and coming down again I could still keep above them , though there was a very narrow ledge of rocks , rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point they were on . This narrow ledge they had to come back on to get to the main part of the mountain ; so , stationing my companion there , and taking off my shoes , and putting on an extra pair of heavy stockings , I proceeded to crawl toward the sheep . With due care , and not making a sound , I made a most successful stalk . Peering over the ledge I just raised my head enough to be sure my game was still there . They were there , sure enough , within seventy-five yards of me , totally unconscious of danger , when all of a sudden they sprang to their feet and dashed away from below me as though possessed of a devil . I fired hastily , but of course missed , and turning , tried to run back to head them off , wondering what had started them , as I knew I had made no noise . But running over broken rock in one 's stocking feet is a very different thing from the slow , deliberate movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few seconds I had the mortification of seeing my would-be victims bounding across the narrow ledge that separated them from the mountain . However , Ithought with satisfaction that at least one would meet its death from my companion in hiding , but , alas ! although the rams almost knocked him down , his cartridge missed fire . Regaining my shoes , which was a great relief , I soon joined my companion and then discovered the curious adventure I had been made the subject of . It seems that when I had reached a point well down on the promontory I must have disturbed a cougar which was evidently there for the same purpose I was , and which had stealthily followed me as I proceeded toward the sheep . Old Woody described it as highly amusingI sneaking down after the rams , and the panther sneaking down upon me . As soon as the beast got an opportunity it // turned off , and , making the descent , in the camp , and I determined to see if alarmed the rams and thus spoiled my I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very cheering , for shortly after For several days I watched this point , starting a heavy fog shut down , hiding but those rams never came back to it all objects from view . I had not pro- again . However , not long after this I was amply rewarded and secured a fine specimen . From one of the high ledges I was looking down into a sort of amphitheatre shut in by massive rocky heights . In this secluded retreat a little band of ewes , with one grand old patriarch as their master , could be seen every day disporting themselves with many a curious gambol . After many unsuccessful attempts I was enabled to get a shot , and great was my delight to deprive this little band of their supercilious protector . Upon another occasion I was camping away back up in the mountains where there were about eighteen inches of snow on the ground . The weather had been villainous ; there was no meat ceeded far , however , when I struck the fresh track of a rain , and following it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led into a dense patch of pine on the side of the mountain . Proceeding very carefully now , I soon made out the outline of a fine old ram that had wandered off here in the timber to be by himself . Giving him no time to run , for I was close upon him , certainly not farther than twenty-five yards , I planted a shot just back of the shoulder , but he did not seem to mind it . I gave him another when he started to walk slowly off . One more shot in the same place and down he came . Even then he died hard . Such is the vitality of an old ram ; for upon examining him I found I sneaking down after the rams , and the panther sneaking down after me. ' // his heart all torn to pieces . This was a good head of nearly sixteen inches circumference of horns , and the girth of chest was forty-six inches . In returning to camp for horses to pack him on , I jumped five more sheep , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in safety . Sheep have a wonderfully keen vision , and it is absolutely useless to try to get to them if they once see you , unless you happen to be above them and on their favorite runway ; then they huddle together and try to break back past you . The only safe rule is to travel high and keep working up above their feeding grounds . In the spring of the year they are much easier to kill than in the fall , for then the heavy winter snows have driven them out of the mountains , and they come low down after the fresh green grass . The- rams are then in bands , having laid aside the hostility that later in the year seems to possess each and every one of them . I was much interested once in watching a band of eight rams , all of them old fellows . They would feed early in the morning and then betake themselves to a large rock which stood on a grassy slope , where they would play for hours . One of them would jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Two or three would then j ump up , and their horns would come together with a clash that I could hear from my position , which was fully a quarter of a mile away . On one occasion I saw them suddenly stop their play and each ram became fixed ; there the little band stood as though carved out of stone . They remained that way for quite half an hour without a movement . I could not detect with the glasses the slightest motion , when , presently , three strange rams made their appearance . Here was the explanation that I was looking for . They had seen them long before I had . The three visitors were not very well received , but were compelled to beat an ignominious and hasty retreat . As summer draws near , and the winter snow begins to disappear , bands of elk may be seen migrating toward their favorite ranges . The bulls are now together in bands of greater or less ex tent . Their horns are well grown out , but are soft and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick timber . As the season advances and the flies become troublesome , the bulls will get up as high as they can climb and seem to delight in standing on the brink of some mountain precipice . I have often wondered , in seeing them standing thus , whether they were insensible of the magnificent scenery that surrounded them . Reader , what would you have given to have seen , as I have , a band of two hundred and fifty bull-elk all collected together on a beautiful piece of green grassy turf at an elevation of nine thousand feet ? Here was a sight to make a man 's nerves tingle . This was the largest band of bulls , by actual count , that I have ever seen , though my cousin and partner once saw in the fall of the year , including bulls , cows , and calves , fifteen hundred . This was on the memorable occasion when the only elk ever killed by any of my men gave up his life , and we have all concluded that this particular elk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and each was confident he hit him , they always asserted afterward that no bullet mark could be found on him . Generally , in August , in each band of bulls there will be found one or two barren cows ; about the end of August , after the bulls have rubbed the velvet off their antlers , they will come back to the vicinity of the bands of cows . I have seen bulls as late as September 4th peaceably feeding or resting among the bands of cows . Usually , in a band of fifty cows , there would be three or four males , including , possibly , one or two spike-bulls. * J have seen these spikebulls in the velvet as late as September 4th , though by that time the older bulls had mostly rubbed the velvet off . A little later , about September 7th , the bulls begin to challenge each other , in hunting parlance , whistling . This , on a clear frosty night , is sometimes extremely melodious , and it is one of the most impossible sounds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for * A spike-bull is a young elk carrying his first or flag antlers . These are siugle&gt;tined , though in rare instances they are bifurcated. // saying it , I do not consider very exciting sport to a man thoroughly versed in the woods . They are far too noble an animal to kill unnecessarily , and if one hunts them in September when they are whistling , it is a very easy matter , guided by the sound , to stalk them successfully . Elk , like the rest of the deer family , are excessively fond of saline matter . Their trails may be seen leading from every direction to the great alkaline licks that abound in certain parts of their mountain ranges . Among other favorite resorts are springs , which make on steep wooded slopes a delightful , boggy wallowing place . The bulls revel in these from August to the middle of September . It is not an uncommon thing to kill them just as they emerge from their viscous bath coated with mud . The *lk has a great deal of natural curiosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree where they have been but little hunted or alarmed . My friend Phillips , of Washington , who was with me , will vouch for the veracity of this story , which I give as an example . We were wandering along the top of the mountain , some nine thousand feet up , trying to stalk some elk , not to shoot them , but to photograph them . We jumped a small band of bulls numbering about sixteen . They trotted slowly off , stopping to look back frequently , until all but two large bulls had disappeared . These walked slowly back to within fifty yards of where we were standing , and stopped , facing us . It was truly one of the most charming sights one could have wished for , to have those graceful , sleek creatures almost close enough to caress . Presently , with a defiant snort , and with a succession of short barks , they would move away and come back again , repeating these mamzeuvres over and over again , until we got tired of trying to look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought this would frighten them , but it did not , and once I thought they were going to proceed from curiosity to more offensive operations , so close did they come to us . Even my caterwauling , as my friend unfeelingly characterized my attempt to imitate their challenges , did not seem to alarm them , and not until a full half hour had elapsed did this pair of worthies jog off . Elk are vigorous fighters , and while it seems but seldom that their combats terminate fatally , the broken points of their antlers , and their scarred and bruised bodies bear testimony to the severity of their encounters . A fullgrown elk stands about sixteen hands high , is about eight feet two inches long from nose to tip of tail , and with a girth around the chest of about six feet . It was on the head of Wind River that I secured my largest head . The regularity of the points was somewhat marred , as the bull had evidently been fighting only a short time before I killed him . These horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the outside curve , is sixty-three and seven-eighth inches . The circumference between bay and tray is from seven and one-half to eight inches , and the greatest spread between antlers is forty-nine inches . Probably more horrible lies have been told by bear hunters than any other class of men , except , perhaps , fishermen , who are renowned for their yarns . However , I trust that in the case of the few instances I have to give of my experience I can keep fairly within the bounds of truth . Bear hunting , as a general rule , I do not think would appeal to most sportsmen . It is rather slow work , and one is often very inadequately rewarded for the amount of time and trouble spent in hunting up bruin . There is hardly a portion of the mountains where there are not evidences of bear , but I do not believe that in any locality they are especially abundant . They have been hunted and trapped so long that those who survive are extremely cautious . In my experience there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this region , the hunter 's chief virtue , patience to wait and stay in one spot , is sure to be rewarded sooner or later with a good shot . Let me say now that the danger and ferocity of the bear is , I think , very much over - stated , yet there is just // 449 enough element of danger to make the pursuit of this animal excitino ' uralists do not now Nat more apparently recog mze than two varieties of bear in the Rocky Mountains . That is , they class the cinnamon , silver-tip , and grizzly , as grizzly bear . The other variety , of course , is the black bear . I am by no means sure that the grizzly bear will not be further subdivided after careful comparisons of collections of skulls . Much has been said and written about the size and weight of the griz* zly l ) ear , and in most instances this has been mere guess-work . Lewis and Clark made frequent mention of this animal , and yet their estimate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few instances have come to my knowledge where the weight has been ascertained absolutely . A good-sized grizzly killed in Yello*-stone Park last summer by Wilson , the Trying to stalk some elk not to shoot them but to photograph them // Government scout , weighed six hundred pounds . Colonel Pickett , who has a neighboring ranch to mine , and who has killed more bear than any man I know of , weighed his largest , which , if I remember rightly , weighed eight hundred pounds . One will , of course , occasionally see a very large skin , and from its size it would seem impossible that the animal that once filled it out , if in good condition , could have weighed less than twelve hundred pounds . But I think it may be safely set down that the average weight of most specimens that one will get in the mountains will be under , rather than over , five hundred pounds . To me , bear hunting possesses a great fascination , and for years I have hunted nothing else . Personally I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins are then in their prime , the hair long and soft , and their claws ( if valued as they should be ) are long and sharp from disuse . Bear seek their winter quarters in Bad Lands and in the mountains . Those that adopt the former come out much earlier ; consequently if the hunter is on the ground soon enough , he may , by beginning in the lower lands first and working toward the mountains , be reasonably sure of securing good skins as late as June . In the spring , too , bear are much more in the open , and travel incessantly in search of food . It is highly interesting to watch them , when one has the chance , turning over stones , tearing open fallen trees , or rooting like a pig in some favorite spot . Acres upon acres even of hard , stony ground they will turn up , and in other places it would be difficult to find a stone or rock they had not displaced . They will undermine and dig out great stumps . Ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have labored all the previous fall to make a cache of pine nuts , are robbed on sight . One spring , the work on the ranch being done , Woody and I took our packhorses and proceeded to the mountains after bear . I had no sooner picked out a good camping ground than it began to snow , and for four days we could not stir from camp . However , it finally cleared off , the sun came out bright and warm , and the little stream that we were on began boiling , tearing , and rushing along , full to the banks , causing us to move our camp back to higher ground . After breakfast , as we proposed to take a long day 's trip , we took our horses with us . Riding up to the head of the stream we were on , looking for bear , no signs were to be seen , though plenty of sheep were in sight all the time . Riding on away above the cafion some six or eight miles , we could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still no sign of bear . Finally , we turned off and worked our way clear up on top of the mountain , determined to see the country anyway . Slowly we climbed upward , skyward , dragging our weary horses after us , until at noon we were nearly up and concluded to lunch at the little rill of melted snow that came from a big drift on the mountain side . To get to it though , made necessary crossing the drift , and Woody led the way with his favorite horse , old Rock , in tow ; and here was where my laugh came in , to see those two floundering through that drift . At times , all I could see of Rock was the tips of his ears . The crust was just strong enough to hold Woody up if he went " easy , " but he could not go easy with the horse plunging on top of him , and they would both break through . However , they had to go ahead in spite of themselves , and they were finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , profiting by this experience , I circumnavigated this drift , and we sat down to our dry bread and bacon , washed down by a long pull from the handy snow-water . Ten minutes and a pipe was all that we allowed ourselves before resuming our toil ( for that is really the way to designate the ascent of these mountains ) . We saw six fine rams ( of course , now that we did not want any ) ; they did not seem to regard us with any uneasiness , permitting us to get within murderous distance , and I looked at their leader with some longing . He had such a noble head of curling , graceful , well-rounded horns . He must have been a powerful adversary when it came to butting . // Stifling the intent I passed by without valleys , and sees the richness and vividdisturbing them , and at last reached the ness of the green growing grasses which top of the divide , and was repaid by a glorious view . At that time nature was not in her most smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds were gathering in the west , and an ugly rolling of thunder warned us that no genial spring day with shirt-sleeve accompaniment was to gladden and cheer us . Still we must look for bear ; so buttoning up our coats and turning up our collars , we surveyed the country . At the same time it was impossible to forego a study of the grandeur of the view displayed before us . Those who have seen the mountains and foot-hills only in the fall of the year . when every blade of grass is parched and brown and dry , can form no adequate idea of the change that presents itself in the spring . Especially is one surprised , when , standing on the top of some mountain height surrounded by everlasting snow , he looks down over the seem to roll up almost to his feet . As we stood there we had a glorious panorama . The vast gathering storm was at our backs , and the sun , though not shining for us , was lighting up the broad valley below . Greybull River stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole range of the Big Horn Mountains was visible , their snow tops glistening like a bank of silver clouds , and the main range we were standing on was brought out in all its dazzling grandeur . Snow-drift upon snow-drift , with gracefully curling crests , stretched away as far as the eye can reach , for miles and miles . Still we saw no bear , and while we were enjoying all this wonderful scenery we neglected the storm , and were soon enveloped in a raging tempest of wind and snow with a demoniacal accompaniment of lightning and crashing thunder . We hunched up our backs and stumbled along the ridge before the blast and I had a very naaty time in getting down the mountain-Page 454. // Two rascals across the gulch on an enormous snow-drift . DRAWN SY A. S. FROST . ENGRAVED EY ANDREW . // HUNTING AMERICAN BIG GAME . were soon brought up by a drift . However , here is luck for once . We saw the print of two fresh bear tracks crossing the drift . All thoughts of the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sign was very fresh . Alas , though , we lost them after crossing the drift , and it was impossible to find them again upon the rugged soil of these ridges where the wind had blown the snow off . We circled round and round , studying every patch of snow , and my companion , Woody , looked and spoke doubtfully . At last I caught the trail again . Only a half dozen tracks , but enough to show the right direction , and as we ascended the ridge the tracks were on , I saw the two rascals across the gulch on an enormous snow-drift , tearing and chewing at something , I could n't make out what . It was still snowing hard , but it was only a squall and nearly over . The wind was wrong ; it unfortunately blew toward the bear and the only direction in which we could stalk them . Still an attempt had to be made . We took the bridles from our horses and let down our hacamores , to let them feed comfortably and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where it joined the one the bear were on . We had to creep up a beastly snow-drift , which was soft and no telling how deep . It was deep enough , for we went through sometimes to our arm-pits . But what mattered it when we were at concert pitch , and bear for the tune . We were now on the same ridge as the bear . Cautiously , with the wind just a little aslant , we crawled down toward our prey , crossing another miserable snow-drift into which we went up to our necks , where we brought up , our feet having touched bottom . We floundered out behind a small rock , and then looked up over at the bear . Too far to shoot with any certainty , and I said to Woody , " I must get closer . " And so back we crawled . Making a little detour we bobbed up again , not serenely , for the wind was blowing on the backs of our necks straight as an arrow to where the bear were . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our taint must have gone over them , for when I VOL . X.-46 looked up again one of the bear was chewing a savory morsel , and the other was on his hind legs blinking at the sun , which was just breaking through the clouds . Wiping the snow and drops of water and slush from our rifles and sights , and with a whispered advice from Woody not to be in a hurry if they came toward us , but to reserve fire in order to make sure work-for no sheltering tree awaited us as a safe retreat , nothing but snowy ridges for miles-I opened the ball with the young lady who was sitting down . She dropped her bone , clapped one of her paws to her ribs , and to my happiness waltzed down the snow-bank . As she now seemed to be out of the dance I turned to her brother , for such I judged him to be afterward , who , with great affection , had gone down with her until she stuck her head in the snow . Not understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hollow three hundred and thirty grain chunk of lead nearly severed one hip and smashed the other . He did not stop to reason , but promptly jumped on his relative , and then there occurred a lively bit of a scrimmage . Over and over they rolled , slapping , biting , and making the best fight of it they could , considering the plight they were in . Each probably accused the other of the mishap . The snow was dyed a crimson hue . It was like the scene of a bloody battleground . At last the first aggrieved lady gave up and plunged her head back into the snow , while her brother , not having any one to fight with , went off a short distance and lay down . We cautiously approached , bearing in mind that a snow drift is a hard thing for pedestrians in a hurry to travel on , and when we got about ten feet from the first bear , I told my companion to snowball her and see what effect that would have , for she looked too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing so , he discarded his rifle and reached for her tail . Ah , I thought so ! for , as he gave a yank , up came her head , her jaws flew open like clock work , and a snort came forth . But right between the eyes went the deadly messenger , smashing her skull // and ending any prolonged suffering for any of us . Her end accomplished , we turned to the other partner . He had been taking it all in and was ready for a fight . He seemed pretty fit , too . Fortunately , he could not come up to us the snow-drift was too steep , and he had only two serviceable legs to travel with . Still he had true grit , and faced us , but it was an unequal battle . Again the bullet reached its victim , and brother ba'r lay quietly on his back with his legs in the air . No need to trifle with this bear 's tail , as any fool could see that he was dead . However , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went around to his stump of a tail and pulled it while I stood guard at his head . We took off our coats and soon had the skins off the pair of them . These skins proved to be in the finest condition , though the bear themselves were pbor . I should judge one was a three-year old and the other a two-year old . Still they were goodsized grizzlies . Those skins seemed to grow in size and weight as each of us lugged one up the side of the mountain over shelving rock , snow , and loose gravel to where wa left our horses . Of course they were not there , and we had to go on carrying the skins , which were growing heavier and heavier every minute , until we tracked our horses to where they were feeding , and , in Western vernacular , " we had a circus** packing those skins on my horse . It was done at last , though , and to stay , by means of blindfolding him with a coat , and after a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear all his many years of service . I had a very nasty time in geting down the mountain after my horse slipped and fell down a gap in the crown rock . We could not get the other down , so I took charge of my horse and skins and made the rest of the descent in safety , though it looked squally for a bit when the old rascal 's feet slid out from under him , knocking me down in the snow , and he on top , and I could feel that even with the fleecy covering the rocks were still very hard . However , it was deep enough for me to crawl out more scared than hurt , and soon we had sage-brush and grass under our feet , with an easy trail to camp , where a square meal inside of a stomach that sorely needed it soon made amends for all hardships . Wondering what those bear had been at work at , I went back the next day and found that they had been tearing up a sheep that had died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To a thorough sportsman , killing bear after a successful stalk is by long odds the best and most exciting method , but the country must be such as permits of this , as , for instance , when there are long stretches of high mountains , plateaus or ridges above or devoid of timber where the bear resort to root , and where the hunter can from some elevated post look over a k*rge area with the aid of glasses . The general procedure , though , is to put out bait , that is , to have the carcass of some animal to attract the bear , and many a noble elk or timorous deer has been thus sacrificed . To avoid this needless destruction the writer has invariably taken along on his hunting trips aged and worn-out horses , which answer admirably when it comes to drawing bear to a carcass . Of course , this is not always a sure way , for the bear if alarmed or disturbed will only visit the carcass at night , and then , if the hunter is persistent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary hours of watching from a friendly pine . I think I hear the reader say , What 's the fun in shooting a bear from a tree ? there is no risk in that . True there is not , but it is when you come down from your perch that you may not feel quite so safe , as with limbs benumbed from cold and lack of circulation you climb down , knowing perhaps that several watchful pairs of eyes or cunning nostrils are studying your movements . Involuntarily your thoughts travel in the vein of your gloomy surroundings as you go stumbling on your way to camp ; what if the bear should prefer live goose flesh to dead horse ? One spring morning I was knocking around under the base of the mountains and found myself , about dinner time , so close to Colonel Pickett 's cosey log cabin that I determined to pay him a long postponed visit .

We had not proceeded far , though , when we met an excited " cow puncher , " who evidently had news to tell . He had been up on the side of the mountain , which was here a long grassy slope as smooth as any of our well-tended lawns , extending upward to where it joined the dense pine forest which covered the upper portion of the mountain . Our friend was the horse wrangler for a neighboring ranch , and was out looking for horses . Did any one ever see a horse wrangler who was not looking for missing stock ? When skirting the timber he surprised or was surprised by a good-sized grizzly , which promptly chased him downward and homeward , and evidently for a short distance was well up in the race . Gathering from his description that the bear had been at work on the carcass of a steer that had died from eating poison weed , I determined to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added to the score . It did not take long to pick out an ideal camping spot , well sheltered , with plenty of dry wood , and trout from the little stream almost jumping into the frying-pan . Our horses had been having pretty rough times lately , and they lost no time in storing away as much of the rich grass as they could hold . They had plenty of society , too , for the slope was dotted here and there with bunches of range cattle and bands of horses , not to mention the recent additions to the families of each in the shape of frolicsome calves and frisky foals , all busily at work . Bruin seemed rather out of place in such a pastoral scene , and yet , as one looked higher beyond the sombre heights of the forest toward the frowning crown rock that resembled some mighty fortress forbidding further progress , or the everlasting snow-peaks above , one could well fancy that wild animals must be up there somewhere , either in the dense woods , or in the still higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found the carcasses of two steers , one of which was untouched , but the other was very nearly devoured . All the signs pointed to more than one bear , and the ground was fairly padded down round the carcass they were using . IJnfortunately , though , there seemed to be no place to watch from , not a bush or rock to screen one while awaiting a shot . To cut a long story short , I watched that bait every afternoon and evening for a week , and though it was visited every night I never got a sight of the prowlers . Bear will very often , when going to a carcass , take the same trail , but when leaving wander off in almost any direction . Taking advantage of this , and being satisfied that they were up in the timber through the day , we hunted for their trail and found it on an old wood road that led through the timber . To make sure we placed the hind quarters of one of the steers just on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it and , dragging it off , carefully cached it ; so we determined to watch here . I was much disappointed , however , as the daylight faded , to confess that if I was to get a shot it would have to be in the dark ; so as soon as I found I could not see to shoot with any degree of safety , I got up in a pine-tree that commanded the road and was just over the bait . It was weary work watching , and to make it still more uncomfortable a heavy thunder-storm swept by , first pelting one with hail , then a deluge of rain and snow . It was pitch dark , except when the black recesses of the forest seemed to be rent asunder during the vivid lightning . The whole effect was weird and uncanny , and I wished myself back under my soft , warm blankets . I could not well repress thinking of the early admonition of , " never go under a tree during a thunder - storm . " But what 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involuntary tightening of the muscles that strongly gripped the rifle . I seemed to feel , rather than see , the presence of three strange objects that appeared to have sprung from the ground under me . I had not heard a sound ; not a twig had snapped , and yet , as I strained my // eyes to penetrate the gloom , there , right at my feet , almost touching them , in fact , I made out the indistinct forms of three bear all standing on their hind legs . Oh , what a chance it was if it had not been so dark ! I could not even see the end of my rifle , but I knew I could hit them , they were so close . But to hit fatally ? Well , there is no use thinking about it now the bear are here . Trust to luck and shoot ! Hardly daring to breathe , I fired ; the scuffling on the ground and the short , sharp snorting told me I had not missed ; but I could see nothing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growling angrily . Presently there was quiet , and then with angry furious champing of jaws the wounded animal charged back directly under me ; but I could not see to shoot again , worse luck . From sundry sou*ids , I gathered the bear was not far off , but had lain down in a thicket which was about one hundred yards from my tree . I could hear an occasional growl and the snap of dead branches , broken as she turned uneasily . I did not know exactly what to do . To descend was awkward , and to stay where I was , wet and chilled to the bone , seemed impossible . It was most unlikely the other bear would come back ; however , thinking it would be prudent to stay aloft a little while longer , I made up my mind to stick it out another half hour . During this wait I fancied I could see shadowy forms moving about , and I could surely hear a cub squalling . The light was now a little better , and though still very dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up courage to descend another bear came up under the tree and reared up . This time I made no mistake , and almost simultaneously with the rifle 's report a hoarse bawl proved to me that I had conquered . Glad at almost any cost to get out of my cramped position I sung out to Woody to lend a hand , as I proposed descending , and as he came up I came down , and then we discussed the situation . The proximity of the wounded bear was not pleasant , but then the dead one must be opened in order to save the skin . But what if the latter were not dead ? Hang this night work , why ca n't the bear stick to daylight ! But to work ; there was the motionless form to be operated on . Inch by inch we crept up with our rifles at full cock stuck out ahead of us until they gently touched the inanimate mass . It was all right , for the bear was stone dead . Hastily feeling in the dark , as neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both dropped our knives and made for the open . . . . It makes me perspire even now when I think of that midnight stampede from an enraged and wounded grizzly.
