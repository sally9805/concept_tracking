txt Representatives of the City Club have been overhauling the records of the Bureau of Elections at the Police Headquarters to find how far the Inspectors and poll clerks at the last election failed or neglected to perform their duties properly . Under the law they are not entitled to their pay until the Police Commissioners certify to the Controller that they have " fully complied with all requirements of law relating to their offices and duties . " Hundreds of cases have been found of failure to comply with the requirements of the law on the days of registration and in the conduct of the election . Some of these indicate negligence and carelessness , but others furnish evidence of ignorance and incapacity . It is said that something like 2,000 election officers are liable to lose their pay if the law is strictly applied , and it ought to be so applied , as a warning not only to election officers hereafter , but to those who are responsible for their appointment . Incompetency and dishonesty in election officers has been a crying evil under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that system , and it might have been as great or even greater under any other . But the representatives on election boards for each party are appointed from lists furnished by party committees , and these committees appear to have given little attention to the competency of their candidates . These places pay $6 for each of the four days of registration and $12 for the day of election , and they seem to have been used to enable the small fry of political workers to get a little compensation from the public for party services . There . are several thousand of them , and the Police Board can not inquire very closely into the fitness of those who are vouched for by the committees . The only way to make the committees more careful Seems to be to refuse payment to the Inspectors and clerks who do not perform their duties properly , and for that the law specifically provides .
