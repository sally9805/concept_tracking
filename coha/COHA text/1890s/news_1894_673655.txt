The correspondent of The New-York Times is informed , however , by a Newport lawyer , that no such law as that talked of , to hold the authors and not the publications responsible , could be had at the hands of the Rhode Island Legislature . This lawyer also said that the existing libel laws here covered all the ground necessary , but made the newspapers alone responsible .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
