txt News reached here to-day of a murder in the Chickasaw Nation near Purcell a few days ago . Two cowboys while hunting cattle in the Washita bottom discovered a covered wagon standing in a ravine with four bodies near it . One was that of a man probably sixty years old , another that of an old woman , while the other two were a young woman , twenty years of age , and a little girl some ten years old . Wolves had evidently visited the spot since the murder , for the bodies Were mangled and the olothing was torn in shreds . All the victims had been shot , the old man having throe bullet holes in him , one in his cheek , another in his right lung , and a third in his abdomen . The old lady , probably the wire and mother , had been shot through the temple . while the older daughter had been shot through the back of the head and the little child was shot iu the mouth . Robbery was the object , as everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near by on the ground . The discoverers examined the wagon . and goods that were lying around very closely in hopes of ending some evidence that would lead to the identity of the murdered family , but failed to bud any evidence whatever . They took a spade which they found in the feed-bOx at the rear of the wagon , and dug four shallow graves and placed the bodies in them , in order to keep wild beasts from further molesting them . It was evident that the bodies had been dead for several days . The young men then went to Purcell and reported their discovery to a Deputy Marshal , who afterward started for the scene of the murder with a posse to make a thorough investigation of the affair . Those murdered , it is believed , composed a family moving from North Texas to Oklahoma , and met their fate at the hands of desperadoes who inhabit that region of country .
