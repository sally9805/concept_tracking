txt MUCH has been said by optimists concerning the many advantages which arise from the simple but most exceptional fact that , while all other substances contract , water expands in passing from the fluid to the solid state . The consequences of this peculiarity are indeed not overstated by those VOL . XJJ. - 19 who take an excessively pleasant view of man 's relations to the world about him , for the simple reason that it is not easy to exaggerate the beneficial effects which arise from them . If water did not depart from the general law that substances occupy less space in their solid than in their liquid form , the ice on // our seas and lakes would , as fast as it formed , sink to the bottom , so that all the oceans and other water-basins in high latitudes would normally be frozen to their floors , except when the summer 's heat had melted a thin layer next the surface .

These icemasses not only endanger vessels , but they chill the waters of the sea in such a measure that , by the cold and misty air which sweeps thence upon the land , extensive regions , like the island of Newfoundland , are made unfit for agriculture .

To understand the conditions which lead to the existence , even in midsummer , of floating islands of ice within the warm northward-setting waters of the Gulf Stream , it is necessary for us to consider many facts concerning the natural history of ice , and the physical condition of the regions from which these bergs are derived , as well as that of the districts through which they View at a Part at the Coaat of Greenland .

The biography of an iceberg brings us in contact with the frozen regions about the poles , and with the marvellous ocean currents which transport the tropical waters to those regions , and with those other streams which send , in return , waters of nearly freezing temperatnre down toward the equator . The simpler phenomena of freezing and frozen water , which we shall incidentally have to consider , are attractive parts of the science of physics , for the reason that they are easily comprehended and are well illustrated by familiar and personal experiences . The ice which travels from the Arctic regions toward the equator consists of two very different kinds of masses ; the difference being so plain that they are invariably recognized by all observers ; in part they are made up of flat or tabular masses , which seldom if ever have a thickness of more than one hundred feet even before they have begnn their journey to lower latitudes . Though limited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed , often have a great horizontal extension . Near the southern extremity of Greenland they often have an area which is to be measured by square miles . Though interesting , these floes have less economic or geogr hic importance than the group of . true icebergs , for the reason that they do not journey so far from their point of origin , and rarely come into the ordinary paths of commerce . The true icebergs differ from the icefloes in that they are vastly thicker and do not have the same table-like tops , but are serrate at their summits . It is impossible to determine by actual measurement the depth of the ice in the true berg , but we know from the specific gravity of frozen water that only about one-seventh to one-ninth of their mass rises above the level of the sea , and we can safely infer from the extent of the emerged portion that their bases are often two or three thousand feet below the surface of the ocean . This estimate , though it does not need confirmation , is fairly proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run aground in water of this depth .

DELORME. // These great variations in the proportions of bergs and floes afford a fair presumption that there is some essential difference in the origin of these two classes of ice-islands . A glance at the processes by which ice is made in high latitudes will show us that this hypothesis is amply justified . When the Arctic explorers or the whalers make their way to the fringe of small settlements which lie upon the western margin of Greenland  --  the only part of that vast area which is ever indeed green-they usually begin to encounter the floe - ice , and as they go northward it increases in thickness and in the extent to which it obstructs the surface of the sea , so that the ships are compelled to creep through the rifts between the ice-fields , the narrow lanes of water which , now opening , now closing , afford most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the western shoulder of Greenland and Grinnell Island narrow the passage which leads into the Arctic Sea , the ice is so firmly held together that it has never been found sufficiently fissured to afford room for the passage of the smallest boats . Thence on to the long - sought , but apparently inaccessible Pole , the sea is covered with a connected sheet of ice , the upper surface of which is exceedingly rough and hummocky , so that it is impassable for sledges . The vast region covered by this sheet of floe-ice , which probably has a depth of one hundred feet or more , has been termed the Pakeocrystic Sea , or the Sea of Ancient Ice . It is clear that its envelope of frozen water is but a more consolidated area of sheet or floe accumulations-in other regards exactly like the fields which float out of Davis Strait and move down the coast of Labrador until they invade the Straits of Belle Isle , and through this channel penetrate into the Gulf of St. Lawrence or crowd into the inlets of northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floe-ice is as follows , viz. In the long winter of high latitudes the surface of the sea , wherever it is not affected by View on the Coast of Greenland . // the warm waters of the south , freezes so that a considerable depth of ice is made . A single winter will often accumulate it to a thickness of ten feet or more . In the short summer this ice only in part melts away and the next season adds still more to it . When the sheet breaks up into separate fields , these masses , often square miles in area , are set in motion by the tidal currents or the strong winds ; they collide with each other and with the shore , and by these accidents the cakes of ice are shoved over and under each other , thus thickening the floes in a very rapid manner , for as soon as these cakes of ice come to rest in their new position they are soldered together so that the floe is a solid mass which may drift away for great distances in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . So massive are they , indeed , and so vast in number and area , that but for the nature of the current systems of the North Atlantic , they might greatly embarrass the main line of ship travel between the northern parts of Europe and those of the northern United States and Canada ; but the direction . of their southward migration is , as we shall now note , greatly affected by the ocean currents . All the superficial parts of the western Atlantic , except the portion of its area next the coast of America , are pervaded by a slow movement which sets the water toward the Poles . This current is due to the Gulf Stream , which , emerging from the tropics as a deep , narrow , swift-moving tide skirts the southern coast of the United States , gradually widens like an opened fan , diminishing in depth and losing its velocity as it comes toward the Arctic Circle . Although the speed of its northward going is here slight , it has sufficient energy to push back the floe-ice which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its excursions to the American shore . Setting out into the Atlantic from Davis Strait , there is , however , a strong stream of Arctic water , which in part slips under the Gulf Stream tide , and in part flows on the surface of the sea next the Labrador coast . In this southwardsetting current the floe-ice drifts with a speed of about a mile an hour down the American shore nntil it attains the mouth of the St. Lawrence .

If Newfoundland and Nova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly straight shore from Greenland to Massachusetts Bay , it is likely that these floes would in large quantities attain to the coast of New England , and give to the shore lands of that part of the continent the sub-Arctic and inhospitable climate of the islands of the eastern St. Lawrence . This shore-current bears few true icebergs with the floe-ice , for the reason , as we shall see more clearly hereafter , that these greater ice-islands are formed altogether on the Greenland shores , and , pressed to the eastward by the prevailing winds , do not come into that superficial , shore-skirting , Labrador current . Moreover , any stray bergs that may find their way against this margin of the mainland are almost certain to take the ground in the shallows over which the current passes and so be arrested in their journey . The character of the ice-floes , as well as the steadfastness of their southward journeys , are well shown by the singular experiences of a part of the crew of the exploring ship Polaris , who , in 1872 , were forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship was in close quarters in the ice-pack of Baffin 's Bay , and was pinched between the floes with ev*ry prospect of being crushed like an egg-shell between the moving masses ; the crew , with supplies of provisions and boats , were encamped , in two separate parties , on the ice near the distressed vesseL A sudden change in the movements of the ice caused the floes to separate , and one of the parties was swiftly borne away from the ship , which , indeed , they thought had sunk from the strains she had received in the squeezing between the packs of ice . The forlorn party , consisting of a score of sailors , several Esquimaux men , two women , and several children of that people , drifted away to the southward , and for the time between October 15th and April 29th found refuge in the floe - ice , and were carried onward toward the open Atlantic . As they came into the wider VOL . XJL-20 waters the waves swept over the flat surface of the ice and broke the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extent , so that they had from time to time to select a new refuge . Their sufferings were considerable , but with the courage and hopefulness characteristic of our sailors , they undaunk edly met their difficulties , each dutifully caring for the other , so that when rescued by a passing ship every member of the party was alive . The chronicle of this wonderful adventure is one of the most picturesque stories of bitter experience and fortitude which the literature of Arctic adventure affords . In the regions about the Southern Pole , because of the vast area of ice which is gathered there , the climate in summer is much less calculated to melt ice than in the region about Greenland . The extension of this ice-cap is caused by the failure of the warm currents from the tropics to attain the Antarctic Circle ; this is brought about by the absence of any distinct land-bounded pathway of the waters , as exists in the North Atlantic lands , which , in a way , serves to confine the Gulf Stream and lead it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are diverted toward the Antarctic Sea , are less strong than those which flow northwardly from the equatorial parts of the oceans . Owing to the frigid condition of the summer climate of the southern ice-district , and the absence of warm water to melt the ice , the floes of that region are thicker and form more extended fields than those with which explorations of the Greenland district have made us acquainted . Fortunately there are in the Antarctic district no such strong currents as those which sweep down the shores of Labrador to convey these packs of ice to the parts of the sea which are most traversed by shipping ; they are only encountered by the whalers or the rare explorers who have attained to these lonely waters of the far southern seas . We have now completed our general account of the simpler and least important of the groups of floating ice-fields . We have next to examine into the processes which lead to the formation of the far grander masses , the true icebergs. // We have already noted the fact that icebergs differ from floes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also characteristic of them that they are composed of a dark blue variety of ice , which is generally much more solid than that of the floes . The berg-ice has also the peculiar feature that it tends to rift in a vertical direction , which gives their crests the striking and beautiful outlines so characteristic of them where they have been much decayed by long exposure to the warm air of the region of the sea to which they attain near the end of their journeys . To understand these peculiar features it is again necessary for us to consider the regions where these ice-masses are formed . It is now well known that all true bergs - and in this class are included all the floating masses which find their way down to the line now followed by the transatlantic steamershave their origin in the glaciers of high latitudes . Those which beset the pathway of ships moving from Europe to America are all cradled in Greenland . All the lands north and west of Spitzbergen are more or less occupied by fields of perpetual snow , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its forward movement crowded into pure translucent ice ; all the little cavities containing vesicles of air , which gives to snow or powdered ice its white color , become closed as the air escapes in the onward journey of the stream . In more southern climes , as in Norway and Switzerland , these glaciers in their descent meet a climate sufficiently warm to melt them away before they attain the level of the sea ; but in the greater part of the lands within the Arctic Circle there is an annual average temperature below the freezing-point , so that any glacier which is formed moves on until it thrusts its extremity into the sea . For a time after the slow- moving stream of ice enters the ocean waters , its height causes it to continue to rest on the bottom ; but when it penetrates to a certain depth of the sea , a depth depending on the thickness of the icesheet , the buoying action brought about by the relative lightness of the ice tends to lift it from the bed over which it has ploughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the movements of the glaciers themselves clearly show , is very brittle to any cross strain , such as this tendency to float imposes , the extremity of the ice-stream is continually broken away , forming detachable masses . The resistance of the ice to fracture causes the projecting extremity of the glacier to hold together for a little distance beyond the point where the weight of the mass alone would hold it upon the bottom . When the berg separates from the parent mass the rupture is attended by a violent movement , often causing a loud thundering noise which may be heard for many miles . The rebound of the newly freed mass from the bottom and the firm-set glacier whence it came , causes it to swing violently , so that it sends great waves sweeping from its base out into the sea , which , though on a larger scale , are like those produced when a ship is launched . The Esquimaux are so familiar with this process of separating bergs from the land-ice that when they hear the roar which it causes they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its young . By this savage description they seem to indicate , in the manner common to primitive peoples , their sense of the activity which exists in the glacial streams as well as that perception of life in nature which , though a common feature with uncivilized people , disappears with the advance in culture . Greenland is the great source whence the icebergs of the North Atlantic are " calved , " and the physical conditions of the country make it admirably fitted to be the breeding-place for those monsters of the deep . Until very recently our knowledge of this country was limited to the southern extremity of the island and the narrow strip along the western shore , where there are a few villages which are visible from a ship 's deck . The eastern shore is so blocked by floe-ice that few mariners have seen the mainland for more than a hundred miles beyond its southernmost part . It has long been known , however , that along the whole coast-line the glaciers descend to the heads of the inlets or fords which plen // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west the ice-streams are so deep and massive that they override the whole marginal portion of the country , hiding its irregularities in the vast sheet of the glacier , which sweeps into the sea until it attains a depth where the ice breaks off and floats away in the form of icebergs . The greatest of these ice - fronts , that of the Humboldt Glacier , faces the water in the upper part of Baffin 's Bay with a continuous precipice of ice , having a length of about fifty miles . So far as is yet known , this is the greatest of the Greenland berg factories , but it is possible that even greater protrusions of the central glacial field may occur on the eastern coast . There has long been much natural curiosity concerning the aspect of the interior district of Greenland , for naturalists have felt that we should there secure much valuable information concerning the conditions which existed during the glacial period over a larger part of northern Europe and North America . Many travellers have ascended the ice-streams for a little distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IRecently some bold travellers , properly equipped for travelling over the ice , made their way to the eastern shore of Greenland , and started on a hazardous journey with the western shore for their destination . After passing for some miles over a portion of the glacier , which was much broken by crevasses-due probably to the existence of irregularities in the floor of rock over which it was movingthey gradually ascended until they came upon a vast , unbroken surface of ice , which was apparently as level as a frozen sea , and which stretched away beyond the field of vision . This portion of the continental glacier , the first ever seen by civilized man , rose gently until , by the barometers , it apparently attained a height of about a mile above the sea . Theifee it declined with a grade so slight as to be invisible to the eye until near the western shore , when it descended more steeply , and was broken by rifts , as the travellers found it at the outset of their journey . This vast arch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow belt next the shore , mainly on the southern and western coasts , where the higher land is now left bare . It would be most interesting to consider the general conditions of this wonderful glacier , with reference to the state of affairs during the last frozen period , for there can be little doubt that we have in the region beheld by these hardy explorers a very true picture of a continental ice-sheet ; but for our immediate purpose we need only to note the immense extent of this ice - field , its great depth , and the speed with which it moves from the interior toward the sea . So far we have but imperfect data concerning the rate at which the high northern glacier passes from the land into the sea ; but it is clear that the movement is much more rapid than in the case of the relatively small icestreams of the Alps . In the valley glaciers of Switzerland , Norway , or the Himalayas , the speed of the flow does not exceed on the average more than three feet per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts on the average to more than thirty feet per day ; that is a strip about half a mile wide would be fed into the sea in the short summer season , and if the flow was maintained during the whole year , there would be a field nearly two miles wide discharged as floating ice along the whole front of the streams which attain the sea . There is no satisfactory basis on which to estimate the linear extent of the glacial front on the Greenland shore , but it is probably not less than two hundred and fifty miles . If this be the size , we may reckon that somewhere near five hundred square miles of icebergs is each year set afloat along the shores of the island . Supposing tiu*t the original area of these masses was one - fourth of a square mile , this supply would provide for a yearly fleet of two thousand bergs , from which throng the ice which our Atlantic ships encounter is derived . The history of these bergs , after they have become separated from their parent glaciers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that a large part of them never attain to any considerable distance from the shores from which // they were discharged . Those which are launched in the inlets are apt to be retained by the shores and melt before they escape to the sea ; of those which start on their journey many become stranded on the shallows , and break into small pieces , so that they are rapidly melted ; yet others , including probably nearly all which are formed on the eastern shore of Greenland , are retained near their place of origin by the action of the wind and the marine currents . It does not seem likely that more than one or two hundred large icebergs make their way each year in the only practicable path that can take them beyond the Arctic Circle-that which is afforded by the current which sets out of Davis Strait , and down the Labrador shore , and then eastward into the Atlantic . Although we have as yet but little decided information concerning this ocean-stream , save that afforded by the movements of the berg and floe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these wandering fragments from the vast Greenland glaciers . Though somewhat inconstant , this current is a tolerably steady stream , setting south through the wide channel which separates the shores of Greenland from those of the many islands which beset the northeast coast of the American continent . By this southward-moving water the ice is propelled out into the open sea . The stream continues to the south , but widens and diminishes in the energy of its flow . It shortly comes in contact with the Gulf Stream , which it somewhat affects , and by which it is much affected . As we have already noticed , a part of the southward-setting current passes down along the shore of Labrador as a superficial stream of no great width or speed . Another , and perhaps the larger part , flows beneath the Gulf Stream , and in time joins the great , slow-moving procession of Arctic waters which , following the bottom of the deeper sea , in the end attain the equatorial district . For a considerable distance southeast of Greenland there are thus two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southwardly , and an upper , or superficial stratum , creeping toward the north . The thin floe - ice , floating altogether within a hundred feet of the surface , is beaten back against the Labrador shore by the surface stream ; but the icebergs , because of their greater depth , are driven forward by the under-current in a southwardly direction . Owing to this peculiarity we sometimes may observe the bergs ploughing their way through vast fields of floe-ice as steadfastly as a steamship when it breaks its way in the new-formed ice of a harbor . This southward journey of the bergs is facilitated by the action of the prevailing winds , which , in this region , in the spring and summer , often blow with great energy from the northwest . A berg one hundred feet high and a mile long spreads a vast surface to these winds , and is slowly but effectually impelled by them in the manner of a sailing ship . From the time the berg is launched into the sea it is constantly wasting ; unlike the floe-ice , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of its depth , which brings the greater part of the mass into water above the freezing-point , steadfastly diminishes in volume ; the little ice-sheet which may form around the water-line does not affect the size of the mass , yet this process of melting goes on but slowly . In the first part of its journey it is always in water which is at about the freezing-point . Most persons are familiar with the fact that cakes of ice will float for a long time in very cold water , and can thus imagine that icebergs may journey a long way in the Arctic seas with but little loss in bulk . It is when they come in contact with the waters of the Gulf Stream that the dissolving process begins to go on in a rapid manner . The under-running cold current , which moves southward toward the central parts of the Atlantic , seizing on the great surface of the bergs which extends downward - it may be to one or two thousand feet below the surface of the sea-urges these masses of ice against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they go to the south the energy of the impelling stream constantly diminishes , for the reason that the flow from the Arctic , no longer confined within the channel between Greenland and the // mainland of North America , slackens , while with each stage of the movement - &gt; of the bergs toward the equator the strength of the Gulf Stream flow becomes augmented . In this way it comes about that , in the latitude of the Newfoundland banks , or shoals , the floating masses attain a position where there is a balance between the effects of the diverse currents , and , as a result of this , the icebergs lie idly in the sea or drift about in the varying winds until they melt away . The bergs from the North Atlantic nursery of ice , from the glaciers of southern and western Greenland , have their limit of migration set by this curious equation of the currents which prevail in these waters . If the southward-setting current were as strong in that region as it is on the west coast of North America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not attain too near the tropics ; as it is , they are rarely if ever found much south of the Newfoundland banks or much east of the meridian . There are reports that in certain rare instances considerable bergs have been seen nearly as far west as the mouth of the Bay of Fundy and as far south and east as the Azores , but these stories lack verification and may be only sailors ' yarns ; if true , it is probably to be explained by the fact that in a period of long-continued and strong northwesterly winds any deep bergs , which on account of their depth projected high above the water , were urged far to the southward and eastward of their normal course . Allowing for such rare accidents , the fact remains that the icebergs of the North Atlantic have their southward and eastward extension determined with admirable accuracy , and in a way to show the observer how beautifully the physical conditions are adjusted in the waters of that tumultuous sea . The fact that icebergs can maintain themselves so long when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of the superficial portions of the sea , and the deeper portions of their masses in a fluid which is a little above the point where ice melts , is due to certain circumstances which we shall now have to note with some care . The icebergs , as they slowly melt , chill the water about them to very near the freezing - point . This very cold state extends , in the case of large masses , to the distance of some miles from the face of the ice - cliffs . Next the berg the temperature is always but a shade above that of a vessel in which there is just enough water to float fragments ? of ice . Only a very small part of this cooled portion of the sea is derived from the melting berg ; in the main it consists of that portion of the ocean which has been deprived of its heat by the contact with the glacial mass . Here we must consider the fact that the process of melting ice calls for a great deal of heat . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over a regulated fire , as , for instance , that of a gas-flame , we observe that it requires a much longer time to melt the mass than it would to bring an equal amount of icecold water to near the boiling - point . If we conduct the experiment in a more careful way , we may easily determine that , starting with a block of ice at a temperature just a fraction of a degree below the freezing-point , it takes more units of heat to bring it to a point where it becomes molten than is necessary to raise its temperature after it is molten to 740 F. This heat , which the water hides away in the process of melting , is so great that it much affects not only the history of icebergs , but all the phenomena of the seasons in countries where a thick envelope of snow gathers during the winter season . It is this peculiar absorption of heat which makes it so difficult for the warm sun of spring to clear away the frostwork of winter and to fit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the icebergs the process of their melting requires that some cubic miles of the relatively warm ocean waters , having a temperature of , say 500 F. , shall come in contact with the ice before an ordinary berg will be dissolved . As long as the icebergs are rapidly pushed forward by the action of the undercurrent which urges them through the superficial layer of warm water , the portions of their masses which are exposed to the northward-setting stream // rapidly melt , because they are by their motion ever brought into contact with fresh fields of warm water , the cold portion of the ocean which they have chilled being left behind . But , as we have already noticed , the rate of this motion steadfastly decreases until they finally cease to travel over the surface , and meet only such water as the winds or the gentle northward - setting current sends against them . In a certain measure they provide by their own action for a slight current movement which promotes their melting . The water next their sides , being chilled by contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surrounding sea , and so tends to sink into the depths , its place being taken by the warmer fluid which flows in over the surface . If water became continuously heavier as it cooled , all the way down to the freezing - point , this action would be much more effective than it is ; but among the many extraordinary features of this substance we have to note that it is the densest at about 390 F. , expanding a little if the heat is decreased below that temperature . Consequently this circulatory movement just described is not strong . The protection of the bergs from melting is also promoted by the fleetlike manner in which they occupy large areas of the sea . They are generally found in troops , which may number scores , or even hundreds , of separate masses ; the result is that vast areas of the ocean have their superficial waters so cooled down by the southernmost individual bergs that the greater part of the group have little chance to come in contact with warm water ; it is only slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more northern masses are exposed to a temperature high enough to affect them in any considerable measure . In much the same way the aggregation of the icebergs hinders the air from affecting them by its warmth ; the atmosphere is chilled by the cold sea and the ice with which it comes in contact , and the result is that thick fogs are formed , which send off the rays of the sun and convert the regions about the bergs into a natural ice-house well fitted to preserve them from the effects of the more southern realm into which they have journeyed . In fact , a fleet of icebergs takes its native climate with it as it goes ; it is enveloped by conditions of its own making as perfectly as if they were designed for the end which they attain . The effect of the close order , which is such a common feature of the berg fleet , is so important in their history that we must consider the way in which it is brought about . As is easily seen , the cause is found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the winter the region about the West Greenland glaciers is occupied by a sheet of floe-ice strong enough to retain the icebergs against their native shores . Only for a brief period in summer , in all perhaps , on the average , less than four months , is the water open . enough to prevent their escape into the wide part of the Atlantic Ocean . When the summer unlocks these Arctic gates the vast assemblage of ice-floes and the imprisoned squadrons of bergs from the several glaciers which have accumulated in the sea during the enduring frost , pour forth into the more southern part of the ocean . Then they become separated  --  the bergs impelled by the deeper current set forth upon their long cruise toward the mid-Atlantic , while the floes follow the surface stream adown the coast of Labrador ; the former to wander , it may be , for years ; the latter to vanish in the heat of a single summer . In the process of destruction which a berg goes through , its decay is aided by the frequent overturns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glacial streams , unlike that made in the ordinary way , is moulded into shape under the great strains to which it is subjected in its journey over the surface of the earth . These strains are not all productive of movement , but remain as tensions , much like those which we find in unannealed glass , giving the mass a tendency to fly into pieces . Moreover , glacial ice is peculiar in that it is always penetrated by numerous rifts or imperfectly closed fissures , which accelerate its breaking whenever it is. violently disturbed . Owing to the more or less irregular melting // which goes on upon the outside of a berg , its centre of gravity gradually changes , so that from time to time it rolls over in the sea . Such accidents are not infrequently observed by Arctic explorers and whalers who haunt the waters where these ice-fields most abound . As may be imagined , when one of these vast masses somersaults , every part of it is subjected to violent stresses which would rack much more solid structures , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea a like trial of their strength occurs . In fact , when either of these accidents happen , the berg often flies into pieces almost as does a Prince Rupert drop of quickly cooled glass when it is treated with any violence . Even when sailing in a quiet sea the innate tensions of the ice , increased it may be by the changes of temperature to which it has been subjected since it parted from the parent glacier , now and then cause large fragments to fly from the steep cliffs , to float as satellites of the mass until they melt away . The processes of decay acting on the summit of the icebergs reveal in the melting forms the existence of incipient rifts in their masses . Unlike the surface of ordinary ice-sheets , which commonly melt down evenly , the berg top is made up of irregular pinnacles and chasms , which in the later stage of its existence may take on forms of the utmost variety . The picturesqueness of these floating islands of the north is in large measure due to the exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our day , who recognize the striking effects which may be produced in edifices by means of pediments and pinnacles , might win suggestions from a study of these fantastic structures . These indentations of the iceberg top are produced by the same abundant planes of weakness which cause the mass so readily to rend asunder whenever subjected to strains such as may arise from the causes we have considered . The warmth and rain penetrating into these crevices eat the ice away while the less weakened parts remain intact . In the case of many bergs , even when they have been long afloat , the top is not much indented , for the reason that the frequent changes of position have not given the ice time to be affected by exposure to the air . In the southern hemisphere icebergs are limited to the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific , and to the waters of very high latitudes within the Arctic Circle . They are practically unknown in the North Pacific , for the reason that the only glaciers which attain the sea in that region , those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only send afloat small masses of ice , and these being imprisoned in deep bays do not attain the open sea . In the Antarctic region the little known islands about the South Pole are the nursery of more numerous bergs than are formed within the Arctic Circle . The currents setting from these southern circumpolar lands toward the equator are much less energetic than those which bear the Greenland floods to the open sea , consequently the parts of these waters frequented by ships are not so affected by the ice invasions as are the invasions lying between North America and Europe . The only point where the south polar bergs come upon a travelled ship-route is on the western side of Cape Horn . In this field these wanderers infest a portion of the way of vessels which have rounded the South American cape , but they are on the whole much less numerous and less dangerous to navigation than those of the North Atlantic . It is a peculiarity of these southern ice-masses that they are much larger than those observed in the North Atlantic field . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the region about the South Pole , and to the correlative fact that the process of melting goes on more slowly in that region than in the Arctic district . We turn now to consider those parts of the geheral effects of floating ice which may be supposed to have an interest for the reader . First among these we must reckon the influence they exercise on the climatal conditions of the countries bordering on their paths . In the case of the floes and icebergs which are borne southward by the Labrador currents the effect // must be considerable ; they perceptibly cool the sea over a large area , depriving a considerable part of its waters of the warmth which their current would otherwise carry to northern Europe . If we could confine these wanderers from the icy realm within the regions where they are formed , the effect on the temperature of northern Europe would be noteworthy and even of economic importance . Their general influence is to disseminate Arctic conditions over a wide area of the more southern regions , where the climate tends through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth . The climate of the northeastern part of North America would probably be distinctly warmer but for the chilling of the neighboring sea which the abunJant ice induces . So , too , with the southern part of South America ; the climate which now renders the country in good part unfit for agriculture would be much more tolerable but for the influence of the vast amount of ice from the Antarctic Sea which floats near to its shores . Though not of great importance in terrestrial conditions , icebergs must be reckoned as a factor with which the meteorologists of the future will have to deaL In forecasting of the weather conditions not only of the seas where they occur , but also of the neighboring lands , it will be necessary to take account of the migrations of these wanderers from the polar region , and to estimate their effects upon the heat and moisture of those districts . To the student of the geological processes which are now going on upon the earth , icebergs , and ice-floes as well , will afford most interesting subjects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea and land , and thus indirectly influence the conditions of the life they bear , but they exert certain curious direct effects upon the distribution of organic species and in the carriage of sediments . We will first note the action of these floating ice-fields in carrying animals from one region to another . It is the habit of the animals of high latitudes , particularly the polar bears , to seek the margin of the sea for the food they may obtain from its waters . The bears indeed win in winter their entire subsistence from this source of supply ; even in summer they obtain little else than what the ocean affords them . Prowling along the shore and swimming far in its waters , with occasional rests on the floating ice-islands , it frequently happens that they are borne away to sea on these rafts . In most cases these creatures starve to death or are drowned when their supports melt away ; but it sometimes happens that the wandering ice conveys them to some other land . Grounding in the shallow water next the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may win the shore and proceed to multiply in their new - found home . From time to time the polar bear is thus conveyed from Greenland to Iceland , on which island it is not indigenous . The people of this Arctic realm are compelled to exterminate the invaders lest they should destroy their cattle and ravage their fields . As the icebergs are derived from glaciers they commonly carry a great deal of rocky matter torn from the surface over which they have found their way . The bottom portion of any thick glacier is commonly filled , sometimes to the depth of a hundred feet or more , with this fractured stone , varying in size from grains of mud or sand to blocks the size of a small house . When the icebergs float away from the land they bear the mass of debris with them on their journey , it may be for a great distance from their birthplace . If the berg remains for a long time in the position in which it entered the sea a relatively slight amount of melting will release the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit by bit , into the sea-floors in the paths of the wandering ice ; but as it often happens that the berg is turned upside down before it has attained any great distance from its point of origin , in this position the waste from the land will remain afloat until the ice again capsizes or melts away , when it will be tumbled into a heap on the ocean bottom . In this way a very large amount of the land waste torn from the bed rocks by the action of the glaciers is distributed far and wide over the surface , where new // strata are constantly accumulating . The number of icebergs delivered to the open sea in the summer season , of either pole , must amount to many thousands . It will be probably safe to estimate the aggregate area of this floating glacial material as not less than five hundred square miles in surface . It will also be reasonable to reckon that the dJbris from the circumpolar lands contained in these bergs is sufficient to form a layer not less than one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this basis we find that in one thousand years the sea-floor , over an area of one million square miles , might receive a contribution of debris having a mean depth of six inches . Although these reckonings are to be taken only as probable , or perhaps possible , estimates , it is evident from them that the land areas about the poles are rapidly wearing away , and that their waste is being deposited with extreme rapidity upon the floors of the oceans in high latitudes . While the massive icebergs are carrying on this singular work of depositing the waste of the circumpolar regions on the wide fields of the oceans , the icefloes are doing a similar , and perhaps equally important , work in conveying the detritus from the shallow waters next the shore out to sea and along the coast lines in considerable though less extended journeys . In the winter season , when the floe-ice forms or thickens in the shore-packs which beset the lands in high latitudes , the stones and other movable detritus of the coast-line becomes frozen into the sheets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafted for some distance , and finally , but more speedily than in the case of the materials conveyed by bergs , are dropped upon the bottom . The carriage is for a less distance , because the floe-ice , being thin , survives for a less time in the sea-water . The immediate effect of this action is to rob the shoreline of the debris which the waves have plucked from the cliffs , and thus to hasten the wasting of the shores ; it also contributes a large amount of detritus to the ocean depths . Although this action is of most importance within the Arctic Circle , its effects are felt all along the shores where ice forms to the thickness of a foot or more , and after severe frosts floats away seaward . Its influence has long been remarked in the waters of the Baltic Sea . One of the English men-of-war which was sunk during the attack on the Danish fleet in 1807 , was visited by divers seven years after that battle ; its deck was found covered with blocks of stone which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunken ships in that part of the sea quickly become overladen by thick debris . In the occasional severe winters which occur along the New England coast as far south as Rhode Island this floe-ice makes to a thickness of three feet . Under the influence of the strong tides and winds these ice-fields are often urged against the shore , upon which they break into fragments , which are crowded by the great pressure from above and below until they form extensive ramparts which are frozen solidly together . When these masses float away they often carry with them bowlders weighing one to two tons , and drop them at a distance from the land . In their collision with the shore these fields of rock-covered ice exercise a very great disruptive force . At many points , even in southern New England , it is difficult to build piers , even of firm masonry , strong enough to withstand their assaults . The fact that these artificial constructions fail to withstand the action of this floating ice , shows how vigorous is the attack which it makes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England , especially those who have an intimate acquaintance with the districts of any particular portion of it , must have remarked the often conspicuous changes which a very frigid winter brings about in the appearance of the bowldery shores . We have then only to conceive that in the geologic ages these actions are to be multiplied by the million-fold in order to make it clear that this agent is capable of accomplishing a great deal of geologic work . In general this work is most effectively done in the embayments of the shore , for on the headlands the waves prevent the ice from forming , or keep it broken into small blocks , so that it can not seize upon the large stones ; in this way the // floe-ice serves to wear away the shores of re-entrants more than those of the headlands . Sand-beaches are but little affected by the ice which may form upon them , for the reason that the continual movement of water from the land side prevents their materials from freezing , so that they do not become entangled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important general features which floating ice presents to the geologist 's eye ; it will not be uninteresting to devote a part of this paper to the questions concerning those masses which have a more human interest , viz. , their scenographic quality and the dangers which they bring to navigators . In taking account of the place occupied by any natural phenomena , it is well to consider the effect which they produce on the aesthetic sensibilities of man . From this point of view we must give a high place to the greater icemasses of the sea , the bergs which come down from the circumpolar glaciers . There is an architectural splendor in many of the aspects of frozen water which is found in no other natural forms . Majestic as is the tumult of Niagara , the scene inexpressibly gains in sublimity when winter has framed it in an encasement of ice . The Alps and the Himalayas have a dignity which is in but small part due to the hardy forms of their rocky slopes , but is lent them by the snows of their uplands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ordinary house-roof , and the fringe of icicles pendant from its eaves , may make the most commonplace building a curiously impressive and pleasing object . There is , perhaps , no condition of frozen water in which this element of the picturesque is more pronounced than where it is exhibited in a fleet of icebergs within the regions where they have not yet been worn out by long journeys . Those who see them only in the usually traversed route between the American ports and Europe behold only the scanty relics of the vast structures which started from the Arctic Ocean months before . The charm of these floating islands consists , in part , in singularity and variety of forms , and in the beauty of coloration ; but in larger part the effect is due to the weird loneliness and lifelessness of their crags and steeps . Save for the splashing of the sea against their steep sides , or the hoarser crash of the masses which now and then tumble from the heights to the lower levels of the floating islands or into the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perfect stillness . When the floating masses are near together , as they often are in the high north , where sometimes hundreds may be seen in a day , they break the waves and make an almost cavernous stillness in the space of water between them . The impression made on the mind by a strong sea breaking against a rock-bound shore , and that of a volcano in energetic eruption , are more startling ; but it is doubtful if any of the aspects of nature , save the ever-familiar depths of the heavens , is so awe-inspiring as that exhibited by a great fleet of bergs as they come forth from the icy mountains of Greenland in their long southern voyage . One of the most notable of the manifold modern developments of interest in the external world is that which leads people to make long journeys to behold the more inspiring scenes of nature . It seems likely that in a few decades this relish for the flavor of scenery will , among cultivated people , become as well developed as that of the IRomans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this stage of our social development is attained we may expect that the fields of the icebergs will be as much visited by the seekers after the nobler aspects of nature as are the ice-streams of the Alps certainly this world has no more impressive spectacles than those afforded by the high northern seas when their vast annual fleet of bergs set forth on their journey into the broad Atlantic . Against the good which is given us in the grandeur and beauty of the icebergs we must set the grave and inevitable danger which they bring to the seafarer who has to traverse the waters where they abound . These dangers have always been great , but are more serious in this age of swift steamships than of old . Against the common perils of the sea the skill of shipmaker and // shipmaster , when at their best , can effectively guard . The ocean is so well charted that there is no island in the usual paths of commerce , hardly indeed a rock which need be approached , the position of which is not well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored and taught , that with the aid of his chronometers and sextants the navigator can often without risk almost graze these obstructions with his keel . There is no longer much to be apprehended from storms ; our abler commercial ships at least can make light of the winds which might have overwhelmed an ancient armada . Among the first class ocean-going vessels of this day only the armor-laden men-ofwar , which are indeed rather floating fortresses than ships , have any serious reason to apprehend the results of a tropical hurricane in the open sea . But all these conquests of the modern sailor depend upon the application of skill to well-ascertained facts , and the difficulty with icebergs is that their position in the sea , where they lie until they melt , is essentially anomalous . The only information which the navigator can have as to the existence of these obstacles in his path is derived in part from the reports of the shipmasters who have recently traversed the path which he is following , and in part from the conditions of the air and water about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that in about a certain field of the sea ice abounds . If he be a wary personand fortunately for the ocean travellers these men are caretaking beyond the understanding of most landsmen-he will watch the temperature of the water and attend to the conditions of the air when he comes into the suspected district . When his ship enters into a chill , foggy atmosphere he will suspect the neighborhood of ice ; if the thermometer shows that the water has suddenly lowered to near the freezing-point , he will know that he is very near icebergs . But good as these indications are , they are not unerring . Small bergs , though trifling remnants of greater masses , though they may be less in bulk than the vessel itself , are sufficient to bring about the destruction of the strongest ship that floats , if the vessel encounters them when going at a speed of fifteen knots an hour . These berglets often float to a great distance from the main fields of ice , and being small , do not affect the temperature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sometimes happens that a strong . wind will drive the air and water before it , so that there is no fog about the bergs and no very cold water on the side from which the bergs are approached . These exceptional conditions make the path of a ship , which in the night-time traverses an iceberg-laden portion of the sea , the seat of grave perils . A collision with an iceberg has certain elements of hopelessness which belong to no other calamities of the deep . Colliding with another vessel , the blow is not likely to be so severe as to damage more than one of the compartments of a ship , the others may keep her afloat . An iceberg , owing to its unyielding and massive nature , gives a much harder blow . Moreover , as the experience of the steamer Arizona showed , the fall of masses of ice from the cliffs of the berg upon the bow of the ship , is likely to add to the damage done to her forward parts . When running against another ship , or against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of refuge for the shipwrecked people , either on the shore or the deck of the other vessel ; but no more hopeless condition can be imagined than that of people who might seek a foothold on the inhospitable islands . The steep , generally overhanging , cliffs , usually deny access to their masses , and even if by chance the shipwrecked people attain the summit of the ice , they would have little chance of rescue , for no craft willingly comes near to those dangerous objects . It has been suggested that the men-of-war of the great navies should be employed in the destruction of the icebergs of the North Atlantic . According to this plan the bergs are to be bombarded with great shells , which , penetrating deep into the ice and exploding there , will shatter them to pieces . There is no doubt that this would be a far more profitable expenditure of ammunition than the uses for // which it is designed ; for any target is better than the dear-bought frame of man or the products of his skill of hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end could be attained in this way . In the first place , to accomplish the desired result , it would be necessary for the men-of-war to watch the exit of Baffin 's Bay in the spring-time , and break up the bergs into relatively small bits , so that they would no longer float with their bases in the deep southward - setting current , but would drift with the floe-ice . To do this , with several hundred great masses , averaging probably at least a thousand feet in cube , would require an enormous expenditure of money . Including the wear and tear of guns , the shells from the great modern ordnance can not be fired at a less cost than five hundred dollars for each shell , and it would probably require many hundred rounds of ammunition to break up a single berg . It would not at all serve the purpose to rend the ice to pieces in the mid-Atlantic district , for there the fragments would float about and multiply the dangers of navigation ; such work , if done , would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though from the readier melting of the ice the trouble would not endure so long . On the whole , this interesting project does not seem practicable . The only way to avoid the perils due to this berg field of the Atlantic is for ships to take a course which will lead them to the south of the tolerably wellmarked field into which the icebergs journey . The detour which it is necessary to make , even in the years when the icc-fleets are most numerous and journey the farthest south , would be but slight ; it would not add more than a day to the duration of the voyage . The fleeter scouting ships of the war marine might well be employed in reconnoitring the position of these enemies , so that their place would be well known to the merchantman . With these relatively slight precautions there is no reason why , in the century to come , when the Atlantic shipping is tenfolded in amount , this sea should not be traversed without any danger from this source . There is , perhaps , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little in the way of veritable evils as those noble remains of the circumpolar glaciers ; they have , moreover , a peculiar charm in that they are so far from the erring touch of man.
