txt Bishop Wigger of the Diocese of Newark had his official orders concerning his controversy with the Rev. Father . Killeen , rector of St. Mary 's Roman Catholic Church of Bayonne , promulgated in the Roman Catholic churches of this city this morning . The Bishop makes over his signature what many well-informed persons consider a wholesale contradiction of published reports telegraphed from Washington about the decision of Mgr . Baton ' . Bishop Wigger 's letter is construed to sustain his assertions that he is ' victorious over Father : Killeen . The letter created much excitement , and German Catholics , with those opposed to Father Killeen , are jubilant in the extreme . It is thought that the . contestants will soon fight the controversy over again in some form , provided the Bishop ha 's not fully understood Satolli 's decision or has failed to place a proper interpretation upon it . A reporter of THE NEW-YORK TIMES saw Father Ahne , rector of Bt . Henry 's , soon after his return to the rectory this morning , and secured from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had read in his church . The letter is as follows : SETON7HALL COLLEGE . sovra ORANGE . Feb. 9 , 1893.5 The Rev. Father Ahne : DEAR REVEREND SIR : Having had a conference on the matter with the Most Reverend Delegate Apostolic Archbishop Satollz . I hereby divide est . Mary 's Parish as follows : The limits of St. Mary 's will extend to St. Henry 's Church . Twenty-sixth Street . The new parish , to be called the United Churches of St. Thomas and St. Henry , will begin at St. Henry 's , Twenty-sixth Street , and thence run northward . The Rev , Father Ahne will be rector of this new parish and the congregation will w orship in St. Henry 's Church . On Sundays the rector will preach in English at the first mass and in English and German at the second , as he has done in the nest . On feast days . if the congregation so wish , the rector will , at his discretion . say mass in St. Thomas 's . St. Thomas 's will henceforth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the four classrooms which are on the first door . Please read this notice to your congregation at every mass next Sunday . I send a similar notice to the Rev. Father Killeen . With best wishes I remain , yours very sincerely . W. H. WIGGER , Bishop of Newark . N. B. ? The Bishop also promisee that in case of Father Ahne 's death or his removal to another parish , ho will appoint an English-speaking priest . W. M. W. The limit of the new parish is fixed by this letter at Twenty-sixth Street , whereas formerly Father Aline 's jurisdiction extended only to Twenty-fourth Street . This is the first point scored by the Bishop . Secondly . the Bishop makes St. Henry 's the principal church , and not St. Thomas 's , which was suddenly closed a year ago . The Washington report said that St. Thomas 's was to be the principal church . Most importatt of all , the Bishop does not order the restoration or reopening of St. Thomas's. built by Father Killeen for Englishspeaking Catholics , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sundays , as reported from Washington . It is , as the Bishop said before , to remain closed , exoepting for schools which have been open there all along . Again , the Bishop does not order all sermons and instructions delivered in St. Henry 's in English , as asserted In the Washington report , but only at the first mass and In part at the second . Judging from the orders read to-day , the Bishop is not humiliated or defeated and the German Catholics element in Bayonne is not subordinated to the English-speaking , but placed on equal terms . Father Ahne made a statement to THE NEvrYORK TIMES 'S reporter , which he said gave in substance his statement to his congregations . Said he : " Our Bishop will probably be accused of Cahensleyism , slums German will continue to be spoken in this church . Now , what is Cahensleyism I It is the earnest endeavor of Bishops and priests to keep immigrants who can not speak English from falling away from the Church by giving them instruction and exhortation that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their duty to do this . for if they do not the immigrant , by the time he has learned English , has fallen away from the Church . " My Irish and American parishioners lose nothing by the short sermon I preach in German , for they have their own sermon in English . Nor do they make any complaint . It is the outsiders who do that . " But there is a false Cahenelyism , or rather a charge of that kind , which is oalled a tendency to maintain foreign customs and speech . We have no sympathy with that and do not advocate it . " The Bishop , " continued Father Ahne , " would not have sent this letter unless the statements it makes were correct and in accordance with Archbishop Satolli 's decision . " Some people thing , in regard to the combination of these churches , that a wrong was done to the parishioners of St. Thomas . When the combination was made , St. Henry 's possessed property that had cost $22,400 , and the debt upon it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts of St. Thomas 's Church from the time the church was opened , Deo. 4. 1891 , to Jan. 10. 1892 , were $1,190.78 . Only $1,000 or this was put into the property . " The debt on St. Thomas 's Church when the oombination was made was $10,303 . The Germans owned the $12,200 that had been paid on the church and controlled the parish . Now they are in the minority , and no longer control what used to be their property . " The statement has been made that the Bishop came to the rescue of the German parish , which was struggling for existence . The . falsity of this statement is apparent from the fact that the receipts of St. Henry 's alone , before the combinationafor 1891. were $5,200 , and for 1892 , since the combination , they were $5,947 , a gain of only $747 . This fact shows that there was no struggle for existence so far as the German ' parish was concerned . " Father Killeen read a letter in Bt . Mary 's similar to the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the Bishop 's orders His congregation was taken by surprise by the orders , owing to the contrary report published as coming from the ablegate at Washington . That Father Killeen will not let the matter rest in its new light , so unfavorable to him , is well understood , but is not admitted by him . When interviewed . Father Killeen said for publication : " I have nothing to say regarding the case except that the Bishop has made a statement which I do not wish to contradict , because I do not care to bring my Bishop into contempt . Later on I expect the Monsignor will make a statement which will satisfy the public regarding his interpretation of his own decision . "
