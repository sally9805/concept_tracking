txt Real estate , and especially that within the city limits , has been giving a pretty good account of itself in these troubloas financial times that have playedducks and drakes with so many other forms of investment . No property has been sacrificed , values have been quite well maintained , and forced sales have been few in number . Wit h regard to foreclosures , it is well to recall that cases of first-mortgage foreclosures are rare , and that even where sales are had under second-mortgage foreclosures the property usually brings more than enough to cover the judgment . An illustration of the latter occurred yesterday , when a parcel of about seven lots , mortgaged first for $10,000 and then for nearly as much more , was put up for sale under foreclosure of the second mortgage . The property is a mile and a half north of the Harlem River , and in a neighborhood where property is not much in demand . It was almost expected that a judgment for deficiency would result . As it happened , however , the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incumbrances . Renting is progressing fairly well , there being a good demand for residences and good apartments on both the east and west sides of town . The volume of private sales , also , shows up well for this season of the year . Real estate men have thus far had no occasion to feel discouraged at the outlook . There is every indication that the flurry among savings bank depositors in this city will be of short duration . It was inevitable that it should take place on the announcement that the rule requiring notice of the withdrawal of deposits would be enforced . There are a great many small depositors who have no understanding of the business or the condition of the banks and who get easily frightened at any intimation that their money can not be had instantly on demand . It was to be expeoted that a large number of these would make an excited rush to the banks on any report the significance of which they did not comprehend . There were others who thought they might need their money before the term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the rule was put into effect . The number applying at the banks was further swelled by those who wished to give the required notice in order that they might draw their money in thirty or sixty days , as the case might be , if they should then find that they wanted it . Many who give notice will probably not draw their money when the time comes . The circumstances produced the appearance of something like a run on the banks for two or three days , but the feeling of disquietude is likely to wear off soon and that of confidence to return . There are signs of it already . The savings banks are safe . There is a probability that the Geary act will be brought before the Supreme Court again , the result of the test suit of last May not being taken as altogether conclusive as to the validity of all its provisions . There have mandates since the judgment of the Supreme Court was rendered . Judge Ross , at Los Angeles , has just held that the section imposing a penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawfully in the country is unconstitutional . There is likely to be an appeal in some of these cases , possibly in that which came before Judge LACOMBE , in this city , when he discharged a Chinaman because the law made no provision for carrying out the penalty of deportation for the crime of being without a certificate of registration . Those who think there may be a different decision if the matter comes before the court again recall the fact that three of the Judges dissented from that rendered by Mr. Justice GRAY , and that Justice HARLAN was then absent and Justice BLATCHFORD was out of health and has since died . If HA.RLA.N and the new Justice , yet to be appointed , should agree with the views of FULLER , FIELD , and BREWER in the former case , the deoision might be quite different . At the close of President HARRISON 'S term , out of 317 offices in the Consular Service only 24 were still held by persons who had . been appointed by President CLEVELAND . In a review of what has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUINCY , Assistant Secretary of State . shows that changes have been made in only 117 of the 317 offices , and that of the persons appointed 17 had been displaced by Mr. HARRISON for political reasons . It is true that more changes have been made since March 4 than were made in the corresponding months of Mr. HARRISON 'S term , but the department had held that changes which were inevitable should be made promptly , in order that the new officers should have as nearly as possible full terms . Mr. QUINCY is confident that the new officers , as a body , are superior to those whose places they have taken . One-sixth of the new officers are men of experience in the service whose records afforded excellent testimony as to their qualifications . The removal of these men had injured the Consular Service , and the restoration of them distinctly improves it . Mr. Quiwov directs attention to more than twenty appointments which show clearly both the department 's attempts to use the valuable experience of old officers whose work had commended them and its efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places to which they were assigned .
