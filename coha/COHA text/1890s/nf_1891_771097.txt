PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE . WASHINGTON : GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE . 1891 . CATALOGUE OF ECONOMIC PLANTS IN THE COLLECTION OF THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE . U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE , Washington , D. C. , June 5 , 1891 . SIR : I have duly prepared by your direction a descriptive list of the more important economic plants at present contained in the collection of the Department , in such a form as will , in my opinion , most satisfactorily meet the wants of the numerous visitors and others interested in the work performed by the Department in this direction , and I beg to submit the same herewith for publication . WILLIAM SAUNDERS , Superintendent of Gardens and Grounds . Hon. J. M. RUSK , Secretary of Agriculture . DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF PLANTS . 1 . ABELMOSCHUS MOSCHATUS.  --  This plant is a native of Bengal . Its seeds were formerly mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pomatum . The Arabs mix them with their coffee berries . In the West Indies the bruised seeds , steeped in rum , are used , both externally and internally , as a cure for snake bites . 2 . ABRUS PRECATORIUS.  --  Wild liquorice . This twining , leguminous plant is a native of the East , but is now found in the West Indies and other tropical regions . It is chiefly remarkable for its small oval seeds , which are of a brilliant scarlet color , with a black scar at the place where they are attached to the pods . These seeds are much used for necklaces and other ornamental purposes , and are employed in India as a standard of weight , under the name of Rati . The weight of the famous Kohinoor diamond is known to have been ascertained in this way . The roots afford liquorice , which is extracted in the same manner as that from the true Spanish liquorice plant , the Glycyrrhiza glabra . Recently the claim was made that the weather could be foretold by certain movements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fallacy . 3 . ABUTILON INDICUM.  --  This plant furnishes fiber fit for the manufacture of ropes . Its leaves contain a large quantity of mucilage. 4 . ABUTILON VENOSUM.  --  This malvaceous plant is common in collections , as are others of the genus . They are mostly fiber-producing species . The flowers of A. esculentum are used as a vegetable in Brazil . 5 . ACACIA BRASILIENSIS.  --  This plant furnishes the Brazil wood , which yields a red or crimson dye , and is used for dyeing silks . The best quality is that received from Pernambuco. 6 . ACACIA CATECHU.  --  The drug known as catechu is principally prepared from this tree , the wood of which is boiled down , and the decoction subsequently evaporated so as to form an extract much used as an astringent . The acacias are very numerous , and yield many useful products . Gum arabic is produced by several species , as A. vera , A. arabica , A. adansonii , A. verek , and others . It is obtained by spontaneous exudation from the trunk and branches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flows in a liquid state , but soon hardens by exposure to the air . The largest quantity of the gum comes from Barbary . Gum senegal is produced by A. vera . By some it is thought that the timber of A. arabica is identical with the Shittim tree , or wood of the Bible . From the flowers of A. farnesiana a choice and delicious perfume is obtained , the chief ingredient in many valued " balm of a thousand flowers . " The pods of A. concinna are used in India as a soap for washing ; the leaves are used for culinary purposes , and have a peculiarly agreeable acid taste . The seeds of some species are used , when cooked , as articles of food . From the seeds of A. niopo the Guahibo Indians prepare a snuff , by roasting the seeds and pounding them in a wooden platter . Its effects are to produce a kind of intoxication and invigorate the spirits . The bark of several species is extensively used for tanning , and the timber , being tough and elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes where great strength and durability are requisite . 7 . ACACIA DEALBATA.  --  The silver wattle tree of Australia . The bark is used for tanning purposes . It is hardy South . 8 . ACACIA HOMOLOPHYLLA.  --  This tree furnishes the scented myall wood , a very hard and heavy wood , of an agreeable odor , resembling that of violets . Fancy boxes for the toilet are manufactured of it . 9 . ACACIA MELANOXYLON.  --  The wood of this tree is called mayall wood in New South Wales . It is also called violet wood , on account of the strong odor it has of that favorite flower ; hence it is in great repute for making small dressing cases , etc. 10 . ACACIA MOLLISSIMA.  --  The black wattle tree of Australia , which furnishes a good tanning principle . These trees were first called wattles from being used by the early settlers for forming a network or wattling of the supple twigs as a substitute for laths in plastering houses . 11 . ACROCOMIA SCLEROCARPA.  --  This palm grows all over South America . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called Mucaja oil , is extracted from the fruit and is used for making toilet soaps . 12 . ADANSONIA DIGITATA.  --  The baobab tree , a native of Africa . It has been called the tree of a thousand years , and Humboldt speaks of it as " the oldest organic monument of our planet . " Adanson , who traveled in Senegal in 1794 , made a calculation to show that one of these trees , 30 feet in diameter , must be 5,150 years old . The bark of the baobab furnishes a fiber which is made into ropes and also manufactured into cloth . The fiber is so strong as to give rise to a common saying in Bengal , " as secure as an elephant bound with baobab rope . " The pulp of the fruit is slightly acid , and the juice expressed from it is valued as a specific in putrid and pestilential fevers . The ashes of the fruit and bark , boiled in rancid palm oil , make a fine soap . 13 . ADENANTHERA PAVONINA.  --  A tree that furnishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing the wood against a wet stone , which is used by the Brahmins for marking their foreheads after religious bathing . The seeds are used by Indian jewelers as weights , each seed weighing uniformly four grains . They are known as Circassian beans . Pounded and mixed with borax , they form an adhesive substance . They are sometimes used as food . The plant belongs to the Leguminosae. 14 . ADHATODA VASICA.  --  This plant is extolled for its charcoal in the manufacture of powder . The flowers , leaves , roots , and especially the fruit , are considered antispasmodic , and are administered in India in asthma and intermittent fevers . 15 . AEGLE MARMELOS.  --  This plant belongs to the orange family , and its fruit is known in India as Bhel fruit . It is like an orange ; the thick rind of the unripe fruit possesses astringent properties , and , when ripe , has an exquisite flavor and perfume . The fruit and other parts of the plant are used for medicinal purposes , and a yellow dye is prepared from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This plant is commonly known as American aloe , but it is not a member of that family , as it claims kindred with the Amaryllis tribe of plants . It grows naturally in a wide range of climate , from the plains of South America to elevations of 10,000 feet . It furnishes a variety of products . The plants form impenetrable fences ; the leaves furnish fibers of various qualities , from the fine thread known as pita-thread , which is used for twine , to the coarse fibers used for ropes and cables . Humboldt describes a bridge of upward of 130 feet span over the Chimbo in Quito , of which the main ropes ( 4 inches in diameter ) were made of this fiber . It is also used for making paper . The juice , when the watery part is evaporated , forms a good soap ( as detergent as castile ) , and will mix and form a lather with salt water as well as with fresh . The sap from the heart leaves is formed into pulque . This sap is sour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinous beverage has a filthy odor , but those who can overcome the aversion to this fetid smell indulge largely in the liquor . A very intoxicating brandy is made from it . Razor strops are made from the leaves ; they are also used for cleaning and scouring pewter . 17 . AGAVE RIGIDA.  --  The sisal hemp , introduced into Florida many years ago , for the sake of its fiber , but its cultivation has not been prosecuted to a commercial success . Like many other of the best vegetable fibers found in leaves , it contains a gummy substance , which prevents the easy separation of the fiber from the pulp . 18 . ALEURITES TRILOBA.  --  The candleberry tree , much cultivated in tropical countries for the sake of its nuts . The nuts or kernels , when dried and stuck on a reed , are used by the Polynesians as a substitute for candles and as an article of food ; they are said to taste like walnuts . When pressed , they yield largely of pure palatable oil , as a drying oil for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake , after the oil has been expressed , is a favorite food for cattle . The root of the tree affords a brown dye , which is used to dye cloths. 19 . ALGAROBIA GLANDULOSA.  --  The mezquite tree , of Texas , occasionally reaching a height of 25 to 30 feet . It yields a very hard , durable wood , and affords a large quantity of gum resembling gum arabic , and answering every purpose of that gum . 20 . ALLAMANDA CATHARTICA.  --  This plant belongs to the family of Apocynaceae , which contains many poisonous species . It is often cultivated for the beauty of its flowers ; the leaves are considered a valuable cathartic , in moderate doses , especially in the cure of painter 's colic ; in large doses they are violently emetic . It is a native of South America . 21 . ALOE SOCOTRINA.  --  Bitter aloe , a plant of the lily family , which furnishes the finest aloes . The bitter , resinous juice is stored up in greenish vessels , lying beneath the skin of the leaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice exudes , and is gradually evaporated to a firm consistence . The inferior kinds of aloes are prepared by pressing the leaves , when the resinous juice becomes mixed with the mucilaginous fluid from the central part of the leaves , and thus it is proportionately deteriorated . Sometimes the leaves are cut and boiled , and the decoction evaporated to a proper consistence . This drug is imported in chests , in skins of animals , and sometimes in large calabash-gourds , and although the taste is peculiarly bitter and disagreeable , the perfume of the finer sorts is aromatic , and by no means offensive . It is common in tropical countries . 22 . ALSOPHILA AUSTRALIS.  --  This beautiful tree-fern attains a height of stem of 25 to 30 feet , with fronds spreading out into a crest 26 feet in diameter . These plants are among the most beautiful of all vegetable productions , and in their gigantic forms indicate , in a meager degree , the extraordinary beauty of the vegetation on the globe previous to the formation of the coal measures . 23 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bombay . The plant attains a height of 80 or 90 feet ; the bark is powerfully bitter , and is used in India in medicine . It is of the family of Apocynaceae. 24 . AMOMUM MELEGUETA.  --  Malaguetta pepper , or grains of paradise ; belonging to the ginger family , Zingiberaceae . The seeds of this and other species are imported from Guinea ; they have a very warm and camphor-like taste , and are used to give a fictitious strength to adulterated liquors , but are not considered particularly injurious to health . The seeds are aromatic and stimulating , and form , with other seeds of similar plants , what are known as cardamoms. 25 . AMYRIS BALSAMIFERA.  --  This plant yields the wood called Lignum Rhodium . It also furnishes a gum resin analogous to Elemi , and supposed to yield Indian Bdellium. 26 . ANACARDIUM OCCIDENTALE.  --  The cashew nut tree , cultivated in the West Indies and other tropical countries . The stem furnishes a milky juice , which becomes hard and black when dry , and is used as a varnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nut or fruit contains a black , acrid , caustic oil , injurious to the lips and tongue of those who attempt to crack the nut with their teeth ; it becomes innocuous and wholesome when roasted , but this process must be carefully conducted , the acridity of the fumes producing severe inflammation of the face if approached too near . 27 . ANANASSA SATIVA.  --  The well-known pineapple , the fruit of which was described three hundred years ago , by Jean de Lery , a Huguenot priest , as being of such excellence that the gods might luxuriate upon it , and that it should only be gathered by the hand of a Venus . It is supposed to be a native of Brazil , and to have been carried from thence to the West , and afterwards to the East Indies . It first became known to Europeans in Peru . It is universally acknowledged to be one of the most delicious fruits in the world . Like all other fruits that have been a long time under cultivation , there are numerous varieties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves yield a fine fiber , which is used in the manufacture of pina cloth ; this cloth is very delicate , soft , and transparent , and is made into shawls , scarfs , handkerchiefs , and dresses . 28 . ANDIRA INERMIS.  --  This is a native of Senegambia . Its bark is anthelmintic , but requires care in its administration , being powerfully narcotic . It has a sweetish taste , but a disagreeable smell , and is generally given in the form of a decoction , which is made by boiling an ounce of the dried bark in a quart of water until it assumes the color of Madeira wine . Three or four grains of the powdered bark acts as a powerful purgative . The bark is known as bastard cabbage bark , or worm bark . It is almost obsolete in medicine . 29 . ANDROPOGON MURICATUS.  --  The Khus-Khus , or Vetiver grass of India . The fibrous roots yield a most peculiar but pleasing perfume . In India the leaves are manufactured into awnings , blinds , and sunshades ; but principally for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , when wetted , diffuse a peculiar and refreshing perfume , while cooling the air . 30 . ANDROPOGON SCHOENANTHUS.  --  The sweet-scented lemon grass , a native of Malabar . An essential oil is distilled from the leaves , which is used in perfumery . It is a favorite herb with the Asiatics , both for medicinal and culinary purposes . Tea from the dried leaves is a favorite beverage of some persons . 31 . ANONA CHERIMOLIA.  --  The Cherimoyer of Peru , where it is extensively cultivated for its fruits , which are highly esteemed by the inhabitants , but not so highly valued by those accustomed to the fruits of temperate climates . The fruit , when ripe , is of a pale greenish-yellow color , tinged with purple , weighing from 3 to 4 pounds ; the skin thin ; the flesh sweet , and about the consistence of a custard ; hence often called custard apple . 32 . ANONA MURICATA.  --  The sour-sop , a native of the West Indies , which produces a fruit of considerable size , often weighing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrid flavor , which is not disagreeable . 33 . ANONA RETICULATA.  --  The common custard apple of the West Indies . It has a yellowish pulp and is not so highly esteemed as an article of food as some others of the species . It bears the name of Condissa in Brazil . The Anonas are grown to some extent throughout southern Florida . 34 . ANONA SQUAMOSA.  --  The sweet-sop , a native of the Malay Islands , where it is grown for its fruits . These are ovate in shape , with a thick rind , which incloses a luscious pulp . The seeds contain an acrid principle , and , being reduced to powder , form an ingredient for the destruction of insects . 35 . ANTIARIS INNOXIA.  --  The upas tree . Most exaggerated statements respecting this plant have passed into history . Its poisonous influence was said to be so great as not only to destroy all animal life but even plants could not live within 10 miles of it . The plant has no such virulent properties as the above , but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapes from the crevices in volcanic rocks which frequently proves fatal to animals , the tree was blamed wrongly . It is , however , possessed of poisonous juice , which , when dry and mixed with other ingredients , forms a venomous poison for arrows , and severe effects have been felt by those who have climbed upon the branches for the purpose of gathering the flowers . 36 . ANTIARIS SACCIDORA.  --  The sack tree ; so called from the fibrous bark being used as sacks . For this purpose young trees of about a foot in diameter are selected and cut into junks of the same length as the sack required . The outer bark is then removed and the inner bark loosened by pounding , so that it can be separated by turning it inside out . Sometimes a small piece of the wood is left to form the bottom of the sack . The fruit exudes a milky , viscid juice , which hardens into the consistency of beeswax , but becomes black and shining . 37 . ANTIDESMA BUNIAS.  --  An East India plant which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a currant , used in making preserves . The bark furnishes a good fiber , which is utilized in the manufacture of ropes . A decoction of the leaves is a reputed cure for snake bites . The whole plant is very bitter . 38 . ARALIA PAPYRIFERA.  --  The Chinese rice paper plant . The stems are filled with pith of very fine texture and white as snow , from which is derived the article known as rice paper , much used in preparing artificial flowers . 39 . ARAUCARIA BIDWILLII.  --  The Bunya-Bunya of Australia , which forms a large tree , reaching from 150 to 200 feet in height . The cones are very large , and contain one hundred to one hundred and fifty seeds , which are highly prized by the aborigines as food . They are best when roasted in the shell , cracked between two stones and eaten while hot . In flavor they resemble roasted chestnuts . During the season of the ripening of these seeds the natives grow sleek and fat . That part of the country where these trees most abound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The Brazilian Araucaria , which grows at great elevations . The seeds of this tree are commonly sold in the markets of Rio Janeiro as an article of food . The resinous matter which exudes from the trunk is employed in the manufacture of candles . 41 . ARAUCARIA CUNNINGHAMII.  --  The Morton Bay pine . This Australian tree forms a very straight trunk , and yields a timber of much commercial importance in Sidney and other ports . It is chiefly used for house building and some of the heavier articles of furniture . 42 . ARAUCARIA EXCELSA.  --  This very elegant evergreen is a native of Norfolk Island . Few plants can compare with it in beauty and regularity of growth . The wood is of no particular value , although used for building purposes in Norfolk Island . 43 . ARDISIA CRENATA .  --  A native of China . The bark has tonic and astringent properties , and is used in fevers and for external application in the cure of ulcers , etc. 44 . ARECA CATECHU.  --  This palm is cultivated in all the warmer parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of betel nut , and is about the size of a nutmeg . The chewing of these nuts is a common practice of hundreds of thousands of people . The nut is cut into small pieces , mixed with a small quantity of lime , and rolled up in leaves of the betel pepper . The pellet is chewed , and is hot and acrid , but possesses aromatic and astringent properties . It tinges the saliva red and stains the teeth . The practice is considered beneficial rather than otherwise , just as chewing tobacco-leaves , drinking alcohol , and eating chicken-salad are considered healthful practices in some portions of the globe . A kind of catechu is obtained by boiling down the seeds to the consistence of an extract , but the chief supply of this drug is Acacia catechu. 45 . ARGANIA SIDEROXYLON.  --  This is the argan tree of Morocco . It is remarkable for its low-spreading mode of growth . Trees have been measured only 16 feet in height , while the circumference of the branches was 220 feet . The fruit is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so heavy as to sink in water . A valuable oil is extracted from the seeds . 46 . ARISTOLOCHIA GRANDIFLORA .  --  The pelican flower . This plant belongs to a family famed for the curious construction of their flowers , as well as for their medical qualities . In tropical America various species receive the name of " Guaco , " which is a term given to plants that are used in the cure of snake bites . Even some of our native species , such as A. serpentaria , is known as snake-root , and is said to be esteemed for curing the bite of the rattlesnake . It is stated that the Egyptian jugglers use some of these plants to stupefy the snakes before they handle them . A. bracteata and A. indica are used for similar purposes in India . It is said that the juice of the root of A. anguicida , if introduced into the mouth of a serpent , so stupefies it that it may be handled with impunity . The Indians , after having " guaconized " themselves , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without injury . 47 . ARTANTHE ELONGATA.  --  A plant of the pepper family , which furnishes one of the articles known by the Peruvians as Matico , and which is used by them for the same purposes as cubebs ; but its chief value is as a styptic , an effect probably produced by its rough under surface , acting mechanically like lint . It has been employed internally to check hemorrhages , but with doubtful effect . Its aromatic bitter stimulant properties are like those of cubebs , and depend on a volatile oil , a dark-green resin , and a peculiar bitter principle called maticin. 48 . ARTOCARPUS INCISA.  --  This is the breadfruit tree of the South Sea Islands , where its introduction gave occasion for the historical incidents arising from the mutiny of the " Bounty . " The round fruits contain a white pulp , of the consistence of new bread . It is roasted before being eaten , but has little flavor . The tree furnishes a viscid juice containing caoutchouc , which is used as glue for calking canoes . In the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is prepared by baking in an oven heated by hot stones . 49 . ARTOCARPUS INTEGRIFOLIA.  --  The jack of the Indian Archipelago , cultivated for its fruit , which is a favorite article among the natives , as also are the roasted seeds . The wood is much used , and resembles mahogany . Bird-lime is made from the juice . 50 . ASTROCARYUM VULGARE.  --  Every part of this South American palm is covered with sharp spines . It is cultivated to some extent by the Indians of Brazil for the sake of its young leaves , which furnish a strong fiber for making bowstrings , fishing nets , etc . The finer threads are knitted into hammocks , which are of great strength . It is known as Tucum thread . The pulp of the fruit furnishes an oil . In Guiana it is called the Aoura palm . 51 . ATTALEA COHUNE.  --  This palm furnishes Cahoun nuts , from which is extracted cohune oil , used as a burning oil , for which purpose it is superior to cocoanut oil . Piassaba fiber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are known as Coquilla nuts ; these nuts are 3 or 4 inches long , oval , of a rich brown color , and very hard ; they are much used by turners for making the handles of doors , umbrellas , etc . The fiber derived from the decaying of the cellular matter at the base of the leaf-stalks is much used in Brazil for making ropes . It is largely used in England and other places for making coarse brooms , chiefly used in cleaning streets . 52 . AVERRHOA BILIMBI.  --  This is called the blimbing , and is cultivated to some extent in the East Indies . The fruit is oblong , obtuse-angled , somewhat resembling a short , thick cucumber , with a thin , smooth , green rind , filled with a pleasant , acid juice . 53 . AVERRHOA CARAMBOLA.  --  The caramba of Ceylon and Bengal . The fruit of this tree is about the size of a large orange , and , when ripe , is of a rich yellow color , with a very decided and agreeable fragrance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally used as a pickle or preserve . In Java it is used both in the ripe and unripe state in pies ; a sirup is also made of the juice , and a conserve of the flowers . These preparations are highly valued as remedies in fevers and bilious disorders . 54 . BACTRIS MAJOR .  --  The Marajah palm , of Brazil , which grows upon the banks of the Amazon River . It has a succulent , rather acid fruit , from which a vinous beverage is prepared . B. minor has a stem about 14 feet high and about an inch in diameter . These stems are used for walking canes , and are sometimes called Tobago canes . 55 . BALSAMOCARPON BREVIFOLIUM.  --  This shrub is the algarrobo of the Chilians . It belongs to the pea family . Its pods are short and thick , and when unripe contain about 80 per cent of tannic acid ; the ripe pods become transformed into a cracked resinous substance , when their tanning value is much impaired ; this resinous matter is astringent , and is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BALSAMODENDRON MYRRHA.  --  A native of Arabia Felix , producing a gum resin , sometimes called Opobalsamum , which was considered by the ancients as a panacea for almost all the ills that flesh is heir to . B. mukul yields a resin of this name , and is considered identical with the Bdellium of Dioscorides and of the Scriptures . The resin has cordial and stimulating properties , and is burnt as an incense . In ancient times it was used as an embalming ingredient . 57 . BAMBUSA ARUNDINACEA.  --  The bamboo cane , a gigantic grass , cultivated in many tropical and semitropical countries . The Chinese use it in one way or other for nearly everything they require . Almost every article of furniture in their houses , including mats , screens , chairs , tables , bedsteads , and bedding , is made of bamboo . The masts , sails , and rigging of their ships consist chiefly of bamboo . A fiber has been obtained from the stem suitable for mixing with wool , cotton , and silk ; it is said to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and volumes on its culture , showing the best soil and the seasons for planting and transplanting this useful production . 58 . BAUHINIA VAHLII.  --  The Maloo-climber of India , where the gigantic shrubby stems often attain a height of 300 feet , running over the tops of the tallest trees , and twisting so tightly around their stems as to kill them . The exceedingly tough fibrous bark of this plant is used in India for making ropes and in the construction of suspension bridges . The seeds form an article of food ; they are eaten raw , and resemble cashew nuts in flavor. 59 . BEAUCARNEA RECURVIFOLIA.  --  This Mexican plant is remarkable for the large bulbiform swelling at the base of the stem . It is a plant of much elegance and beauty , resembling a drooping fountain . 60 . BERGERA KOENIGII.  --  The curry-leaf tree of India . The fragrant , aromatic leaves are used to flavor curries . The leaves , root , and bark are used medicinally . The wood is hard and durable , and from the seeds a clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 . BERRYA AMMONILLA.  --  This furnishes the Trincomalee wood of the Philippine Islands and Ceylon , and is largely used for making oil casks and for building boats , for which it is well adapted , being light and strong . 62 . BERTHOLLETIA EXCELSA.  --  This furnishes the well known Brazil nuts , or cream nuts of commerce . The tree is a native of South America and attains a height of 100 to 150 feet . The fruit is nearly round and contains from eighteen to twenty-four seeds , which are so beautifully packed in the shell that when once removed it is found impossible to replace them . A bland oil is pressed from the seeds , which is used by artists , and at Para the fibrous bark of the tree is used for calking ships , as a substitute for oakum. 63 . BIGNONIA ECHINATA.  --  A native of Mexico , where it is sometimes called Mariposa butterfly . The branches are said to be used in the adulteration of sarsaparilla . B. chica , a native of Venezuela , furnishes a red pigment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by the natives for painting their bodies . The long flexible stems of B. kerere furnish the natives of French Guiana with a substitute for ropes . B. alliacea is termed the Garlic shrub , because of the powerful odor of garlic emitted from its leaves and branches when bruised . These plants all have showy flowers , and the genus is represented with us by such beautiful flowers as are produced by B. radicans and B. capreolata. 64 . BIXA ORELLANA.  --  Arnotta plant . This plant is a native of South America , but has been introduced and cultivated both in the West and East Indies . It bears bunches of pink-colored flowers , which are followed by oblong bristled pods . The seeds are thinly coated with red , waxy pulp , which is separated by stirring them in water until it is detached , when it is strained off and evaporated to the consistence of putty , when it is made up into rolls ; in this condition it is known as flag or roll arnotta , but when thoroughly dried it is made into cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the South American Caribs and other tribes of Indians for painting their bodies , paint being almost their only article of clothing . As a commercial article it is mainly used as a coloring for cheese , butter , and inferior chocolates , to all of which it gives the required tinge without imparting any unpleasant flavor or unwholesome quality . It is also used in imparting rich orange and gold-colored tints to various kinds of varnishes . 65 . BLIGHIA SAPIDA.  --  The akee fruit of Guinea . The fruit is about 3 inches long by 2 inches wide ; the seeds are surrounded by a spongy substance , which is eaten . It has a subacid , agreeable taste . A small quantity of semisolid fatty oil is obtained from the seeds by pressure . 66 . BOEHMERIA NIVEA.  --  A plant of the nettle family , which yields the fiber known as Chinese grass . The beautiful fabric called grasscloth , which rivals the best French cambric in softness and fineness of texture , is manufactured from the fiber of this plant . The fiber is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China as Tchow-ma . It is a plant of the easiest culture , and has been introduced into the Southern States , where it grows freely . When once machinery is perfected so as to enable its being cheaply prepared for the manufacturer , a great demand will arise for this fiber. 67 . BOLDOA FRAGRANS.  --  A Chilian plant which yields small edible fruits ; these , as well as all parts of the plant , are very aromatic . The bark is used for tanning , and the wood is highly esteemed for making charcoal . An alkaloid called boldine , extracted from the plant , has reputed medicinal value , and a drug called Boldu is similarly produced . 68 . BORASSUS FLABELLIFORMIS.  --  The Palmyra palm . The parts of this tree are applied to such a multitude of purposes that a poem in the Tamil language , although enumerating eight hundred uses , does not exhaust the catalogue . In old trees the wood becomes hard and is very durable . The leaves are from 8 to 10 feet long , and are used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also supply the Hindoo with paper , upon which he writes with a stylus . A most important product called toddy or palm wine is obtained from the flower spikes , which yield a great quantity of juice for four or five months . Palm-toddy is intoxicating , and when distilled yields strong arrack . Very good vinegar is also obtained from it , and large quantities of jaggery or palm sugar are manufactured from the toddy . The fruits are large and have a thick coating of fibrous pulp , which is cooked and eaten or made into jelly . The young palm plants are cultivated for the market , as cabbages are with us , and eaten , either when fresh or after being dried in the sun . 69 . BOSWELLIA THURIFERA.  --  This Coromandel tree furnishes the resin known as olibanum , which is supposed to have been the frankincense of the ancients . It is sometimes used in medicine as an astringent and stimulant , and is employed , because of its grateful perfume , as an incense in churches . 70 . BROMELIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is obtained from this plant , which is very strong , and much used for bowstrings , fishing lines , nets , and ropes . 71 . BROMELIA PINGUIN.  --  This is very common as a hedge or fence plant in the West Indies . The leaves , when beaten with a blunt mallet and macerated in water , produce fibers from which beautiful fabrics are manufactured . The fruit yields a cooling juice much used in fevers . 72 . BROSIMUM ALICASTRUM.  --  The bread-nut tree of Jamaica . The nuts or seeds produced by this tree are said to form an agreeable and nutritious article of food . When cooked they taste like hazelnuts . The young branches and shoots are greedily eaten by horses and cattle , and the wood resembles mahogany , and is used for making furniture . 73 . BROSIMUM GALACTODENDRON.  --  The cow tree of South America , which yields a milk of as good quality as that from the cow . It forms large forests on the mountains near the town of Cariaco and elsewhere along the seacoast of Venezuela , reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree is called Palo de Vaca , or Arbol de Leche . Its milk , which is obtained by making incisions in the trunk , so closely resembles the milk of the cow , both in appearance and quality , that it is commonly used as an article of food by the inhabitants of the places where the tree is abundant . Unlike many other vegetable milks , it is perfectly wholesome , and very nourishing , possessing an agreeable taste , and a pleasant balsamic odor , its only unpleasant quality being a slight amount of stickiness . The chemical analysis of this milk has shown it to possess a composition closely resembling some animal substances ; and , like animal milk , it quickly forms a cheesy scum , and after a few days ' exposure to the atmosphere , turns sour and putrefies . It contains upwards of 30 per cent of a resinous substance called galactine. 74 . BRYA EBENUS.  --  Jamaica or West India ebony tree . This is not the plant that yields the true ebony-wood of commerce . Jamaica ebony is of a greenish-brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinks in water .

Animals fed upon the fruit and leaves will have very tender and juicy flesh . 90 . CARLUDOVICA PALMATA.  --  A pandanaceous plant from Panama and southward . Panama hats are made from the leaves of this plant . The leaves are cut when young , and the stiff parallel veins removed , after which they are slit into shreds , but not separated at the stalk end , and immersed in boiling water for a short time , then bleached in the sun . 91 . CARYOCAR NUCIFERUM.  --  On the river banks of Guiana this grows to a large-sized tree . It yields the butter-nuts , or souari-nuts of commerce . These are of a flattened kidney shape , with a hard woody shell of a reddish-brown color , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , and yield , by expression , an oil called Piquia oil , which possesses the flavor of the fruit . 92 . CARYOPHYLLUS AROMATICUS.  --  This myrtaceous plant produces the well-known spice called cloves . It forms a beautiful evergreen , rising from 20 to 30 feet in height . The cloves of commerce are the unexpanded flower-buds ; they are collected by beating the tree with rods , when the buds , from the jointed character of their stalks , readily fall , and are received on sheets spread on purpose ; they are then dried in the sun . All parts of the plant are aromatic , from the presence of a volatile oil . The oil is sometimes used in toothache and as a carminative in medicine . 93 . CARYOTA URENS.  --  This fine palm is a native of Ceylon , and is also found in other parts of India , where it supplies the native population with various important articles . Large quantities of toddy , or palm-wine , are prepared from the juice , which , when boiled , yields very good palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sago is also prepared from the central or pithy part of the trunk , and forms a large portion of the food of the natives . The fiber from the leaf stalk is of great strength ; it is known as Kittool fiber , and is used for making ropes , brushes , brooms , etc . A woolly kind of scurf , scraped off the leaf stalks , is used for calking boats , and the stem furnishes a small quantity of wood . 94 . CASIMIROA EDULIS .  --  A Mexican plant , belonging to the orange family , with a fruit about the size of an ordinary orange , which has an agreeable taste , but is not considered to be wholesome . The seeds are poisonous ; the bark is bitter , and is sometimes used medicinally. 95 . CASSIA ACUTIFOLIA.  --  The cassias belong to the leguminous family . The leaflets of this and some other species produce the well-known drug called senna . That known as Alexandria senna is produced by the above . East Indian senna is produced by C. elongata .

CATHA EDULIS .  --  This plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of 7 to 10 feet . Its leaves are used by the Arabs in preparing a beverage like tea or coffee . The twigs , with leaves attached , in bundles of fifty , and in pieces from 12 to 15 inches in length , form a very considerable article of commerce , its use in Arabia corresponding to that of the Paraguay tea in South America and the Chinese tea in Europe . The effects produced by a decoction of the leaves of Cafta , as they are termed , are described as similar to those produced by strong green tea , only more pleasing and agreeable . The Arab soldiers chew the leaves when on sentry duty to keep them from feeling drowsy . Its use is of great antiquity , preceding that of coffee . Its stimulating effects induced some Arabs to class it with intoxicating substances , the use of which is forbidden by the Koran , but a synod of learned Mussulmans decreed that , as it did not impair the health or impede the observance of religious duties , but only increased hilarity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 . CECROPIA PELTATA.  --  The South American trumpet tree , so called because its hollow branches are used for musical instruments . The Waupe Indians form a kind of drum by removing the pith or center of the branches . The inner bark of the young branches yields a very tough fiber , which is made into ropes . The milky juice of the stem hardens into caoutchouc. 100 .

CEPHAELIS IPECACUANHA.  --  This Brazilian plant produces the true ipecacuanha , and belongs to the Cinchonaceae . The root is the part used in medicine , it is knotty , contorted , and annulated , and of a grayish-brown color , and its emetic properties are due to a chemical principle called emetin. 102 . CERATONIA SILIQUA.  --  The carob bean . This leguminous plant is a native of the countries bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mucilaginous and saccharine matter , and are used as food for cattle . Besides the name of carob beans , these pods are known as locust pods , or St. John 's bread , from a supposition that they formed the food of St. John in the wilderness . It is now generally admitted that the locusts of St. John were the insects so called , and which are still used as an article of food in some of the Eastern countries . There is more reason for the belief that the husks mentioned in the parable of the prodigal son were these pods . The seeds were at one time used by singers , who imagined that they softened and cleared the voice . 103 . CERBERA THEVETIA.  --  The name is intended to imply that the plant is as dangerous as Cerberus . The plant has a milky , poisonous juice . The bark is purgative ; the unripe fruit is used by the natives of Travancore to destroy dogs , as its action causes their teeth to loosen and fall out . 104 . CEREUS GIGANTEA.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , arid , and almost desert regions of New Mexico , found growing in rocky places , in valleys , and on mountain sides , often springing out of mere crevices in hard rocks , and imparting a singular aspect to the scenery of the country , its tall stems often reaching 40 feet in height , with upright branches looking like telegraph posts for signaling from point to point of the rocky mountains . The fruits are about 2 or 3 inches long , of a green color and oval form ; when ripe they burst into three or four pieces , which curve back so as to resemble a flower . Inside they contain numerous little black seeds , imbedded in a crimson-colored pulp , which the Indians make into a preserve . They also eat the ripe fruit as an article of food . 105 . CEREUS MACDONALDIAE.  --  A night-blooming cereus , and one of the most beautiful . The flowers when fully expanded are over a foot in diameter , having numerous radiating red and bright orange sepals and delicately white petals . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The wax palm of New Grenada , first described by Humboldt and Bonpland , who found it on elevated mountains , extending as high as the lower limit of perpetual snow . Its tall trunk is covered with a thin coating of a whitish waxy substance , giving it a marbled appearance . The waxy substance forms an article of commerce , and is obtained by scraping the trunk . It consists of two parts of resin and one wax , and , when mixed with one third of tallow , it makes very good candles . The stem is used for building purposes , and the leaves for thatching roofs . 107 . CHAMAEDOREA ELEGANS .  --  This belongs to a genus of palms native of South America . The plant is of tall , slender growth ; the stems are used for walking canes , and the young , unexpanded flower spikes are used as a vegetable . 108 . CHAMAEROPS FORTUNEI .  --  This palm is a native of the north of China , and is nearly hardy here . In China , the coarse brown fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also garments called So-e , worn in wet weather . 109 . CHAMAEROPS HUMILIS.  --  This is the only European species of palm , and does not extend farther north than Nice . The leaves are commonly used in the south of Europe for making hats , brooms , baskets , etc . From the leaf fiber a material resembling horse hair is prepared , and the Arabs mix it with camel 's hair for their tent covers . 110 . CHAVICA BETEL.  --  This plant is found all over the East Indies , where its leaf is largely used by Indian natives as a masticatory . Its consumption is immense , and has been said to equal that of tobacco by Western peoples . It is prepared for chewing by inclosing in the leaves a slice of the areca nut , and a small portion of lime . It is thought to act as a stimulant to the digestive organs , but causes giddiness and other unpleasant symptoms to those not accustomed to its use . 111 . CHIOCOCCA RACEMOSA.  --  This plant is found in many warm countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brazil , where a preparation of the bark of the root is employed as a remedy for snake bites . Almost every locality where snakes exist has its local remedies for poisonous bites , but they rarely prove to be efficient when truthfully and fairly tested . 112 . CHLORANTHUS OFFICINALIS.  --  The roots of this plant are an aromatic stimulant , much used as medicine in the Island of Java ; also , when mixed with anise , it has proved valuable in malignant smallpox . 113 . CHLOROXYLON SWIETENIA.  --  The satinwood tree of tropical countries . It is principally used for making the backs of clothes and hair brushes , and for articles of turnery-ware ; the finest mottled pieces are cut into veneers and used for cabinet-making. 114 . CHRYSOBALANUS ICACO.  --  The cocoa plum of the West Indies . The fruits are about the size of a plum , and are of various colors , white , yellow , red , or purple . The pulp is sweet , a little austere , but not disagreeable . The fruits are preserved and exported from Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed oil , and an emulsion made with them is used medicinally. 115 . CHRYSOPHYLLUM CAINITO.  --  The fruit of this plant is known in the West Indies as the star apple , the interior of which , when cut across , shows ten cells , and as many seeds disposed regularly round the center , giving a star-like appearance , as stars are generally represented in the most reliable almanacs . It receives its botanic name from the golden silky color on the under side of the leaves . 116 . CICCA DISTICHA.  --  This Indian plant is cultivated in many parts under the name of Otaheite gooseberry . The fruits resemble those of a green gooseberry . They have an acid flavor ; are used for preserving or pickling , and eaten either in a raw state or cooked in various ways . 117 . CINCHONA CALISAYA.  --  The yellow bark of Bolivia . This is one of the so-called Peruvian Bark trees . The discovery of the medicinal value of this bark is a matter of fable and conjecture . The name cinchona is derived from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have taken the drug from South America to Europe in 1639 . Afterwards the Jesuits used it ; hence it is sometimes called Jesuit 's bark . It was brought most particularly into notice when Louis XIV of France purchased of Sir R. Talbor , an Englishman , his heretofore secret remedy for intermittent fever , and made it public . There are various barks in commerce classified under the head of Peruvian barks . Their great value depends upon the presence of certain alkaloid substances called quinine , cinchonine , and quinidine , which exist in the bark in combination with tannic and other acids . Quinine is the most useful of these alkaloids , and this is found in greatest quantities in Calisaya bark . The gray bark of Huanuco is derived from Cinchona micrantha , which is characterized by its yield of cinchonine , and the Loxa or Loja barks are furnished in part by Cinchona officinalis , and are especially rich in quinidine . There is some uncertainty about the trees that produce the various kinds of bark . These trees grow in the forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , but chiefly in sheltered mountain valleys , and all of them at a considerable distance below the frost or snow line . They are destroyed by the slightest frost . Plants of various species have been distributed from time to time , in localities which seemed most favorable to their growth , but all reports from these distributions have , so far , been discouraging . 118 . CINNAMOMUM CASSIA.  --  This furnishes cassia bark , which is much like cinnamon , but thicker , coarser , stronger , less delicate in flavor , and cheaper ; hence it is often used to adulterate cinnamon . The unexpanded flower buds are sold as cassia buds , possessing properties similar to those of the bark . It is grown in southern China , Java , and tropical countries generally . 119 . CINNAMOMUM ZEYLANICUM.  --  A tree belonging to Lauraceae , which furnishes the best cinnamon . It is prepared by stripping the bark from the branches , when it rolls up into quills , the smaller of which are introduced into the larger , and then dried in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pleasant flavor , and its astringent properties are of medicinal value . It is cultivated largely in Ceylon . The cinnamon tree is too tender to become of commercial importance in the United States . Isolated plants may be found in southern Florida , at least it is so stated , but the area suited to its growth must be very limited . 120 . CISSAMPELOS PAREIRA.  --  The velvet plant of tropical countries . The root furnishes the Pareira brava of druggists , which is used in medicine . 121 . CITRUS AURANTIUM.  --  The orange , generally supposed to be a native of the north of India . It was introduced into Arabia during the ninth century . It was unknown in Europe in the eleventh century . Oranges were cultivated at Seville towards the end of the twelfth century , and at Palermo in the thirteenth . In the fourteenth century they were plentiful in several parts of Italy . There are many varieties of the orange in cultivation . The blood red , or Malta , is much esteemed ; the fruit is round , reddish-yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandarin or Tangerine orange has a thin rind which separates easily from the pulp , and is very sweet and rich . The St. Michael 's orange is one of the most productive and delicious varieties , with a thin rind and very sweet pulp . The Seville or bitter orange is used for the manufacture of bitter tincture and candied orange-peel . The Bergamot orange has peculiarly fragrant flowers and fruit , from each of which an essence of a delicious quality is extracted . 122 . CITRUS DECUMANA.  --  The shaddock , which has the largest fruit of the family . It is a native of China and Japan , where it is known as sweet ball . The pulp is acid or subacid , and in some varieties nearly sweet . From the thickness of the skin the fruit will keep a considerable time without injury . 123 . CITRUS JAPONICA .  --  This is the Kum-quat of the Chinese . It forms a small tree , or rather a large bush , and bears fruit about the size of a large cherry . There are two forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oval fruits . This fruit has a sweet rind and an agreeably acid pulp , and is usually eaten whole without being peeled . It forms an excellent preserve , with sugar , and is largely used in this form . 124 . CITRUS LIMETTA.  --  The lime , which is used for the same purposes as the lemon , and by some preferred , the juice being considered more wholesome and the acid more agreeable . There are several varieties , some of them being sweet and quite insipid. 125 . CITRUS LIMONUM.  --  The lemon ; this plant is found growing naturally in that part of India which is beyond the Ganges . It was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans . It is supposed to have been brought to Italy by the Crusaders . Arabian writers of the twelfth century notice the lemon as being cultivated in Egypt and other places . The varieties of the lemon are very numerous and valued for their agreeable acid juice and essential oil . They keep for a considerable time , especially if steeped for a short period in salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found wild in the forests of northern India . The Jews cultivated the citron at the time they were under subjection to the Romans , and used the fruit in the Feast of the Tabernacles . There is no proof of their having known the fruit in the time of Moses , but it is supposed that they found it at Babylon , and brought it into Palestine . The citron is cultivated in China and Cochin-China . It is easily naturalized and the seeds are rapidly spread . In its wild state it grows erect ; the branches are spiny , the flowers purple on the outside and white on the inside . The fruit furnishes the essential oil of citron and the essential oil of cedra . There are several varieties ; the fingered citron is a curious fruit , and the Madras citron is very long and narrow ; the skin is covered with protuberances. 127 . CLUSIA ROSEA.  --  A tropical plant which yields abundantly of a tenacious resin from its stem , which is used for the same purpose as pitch . It is first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it assumes a brown or reddish tint . The Caribs use it for painting the bottoms of their boats . 128 . COCCOLOBA UVIFERA.  --  Known in the West Indies as the seaside grape , from the peculiarity of the perianth , which becomes pulpy and of a violet color and surrounds the ripe fruit . The pulpy perianth has an agreeable acid flavor . An astringent extract is prepared from the plant which is used in medicine . 129 . COCOS NUCIFERA.  --  The cocoanut palm . This palm is cultivated throughout the tropics so extensively that its native country is not known . One reason of its extensive dissemination is that it grows so close to the sea that the ripe fruits are washed away by the waves and afterwards cast upon far-distant shores , where they soon vegetate . It is in this way that the coral islands of the Indian Ocean have become covered with these palms . Every part of this tree is put to some useful purpose . The outside rind or husk of the fruit yields the fiber from which the well-known cocoa matting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hats are made from this fiber , and , when curled and dyed , it is used for stuffing mattresses and cushions . An oil is produced by pressing the white kernel of the nut which is used for cooking when fresh , and by pressure affords stearin , which is made into candles , the liquid being used for lamps . The kernel is of great importance as an article of food , and the milk affords an agreeable beverage . While young it yields a delicious substance resembling blanc-mange . The leaves are used for thatching , for making mats , baskets , hats , etc. ; combs are made from the hard footstalk ; the heart of the tree is used as we use cabbages . The brown fibrous net work from the base of the leaves is used as sieves , and also made into garments . The wood is used for building and for furniture . The flowers are used medicinally as an astringent and the roots as a febrifuge. 130 . COCOS PLUMOSUS.  --  A Brazilian species , highly ornamental in its long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in size about as large as a chestnut , inclosed in an edible pulp . 131 . COFFEA ARABICA.  --  The coffee plant , which belongs to the Cinchonaceae and is a native of Abyssinia , but is now cultivated in many tropical regions . It can not be successfully cultivated in a climate where the temperature , at any season of the year , falls below 55 degrees , although it will exist where the temperature all but falls short of freezing , but a low fall of temperature greatly retards the ripening of the fruit . Ripe fruits are often gathered from plants in the extreme south of Florida . The beans or seeds are roasted before use , and by this process they gain nearly one half in bulk and lose about a fifth in weight . Heat also changes their essential qualities , causing the development of the volatile oil and peculiar acid to which the aroma and flavor are due . The berries contain theine ; so also do the leaves , and in some countries the latter are preferred . 132 . COFFEA LIBERICA. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which country it is a native . This plant is of larger and stronger growth than the Arabian coffee plant and the fruit is larger . This species is of recent introduction to commerce , and although it was reported as being more prolific than the ordinary coffee plant , the statement has not been borne out in Brazil and Mexico , where it has been tested . It is also more tender than the older known species . 133 . COLA ACUMINATA.  --  An African tree , which has been introduced into the West Indies and Brazil for the sake of its seeds , which are known as Cola , or Kola , or Goora nuts , and extensively used as a sort of condiment by the natives of Africa . A small piece of one of these seeds is chewed before each meal to promote digestion . It possesses properties similar to the leaves of coca and contains theine . These nuts have from time immemorial occupied a prominent place in the dietetic economy of native tribes in Africa , and the demand for them has established a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 134 . COLOCASIA ESCULENTA.  --  This plant has been recommended for profitable culture in this country for its edible root-stock . It is cultivated in the Sandwich Islands under the name of Tara . The young leaves are cooked and eaten in the same manner as spinach or greens in Egypt . They are acrid , but lose their acridity when boiled , the water being changed . The roots are filled with starch , and have long been used as food in various semitropical countries . 135 . CONDAMINEA MACROPHYLLA.  --  This plant belongs to the cinchona family , and contains tonic properties . The Peruvian bark gatherers adulterate the true cinchona bark with this , but it may be detected by its white inner surface , its less powerful bitter taste , and a viscidity not possessed by the cinchonas. 136 . CONVOLVULUS SCAMMONIA.  --  This plant furnishes the scammony of the druggists. 137 . COOKIA PUNCTATA.  --  A small-growing tree from China , which produces a fruit known as the Wampee . This fruit is a globular berry , with five or fewer compartments filled with juice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OFFICINALIS.  --  This tree yields balsam of copaiba , used in medicine . The balsam is collected by making incisions in the stem , when the liquor is said to pour out copiously ; as it exudes it is thin and colorless , but immediately thickens and changes to a clear yellow . Like many other balsams , it is nearly allied to the turpentines ; it has a moderately agreeable smell , and a bitter , biting taste of considerable duration . Distilled with water it yields a limpid essential oil . 139 . COPERNICA CERIFERA.  --  The Carnuba , or wax palm of Brazil . It grows about 40 feet high , and has a trunk 6 or 8 inches thick , composed of very hard wood , which is commonly employed in Brazil for building and other purposes . The upper part of the young stem is soft , and yields a kind of sago , and the bitter fruits are eaten by the Indians . The young leaves are coated with wax , called Carnaub wax , which is detached by shaking them , and then melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has been used for making candles . The leaves are used for thatch , and , when young , are eaten by cattle . 140 . COPROSMA ROBUSTA.  --  A cinchonaceous shrub . The leaves of this plant were formerly used in some of the religious ceremonies of the New Zealanders. 141 . CORDIA MYXA.  --  This produces succulent , mucilaginous , and emollient fruits , which are eaten . These qualities , combined with a slight astringency , have led to their use as pectorals , known as Sebestens . The wood of this tree is said to have furnished the material used by the Egyptians in the construction of their mummy cases ; it is also considered to be one of the best woods for kindling fire by friction . 142 . CORDYLINE AUSTRALIS.  --  The Australian Ti , or cabbage tree , a palm-like plant of 15 to 20 feet in height . The whole plant is fibrous , and it has been suggested as good for a paper-making material . The juice of the roots and stem contains a small amount of sugar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UMBRACULIFERA.  --  The Talipot palm , a native of Ceylon , producing gigantic fan-like leaves . These leaves have prickly stalks 6 or 7 feet long , and when fully expanded form a nearly complete circle of 13 feet in diameter . Large fans made of these leaves are carried before people of rank among the Cinghalese ; they are also commonly used as umbrellas , and tents are made by neatly joining them together ; they are also used as a substitute for paper , being written upon with a stylus . Some of the sacred books of the Cinghalese are composed of strips of them . The hard seeds are used by turners. 144 . COUROUPITA GUIANENSIS.  --  The fruit of this tree is called , from its appearance , the cannon-ball fruit ; its shell is used as a drinking vessel , and when fresh the pulp is of an agreeable flavor. 145 . CRATAEVA GYNANDRA.  --  This West Indian tree yields a small fruit which has a strong smell of garlic , hence it is called the garlic pear .

TAMARINDUS INDICA.  --  The tamarind tree . There are two varieties of this species . The East Indian variety has long pods , with six to twelve seeds . The variety cultivated in the West Indies has shorter pods , containing one to four seeds . Tamarinds owe their grateful acidity to the presence of citric , tartaric , and other vegetable acids . The pulp mixed with salt is used for a liniment by the Creoles of the Mauritius . Every part of the plant has had medicinal virtues ascribed to it . Fish pickled with tamarinds are considered a great delicacy . It is said that the acid moisture exhaled by the leaves injures the cloth of tents that remain under them for any length of time . It is also considered unsafe to sleep under the trees . 403 . TANGHINIA VENENIFERA.  --  This plant is a native of Madagascar , and of the family Apocynaceae . Formerly , when the custom of trial by ordeal was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great repute , and unlimited confidence was placed in the poisonous seeds as a detector of guilt . The seeds were pounded , and a small piece swallowed by each person to be tried ; those in whom it caused vomiting were allowed to escape , but when it was retained in the stomach , it would quickly prove fatal , and their guilt was thus held to be proven . 404 . TASMANNIA AROMATICA.  --  The bark of this plant possesses aromatic qualities , closely resembling Winter 's bark . The small black fruits are used as a substitute for pepper . 405 . TECTONA GRANDIS .  --  The teak tree .

The active principles of the leaves are theine and a volatile oil , to which latter the flavor and odor are due . So far as climate is concerned for the existence of the tea plant in the United States , it will stand in the open air without injury from Virginia southwards . A zero frost will not kill it . But with regard to its production as a profitable crop , the rainfall in no portion of the States is sufficient to warrant any attempt to cultivate the plant for commercial purposes . But this does not prevent its culture as a domestic article , and many hundreds of families thus prepare all the tea they require , from plants it may be from the pleasure ground or lawn , where the plant forms one of the best ornaments . 409 .

It is a climbing orchid , and is allowed to climb on trees when cultivated for its fruit . In Mexico , from whence is procured a large portion of the fruit , it is cultivated in certain favorable localities near the Gulf coast , where the climate is warm . Much of the value of the bean depends upon the process of its preparation for the market . In Mexico , where much care is given to this process , the pods are gathered before they are fully ripe and placed in a heap , under protection from the weather , until they begin to shrivel , when they are submitted to a sweating process by wrapping them in blankets inclosed in tight boxes ; afterwards they are exposed to the sun . They are then tied into bundles or small bales , which are first wrapped in woolen blankets , then in a coating of banana leaves first sprinkled with water , then placed in an oven heated up to about 140 deg . F. Here they remain for twenty-four to forty-eight hours , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longest time . After this heating they are exposed to the sun daily for fifty or sixty days , until they are thoroughly dried and ready for the market . 423 . VATERIA INDICA.  --  This plant yields a useful gum resin , called Indian copal , piney varnish , white dammar , or gum anine .
