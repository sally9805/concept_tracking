txt Chicago this evening suffered one of the most destructive conflagrations that have occurred here since the big fire of 1871 . The loss is about $788,000 . It was at almost the exact geographical centre of the city that the flames started , and like the terrible disaster twenty years ago they began in a stable . In this case the stable was the property of the furniture manufacturer and politiolan , John IL Smyth , and was situated in the rear of his big house-furnishing establishment in West Madison , near Halstead , Street The flames speedily communicated to the furniture establishment , and a moment later to Kohl &; Middleton 's Dime Museum ; A general alarm to the fire departmeat was soon followed by special calls for extra engines , as the fire was seen to be gaining ground with extraordinary rapidity . In less than five minutes smoke was pouring from every window in the museum and was enveloping the huge six-story building occupied by Smyth . When , in a marvelously short interval , both structures had turned into a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodged in the upper stories of the buildings on ; the north side of Madison Street . A moment later the firemen along the thoroughfare found themselves working between two towering walls of fire . For a time it looked as though the conflagra. - tion would get beyond oontrol , and that as in 1871 it would sweep toward the lake-directly across the business district of the city . As if to add to the consternation , the wind had suddenly arisen and was blowing a stiff gale from the west . Probably twenty thousand people gathered in the neighboring streets and helplessly . watched the progress of the possible impending calamity . At this critical juncture the thOrough discipline of the firemen became apparent . The men , obeying orders , stood steadily in the street . where the flanies  --  scorohed them from either side , and after a fierce battle at length brought the fire in a measure under control . The immense blaze , however , continued to rage with intense fury in the buildings already partly destroyed . Theinuseum was nothing but a heap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling , one after another . For tunately they all fell into the ruins and no person was injured . Across the street , also , the walls soon succumbed to the furious onslaught Here the upper story of the three-story building on the northwest corner of Madison and Union Streets caught lire . Quickly following , the flames lodged around the windows of the fifth story of the Haymarket Theatre Building and were soon stretching along under the Mansard root Just west or the Haymarket Building was the five-story building occupied by the People 's Clothing Company . Here , also , the windows were on fire . Despite all efforts , the buildings between Union Street and the Haymarket block shared the fate of these across the street , and were wiped out completely . In the Haymarket the lire was confined to the upper story , but the whole building was filled with smoke and water . West of the Haymarket the damage was comparatively small . The first intimation the inmatee of Kohl and Middleton 's museum had of the close proximity of the Are was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a volume of smoke poured , filling the entire floor . A wild panto followed among the 400 persons in the building , most of whom , however , were on the first , floor watching a variety performance . These.Were first apprised of their danger by the stampede on the upper floors , and , as they arose and fled , precipitately toward the front door , the fire - appeared at the rear windows , increasing the terror of thc. crowd . The . emergency brought out a hero in the person of Policeman Patrick Sheehy . yoreing his way through the frightened people who were madly retarding one another in the jam at the exit , he stationed himself at the head of the stairs , and , drawing his revolver , declared his intention to kill the first person who refused to obey his orders . By coolness and determination he succeeded in quieting the crowd , and with one exception everybody reached the street in safety . The exception was C. H. Messenger , a young man who , before Officer Sheehy reached the stair landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build-ing , and , throwing open the window , jumped out into the street . He fell on the stone pavement and was unconscious when picked up . As soon as Officer Sheehy had caused an abatement of the panic among the people , he went up to the third floor where some scores of monkeys were caged . The poor brutes were chattering and screaming with terror . Sheehy hurriedly seized the iron bars , aud , forcing them apart , opened an aperture wide enough to admit of the escape of the little animals , whose fright was almost human . The creatures when liberated wildly scampered about the room for a moment , and then , with innate perverseness and to the intense chagrin of Sheehy , who was risking his life every . moment , rushed up stairs in a - herd and were burned to death by wholesale . The policeman was forced to grope his way down through a blinding smoke andreaehed the street dazed and nearly unconscious . The excitement among the freaks who were on exhibition oh the third floor was pitiful to behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their abnormal development , or lack of development , and could only with difficulty be restrained from throwing themselves from the windows . Clarence Dale , the Dig-beaded boy ; Zola Lorengo , the albino ; Mine . Carver , the fat woman , who weighs 900 pouuds , and her son , who is a wee mite of a boy and is exhibited as a midget ; were on the platforms . Mine . Carver hobbled down , and , seizing the midget , dragged herself to the rear window , and was about to throw the child out when she was restrained by Manager Belmont , who , with difficulty , escorted them down the stairway . A. D. Lafayette , the rather of the big-headed boy who was so top-heavy that he could not navigate alone , rushed to the assistance of his son , and while leading him out found the Albino , al nest blind by reasoner her weak eyes , groping about in the smoke . With the big-headed boy under his ann , he seized the Albino and dragged rather than led her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty fire engines and nearly three htindred firemen to bring the fire under suhjection , Several times it seemed as if the men would be compelled to abandon their engines , so intense was the heat , but cheered on by indefatigable superiors , they managed to withstand the heat by turning the hose upon themselves . The nerve displayed by the firemen was heightened by the fact that all the time they knew that at least a hundred barrels of oil were stored in the basement of the Smyth establishment , likely at any time to create a terrific explosion . Just before the west wall of the Smyth Building fell a venturesome lad climbed up to the third floor of the building adjoining and stood watching the flames from his lofty position . When the wall toppled over with a loud crash and the smoke cleared away he was not seen Where he had been standing , and it Di feared that ho went down ' With the debris and was lost in the lire . The heat was too intense for the firemen to make any search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the ruins are sufficiently cooled to attempt the search . The loss , aggregating over three-quarters of a million dollars , is distributed as follows : John M. Smythe , furniture , stock , and building $500 , - 000 ; Kohl &; hIiddleton , curiosities . natures . and building , $85,000 ; Neely Brothers , boots and shoes , $20,000 ; Aldebert KaoMhfer , jewelry , $45,000 ; Alfred Feats , wall paper , $60,000 ; Baer Brothers , hats , $10,000 ; M.

Miscellaneous losses , 3,000 . The insurance will be very light , John M. Smyth carrying only about $125,000 , while Kohl &; Middleton and hi . Irrman carried none whatever , having allowed their polities to expire without renewal , as they had intended moving within a fortnight . The fire in the Haymarket Theatre was discovered just twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smoke was barely perceptible when the manager stepped out on the stage and endeavored to persuade the audience to file out in order . At this moment some one in the audience shouted " Fire : " and a panic seemed imminent . Tile excitement was partially subdued by prompt work on the.part of the ushers , and the theatre was cleared to fairly good order . Barry and Fay 's company had just begun a week 's engagement . Their scenery and effects were removed without damage . While the fire was at its worst a sidewalk at the corner of Union Street and Meridian Court collapsed and precipitated forty people into an excavation beneath . Mrs. Bessie Higgins was probably fatally injured by the fall . Bernard Sloth had a leg broken .
