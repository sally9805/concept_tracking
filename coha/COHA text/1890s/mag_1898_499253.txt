IV . THE LAST OF THE CONFEDERATE CRUISERS . BY JOHN THOMSON MASON H , FORMERLY MIDSHIPMAN OF THE " SHENANDOAH . " Y ITH the exception of the Stonewall , an ironclad built in France and got to sea too late to be of any service , the Shenandoah was the last of the Confederate cruisers to elude the vigilance of the neutral governments of Europe  --  a much more difficult feat to accomplish then than it had been when the Alabama and Florida made their escape from England , some two years earlier . On October 1 , 1864 , a number of Confederate naval officers , who had been for some time waiting orders in England and France , received instructions from Commodore Samuel Barron , who was the senior officer in Europe , with headquarters at Paris , to proceed at once to Liverpool , and report for duty to Captain James D. Bulloch , the Confederate naval agent there . I // was fortunate enough to be one of those officers , having been sent to Europe more than a year before to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seized by the English government before her completion . Upon our arrival at Liverpool , we were instructed to procure an outfit for a two years ' cruise as quickly as possible , to have our trunks packed in wooden cases so that they might have the appearance of ordinary merchandise , and to send them on board the steamer Laurel at Clarence Basin . Nothing was told us of the destination of the Laurel ; but if questioned by any one , we were to say that we were going home . These orders were issued on Monday morning , and by the following Friday the baggage had all been shipped , and the officers were instructed to remain at their respective quarters all day Saturday , ready to move at a moment 's notice . The utmost secrecy was observed , and not one of these officers , some twenty in number , knew what was to be the destination of the party ; nor did we seek for information , knowing that secrecy was of the essence of the undertaking . At six o'clock on Saturday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were received by us to be on Prince 's Pier at nine o'clock , and to go on board the tug Black Hawk . Twenty-three officers and about a dozen picked men , the latter being the remnant of the crew of the Alabama , which had been kept together for such an occasion , met at the rendezvous , and were soon carried on board the Laurel , then lying in the river ; and before daylight the next morning the Laurel weighed anchor and went to sea . The unsuspecting pilot who took us out complimented Captain Ramsey of the Laurel on the good behavior of his passengers , who all seemed to know their places at once , gave no trouble , and asked no useless questions . The Laurel was a small steamer owned by the Confederate government , and used afterward as a blockade-runner . She cleared for Matamoras , via Nassau , but her real destination was the Madeira Islands , where she was to rendezvous with the Sea King , afterward the Shenan&gt;doah , the latter having sailed from London the same day that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have mentioned , the Laurel had on board the guns , gun-carriages , ammunition , and all the other equipment and stores of a warlike nature intended for the Shenandoah . Five days of rapid steaming , with fine weather and a smooth sea , brought us to Madeira , where we anchored VOL . LVJ. - 76. in the beautiful harbor of Funchal , to await the arrival of our consort , whose movements had not been so rapid as ours . The Sea King had been purchased in London by an English merchant who was engaged in the shipping-trade . She was loaded with coal and assorted merchandise , the latter being provisions and stores of a nonwarlike character intended for the cruise . She was supplied with a crew and officers from the English merchant service , and cleared for Bombay and other ports in the East Indies on a cruise not to exceed two years . She was an ordinary merchant vessel of the kind usually sent on such a voyage . None of her officers or crew , with the exception of the captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ship was bound on any other voyage than the one named in the shipping articles . In short , there was nothing about the vessel , officers , crew , or cargo to excite the suspicions of the most watchful , and the result was that she left her dock without difficulty or detention . At the moment of starting , however , Lieutenant William C. Whittle , who was to be the executive officer of the Shenandoah , was put on board as a passenger , under an assumed name . As soon as the ship was fairly outside of English jurisdiction , Mr. Whittle made himself known to Captain Corbet of the Sea King , showed his authority from the owner to purchase the vessel , took charge of her , and immediately shaped her course for the Madeira Islands , where she arrived a few days later than the Laurel . The Sea King did not come into the harbor , but signaled the Laurel from the offing , and we went out at once and joined her . The two vessels were run under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were anchored alongside , and the guns , ammunition , and other stores on the Laurel were transferred to the decks of the Sea King as rapidly as possible . Captain Corbet had with him a crew of forty or more , and we had hoped that most , if not all , of them would be only too glad to join us ; but in this we were grievously disappointed . After leaving London the sailors had soon discovered that something unusual was in the wind . They had become restive about the mysterious voyage upon which they were embarked , and when they found their vessel at anchor under a lonely and barren rock in mid-ocean , taking on an additional cargo , they demanded to know what it meant . Upon being informed of the true state of affairs , they became // very indignant at the deception which had been unavoidably practised upon them , and when asked if they would like to join the Shenandoah , they stubbornly declined our enticing offers of generous wages and liberal bounty . They upbraided poor Captain Corbet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , in unmeasured terms ; and but for our presence , I think they would have given him a ducking . The end of it all was that we paid them the three months ' wages , as a forfeit for the violation of the shipping articles , to which they were entitled under the English law , and turned them over to Captain Ramsey on the Laurel , to be landed by him at Teneriffe . Only a few firemen and coal-heavers remained with us ; and when ready for sea , instead of a crew of one hundred and fifty men , which would have been our proper complement , we could muster only nineteen , all told , including those in the fire-room , the cook , and a cabin-boy . Lieutenant Waddell , who was to command the Shenandoah , was much discouraged at this outlook . He thought it would be very unsafe to take the vessel on a cruise with so slim a crew , and talked of running into a French or Spanish port ; but the officers being called into council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in all probability our cruise would end in whatever port we made . We told the captain that if he would take the wheel , we would work the ship and do whatever else was needed until such time as we could pick up recruits from the prizes we might capture , or elsewhere , as occasion should offer . The captain having given his assent to this arrangement , the anchor was weighed , and on the evening of the 19th of October , just eleven days after the two vessels left England , we parted company with the Laurel and her cargo of growling sailors , and the cruise of the Shenandoah began . Short-handed we most certainly were ; but as the officers , including the captain and doctors , numbered twenty-four , we had , with our crew of nineteen , forty-three souls on board ; and as we were all in the best of spirits , able and willing to do any kind of work required of us , we were not so badly off , after all . The Shenandoah was a full-rigged ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas , having cross-jack , royal studding-sails , jib-topsail , and all the " high-fliers . " She had rolling topsail-yards , which were of great assistance to us in shortening sail in the early days of the cruise , when sailors were so scarce . She was a wooden ship with iron knees and frame , iron masts and bowsprit , and steel yards , and all of her standing-rigging was of wire . She was of the class of vessels known as " auxiliary screws , " having a propeller that could be hoisted out of the water when not in use , and a funnel that shut down , like a telescope , flush with the ship 's rail . Her engines were small , the steaming apparatus being intended for use only in calm weather , and she could not steam much more than eight knots an hour under the most favorable conditions . She was a fast sailer , however , and on more than one occasion during our cruise her log showed seventeen knots . 602 DRAWN BY W. TAMER , FROM A PROTOORAPA TAKEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOMINO TOE EROIRD . THE " SHENANnOAH . " Lieutenant Scales 's picturc was made from accurate mcasurements. // The armament , which was mounted under many difficulties during the first few days after leaving Madeira , consisted of six guns - two rifled 32-pounders forward , and four 8-inch shell-guns amidships . There were also two little brass " pop-guns " on the poop-deck , which the Sea King had carried as a merchantman . Our commanding officer , Lieutenant James I. Waddell , was from North Carolina . He had been an officer in the United States navy , and resigned at the beginning of the war to join the Confederate service . The executive officer , Lieutenant William C. Whittle , Jr. , was a Virginian , a son of Commodore William C. Whittle of the old navy , and had also seen service before the war . The other lieutenants were John Grimball of South Carolina ; Sidney S. Lee , son of Captain S. S. Lee of the old navy , and nephew of General Robert E. Lee ; Francis T. Chew of Missouri ; and Dabney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same class at Annapolis with Admiral Dewey , the hero of Manila Bay . Our sailing-master was Irvine S. Bulloch of Georgia , who had held the same position on the Alabama at the time she was sunk off Cherbourg ; he was a younger brother of Captain James D. Bulloch . The remaining ward-room officers were Surgeon Charles E. Lining of South Carolina ; his assistant , F. J. McNulty ; Paymaster W. B. Smith ; Chief Engineer Matthew O'Brien of New Orleans ; and passed midshipmen Orris A. Browne and John T. Mason , both Virginians . In addition to these , we had three assistant engineers , three master 's mates , and the four forward officers , boatswain , gunner , carpenter , and sailmaker . It would be difficult to describe the condition of the Shenandoah 's decks and of the ship generally at the start . The stores from the Laurel had been simply thrown on board , and lay about in hopeless confusion . The heavy guns and gun-carriages , in huge boxes , so lumbered up the deck that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vessel was new and strange to us all , and the stores put on board of her at London were stowed without any expectation of their being used during the voyage , so that everything had to be overhauled . The officers and men were divided into gangs , and went to work with a will . Fortunately for us , the weather continued fine , and in the course of ten days we had things in pretty good shape - port-holes cut and guns mounted and secured , magazines built and ammunition safely stored , the fore and after holds carefully restowed , and everything snug for the voyage . Meantime the ship was heading to the southward , the object of the cruise being to destroy the American whaling fleet , more particularly that in the North Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Sea . On October 29 , ten days after the cruise began , when about fifteen degrees north of the equator , we captured our first prize , the bark Alma of Searsport , Maine , bound from England to Buenos Ayres , and loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-five thousand dollars . All neutral ports being closed to us , and our own closely blockaded , we had no alternative but to destroy her ; so , the vessel and cargo being appraised and condemned as prize by a drumhead prize court , the Alma was scuttled within an hour after her capture . We took nothing from the prize but her ensign and chronometer , the officers and crew of the prize being allowed to take their personal effects , or baggage , with them when sent on board the Shenandoah as prisoners . We made it a rule from the start that there should be no pillaging of the captured vessels . If we needed stores for the ship 's use , we took them , but our sailors were never allowed to plunder on their own account . The Alma had a crew of nine men , six of whom joined us at once , and were a most welcome addition to our slender ship 's company . During the next few weeks we were in the track of vessels crossing the equator , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oak from Boston , the sides of which inclosed a freight less precious than that of its colonial namesake , but much more acceptable to us just then , it being an assortment of canned fruits and vegetables instead of musty parchments . The Charter Oak , however , gave us an accession which we had not anticipated , in the shape of the captain 's wife , sister , and little boy . As we had no accommodations for ladies , Captain Waddell gave them quarters in one of his cabins . A few days afterward we spoke a Danish brig , and transferred a number of our prisoners to her , paying their passage to Rio , to which port the brig was bound . On the 10th of November , about midnight , we captured a large ship called the Kate Prince , bound for Bahia , which we bonded , putting on board of her the captain of the Charter Oak and his family . Other vessels captured in this locality were the bark D. Godfrey , brig Susan , and schooner Lizzie M. Stacey , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 0 0 // From each of these prizes we received recruits for our ship 's company ; in some cases all hands volunteered , with the exception of the officers . In one case the captain himself expressed a desire to ship before the mast on the Shenandoah . This was the captain of the brig Susan . He was a German , and knew little and cared less about the war between the States , and was deterred from becoming one of us only by the consideration that such action on his part might prejudice the rights of the owners of the vessel and cargo in claiming their insurance money . Most of the sailors in the American merchant service were foreigners , and it was due to this fact that so many of them shipped with us when their vessels were destroyed . By the latter part of November we were pretty well to the southward , and early in December we entered the whaling-grounds of the South Atlantic . We did not stop to cruise here , as our principal field of operations was to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , we picked up one whaler , the bark Edward of New Bedford , with a good-sized whale alongside , which the crew were busily engaged in cutting up and trying out . We were now quite near the island of Tristan da Cunha , an outof-the-way place inhabited by some forty people , mostly English and Americans , who very seldom saw any one from the outside world , no vessels stopping there , except an occasional whaler to get fresh water and provisions . Having burned our prize , we ran into Falmouth Bay , the harbor of this little island , and put ashore the officers and crew of the Edward , and got from the inhabitants of the island some fresh meat , for which we gave in exchange flour that we had taken from the prize . This island was the first land we had seen since leaving Madeira , but we did not drop anchor , and no one was allowed to go ashore . On the 7th of December we took our departure from Tristan da Cunha , and shaped our course around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after leaving Tristan da Cunha we discovered that the coupling-band of our propeller-shaft had been damaged seriously , thus rendering our steaming apparatus useless for the time being . But as our main reliance in fast traveling was upon the sails , this accident caused us no delay . We got the propeller upon deck , however , and in the course of a few weeks the engineers repaired the injury as well as it was possible to do it at sea . In the meantime we continued our course under sail with fair winds and fine weather , which lasted until Christmas , when we encountered a very severe gale of wind , which continued for several days , and did us considerable damage . Late in the afternoon of the 29th of December , in about 40* south latitude , in the middle of the Indian Ocean , we very unexpectedly captured the bark Deiphine of Bangor , Maine . The gale of the previous few days had scarcely abated , and the sea was running very high , when the Deiphine came up astern of us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and the bark was under a good press of canvas , and to windward of us , so that we were very much afraid she would give us the slip before we could make sail . But the captain of the Deiphine had no suspicions , taking us for an Englishman , and ran close up to us for the purpose of exchanging signals . The Shenandoah was then hauled close up to the wind , and the bark passed under our stern , leaving us to windward , when we at once fired a blank cartridge from one of our little guns . The Deiphine at first paid no attention to this , but kept her sails full , and gained on us rapidly . We then cleared away the two forward guns , and prepared to give her a rifle-shot ; but before we were ready for this she hauled up her mainsail and hove to . Captain Nicholls of the Deiphine was of course greatly chagrined at the manner in which he had been caught ; and when informed that his vessel was to be destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , was a delicate and nervous woman , and that it would be as much as her life was worth to bring her from one ship to the other in such rough weather . Captain Nicholls pleaded so earnestly that Captain Waddell was much moved , and thought seriously of letting the bark go under bonds . At this juncture the first lieutenant suggested that the surgeon be sent off to see Mrs. Nicholls , which was done . Dr. Lining , upon his return , reported that she was a person of robust health and strong nerves , and that there was not the slightest cause for apprehension on her account . We had taken two stanch whale-boats from the Edward , and these were found very useful in transferring the crew of the Delphine in the high sea that was running . We brought all hands off safely , hoisting Mrs. Nicholls and the stewardess on board in a boatswain 's chair ; but it was nearly midnight before we got the bark on fire and resumed our course . The prisoners from the Deiphine remained with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife were taken into 4 // the ward-room mess and were given quarters in the starboard cabin . Mrs. Nicholls was a handsome woman , and after the first few days she was quite gracious , and would sit in the ward-room and chat with the officers and play checkers and backgammon with us . Captain Nicholls , however , was very melancholy , and refused to be comforted . One of the officers endeavored to rally him by saying : " Now , captain , just suppose that on the morning of the day you came up with us you had altered your course only a quarter of a point ; we should not have seen you , and you would never have been captured . " Captain Nicholls turned on him with a grim smile , and retorted : " That shows how much you know about it . That is just what troubles me ; I did alter my course that very morning exactly a quarter of a point , and that was the only reason why I was captured . " The weather cleared up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1865 , we made the island of St. Paul , which the sailing directions and all the books we had on board described as thrown up by volcanic action , and uninhabited . There was very little wind at the time , and when we were about five miles from the land some of the officers got permission to go ashore . We pulled off in a whale-boat , and upon reaching the island found , much to our surprise , that there were two Frenchmen in possession of the place , and that it was used as a fishingstation by these men , who came from the Isle de Bourbon , on the coast of Africa . They fished during the summer , and left in the fall with their catch , the winter season being too rigorous and stormy to stay on the island . It will be remembered that we were in the Southern Hemisphere , where January is midsummer . The water of the harbor literally swarmed with fish , and we very soon filled our boat . On one margin of the little bay we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to cook the fish that we caught from the other end of the boat . From St. Paul to Melbourne nothing of interest occurred ; but a few days before reaching Australia we missed a fine prize . Captain Waddell was extremely anxious to reach port in time for the mail for England , which left at the end of the month , and he was making all haste under steam and sail when we sighted a large ship , American rigged ; but the captain would not go out of his course to overhaul her , being of the opinion that she was the English ship Nimrod , which we had spoken a few days before . Most of the officers were of a different opinion , which was justified by the sequel ; for when we got into port we learned beyond a doubt that the ship in question was the David Brown , an American vessel , owned by the father of Mrs. Nicholls . Captain and Mrs. Nicholls had recognized the ship at once , and trembled for her safety . We caught the January mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On January 25 , 1865 , we made the land of Australia . About noon we took on board a pilot , and in the afternoon of the same day we were safely anchored in Hobson 's Bay , the port of Melbourne . We had expected to spend only a few days here , but the week of steaming just before reaching port , with the damage to our shaft sustained in the South Atlantic , and imperfectly repaired , had been productive of serious results . A diver who was sent down to examine the stern bearings reported the injury so great that it would be necessary to dock the vessel in order to make the necessary repairs . Thus our stay in Melbourne became a matter of weeks instead of days . The colonial authorities were extremely civil , and readily granted us permission to make the repairs required , and to take in coal and such provisions and other non-warlike stores as we needed . The citizens received us with the utmost kindness and hospitality , and did everything in their power to make our visit pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crowds of people came daily to visit the ship , and our decks were so encumbered with guests that it became impossible to do any work , and at the end of the first week we were compelled to establish visiting hours . While the work of repairs was going on , and we were enjoying the hospitalities of Melbourne , an incident occurred which for a time threatened to bring our cruise to an untimely end . Although most of the people were apparently in sympathy with us , there were at Melbourne a number of American shipping merchants , and they , with the American consul , tried in every way to involve us in a dispute of some sort with the authorities , in the hope that the ship might thus be detained or seized . Some of the men that we had shipped from prizes deserted shortly after we got into port , and one of these deserters was induced to make an affidavit that a British subject named " Charley " had been enlisted on the Shenandoah after she reached Melbourne . Armed with this affidavit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner of trade and customs , who happened to be A // the only member of the colonial government who did not sympathize with us , and demanded the seizure of the vessel for this alleged offense . The Shenandoah was then on the dry-dock , or slip , undergoing repairs to her stern-post , and the first intimation we had of the trouble was the appearance in the afternoon of a number of police officers and militia , who surrounded the ship-yard , told the proprietor that he would not be allowed to launch the vessel , and warned all those who were employed in making repairs to the ship to stop work . Thus , although the Shenandoah was not actually seized , and every one on board was free to go and come , yet in point of fact we could not have been more effectually detained . An officer then presented himself at the gangway , with a warrant for the arrest of Charley , and requested permission to search the ship for him , which was of course refused ; but the master-at-arms of the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and no one but the ship 's company and the hired mechanics were found on board . The colonial authorities were duly informed of the result , but were not satisfied . In the meantime all the carpenters , joiners , painters , and calkers who had been at work on the vessel left , the mechanics engaged in the repairs to the stern-post and shaft alone remaining . The gentleman who had the contract for this part of the work said at once that if we would provide his men with food and lodging , he would keep them on board until the job was finished , but that if they went ashore once they might be prevented from returning . We readily assented to the arrangement , and this , the most important work , went on without interruption . As for the rest , it was so far advanced that the ship 's carpenter could manage it . About nine o'clock that night an officer was sent from the Shenandoah with a communication to the government to the effect that the ship would be ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and that if the existing restraint was continued , Captain Waddell would haul down his flag , pay off his crew , and proceed home at once by way of England , leaving his vessel where she was . No reply was received to this letter , but it had the desired effect ; for the next day , as the afternoon tide came in , the policemen and militia disappeared . The repairs to the shaft were finished in the meantime , and when the moment for launching arrived the proprietor of the yard politely informed us that he was ready to put the ship into the river . We were launched safely at five o'clock , and what had threatened for a time to be a very serious complication was thus happily terminated within twenty-four hours , without causing us the least delay . It is needless to say that the Shenandoah had not shipped any men in the port of Melbourne , and that the story about Charley was a pure invention of the deserter who swore to it . After this we had no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed to get the ship ready for sea , having been three weeks in port , losing valuable time , with the principal object of our cruise unaccomplished . We bad been obliged to lighten the ship to put her on the ways , and three days were spent in replacing the coal and other stores , and in taking in such additional supplies as we needed before we were ready to resume our cruise . During this time the captain received numerous warnings of mysterious plots , alleged to have been set on foot by the American consul and his friends , to blow up the Shenandoah or set fire to her . Although we did not attach much importance to these anonymous communications , we kept a bright lookout , particularly at night , and no strange boat was allowed to approach the ship . On the morning of February 18 we weighed anchor and went to sea . Our crew of thirtyodd men had suffered somewhat from desertions at Melbourne , so that we were still deplorably short-handed ; and although we had applications enough to man our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtures to enlist men while in British waters . When the ship was fairly outside of English jurisdiction , however , it soon became known that there were a number of strangers on board ; and when these " stowaways* ' were mustered on deck they numbered fortytwo , about twice the number of our own crew - men of all nations , kindred , and tongues . Among them was the captain of an English steamer lying at Melbourne when we left , who had thrown up his command to come on board of us , and who was made captain 's clerk . These stowaways had been smuggled on board , and doubtless with the knowledge and connivance of the crew ; but I do not believe that a single officer knew that we had any one on board but the ship 's company when we left Australia , nor did one of the stowaways show himself until the vessel was fairly at sea . We shipped these men , and they made a most welcome accession to our crew . After leaving Australia we cruised for a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a succession of // gales and rough weather ; and from there we made our way to the North Pacific , and touched at Ascension Island , one of the Carolines , just north of the equator , which we knew to be the recruiting-station for whalers , it being the time of year for whale-ships to stop for fresh provisions before going to the Northern seas . Ascension Island is inhabited by Kanakas , who live in the most primitive style , having not even the elements of civilization . Sailing-vessels touch there from time to time , but up to the time we were there no steamer had ever been in sight of the island . As we approached the land the breeze left us , and we furled all sail and steamed into the harbor , to the terror of the natives , as , so far as their knowledge went , we were moving without any means of locomotion . In the harbor we found four American whalers , the ships Edward Carey and Hector , and the barks Pearl and Harrest , of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited the king of the island to make us a visit . He accepted the invitation , and came off from the shore in one of our boats , the captain 's gig , which we sent for him , escorted by a perfect cloud of native canoes containing the members of the royal household and his body-guard . The costumes of the people were admirably adapted to the climate , their bodies being tattooed from head to foot . They wear over this a " coat ' * of cocoanutoil , which gives the skin a fine gloss , and makes the tattooing show to greater advantage ; and when this is done , your Ascension Islander is in full toilet . The king and his suite came on board the Shenandoah with some trepidation , but were soon reassured by our manner toward them , and proceeded to examine the guns and engines with great interest and wonderment . After making the tour of the ship they sat down on the deck and smoked pipes with us , and we conversed through an interpreter , an English convict who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . Upon getting up to take their departure , our guests unwittingly left a portion of their costume behind them , and the next morning we had extra work in holystoning the deck . We took some stores from the prizes to replenish our supply , and then burned all four vessels , after putting the crews ashore on the island and giving them such things as they needed in the way of clothing and provisions from their ships . On April 15 we went to sea again , having spent two weeks at Ascension Island , and continued our northerly course . Upon reaching the outer edge of the Japan seas , we cruised there for about a week in the track of vessels crossing the Pacific ; but meeting no American ships , and our principal object being to capture whale-ships , we went on to the Okhotsk Sea , which we entered on the 20th of May . We accomplished little in the Okhotsk , the only prize we captured there being the whaling-bark Abigail , which we burned , taking the officers and crew on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice very heavy in the Okhotsk . One morning , when pretty well up north , during a calm with a dense fog , we forged into one of these immense floes , and when the fog lifted we were completely surrounded by ice as far as the eye could see . Fortunately for us , the weather remained calm , and we were able to work out of our uncomfortable position without serious damage . We cruised three weeks in the Okhotsk Sea ; but either there were no more whalers there , or else we could not find them , and at the end of that time we passed out , and shaped our course for Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean . Our prisoners from the Abigail were a very jolly set , and bore their misfortune with great cheerfulness . Almost every evening they would enliven the monotony of their captivity by a dance on the forecastle or a " shanty . " Fifteen of these men joined us , among whom were two of the mates . On the twenty-first day of June we entered Bering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having completed half the circuit of the globe in an easterly direction , we gained a day ; but before nightfall we went out of our course to chase a ship , which carried us back to the other side , and our new day was lost almost as soon as won . The following morning , however , we again crossed the central meridian , and the 22d of June was a double day , forty-eight hours long . The sight of large pieces of " fat-lean , " or whale meat , floating in the water now warned us that whalers were at work near by , and very soon afterward we came up with several . The week which followed was the busiest of the cruise . Not a day passed without our making one or more captures . In all we took twenty-five whale-ships , which , with the exception of three or four , were burned . Some disposition had to be made of the prisoners , and as we could not put them ashore in those frozen regions , we were obliged to bond one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of the crews of the others . One of the vessels which we bonded was in charge of a woman , the wife of the captain , who had died // at sea . Occasionally , when the weather was fine and we had more prisoners than we could conveniently accommodate on board , we put them astern in whale-boats for the day . On one occasion we had twenty-four of these loaded boats towing astern . Our last capture was made on the 28th of June , on which day we took eleven vessels . Nine of them were fired , and were all burning at the same time within a few miles of one another . One of these eleven vessels had been caught in an ice-floe , and was so badly injured that her captain had determined to abandon her , preparatory to which there was a sale of all the movables on board , which the other vessels had assembled to attend . Most of these were at anchor near tbe injured vessel , and hence we captured them all with but little trouble . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted the poop-deck of his ship , armed with a bomb-gun used in killing whales , and threatened to fire into the boat which was about to board him . The officer in charge of the boat , however , disregarded this threat , and pulled to the gangway and went on board with his crew . When the flag was about to be hauled down , another scene of the same sort was enacted ; but by this time the boarding party had discovered that the belligerent captain had been celebrating the occasion , and was royally drunk . He was taken in charge after some resistance , and refusing to leave his ship , had to be lowered into the boat with a block and tackle . Several of the ships , when they saw what was going on , slipped their cables , and steered , some for the shore to get within the marine league , and some for the ice-floes ; but as the wind was light , and we had steam up , we very soon had them all in hand . We were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Ocean , where we encountered heavy floes of ice , and the navigation was very dangerous . There was every reason to believe that a number of whalers had passed into the Arctic ahead of us , and we hoped to come up with them ; but the captain was afraid to venture very far , the ice being so heavy ; and after a day spent in the Arctic , we turned and steered to the southward . On the 5th of July we passed out of Bering Sea into the open Pacific , and saw the last of the ice-floes . For the next month nothing occurred to break the monotony of ordinary sea life on the Shenandoah . We were steering to the southward to get into the track of the China traders and the Pacific mail-steamers . By VOL . LVJ. - 77- 78. the end of the month we were in the desired cruising-ground , and on the 2d of August we overhauled and spoke the English bark Barracouta , from whom we received news of the collapse of the Confederate government . While in the Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the captured whalers , California papers of April 22 , giving an account of the assassination of Mr. Lincoln and the evacuation of Richmond ; but the same papers contained the proclamation of Mr. Davis , issued from Danville , saying that the war would be prosecuted with renewed vigor . We had hoped all along that the disaster might not be as bad as these accounts stated ; but the Barracouta had left San Francisco on July 20 , and it was impossible to doubt the correctness of the news she gave us , and yet so strong had been our faith that it seemed incredible to us . The important question now arose as to what was the proper disposition to be made of the Shenandoah . Captain Waddell at first thought of taking the ship to Australia , and running into Sydney or back to Melbourne , and the course of the ship was altered with that view , and for twenty-four hours we steered for Australia . At the end of that time , however , the captain changed his mind , and the course was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn , the captain announcing to the officers and crew that he had determined to take the ship to the nearest English port ; but her actual destination was not made known to any one . Immediately after parting company with the Barracouta , the guns of the Shenandoah were dismounted and sent below into the hold for ballast ; the port-holes , which were of our own construction , were boarded up again ; and all the small arms and warlike appliances were stowed away between decks . We kept the ship under sail most of the time , with propeller up and smokestack " reefed , " saving the little fuel that remained for condensing fresh water for the use of the ship 's company , and for any other emergency that might arise . After doubling Cape Horn , the question of the ship 's destination was again agitated among the officers . Were we bound for Cape Town , or would we go on to Liverpool ? Cape Town was , in point of fact , the nearest English port , but it was thought by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . As between Cape Town and Liverpool the ward-room officers were about evenly divided , and the question was very fully discussed by them , and their respective views // were made known to Captain Waddell by written communications addressed to him . The captain finally called a council of the five lieutenants , and submitted the question to them . At this deliberation the first lieutenant declined to vote , on the ground that he was the executive officer , and as such had already fully expressed his views to the captain ; his preference , however , was for Cape Town . The remaining four lieutenants voted one for Cape Town and three for Liverpool , and thus the matter was finally decided . While the subject of the final disposition of the ship was being discussed , Captain Waddell expressed to two of the officers the opinion that , as government property , the Shenandoah reverted to the conquering power , and that it would be , perhaps , strictly considered , proper to take the ship into a United States port and surrender her . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it was made , was not further considered . Many of the officers thought that the best course , and a perfectly proper one , would be to destroy the ship and go ashore in the boats ; but to this the captain would not give his consent , and it was therefore abandoned . We kept steadily on our course , and as far as possible gave everything a wide berth . Our crew , augmented by the stowaways from Melbourne and volunteers who had joined us from the prizes captured , now numbered about one hundred and thirty men , of all nations under the sun ; and as they were acquainted with the unfortunate termination of the war for the South , and knew that the Shenandoah had no government behind her , we had contemplated the possibility of having some trouble with them . But in this we were agreeably disappointed , for every one of this cosmopolitan crew behaved with perfect subordination . Our first lieutenant , Mr. Whittle , had from the start preserved the most admirable discipline on board at all times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent management of the crew that no difficulty occurred . On September 29 we struck our track of the year before in the South Atlantic , and early in October crossed the equator . So far we had not lost a man by sickness or accident , but we had now two very sick men on board . There is a superstition among sailors that , however long a sick man may last at sea , he is sure to die as soon as he " smells the land . " Our two invalids respected this superstition , for they died within a few days of each other , and less than a week before the ship reached Liverpool , and when some of the old sailors declared they could smell the bogs of Ireland . On the 5th of November , 1865 , we reached England , anchoring in the Mersey on the morning of the 6th , and the cruise of the Shenandoah ended , the vessel being surrendered to the English authorities . When we took on board the pilot , the first question we asked him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping against hope that there might be some mistake about the news we bad received in the Pacific . This called forth an amusing cartoon from " Punch , " representing the Shenandoah , with Captain Waddell , astride of one of his guns , shouting through a huge trumpet to a pilotboat in the distance : " Is Queen Anne dead ? " 610 I BOSON BY W. TABER , FROM A SKETCH LENT BY JOHN T. BOSON . FAREWELL TO LAWRENCE ISLAND PRIZES . I // THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SPANISH FLEET DESCRIBED BY EYE-WITNESSES . THE naval battle of Manila Bay on May-day , 1898 , will be ranked by historians of the American navy with Perry 's victory on Lake Erie and Farragut 's attack on the forts of Mobile Bay . Splendid as an example of American daring and skill on the part of Admiral Dewey , it is unique because of the terrible loss inflicted on the Spanish , without the death or serious injury of a single man on the American fleet . Like the shot of the " embattled farmers " of 1775 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone round the world , and has shown to the nations the efficiency of the American navy . The guns of the American fleet were heavier than those of the Spanish squadron , but the Spaniards , in addition , had several shore batteries with formidable guns . On the lunette in front of the city of Manila were several ten-inch Krupp guns , and on Cavite fortress , which guarded the harbor , were batteries of six- and eight-inch guns . The battle was fought mainly at a distance of from twenty-five hundred to thirty-five hundred yards , or , roughly , between a mile and a half and two miles . At this range accurate marksmanship was imperative . Even at the lesser distance the Spanish fire was ineffective . The simple truth is that the Spaniards had had no target practice , while on most of the American ships target-firing was a regular monthly duty . The absolute lack of skill of the Spanish gunners was demonstrated by their waste of ammunition while the American fleet was drawn off for breakfast . They kept up a continual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown them that all their shells fell short . At close quarters they were equally powerless to inflict damage , for both the Baltimore and the Olympia approached very near to Cavite in the second engagement , and succeeded in silencing the guns of the fortress without suffering the loss of a man , and without material damage to either ship . And after this the little gunboat Petrel dashed up and down close inshore , destroying the Spanish gunboats , and silencing the remaining shore batteries ; and she also escaped unscathed . The narrative of the battle is told in much detail in the following statements by three Americans who witnessed it . They arrived at San Francisco on June 7 , and their accounts as here given for the readers of THE CENTURY are the fullest made by them , and have been authorized by their signatures . Colonel George Alvin Loud , who had served as paymaster of the revenue cutter MeCulloch , but who was relieved just before the fleet sailed from Hong-Kong , secured permission to serve in the battle . He watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what he saw through his glasses . Dr. C. P. Kindleberger was junior surgeon on the battle-ship Olympia , and was able to give most of his time to observation of the battle . The third account is given by Joel C. Evans , gunner of the Boston , who furnishes a graphic picture of the scene below among the men who did their part in securing victory for the American fleet . I. NARRATIVE OF COLONEL GEORGE A.
