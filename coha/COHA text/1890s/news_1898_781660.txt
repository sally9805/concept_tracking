txt We observe that the proprietor of our esteemed and enterprising yellow contemporary The Journal has carried his characteristic enterprise into Cuban wa-ters . He has there , with his own hand , so to speak , , captured some twenty survivors of the Maria Teresa , huddled on the beach , and turned them over to the proper authorities . This is the most genuine as well as the most legitimate increase of circulation , so to speak , which he has of late achieved , and is a subject for honest pride , beyond the fear of 11-valry . We admit that we can not Imagine Mr. PULITZER in the act of corraling shipwrecked Spaniards for the glory of his journal and his country . It is true that the choice of the prisoners was , so to say , HObsonian . The unhappy Spaniards were between the yellow journalist and the deep sea .. Literally they were between ? the deep sea and the truculent Cuban , who would undoubtedly have caught them and practiced upon them with machetes if they had stayed where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this fate is course for which , in the circumstances , the most austere moralist would find it difficult to blame them , except possibly upon the score of taste . We observe with interest that our other esteemed contemporary The Sun , in partaking of the dispatch which tells how Mr. HEAitsT gathered in the Spaniards , suppresses his name , in which so large a part of the interest resides . It disguises him under the style of " The Sun correspondent " and other opprobrious but unidentifying names . This is unseemly jealousy . The captures were of The Journal not of The Sun . They can not make out The Sun 's English , while The Journal 's pictures will be as comprehensible ' to them as to anybody else . If . The . Sun is not above partaking The Journal 's news , it ought to be above suppressing the glory of The Journal 's military and naval operation ..
