txt At the close of the hearings before the Supreme Court Rapid Transit Commission . ers , Charles Sooysmith said that a. syndicate had been formed to bid for the contract of constructing and operating the underground road , if the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court should make a favorable decision upon the Commissioners ' report . He also added that he was interested in the syndicate , and had assisted in organizing it . It developed yesterday that the syndicate referred to by Mr. Sooysmith had been completely organized ; that it was composed of capitalists such as the Asters , the Vanderbilts , and J. Pierpont Morgan , and that it stood ready to bid for constructing the road and operating it for fifty years , just as soon as the question of having such a road is determined and the final draft of the contract is made . Another development yesterday was one that has already lessened Brooklyn 's opposition to the rapid transit system , and that was that it was proposed to have the system made accessible to Brooklyn as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East River from Broadway and Ann Street , New York , the terminus of the subway , to Fulton Ferry , Brooklyn . One of thr men most heavily Interested in the enterprise is Emerson of the firm of Emerson &; Co. , 40 Wail Street . When asked about the syndicate yesterday , he gave the names of the capitalists mentioned above , ana said that those were only some that were fresh In his memory , and that many others were associated with him in the scheme . Frederick B. Esler , a lawyer , also at 40 Wall Street , is a prominent member of the syndicate , and has been largely instrumental in its organization . He is also interested in the New York and Brooklyn Railroad tunnel under the East River . He said last night that it was the fact of the two tunnels approaching each other at a common terminus at Broadway and Ann Street that suggested the forming of the syndicate that could manage both jointly and contribute to the transit facilities of both cities . Not a Cent Added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misconceptions and a lot of misinformation about the rapid transit road " said Mr. Esler , " and the most dangerous , because it might defeat the plan , is the erroneous assumption that the city 's debt limit may be exceeded . So far from exceeding the debt limit of either the present or the future City of New York , I can say that not one cent of indebtedness Will be added by the construction of the rapid transit road . Instead of indebtedness , the city merely acquires without risk , or expense , a valuable property , worth many millions of dollars . How is this to be accomplished ? Why , in the simplest manner possible . The city pays out no money , either for past or future work . All that it does is to allow the use of its credit . It is to issue and sell bonds , it is true ; but in the first place these bonds will cover work already done and can not , even in the most violent construction of the provisions regarding the debt limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will more than equal the yearly issue of such bonds . In the second place , the bidders for the contract must give security for the payment of the interest on the bonds , and for the setting aside every year of at least I per cent . of the issue as a sinking fund which , in fifty years , will more than pay for the bonds . " Now , where does the city incur a debt , or even assume an obligation that may become a debt in the future ? It pays out no money , as the bonds are sold in open market , to any responsible persons , except the bidder for the contract . The interest on the bonds is paid by the syndicate or company operating the road . And , finally , the sinking fund , which the company is required to set aside , pays off the bonds at the end of fifty years , and the rapid transit road , in perfect condition , no matter what it may have cost the company that constructed and operated it . is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for fifty years , without the expenditure of a cent . Brooklyn 's Interest in the Plan , " I said that the East River tunnel suggested to us the idea of forming a syndicate for bidding on the rapid transit road . It was observed that the proposed terminus in New York of both subways was at Broad-'way and Ann Street . This suggested the scheme of a joint terminal , with the possibilities of running trains to and from Brooklyn , or continuoaa trains irons the northern terminus to and from Fulton Ferry , Brooklyn , which would give to that city also the advantages of rapid transit . This would be entirely practicable . The East River tunnel will be constructed by our syndicate without any sort of doubt , and if we get the contract for operating the rapid transit road , we could easily arrange to run the trains to and from Brooklyn . " This consideration should modify Brooklyn 's opposition to the rapid transit scheme , and I have heard that it has already had its effect . That city , very naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid transit plans . " As to the syndicate itself , Mr. Esler said that it was composed of capitalists in this city who were able to build many such roads , and able , also , to furnish unquestionr , ble security ' for the fulfillment of their pledges . He said that the syndicate included the company that was formed to build the Elm Street route . The construction part of the contract was , he said , under the direction of Charles Sooysmith . Cost of Building the Subway . " The cost of constructing the subway , " said Mr. Eslet , " has also been greatly exaggerated . The limit set by the act , *3:x , - 000,000 , is ample . We had this part of the matter very carefully estimated by Mr. Sooysmith , and we are ready to build the road and put it in operating condition within that limit . A great deal has also been said about the length of time required for building the rows . It would be to our interest , of course , to build it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two years . We will follow , however , the terms of the contract in this as In every other respect . " I could say positively that our syndicate will bid for the contract if I knew its exact conditions . We are only awaiting the final draft , If the terms of the act are followed , we shall bid . "
