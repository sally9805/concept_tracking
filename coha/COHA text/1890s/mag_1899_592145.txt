IMPROVEMENT IN CITY LIFE . II . EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS . IN the history of our civic progress , the problems that may be grouped under the head of education early had the advantage of harmonious treatment . The public schools gave a unity to educational effort that was slow in asserting itself in philanthropic endeavor . With the sentiment chiseled on one of the sides of the Boston Public Library , " The Commonwealth requires the Education of the People as the Safeguard of Order and Liberty , " the public school *ystem has grown , till no American community is too small or too poor to have its schoolhouse , no city district so rich and cultivated as not to need one . All other educational movements dovetail into it . But it somatimes seems as if the excellence of the idea and the magnitude ' of the machine had dazed us , for we stand aside to watch the wheels go round , with a strange sense of individual irresponsibility . We talk proudly and bravely , and let local shortcomings grow into common abuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school than to improve it ; and now no problem in the field of civic education is more urgent than reform of the school system by the personal interest of parents . Fortunately , public spirit is turning to this fundamental problem . In a few cities , the curious spectacle is presented of the teachers summoning the parents to come to the schools and offer criticisms . And these invitations are accepted . In Brooklyn , for instance , in the winter of 1898 , it was not unusual for the school halls to be crowded by parents who came in hundreds . But in a number of cities the abuses in the schools have been such as to invite , with a very direct invitation , more vigorous measures . A recent illustration is afforded in Buffalo . A school association was formed . In June , 1896 , it appointed a visiting committee , who , at a public meeting in March , 1898 , presented a report that was a severe arraignment for bad sanitation and overcrowding , and later published the report in press and pamphlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Boston , Cleveland , New Haven , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , and San Francisco . In Cleveland , where several basements were found to be utilized as schoolrooms , a committee of the common council investigated the matter , and made a rousing stat*ment . In Chicago , an educational commission was recently appointed by Mayor Harrison , which , after studying the school systems of various cities and consulting leading educators , recommended changes and offered suggestions for the management of the schools . In New York , the Public Education Association , composed of women , called a conference , a year ago , of similar associations in other cities , with such success that another congress is to be held in Philadelphia this year . The common , hasty judgment is that political control is alone responsible for the evils that have crept into the school system . In response to that idea has come the formation of bodies , of which the Independent Women Voters Association and the Public Schools Association of Boston are good examples . It is their purpose to eliminate politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capable men and women who have no interests at heart but those of the schools . The premise , however , is not entirely sound . The appropriation of many thousands of dollars , to be expended for contracts or in the payment of salaries to those who have no vote , // does offer strong temptations to politicians . But the investigations by citizens show also that , making allowance for the greater cost of public than of private work , much of the condition complained of is due to the recent very rapid growth of the cities . The fact was pointed out at Buffalo , for instance , that the average growth in population jumped from 4000 a year in the decade from 1870 to 1880 to more than 10,000 a year in the following decade . The former annual provision of new accommodations was , therefore , most inadequate ; and yet , every year , in the absence of definite census returns for an argument , the School Board had hesitated to make the larger demand for new structures which actual conditions required . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public schools . No department of city government now receives more earnest attention from city charter reformers . In none are more experiments tried , in an effort to eliminate objectionable features ; nor is there any public work in which women have taken a more prominent part . So closely is the welfare of the child connected with the school that such a condition is natural , and for this task a woman is well fitted . Tradition is nothing to her , since she did not found the system ; her mother love is not dazed by the splendor of statistics ; and there could scarcely be a surer way to drive her to a demand for the ballot than the assertion that in one city 2000 women teachers receive smaller pay than do the voting sweepers of the streets . At its meeting in 1896 , the General Federation of Women 's Clubs officially adopted , as the cause it would specially work to advance , the system of public education , from the kindergarten to the university . At that time 2000 clubs had membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts are diversified , almost invariably have a committee on education . The big Wednesday Club of St. Louis , for example , is credited with having secured the passage of the School Age Bill by the legislature . It established also a free kindergarten rbr poor children under the legal school age , out of which grew the kindergarten association . The Chicago Woman 's Club , which is said to be the largest of its kind in the country , has done impo*rtant work through its department on education . For one thing , it raised $40,000 in three months to make the manual training school at Glenwood possible . In good contrast , it gave an illustration of how it thought the schools should be cleaned . The recurrence in many different cities of the club name Woman 's Educational and Industrial Union is properly indicative of the direction which women 's earnest efforts take . Mixed clubs , such as the Twentieth Century Club of Boston , usually include an educational department . In city after city , also , women have worked their way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been a strong influence working within the school system itself . It dates from about 1870 . Since that time , manual training , kindergarten , nature study , and the study of literature have appeared , the high school has been generally developed , and the whole system has had a new impulse . This is due in part to changes in its urban organization which need not here be specified . Industrial training schools and courses have been grafted on the system of public education , in an effort to make it more practical . In Denver , Washington , Chicago , St. Paul , Baltimore , Boston , Cambridge , Brookline , Portland ( Maine ) , Springfield ( Massachusetts ) , Camden ( New Jersey ) , New York , Cleveland , Louisville , Toledo , Philadelphia , and some other cities , there are , as a part of the public school system , institutions which offer such training . The creation of many of these institutions is interesting , illustrating how individual influence // affects urban education . At Louisville , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , building , and equipment of a manual training school to the public school system . At Toledo , the organization of such a school was made possible by the legacy of a citizen , and the supplementary gifts of his sons and others . At Philadelphia , in response to the request of an individual , a course in woodwork was established in 1880 at one school , for classes which met two days a week . The success of the experiment led the Board of Education to take charge of it the next year , and place it on a permanent basis . In 1885 the boys ' manual training school had grown out of it . The result was so cheering that in four years another such school was opened . These schools are ranked as of high school grade . As for the girls , sewing is common , and cooking is by no means rare , nowadays , in the city schools . The general course is again illustrated by Phila.delphia , where sewing was introduced in 1880 in the girls ' high and normal schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooking was brought into the girls ' grammar schools two years later . Boston is said to be the leader in the number of cooking and manual training departments in the public schools . Chicago took up the work for girls in the present school year , and is about to try the experiment of a commercial training school as a part of her system . Washington has a business high school , and Philadelphia has just opened a school for commerce . In several cities are to be found special industrial training schools , considerably advanced , and not a part of the public school system . The first of these was established at Chicago , in 1882 , under the patronage of the Commercial Club , and while not free was largely helped by an endowment fund furnished by individuals . Other schools of this kind are the manual training school of Washington , the technical school of Cmcinuati , the University of St. Louis , the New York trade school , and the Baron de Hirsch trade schools , also in New York . The facilities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,000 ,  - -  000 or more . Other of these institutioris are in the care of philanthropic societies , and even of churches . For instance , the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor , the Children 's Aid Society , and the United Hebrew Charities , in New York , are among those which maintain industrial or training schools . Beyond these , again , are such monuments to individual civic spirit and philanthropy as the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn , Cooper Union in New York , the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia , and the Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago . At some of these tuition is entirely free . At others , as at Pratt Institute , a merely nominal charge is made , to be expended in the advancement of the work . At all , classes by day and by night are opening better and wider avenues of profitable employment to thousands of young men and women of the cities . Still other cases represent the associated effort of so many publicspirited citizens as to be properly looked upon as belonging to the whole community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , there was laid the corner stone of the first building in the United States especially designed for a textile school , where theory will be offered as well as practice ; and Trenton , after years of talk , has now secured an art school for workmen in the potteries . The extension of the system of public instruction at its base , by the establishment of kindergartens , dates from 1871 . In the next year the matter came up at St. Louis , and a committee reported to the authorities that the only " play school " that received the direct support of a Board of Education was in Newark , New Jersey . In 1873 one was opened at St. Louis , and carried on by supplementing the city appropriation with private munificence. // Philadelphia , which quickly took and has long kept the lead in the movement , was without city kindergartens until 1887 . But associated private effort , under the title of the Sub-Primary School Association , had been so active for seven years that the city system was able to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement has spread very irregularly , but lately with great speed . How irregular was the early kindergarten development is shown by some figures selected from the report of the United States Commissioner of Education for 1895-96 . At that time , Boston was credited with 62 , Detroit with only 1 , Chicago with 37 , St. Louis 95 , New York 15 , Milwaukee 39 , Springfield ( Massachusetts ) 4 , and Denver 25 . There are now few cities in the United States without a school of this kind . Kindergartens founded by private philanthropy preceded official schools . Perhaps there is no more welcome instance of that sort than the success which last fall crowned the efforts of the District Colored Woman 's League of Washington , in conjunction with the Columbian Association , to have kindergartens adopted in the city 's school system . For two years the league had maintained a training school for young colored women , so that teachers might be ready when the time came . In most cases , municipal adoption of the kindergarten has not gone so far that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in supplementing them . In the limits of the old city of New York , for example , where in 1898 the number of public kindergartens was put at only 42 , 15 others were maintained by the kindergarten association . Again , at Cleveland , the Free Kindergarten and Day Nursery Association relieved the pressure on the public kindergartens by about an equal number under its own direction . The beginnings of the movement may be studied in Tacoma , where some earnest women , comprising the kinder VOL . LXXXIII. - NO. 499. 42 garten association , conducted one free kindergarten in a room which the School Board lent . Contemporaneously with this effort , the third international kindergarten convention held meetings in Philadelphia . In New York , last summer , kindergartens were opened on the play piers . It need scarcely be added that in the cities this movement is conducted by philanthropic and even religious bodies , as well as by those whose first object is education . Two concomitant movements have grown out of it : the training schools for kindergartuers , as illustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to bring the home and school into closer relationship . In Duluth , for instance , where there were 15 kindergartens in 1897 , the Board of Education reported that , during the fiscal year , 45 mothers ' meetings had been held in connection with them , 1827 visits had been made by kindergartners to the children 's homes , and a mothers ' club had been successfully organized , - " all this for the sake of broader acquaintance and sympathy . " At Dayton , Ohio , each of the 12 kindergartens connected with the public schools has a mothers ' club , and in some cities courses of lectures are offered to mothers . Another interesting development is in the way of cooperation . At Cincinnati there is a kindergarten association which maintains 5 kindergartens ( the first founded in the city ) and a kindergartners ' training school . To encourage the spread of the system , the association volunteered to organize and supervise kindergartens which might be supported by other organizations or by individuals , and to furnish these with pupil assistants from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable associations and 9 private kindergartens promptly availed themselves of the offer . Many trials , of varying wisdom , have recently been made to improve the intellectual quality of the instruction which // is given in the public schools . Of these , none is of greater value than the effort directed toward teachers . It has acted in multiplying normal schools and making a psychological study of childhood . It raises the standard of appointment ; it provides lectures , institutes , and summer schools for teachers ; and - though only lately , and still in little measure - it encourages higher salaries . Improvement in textbooks and in facilities for instruction , and rearrangement of courses , are other commendable results . But the impulse is not thus exhausted . With a generosity that in some cases is unwise , it adds demands for drawing , music , and physical culture . Against some of these efforts , which the less imaginative of the community tersely blast as " fads , " protest has arisen . It is pointed out that while doubtless creditable to the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take the scant time of pupils from the essentials of instruction , scatter their attention , and absorb money needed in other ways . In at least two Western cities which have come under my notice , drawing and music were offered in the public schools but the school funds ran short during the winter , and the community had the choice of closing the schools or keeping them open by a popular subscription . However advisable the ornamental branches may be , it would seem good sense to provide first for the essentials of education . An example has been furnished lately by Providence , where , last fall , the school committee , forced to cut their coat according to their cloth , discussed the choice of three propositions : ( 1 ) to reduce the school year by two months ; ( 2 ) to cut the salaries of teachers ; ( 3 ) to discontinue a number of branches of study recently introduced . The third course was chosen . Possibly , the effort of this nature to which least objection can be made is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of casts and pictures . Boston was the pioneer in the movement with a Public School Art League which was founded in 1892 . As yet , the universal idea is , to make no demand upon the public funds for the work , but by popular subscription and individual gift to encourage the adornment of the rooms of the public schools , so that the old bareness may give place to a beauty both uplifting and gratifying . The idea is credited to John Ruskin ; yet as far back as 1870 , ten years before the formation of the Art for Schools Association in London , tlwre had been an attempt on the part of two individuals to bring art into Boston schools . When the league was formed , the movement rapidly radiated from the city , reaching the immediate suburbs , and also Salem and Springfield . At Brookline the movement started the same year as in Boston , with a meeting of parents at one of the schools . So , gaining impetus as it traveled , it spread over the whole country . Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . In time State Library of New York and in the Public Library at Boston there are permanent exhibitions of such works of art . An exhibition of this sort which was held in Brooklyn three years ago , under the auspices of the Brooklyn Institute , was better than any similar exhibition that has been held in New England . In Philadelphia , in 1896 , there was an exhibition under the auspices of the Civic Club . Chicago , St. Louis , Denver , San Francisco , and Milwaukee are notable Western centres of the movement . At Cleveland an Art Education Society has been founded , and at Rochester and some other cities the movement is under the patronage of a woman 's club . Exhibitions are the popular means for awakening interest in the matter . They not only raise money to purchase works of art , but suggest gifts for individuals to make , whence , in some cases , memorial rooms have resulted . Within a few years vacation schools // have appeared . Here the educational purpose is secondary to the wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interest them . The movement has met with large success . In New York city there were half a dozen vacation schools in 1896 . In the summer of 1897 there were ten , all in the poorer districts , and crowded to their utmost capacity . At one of them , on the first day , which was insufferably hot , there was such a throng about the doors that it was merely an act of humanity to open them an hour before the appointed time . Then a thousand tickets of admission were issued . In New York this work was charitable , the instruction being paid for by voluntary contributions . With the season of 1898 it became part of the public educational system . All these schools are in the poorer districts , and , to their credit be it recorded , teachers and principals often volunteer to do the work , in continuance of their winter labors and without compensation . Boston , Philadelphia , Chicago , Baltimore , Indianapolis , Newark , Hartford , Cambridge , and Buffalo are other cities in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full of picturesque details ; and here again , as so often , private philanthropy precedes official action . School savings banks , of which the avowed purpose is " to teach children to save , " are educational mainly in the phrase . Two methods are used , - the stamp and the direct deposit . In 1897 the savings bank had been adopted in 280 schoolhouses of 63 American communities , and pupils had deposited $451 ,  - -  211 , mainly in pennies ; about one third of this amount was still on deposit . l An interestingly liberal example of this is to be found in the City History Club of New York . Started only in 1893 , it had risen to the dignity in 1898 of having more than sixty teachers and nearly a thousand members , and it hired a theatre for a rally of its classes . A newspaper , speaking of the club , said : " Its work is based on the principle that we must in City L1f*. 659 The School Children 's Street - Cleaning Leagues , inaugurated in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , aim to lead children to a higher sense of civic duty . Object lessons in the principles of city government and the machinery of elections have a similar general purpose . So have lectures on local urban history , 1 such larger courses as the Old South course in Boston , and the excursions for school children to patriotic shrines . It is common to extend to pupils of the public schools special privileges in admission to , or use of , many of the things which do much in cities to stir the intellectual life . Efforts for the intellectual betterment of the public schools , by extension of the course or its refinement , have their counterpart in efforts for its material advancement . A good deal of this is forced on the system . Buildings have been enlarged reluctantly to meet the insistent demands of growing population , and , except in a few new buildings in the larger cities , the sanitary advance has barely kept pace with the general gain in that direction . Yet it is impressive to learn how far the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great modern cities . A report of the Board of Education of the metropolis , at the beginning of tile fall term of 1897 , showed that within three years it had expended $8,000,000 for sites for school buildings . Within eighteen months it expected to open more than thirty new schools , some of which would cost $300,000 each , and would provide for between 1800 and 2500 pupils . In the fall of 1898 the estimates for the coming year asked for $24,500,000 for the schools . The newer buildings , in exknow a thing before we can love it . Its hope is to teach the people of New York to know the city - its history , traditions , growtn , and conditions - so well that they will not only love it , but will know all about it , and be able to think , talk , work , and vote intelligently and affectionately for it . " // tenor design and interior sanitary and pedagogical equipment , are equal to the best model schools in the world . But the interest in healthful surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that old buildings be improved , though less spectacular in its results , is quite as important . Daily medical inspection of schools , a practice which had its beginning in Boston , has been productive of such important discoveries that other cities are falling into line . In an argument by the superintendent of instruction at Springfield , Massachusetts , for baths in the public schools , an idea appears which is quite new in the United States , but which has been accepted in Germany . At least , it shows with what proper seriousness we are coming to regard the hygienic condition of city schools . To be classed with these movements are the occasional swimming lesson and the familiar fire drill . Comment on the universities and colleges opens a wide field . We have more institutions , creations of private or state munificence , which take one or other of these ambitious names , than we have great cities . The point pertinent to this review is that nearly all of the larger cities and many of the " second class " contain not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools of higher academic instruction . These , by means of their scholarships , financial aid to worthy poor students , and low tuition fees where any are charged , extend in practice the system of public instruction to the furthest limit . In many of our cities , it is now possible , for one who lives at home , to pass from the kindergarten to the end of the university course without paying a cent for tuition . His instruction will form a harmonious whole , ant he will make the progress in perfect gradation . Nor will he feel himself entirely indebted to private munificence even in his later work . The Western universities derive their support from the state ; and in the East it is usual for a city in which a college is situated to own free scholanships in it . At Philadelphia , the University of Pennsylvania received its magnificent site as a gift from the city . The higher education , though less general , is become little less democratic than the intermediate , and recent years have seen its field opened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools of our cities to-day stand virtually where the colleges stood fifty years ago . They give nearly as good training , and have generally longer student rolls . It is hard to feel the confidence and enthusiasm for the intellectual chances which cities offer to their adults that one feels for those offered to their youth . But the movement is becoming very characteristic . The majority of those who avail themselves of the instruction of lectures , libraries , galleries , and museums are persons who have profited by the earlier opportunity , and the value does not seem doubtful nor the outlay incommensurate with the work . The success of University Extension lectures , and the wide adoption of the system , make it a feature of urban life . In addition , an interesting experiment in free lectures to the people has been made in New York , under the management of the Board of Education , and is spreading to other cities . They are addressed to adults , are delivered in the evening in the schoolhouses , and are practically a lecture extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university . " They began at New York in 1889 . In 1896-97 the number of lectures was 1066 , in thirty-three centres , with an attendance of nearly 500,000 . The cost was only $40,000 . In 1897-98 there were fortyone centres and nearly 1600 lectures . The listeners are almost all workingmen and their families . The subjects treated are serious , but of universal interest . A recent annual report says that the intellectual advance is no less remarkable than is the statistical success of the leetures. // Courses are now given which eight years ago would have been impossible . Within the last few months , a number of lectures on sanitation , civil government , and American history have been given in Italian and colloquial Hebrew ; and for a course on educational topics some of the most eminent educators in the country were obtained . Chicago , Brooklyn , and a few other cities have since adopted the plan ; the course at Chicago having had the backing of the Field Columbian Museum , Northwestern University , Lake Forest University , and Armour Institute ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , not officially connected with education , have also taken up the work ; in Philadelphia the University Extension Society joined this year with the Board of Education for the purpose , while in Boston the Twentieth Century Club provided , in 1898 , a course of six free evening lectures at each of six public schools . Most of the lectures , following the rule in other cities , had illustration by stereopticon , piano , or blackboard ; and at two of the schools all were pertinent to one general subject . These lectures have been continued this year on Saturday mornings , in a smaller way ; but the city , under the guidance of Mayor Quincy , has taken up the evening lectures in school and other halls . The Lowell lectures at Boston , founded , by the bequest of a private individual , have been carried on for about sixty years . Five lectures are delivered each week from October to May , in a ball seating 800 persons . The high praise is bestowed on these that , by their excellence , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular lecture " which is elsewhere unknown . In another city an historical society provided in 1898 a course of lectures ; and it is needless to say of what an endless round of clubs , papers , and lectures , all instructive in purpose , the social life of cities is made up . In New York , again , the Educational Alliance does a great work . It is said that its building is daily visited by nearly 6000 persons , to attend lectures , clubs , classes , etc . From the lectures one comes to the great public libraries . Their foundation has been one of the earliest and possibly most striking proofs , after the parks , that our cities are outgrowing the first stage of development . In that stage even the large increase in city wealth left little chance for higher demands ; but our public libraries are said to - day to contain more books than those of France , Great Britain , and Germany combined . The libraries of the cities are of various creation . Boston 's splendid building and magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Chicago , the three great libraries , now working in harmony , show how generously individuals add to official provision . The public library of New York , homeless as yet , illustrates a city 's combination and use of private beneficence . Philadelphia , in her recent vote of $1,000,000 for a building for a public library which has long had corporate existence , is an instance of gradual development ; while St. Louis , which recently paid nearly $500,000 for a site for a library structure which it had not the money in hand to build , represents the effort at an earlier stage . Allegheny City and Pittsburg have received their libraries as gifts from a citizen , on the condition that they be maintained , at least in part , by taxation . Mr. Andrew Carnegie , the donor , said , in emphasizing this condition : " I am clearly of the opinion that it is only by the city maintaining its public libraries , as it maintains its public schools , that every citizen can be made to feel that he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of great service in nearly every case . In Boston , a department called the Home Library brings books directly to the tenements . A tenement house is selected to // be the neighborhood library for two or three months . A number of good books and children 's magazines are taken there and lent , and once a week a " person of sense , " as Dr. Hale has put it , meets the children and talks the books over . When the time is up , the library is passed on to another place . A similar work , though managed a little differently , is carried on in Chicago . The New York Free Circulating Library is also engaging in this work ; and last summer , through the interest of other associations , traveling libraries made their appearance in the vacation schools and playgrounds . In several cities there are libraries in the public schools . At Buffalo , where ten schools were so provided this year , the libraries are under the direction of the public library . A thousand books are put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transfer between the schools , so that the pupils in each have access to 3000 volumes during the year . A writer , in attempting to sum up the civic duty of an ideal librarian , said , in the Century magazine for March , 1897 , that it was " to adapt the contents of shelves and tables to the specific manufacturing , commercial , and artistic needs of a community , as at Worcester ; to name works illuminating the living question of the hour , as at Providence ; to court helpful relations with the schools , as at Detroit . " Provision of opportunities for the study of art comes later in the cities , whether its impulse be of private or of public origin . New York , Boston , and Chicago have their notable public galleries . The Metropolitan Museum of Art , in New York , is the largest in the country . Washington has its Corcoran Gallery ; Baltimore its Walter Collection , to which the public have access ; and Pittsburg , largely through the generosity of a citizen who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American paintings , has begun to form an interesting collection , and holds anin City Life . nual exhibitions which rank high , and for which there is an international commission of award . As lately as November , 1897 , Philadelphia appropriated by popular vote $200,000 for the erection of an art gallery . A collection of paintings belonging to a citizen had been offered to the city on condition that a building be erected to contain them . These works of art , said to represent the expenditure of $1,000,000 , enable the Philadelphia art gallery to open its career with paintings valued at $5,000,000 , - happily not the only indication of their artistic worth . It also has a large endowment fund ( by a Jegacy ) for annual purchases . The Metropolitan Museum of Art , in New York , was the direct outgrowth of a public meeting held in 1869 . It was ten years later that the legislature permitted the park board to begin the erection of the present building on park lands . The consideration was an agreement by the society to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holidays , besides giving special privileges to public school pupils and teachers . But the museum owes its collections to the public spirit of individuals . In New York , the spring exhibitions of the various art societies , of clubs , and of the Academy of Design have also that educational value which belongs to a city 's higher life . In Philadelphia , at the exhibitions of the Academy of the Fine Arts , the Civic Club arranges free evening receptions , the tickets for which are distributed through societies , guilds , manufactories , etc . Attendants in each gallery explain the pictures . In Boston , the Museum of Fine Arts has received nothing from city or state save the land on which it stands ; but it grants privileges similar to those of the Metropolitan Museum , and only one fourteenth of the persons who now visit it pay an admission fee . Private generosity has provided it with treasures and furnished a substantial endowment , and annual private subscriptions meet the current expenses . // For instruction in art , opportunities have improved rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed still missing ; but those traditions which contain its subtle suggestion are beginning to appear around the Art Students ' League in New York , while Copley Square in Boston has begun to be likened to the " Quartier " in Paris . In New York , the art schools of the Metropolitan Museum , of Cooper Union ( free ) , and of the National Academy of Design ( free ) perform a different but valuable function . The league , which has been called the most powerful and active academic art school in the country , has some fifteen hundred men and women enrolled in its classes every winter . It is self-supporting . In Philadelphia , the Academy of the Fine Arts has two hundred and fifty pupils in advanced work , and the city pays for free scholarships in the Pennsylvania School of Industrial Art , the Art Academy , and the School of Design for Women . In Washington , the free classes at the Corcoran Gallery are so well attended that the accommodation has been recently doubled . Cincinnati is proud of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Art , o#-ganized in 1889 . Both occupy splendid buildings , and both offer , as do some other art societies , traveling scholarships . In Detroit , Sunday museum lectures for the people have lately become a unique and popular feature . Chicago , besides its large gallery and school , has originated a peculiar and pleasant development of the art purpose in forming a collection of pictures from which the poor can take a picture as one would take a book from a public library . The borrower takes it home and keeps it for two weeks , and then returns it , to renew the loan or to draw another . The Civic Club of Philadelphia also manages a circulating gallery . In each of the larger cities , within the last few years , there have been free loan exhibitions of good paintings in the poorest quarters of the city , the interest in which is sometimes stimulated by asking visitors to name their favorite pictures . In other museums American cities have thus far made but little progress . The American Museum of Natural History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national collection in Washington , was organized about the same time as the Metropolitan Museum , on similar lines , and has had a similar history . The additions of 1898 to its structure include a lecture hall to seat twenty-five hundred persons , which is an index to its educational function . The Field Columbian Museum at Chicago is an outgrowth of the World 's Fair . The meeting of citizens in the summer of 1893 resolved " to establish in Cliicago a great museum that shall be a fitting memorial of the World 's Columbian Exposition , and a permanent advantage and honor to the city . " Very generous private donations were made , and extensive purchases and many gifts secured large and valuaAe exhibits from distant lands . The remarkable collection was housed in the Fair 's Art Building . It has already become a great institution , - has inaugurated popular lectures , established a publication series , and sent out some scientific expeditions . In some of the older cities , as Philadelphia and Boston , there are excellent historical collections on public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprung up , indeed , in nearly all the cities , and have gathered collections of interest and preserved many an historic shrine . The new Philadelphia commercial museums fill an immense building with a collection of natural and manufactured products , to which every city in the United States , it is said , has contributed , and all countries in the world . Museum exhibits in the department of natural history are supplemented by small collections of flora and fauna in the parks of many cities . These rarely deserve , or assume , the title of botani // cal and zo*Aogical gardens . The value , interest , and instructiveness of the exhibits , however , are bringing them rapidly into favor . The Arnold Arboretum at Boston - not strictly a municipal possession - is one of the famous gardens of the world ; Philadelphia is arranging a botanical garden on a strip of river bank that has long been an eyesore ; New York has made liberal provision of land in Bronx Park for a garden , which public spirit is splendidly equipping . In St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just cause for pride . It is not only an exhibition , but a school of botany . The donor gave the land for it and another tract for its endowment , and both scientific botany and market gardening are taught . Philadelphia and Cincinnati have for some years had notable zo6logical gardens . Philadelphia 's garden contains more than 1000 living animals , and was visited in 1897 by nearly 200,000 persons . Chicago has an important collection in q*e of the parks . New York , which has recently furnished the land ( in Bronx Park ) for a " zoo , " found public spirit ready to face the task of raising $250,000 by private gift for buildings and collections . The garden will be by far the largest of its kind in the world . In line with this movement is the city aquarium in New York , which was opened in Battery Park on December 10 , 1896 , and has gained a popularity measured by 10,000 admissions in a day . Music has a place in city problems and progress . By unofficial patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the great musical cities of the world . In no European capital is the opera given on a grander scale , and the National Conservatory of Music of America does a large work in the line of musical education . New Orleans has its French opera company ; and many cities have musical societies that , where the foreign element is large , have a dis tinct effect on the city life . Boston , in maintenance of its claim to culture , does the most for pure music . It has a music commission , officially appointed , to preserve the excellence of public music . It has a permanent orchestra , thanks to the generosity of an individual citizen , who cheerfully meets deficits in the thought that thus lie makes it possible for citizens to hear the best music at popular prices ; and the New England Conservatory of Music , which has an expense account of $250,000 a year , enrolls about twentythree hundred pupils . In Baltimore the Peabody Institute does a large work of this sort , and Cincinnati has in the endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports a permanent orchestra by subscription ; Pittsburg has one as a detail of the Carnegie Institute , though it has not required a subsidy ; New York was stirred to make a serious effort to secure one , and Indianapolis , thanks to the enterprise of its women , is in a fair way to succeed . Cincinnati maintained such an orchestra some years ago , and Buffalo has had one , largely through the generosity of an individual . In Boston , again , free organ concerts , serially arranged and with instructive programmes , have been tried with success ; and in a number of cities there are annual musical festivals . So , from the kindergarten and the university with its millions of endowment , from the whir of machinery in the technical school and the stillness of the public library , as well as from the crowded lecture hall , comes the impulse of education into the throbbing life of a great city . The improvement within a few years has been very marked . Not all is gained ; ' much must yet be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in any land , to chronicle such diverse and earnest activity for the upbuilding of the culture and the character of the whole people . These movements are without precedent in human history .
