txt Gold news took a curious turn yesterday . The National City Bank , which had $12,712,300 in gold in its vaults , according to Saturday 's bank statement , sent $1,000 , - 000 of it to the Sub-Treasury and withdrew greenbacks . Talk of engagement of gold for export not only ceased , but foreign exchange declined to $4.881/2 , at which rate exports are hardly profitable , even if they might not involve loss . Cables reported a probable shipment of ? 1,000,000 from London for New-York by the Majestic , which will sail to-morrow . While gold gains without offsetting losses seemed thus promised for immediate purposes , bankers thought the public should not attach undue importance to them . The City Bark 's deposit was impelled by the need of greenbackS : In the last three weeks that bank added $2,731,000 in gold to its stock , which had been increasing before that time . While it gathered the gold , dealers put a commission which amounted to a premium on greenbacks . Naturally the circulation of greenbacks was contracted . Remittances from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great quantity of sliver certificates to the banks , but not the usual proportion of greenbacks . The banks began to guard their greenbacks , not only for the purpose of checking exports of gold , but for their own protection , since greenbacks and Treasury notes are alone used in Clearing House settlements . As a result of the great accumulation of silver certificates recently , bullion dealers anxious to get greenbacks have tendered gold to banks at a lower commission than to the public , and silver certificates at 1-16 of 1 per cent . below par , for greenbacks . In making up their weekly statement , the banks have counted silver certificates as legal tenders , because they may be redeemed in silver dollars . The City Bank reported more than $3,000 , - 000 legal tenders on hand last week . It was supposed yesterday , the bank 's officers declining to explain the exchange of gold for greenbacks , that a good part of the $3,000,000 was in silver certificates ; that the bank could not conveniently borrow greenbacks from other banks , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got them from the Sub-Treasury for gold in preference to sending gold to the Clearing House . If it had taken the latter course , the gold could not be recovered . It may now be had again whenever the bank- may replenish - its supply of greenbacks . In regard to the decline in exchange rates , bankers say that high rates for money have shut off the demand for bills by merchants . Absence of demand has *depressed the price of bills . When money was easy , importers bought bills in order to get advantage of trade discounts for prompt payments . They find now that they can save nothing by paying promptly , high interest charges more than offsetting the advantage of trade discounts . Therefore they will let ? accounts in Europe stand until they mature , unless interest charges here may again become normal . They made quick payments when they could discount their paper at 5 to 6 per cent . Prime ' paper can rarely now be sold as well as that . On maturity of bills for imports , remittances must occur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure for present dullness . The demand will not be normal , it is said , because merchants are cutting down imports to actual needs , but on imports actually made bills must finally be bought . To this principal cause for decline in exchange must be added that of a fresh supply of grain bills in market . Reported imports of gold signify the progress of preparations for the new bonds by gold purchases abroad . r Only gold or ' its equivalent buys gold in Europe , so that , while the immediate situation here is eased or brightened by arrivals of gold , the day of settlement can not be long ahead . Since the conditions indicated serve present purposes , the markets have responded well to them . An encouraging feature is that London has again become a good buyer of American securities . Should this spirit abroad continue , and should the condition of the money market attract foreign capital in large amounts , as is promised , bankers say that the puzzles in the financial problem may work themselves out . No apprehension is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise encouragingly for the first installment on the new Government loan . Should ? 1,000,000 be sent from England this week , the imports since  --  the bond call will have been about $10,000,000 , or sufficient for the first payment on one-half the proposed issue of bonds .
