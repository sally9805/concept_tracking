txt The next time that Secretary Foster is called upon to dispose of a business matter involving the question of the employment of men who have made themselves conspicuous chiefly for their ability to make mischief , it may be expected that he will be gabled and controlled by business reasons and a sense of justice that has been lacking in his clumsy attempts to settle the contentions set up by the seven dismissed Knights of Labor , who demanded restoration as the reward of their efforts to secure possession of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . The controversy that has been going on for weeks was practically concluded this afternoon . not in the way that seemed probable a few days ago , but pretty nearly according to the way that would have suggested itself to any fairminded business man who was confronted with similar problem . Along with Messrs . Cavanaugh and Devlin , representatives of the Knights of Labor froniphio , who came here a few days ago , arrived a report Aat Mr. Cavanaugh had received assurances before he left Ohio that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troubles in the Bureattof Engraving and Printing in a way that would be entirely satisfactory to the Knights of Labor . Mr. Cavanaugh evidently ' assumed that this assurance meant that the Knights of Labor were to have their own way with Mr. Foster . Since then there have been other reports of a wort to support the belief that Mr. Cavanaugh had received extraordinary assurances from Mr. Foster . One report was that Mr. Foster had written a letter to Jordan , one of the most mischievous of the malcontents , whom Chief Meredith refuses to reinstate , offering to put him back in his office of Assistant Superintendent of the Bureau . of Engraving and Printing . There arrived here this morning a man whose arguments have enabled Secretary Foster to see this matter in a new light . Mr. Samuel Gompers , President of the Federation of Labor , iaccompanied. by Mr. Christopher Evans , the Secretary of the federation , came to Washington , had a consultation with the committee of the federation in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , and late in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , the pretensions and demands of the seven worthy Knights of Labor who aspired to the control of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing were pretty well disposed of . lir . Gompers was seen to-night in company with a large number of the - elate printers who oppose the decoration of Chief Meredith 's prosecutors . He was asked by a correspondent of THE TimEs when and how his attention had been directed to the bureau controversy and what had been the result of his " My attention was directed to the controversy about three weeks ago by the local committee , " he said , " but it was not until yesterday that dispatches received in New-York appeared to make it desirable that I should come here at once to endeavor to secure a settlement fair to the employes of the Government , who were not open to criticism for their conduct . " " Have you succeeded in your mission 1 " was asked . " I think I have . I told Secretary Foster that all that was asked by the Federation of Labor and its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person should bo taken on at the head of the ' chance ' list in preference to those whose , names were now , there . If he thought thatMoore , Jordan , and the other employes who had been dismissed by the chief ough ? - to be re-employed , there could be no objection by the DIM on the list if they took their places at the end of it and awaited their ' turn . To this , after some farther discussion , the Secretary agreed . That agreement I believe he will adhere to . " Mr. gompers did not refer to politics in his statement of what was said to him in the talk with Mr. Foster . The members of the Federa , tion of Labor appear to be anxious to keep all political allusions out of the controversy . That intention may be highly creditable to them , but it is perfectly well understood here that Mr. ' Foster 's early tendency was to surrender to the ; demands of the Knights of Labor , and reward ? the seven mischief makers with places before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list ' had been furnished with work . Behind him were a lot of Ohio poliftelans who had been frightened by the threats of the Knights of Labor to defeat , if their demands were not conceded . When he came to consider the matter he looked at it like a " scurvy politician , " instead of regarding it with the calm . ness and fairness of a Judge . ' Until Mr. Goin- ? pars arrived it was not at all - certain that he Would not give in to the Knights of Labor , put the bureau practically in their hands , discredit it , and humiliate Chief Meredith , his own officer in command , and invite a train of evils in me. management that would plague the Secretary of the Treasury for years . The outcome is that Mr. Foster has permitted it to be known that his back is not too strong , that he is apt to be caught by the last man who sees him , that he considers political expediency the bestjustice , and that he is ant to regard party policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that he will lose the support of . the Knights of Labor , while he will not gain the - esteem of the Federation of Labor .
