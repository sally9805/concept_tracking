txt I ATTENDED the meeting which was held in St. James 's Hall , in London , to give the first welcome to Mr. H. M. Stanley on his return from Africa . The meeting was held under the auspices of the Emin Relief Committee  --  the committee who had got up the whole expedition , and who , therefore , had the first claim on Mr. Stanley 's presence ; and it was presided over by the Prince of Wales . The Prince was received with the utmost enthusiasm . He deserved the enthusiasm in his capacity of chairman ; for I have seen a few public meetings in my time , and I do not think I ever saw a better chairman on 5 " i an occasion . He spoke well , but he was very brief of spw * . Yet he managed to say something quite distinct and expressive . He was not the sort of chairman who gets up and merely announces that he does not propose to stand between the meeting and the orator of the occasion , and then collapses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give one the idea that he could say a great deal about Mr. Stanley and his expedition if only time allowed him , but that time did not allow him , and therefore he forebore to say most of that which he might have said . He spoke firmly , as if he were contending against a certain difficulty or reluctance . The tone of his voice and something about his utterance reminded me curiously now and then of Lord llartington . The whole occasion set me thinking-about the position of the Prince of Wales in English society and politics-about the place he is yet to hold-about the manner in which he is likely to hold it-about the duties of a Prince of Wales in the England of our day , which is a very different country indeed from the England of George the Second or George the Third , or even George the Fourth . My mind sometimes wandered away from the Congo and Emin Pacha . The function of the late Prince Consort was once described as that of unofficial Minister of Education . The function of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made it // out , is that of unofficial Minister of Ceremonial . No one could be fitter for the work or could perform it with better grace and greater good-will . Nor is it in a country like England by any means an unimportant function . The Queen has practically withdrawn from the business of social life , and the Prince has taken her place . If he were not there to do the social duties , the absence of the sovereign would become highly inconvenient and would lead to much disatisfaction . The Prince of Wales , however , has made himself thoroughly popular , and the Princess of Wales is the most popular woman in England . The work which the Prince of Wales does in this social way is something amazing . He is always presiding at the opening of exhibitions and all manner of charitable , philanthropic , and educational institutions . He is always taking the chair at meetings ; he goes down to the country to preside over ceremonials of every kind . He attends civic feasts and state balls . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment out of life . He is a lover of the theatre and sel ' a mis*es an important " first night . " He runs across to Paris e j now and then-he is very fond of Paris and Paris is very fond of him . He sometimesindeed , almost every winter-takes a trip to Monte Carlo . He loves living and enjoying himself , and must feel the functions and the pageantry a terrible bore very often . But if he is bored , as he surely must be , he has the art not to show it , and each crowd before which he appears is led to believe that his whole soul is for the time in the work he is actually doing . I must say that I think one main reason why he is able thus to wear the look of a man who likes the work is that he really does like it to a certain extent and in a certain way . Of course it must weary him fearfully sometimes , but I fancy that his genuine good nature enables him to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to derive an inspiration and an encouragement from it . Besides , there must be a great charm , surely , in the knowledge that all people think one charming  --  and I believe all who know him think the Prince of Wales very charming . There was a time , of course , when hard things were said of the Prince of Wales . There was a time when I myself wrote some hard things of him in an American magazine . That was twenty years ago so far as I knew then or know now , the censure given to him was just . But he is not now the man he was twenty // years ago , or anything like it ; and although no admirer of his would claim for him a very lofty and heroic nature , yet I think almost every one would allow that he has improved in personal character and ways to an extent which was not observed among former princes of the House of Hanover . Every one says that he is a good friend to his friends . But perhaps not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales 's set would be right in regarding themselves exactly as his friends . A pleasant prince will always have his jester or two to make him more pleasant still ; and a self-conceited man in the prince 's set might easily fancy himself a friend whereas he was in reality only a butt . Certainly I meet men now and then who are always reporting themselves to be among the closest friends of the Prince of Wales , and who are quietly smiled at by such of the listeners as happen to know better . I do not know that any of the really eminent men in letters or in science have much to do with the Prince of Wales 's set . There is no Fox , no Burke , no Sheridan there . But then a champion of the Prince might well ask , Have we now a Fox and a Burke and a Sheridan anywhere ? The Prince of Wales is sometimes described by admirers as a brilliant after-dinner and ceremonial speaker . He is not a brilliant speaker ; and those who describe him as brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his real success in the business which he has to undertake . He speaks directly and to the point . He never obtrudes himself between the audience and the business of the occasion . He never nses the wrong word , and he never says a word too much . He puts as little of himself as possible into his speeches ; and while there is always a firm and manful tone about him , there is never any indication whatever of a desire to impose himself and his position on his audience . I am quite sure that he has no such desire . But his speeches have no brilliancy of expression , no originality of thought . They are not eloquent in any sense . The Prince of Wales does not , I fancy , do what other princes have done-get his shorter speeches written for him . At least , I do not think he indulges in such a practice now-if he ever did . As to the longer speeches-well , I have my own ideas about them . Of course he could get a really brilliant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meniory and deliver it to an audience . But the Prince , whether by deliberation or by instinct , understands his part better . // In Englaud the public do not want an eloquent Prince of Wales . They do not want a prince whom we should all have to compare with Gladstone and Lord Salisbury and the Bishop of Peterborough . Prince Napoleon- " once feared , now forgot , " like Will Watch , the bold smuggler of English ballad  --  the Prince Napoleon of the Second Empire-Plon-Plon-there was an eloquent prince if you like ! I used to think him one of the most eloquent of all the orators of the empire-even in the days when Berryer was still to the front , and Jules Favre was in hi* prime , and Thiers grew old in unwaning power of debate . But in England we are precise and formal , and more than a trifle prosaic ; and we should not like a prince who was really eloquent and was always getting compared with this and that renowned orator . We could not have our prince declaiming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaim in the Imperial Senate  --  and to declaim generally in opposition to the policy of his imperial cousin , the Emperor . The ordinary Englishman would think there was something rather unseemly in this sort of eloquence possessed and displayed by a royal prince . The Prince of Wales is , indeed , as far below the intellectual level and the artistic culture of Prince Napoleon as he is above him in tact and temper and personal integrity . He has somehow lighted on the very style of public speaking which suits the British public ; and those who think to flatter him by calling him a brilliant speaker only show that they do not understand his part in life . The Prince of Wales must not go into rivalry with any one . When we hear him speak at a public meeting , we must not be oppressed with any idea whatever that he is as good as this speaker , or better than that , or not quite equal to this other . Agamemnon must not be put to the test of discharging his arrow . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent chairman he is in every sense of the word . From the testimony of all who know him , I believe him to be in one sense a remarkably well.informed man . He is not a scholar , of course , but he speaks several languages admirably and he has a thorough knowledge of what is going on in the civilized world . He has travelled much , and he has a good memory , and he knows a great deal about the condition of countries he has seen , and he knows all about the public men of the various state . He has a desire to get information and a considerable faculty for acquiring it . // All this I have heard from ardent Radicals-even from Radicals who avow that they would rather have no throne and no Prince of Wales-as well as from devoted Tory loyalists . I do not say that all men in England speak well of the Prince of Wales . There are many of the old noblesse , and the Catholic noblesse among the rest , who regard the prince 's set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudder . American visitors sometimes make the mistake of supposing that when they have got into Marlborough House they have got into the very best of English society . They have done nothing of the kind . They might as well have fancied in the old imperial days that when they had been invited to the Tuileries , and talked with the Empress Eagi*nie , they had got into the best of French society . Many of those who form the entourage of the Queen turn their eyes away from the circles amid which the Prince of Wales is supreme . The truth is that the Prince is a good deal of a social leveller . He loves to be amused , and though he can put up with solemn and formal dulness when there is some need for such endurance , he gets back all the more gladly to the society of those who can divert him and make him laugh . I have no doubt that many of the indiscrotions of his younger and wilder days came from his delight in the companionship of those who amused him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he surrounded himself with artists and actors and singers and the tellers of good stories and the makers of good jokes , and he delights in the theatres , is made gladsome by the burlesque , scorns not the ballet , has no conscientious objection to short skirts . He can be as friendly as any man among his friends , and has a curious aptitude for throwing off dignity and yet retaining his hold upon it , ready to wrap himself round with it again if any one should presume too far on his good-natured abandonment . He does not profess to be a politician in domestic affairs , but yet I have no doubt that he keeps well up with politics , and he likes to know any public man who is at all interesting . Of late he has taken to cultivating the acquaintance of rather advanced Liberal politicians , and Sandriugham has received many of the occupants of what we call here " the front opposition bench " - who are Radical Home-Rulers . Nay , more than that , when Lord Randolph Churchill lately entertained him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him was a " whip " of the Irish home-rule party . Of course every one knows that no one invites a guest to meet the Prince of Wales without making very sure that the Prince is not unwilling to meet that guest , and therefore I take it that the paragraphs in the society papers describing that little dinner did really tell something of a certain public importance . All this an American might perhaps say is ridiculouswhat does it matter whom the Prince of Wales invites to dinner or meets at dinner ? I can only say that in this country it means a great deal . It means that the future sovereign of England is alive to the fact that great political movements are going on and have to be recognized . I am satisfied that , by thus proving himself willing to mark the recognition in the only way really open to him , the Prince of Wales is fulfilling one of the most important functions of his station . If the monarchy is to hold in England , it can only be by the monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of a party . The English people would never again endure a king who openly denounced the leaders of one party and declared that he rested all his hopes upon the leaders of another party . We could not stand even a " patriotic king " nowthat is , a king who was kind enough to try to govern us for our good . How , then , should we endure a king who associated himself with one party only , and who shunned and denounced the others ? The very name of a king 's party now would be fatal to the popularity of any king-might bring down the throne itself . I have no doubt that the Prince of Wales understands all this as well as any statesman in the country . I have not the slightes doubt that he will prove himself a thoroughly constitutional sovereign , and that he will perform the business of royalty , such as it is , as well as any man could do it . Jn the mean time there is nothing for him to do but to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying ceremonial visits to the provincial cities , and in the intervals getting out of life all the pleasure it can give him . I can well imagine a Republican being a little shocked at all this . I can hear him asking indignantly whether it is worthy the part of a great civilized and advancing nation like England to keep up a dynasty and a title merely for the sake of having a royal Master // or Mistress of the Ceremonies always at hand . I should not be surprised to hear such a question put . As a matter of abstract reasoning , I should say it certainly was not worth the while of such a nation to keep up such an office for such a purpose . But there is the fact . The Prince of Wales does for us all that we would allow him to do . He will , to be sure , have functions more wide and serious when he comes to be King . The sovereign undoubtedly does a good deal in the way of considering with the ministers what ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home or foreign politics . It is well known that in foreign politics the influence of Queen Victoria has always counted for much , and that she has as thorough an understanding of Continental affairs as any of her foreign ministers . The sovereign is always consulted on the measures which the ministry are anxious to bring forward . The consent of the sovereign is always asked and obtained before any initiative step of a serious kind is taken . The sovereign has a great deal to say about each proposition . It is impossible that the arguments , the impressions , even the prejudices , of the sovereign should not have some effect upon the policy of a governmciit . The great difference between the England of to-day and the England of the Georges is that , if a serious differeiice of opinion should arise between the monarch and a popular ministry , the sovereign of today would give way in the end without scenes and scandal ; the sovereign in the days of the Georges gave way only after scenes and scandal . Admitting all this , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a man of sense , of tact , of considerable knowledge of men and countries ; a man of temper and an impartial man ; not an ignorant , prejudiced , hot-tempered , meddling man . Nothing could be more absurd than to suppose that it does not matter to the English people whether their sovereign be a wise person or a fool  --  a man of equal mind or a muddle-headed partisan . But if I were a very eager and ardent Republican , I should wish that the Prince of Wales were not the man he is . I should wish him to be a hot-headed and muddleheaded partisan . I should wish him to be a dogged Tory and to be seen perpetually in the company of Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour . I should wish him , while he was yet Prince of Wales , to be seen at various Tory meetings and to preside over one of the // gatherings of the Primrose League . I should wish that when he became King he told Mr. Gladstone he would not have him and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when public opinion forced him to have Mr. Gladstone as his minister , he went to work to thwart every proposal made by his minister and to dissolve every Parliament which presumed to support the minister against the sovereign . If one could suppose such things happening in our time , one could then easily suppose the throne coming down and the republic coming up . But certainly , if we could suppose such things possible in our time , we could not suppose them possible with the Prince of Wales for king . The Prince of Wales will do nothing in that way to promote the growth of a republic in England . If we are inclined to find fault with the office of the Prince of Wales on the ground that it is only the office of a Master of the Ceremonies , we must remember that that is what the function has grown to be with the natural development of constitutional liberty in England . A sovereign rules over a people who are not free . Lord Bramwell , one of our great lawyers and judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for socialism . I have a sneaking kindness for the German Emperor . Perhaps it might be said of him , as Disraeli once said of Lord Salisbury , that " the young man 's head is on fire . " But I am taken by his determination " to be a man and not a thing , " as somebody says in one of George Meredith 's novels . I like his bold challenge to Europe in general to come and consult together over the labor question . I admire the self satisfied courage with which he assumed at once the right to take the lead of Europe . All this does very well for a German Emperor  --  but only imagine an English sovereign attempting to play such a part ! Imagine the amazement and bewilderment of his ministers ! Imagine the consternation of his people ! It is possible for the German Emperor to assume such a part , for his people are not , in the English or American sense , a free people at all . They are merely the soldiers of an army . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state may well suppose that he is bound to prove his title to be a leader and to mark out a distinct way for himself and to draw all the eyes of the world on him . When Napoleon the Third was at the height of his fame , he issued invitations to all the great powers of Europe to assemble at // 83 a congress for the purpose of coming to some understanding as to a settlement of peace and general disarmament . The European states for the most part distrusted and almost resented the invita* tion , believing that there was , to say the least , a certain arrogance about it  --  a claim set up to be recognized as the leader of European council . One power after another declined and the scheme dropped through , and unquestionably the failure did harm to the prestige of the Emperor . But the German Emperor found his invitations accepted all round without hesitation or objection . No wonder he is encouraged to set himself up as the light and leading of Europe . I doubt very much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an emperor to play the old imperial part . The times are against it ; the Germans are a highly-educated people , and they learn a good deal from their brothers and cousins in the United States . If there were no possibility of a war with France , the German Emperor would soon have to be content with reigning and not governing . But whatever may happen in Germany , it is certain that we could not have the King of England uprearing his crest in this ostentatiously heroic fashion . The Prince of Wales has shown , of late years at all events , that he thoroughly understands the nature , the duties , and the limitations of his function as heir to the throne . He will , I have no doubt , show , when he comes to the throne , that he understands his part in that more responsible position just as well . The Prince of Wales is understood to be a great stickler for court etiquette . No one knows better the exact way in which every band and order and medal should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in princes and princesses , and I hay ? heard that there is a near connection of his by marriage who is often lectured severely on the impropriety of losing his temper when giving directions to servants . The Prince is a social umpire of the utmost authority , and no end of personal disputes are settled satisfactorily by a reference to his goodnatured and genial , but firm , counsel . I suppose he is happy in his position . A man of ambition would surely find it all but intolerable to see his whole life going by in that unceasing round of mere ceremonial . The Prince of Wales is not any longer young - he has long left youth far behind him . He is not a soldier - except in the sense in which he is a member of one of the Inns of Court ; he has never done a soldier 's // service . His brother , the Duke of Edinburgh , is a working admiral , and if we were to have a war , he would , of course , take his share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connaught is a brigadier-general in the army and has actually seen service-was , at all events , " on the rough edge of battle " in Egypt ; and if there were more wars , he would go to the wars again . But the Prince of Wales must not be a real soldier and must not go to any wars . No doubt he has the courage of his race . The ilanoverian kings and princes , even the worst of them , never wanted courage . But military ambition would be useless for the Prince of Wales . So , indeed , would ambition of any kind . We could not have him writing books like Napoleon the Third with his " Life of Julius C*sar " ; or volumes of poetry like the Queen of IRoumania . It would not do for him to paint pictures and send them to the Royal Academy or the Grosvenor Gallery . I have shown how limited is the share he can now take in even the unseen work of politics . It must be , therefore , something like a relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . It has the appearance of a duty , and , indeed , in its sense it is a duty , and it gives him something to do . It would be hard to find a man better suited for the part . A foreigner may think it curious that an intensely practical people , as the English are always reported to be , should pay so much money for keeping up such a part . But is not one reason for the course they take to be found in the fact that they are so intensely practical ? The institution is there ; it is working well enough ; there are ever so mauy reforms that have to be carried out , ever so many other changes that have to be made : why slio*ild they waste time and trouble in trying to devise any improvement in an institution which , though costly , seems to give general satisfaction ? The vast gulf between the rich and the poor- " the two nations " of Lord Beaconsfield 's " Sybil " - is still further deepening every day . Luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The moral tone of society , as it is called , is loweriug itself deliberately and wantonly with every season . Cynicism sits at every dinner-table . The sort of conversation which goes on openly and undisguisedly in society now would have been impossible twenty or thirty years ago . Men and women at dinner parties talk freely and at large on subjects which formerly were reserved for the men in the smok // mg-room or the low whisper of the women to each other in the drawing-room . We have all manner of scandals which are reported in all the newspapers , and , we may be sure , are talked of in Bethnal Green as well as in Beigravia . The poor and the unemployed of the East End must begin more and more to chafe at the condition of things which , as Thackeray puts it , gives the purple and fine linen to one set of men , and to the other " rags for garments and dogs for comforters . " But I do not hear that there is any particular grumbling iii the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince of Wales is supposed to lead . Indeed , it is much in his favor that almost the only movements of a really serious nature in which he has ever taken part were movements which had for their object the improvement in the housing and the condition of the poor . Not very long since he gave much time and close attention to a commission on this subject , of which Cardinal Manning was one member and Mr* Burt , one of the workingmen 's representatives in the House of Commons , another . He has borne an active part in many other organizations for the same general purpose . These things get known at the East End , and they do unquestionably help very materially to make the Prince popular among the working classes and the poor . Enthusiasm in such quarters it would be hard for a Prince to excite who is restricted to so limited a field of action and display . But our royal institutions do not live on enthusiasm . They live on acquiescence . They are accepted . No one can say how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed in the same way as they have lately been , and are likely still to be . I am not myself a great enthusiast about royalty or royal personages , but I must say that , so long as we are to have an heir to the throne , I do not think we could find any one better able to conduct the business of the position than the Prince of Wales has shown himself of late years.
