txt " It would seem , indeed , as if the whole world , during all the years since the inception of civilization , has been working upon the line of equipment for industrial effort ,  --  inventing and perfecting tools and machinery , building workshops and factories , and devising instrumentalities for easy intercommunication for persons and thoughts , and the cheap exchange of products and services ; that , this equipment having at last been made ready , the work of using it has for the first time , in our day and generation , fairly begun ; and also that every community , under prior or existing conditions of use and consumption , is becoming saturated , as it were , with its results . " The striking nature of this thpught is found in the fact that almost every man who thinks at all has had his mind turned in the direction of the excesses of the time ,  --  not the excesses of dissipation or even of extravagance , but the extraordinary output of almost everything the world over , whether it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whether of agricultural products to such an extent that corn is being used in the Western States for fuel , or of manufactures , as in making boot 's and shoes , and collars and cuffs , for 100,000,000 people , with les* than two-thirds of that number to wear theln . While this intense activity in industrial pursuits has been proceeding at this rapid rate on this continent , we have been ab-. sorbing and re*mploying the money or capital acquired , by occupying our ever-widening areas and developing our enormous natural resources . On the other hand , the smaller and richer countries of Europe , trading with nations other than themselves , have been equally overwhelmed with production and excess . Not being able to absorb the products of their own industries themselves , they have sent their surplus to the rest of the world ; and while they have taken in exchange all that they could consume , the vast balance due to them has reached them in the shape of // money . This is especially the case with Great Britain , whose position to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sun . If this tribute is not in the shape of a profit on goods exported , if not in the shape of profits from trade by the use of English money within the foreign country itself , then certainly by direct loans , and returns in the shape of interest or dividends , does Great Britain receive tribute from almost all other countries . For instance , the great national debts the world over arc largely due in England . The revenue derived in the shape of interest from other nations by Great Britain , from the constantlyincreasing obligations of governmental borrowing , has grown to enormous proportions . The people of the United States can measure how vast is the sum to be paid in carrying national debts by the extent of their own taxation for this purpose . This taxation , though excessive and long-continued , with the object of obliterating the national obligation , nevertheless has always been lightened by the consideration that the bulk of the interest was paid to our own people , and that the drain was a constantlydiminishing , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any other country , and Great Britain profits by the growing necessities and the heavy burdens of other nations . The amount of interest paid to Engh*nd , even by Russia , for money borrowed to create a peace establishment , in readiness for possible war with England herself , is no inconsiderable sum . Eastern countries , as Turkey and Egypt , apparently in the last stages of governmental decay , are depcndent upon Great Britain equally with the South African colonies , in their earliest inceptions of governmental vigor . Central and South American republics , vast dependencies like India , Australia , and Canada , are all national borrowers in London , the interest on whose loans is usually paid with the regularity of clock-work . Referring to Canada , as a near-by illustration of the amounts paid to England , it may be stated that it is estimated that the governmental , railroad , municipal , and mortgage indebtedness to Great Britain of that colony amounts to 650 millions of dollars , implying that the tribute which England levies on her colony for the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paid by barely five millions of people , and , although it is an agricultural country , amounting to almost double the export of breadstuffs . If this is an illustration of what takes place all over the world , // it will afford some idea of the enormous revenues in the shape of interest which Great Britain is constantly receiving . But it is not solely by the revenue from governmental loans that England is enriched . In the public works of numerous countries she is a participant ; and , indeed , in many independent nationalities , rich and prosperous in themselves , English capital has largely been used , especially in state and municipal improvements . This is shown in the case of the construction of the capitol at Austin , Texas , built by British money ; in the ownership of water-works or school bonds of Northwestern towns and farm mortgages by British investment companies in the Pacific-coast States . Whether it is to construct a railroad in India or a canal in Bulgaria ; whether it is to open and work a gold mine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ilarney Peak , in Dakota ; whether it is to dig for rubies in South Africa , or to profit a Dundee Scotch shareholder in an Illinois corporation by affording lodging on a Pullman car in any part of the North American continent ,  --  no matter how , where , or when profits are made , the Briton somehow or other participates . The result of this vast volume of interest , dividends , and profits , which for many years has been trending , like the Gulf Stream , toward Great Britain and , like That current , rendering existence possible for so vast an aggregation in so small a space , has been the accumulation of money , and the creation of an annual income , far in excess of spending or absorbing possibilities within the island itself . But in addition to the constant stream of profits , interest , and dividends which from almost the whole world tends toward Great Britain , there is an equally steady tendency of people with means in that direction . Men who have made their money in India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to spend their fortunes and the remainder of their lives in the only country where they think civilization has reached perfection . The British miner of South Africa , the gold-digger or sheep-farmer of Australia , the adventurer in South or Central America , at the conclusion of his labors , turns with almost unerring certainty to his native land , to enjoy its comforts and spend his competency . Thus from all quarters of the globe , and in all departments of effort , the British capitalist somehow takes his share , the result being a stream of money returning into Great Britain , of enormous proportions , steadily increasing , and perfectly incapable of being // absorbed in that country , either in new pursuits or by expenditure on living . For it m*ist be borne in mind that the English and Scotch people , who are the main recipients of this money , are an economical people ; that , aside from the carefulness which they are taught and the habits of economy into which they are trained , habits of extravagance are indications of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without ostentation , by the middle or money-earning class , is the surest way to recognition in the higher social or aristocratic strata of society . As to increased incomes , by successful investments , by economy , and by other influences in this direction , this is shown in the remarkable fact that since 1843 , when the income-tax figures first began , the increase in national income has been $3,7Th,000,000 . Of this amount the income from the capitalist class has increased from $950,000,000 to $2,000,000,000 annually . Some idea of the magnitude of the amount of capital for investment in London is indicated by a table printed in the London Economist , showing the subscriptions to new enterprises launched in London during the last six years , which compresses into small space facts more eloquent than pages of remarks : Total subscriptions to companies for year . Total subscriptions to companies for year . 1889 ? 175,859,865 isss ? 160,149,000 1888 157,643,090 1887 1887 91,913,000 1886 101,074,000 1886 94,738,000 1885 77,972,000 1885 .. 68,67i , , 000 1884 10* , O31,000 It will be seen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year equals $815,000,000 . The prediction seems a safe one , in view of the constant increase iiidicated in previous years , that the total amount likely to be subscribed toward floating new enterprises in London in 1i900 will reach $l , OOO , 000,000-equal to the almost fabulous sum of over $3,000,000 per day for every business day in the year Closely examining a list of companies absorbing so vast a sum , as furnished by the Messrs . Spackman to the London Times of January 1 , it appears that three-fourths of the companies floated represent industrial enterprises , and one-half of them are located within the United Kingdom , while the other half are scattered all over the world . Of course , at this rate it will not take long until every concern even in Great Britain that can be profitably // merged into a limited company will take on that form , and the public become part proprietors of almost all the concerns in which private capital alone has heretofore been concerned . The releasing of money hitherto locked up in these enterprises , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to make it provide an income , it must be reinvested , in which process risks are run and new ventures made , which would never have been dreamed of if the capital had still been tied up in a conservative , old-established business . The whole list for 1889 , as , indeed , the enormous amount taken by the public , indicates a highly-speculative condition of things , a collapse of which would not be surprising . This , however , would be but temporary , for even a collapse in the ranks of the numerous underwriters who are carrying a burden of speculative subscriptions would not be a permanent barrier to further investments . For it is apparent that there is a solid substratum of capital , in vast sums , needing investment , which even the heavy offerings of so many years , as indicated in the foregoing table , have not begun to absorb . All that has been said points in one direction , and one direction only , viz. , the enormous aggregation of money in Great Britain . While industrial activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent unparalleled in history , England has been taking in the results in the shape of cash to a greater degree than any other country , and she must therefore become the great investor of the world . Concurrent with her success in thus acquiring so vast an annual income in the shape of interest has been the exhaustion , to some extent , of the credit of the countries which have borrowed from her ; and it m*ist begin to be the question of questions , for the British public , where money can be safely placed and an income assured . England itself , up to a late period , has not been a bad place for investing money ; but its abundance and the limited nature of the country 's area , with a competition already existing . in every line of life , make it difficult to invest money in England with safety and profit . Heretofore l*nd has been a safe medium for investmei*it ; but the disastrous condition to which the farming industry in Great Britain has been subjected is sufficient to deter capital from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is equally limited , for the country is so small , the public works are already so numerous , and the industrial activities so great , that the difficulties which an investor // encounters to find safety and profit combined are exceedingly great . Turning from Englaid to the rest of the world , it is not an easy matter for the British investor to discover in avenues heretofore eniployed a safe outlet for his money . Countries like France , Germany , Belgium , have themselves accumulated largely , and do not need money either for governmental indebtedness or industrial activities ; while Russia , Spain , Egypt , Turkey , Bulgaria , and Austria have already taxed their credit to the utmost . New countries like Canada , Australia , the Cape , and even the South American republics , have got about as much as they can stagger under , the amount sent out to the Argentine Republic alone in the last five years amounting to no less a sum than $500,000,000 , involving an annual payment of at least $25,000,000 a year . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , and profit for the English capitalist seems assured , and that country is the United States . The vast object-lesson which the career of the American Republic affords to the average English observer is a most instructive one . The strides in material advancement ; the growth in population , to which all the world has contributed ; the stability of the government notwithstanding the most tremendous internal conflict that the world has ever seen ; the creation of a great debt within itself and to its own people , and , more than all , its rapid obliteration , followed by a surplus unparalleled in the history of nations , are all circumstances that tend to impress upon the British mind the solidity and greatness of this country . A people of the same lineage , the same language , the same laws , and the same literature , and with such a record , it is no wonder that they turn - in this direction when , with the ample opportunities which the continent has afforded for the achievements of the Anglo-Saxon race , such magnificent progress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wonder , then , that , with a constant aggregation of capital pouring in upon Great Britain , with an inability to make it yield a profit within her own domain , and , still further , the impossibility of finding any other country where it can be so safely invested , she should turn in the direction of the United States , which alone of all nations seems to combine all the elements of safety and profit . From a list recently published it appears that the amount of English money which has been inVOL . CL. - XO. 399. , * 15 // vested in industrial enterprises in the United States has equalled , in the last two years , about a million dollars a week , amounting in all to about 100 millions . The chief , properties . included in these purchases were , first , certain New York breweries , at about five millions of dollars ; then the brewing company at Portsmouth and Boston , owned by Mr. Frank Jones , at a capitalization of six and a half millions ; the Chicago breweries at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester , approaching a still further five millions ; the United States Brewing Company at an equal amount , together with the still more important purchase of the St. Louis Brewers ' Association , at no less a sum than twelve millions of dollars . In this operation seventeen distinct establishments were united , indicating a possibility of a local combination of interests , hitherto competitive , of the greatest possible significance . But the investments have been by no means confined to the brewery interest . The great abatto% establishment of Mr. T. C. Eastman , in New York city , united with an English company , absorbed an investment of English capital to the extent of over five millions ; the Otis Steel Company , of Cleveland ; the Chicago and Northwestern granaries ; the Pillsbury and Washburn Flour Mills , and the Virginia Development Company also absorbed considerable amounts . The City of Chicago Grain Elevator Line brought nearly five millions ; the California Consolidated Quicksilver Companies , two millions ; and , as if to show the infinite variety of pursuits to which capital can be diverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions has been absorbed in the purchase of the great patent-medicine establishment of Mr. H. H. Warner , at Rochester , where the " Safe Cure** remedies are manufactured . These and other indications , which so constantly appear in the newspapers , would imply that a very vast sum had already been realized from English capital in this country . But it is a fact that the amount , though large , is mush less than people suppose ; yet even at the rate of a million dollars a week is not inconsiderable . There are those who indulge in the belief that the English capital brought out to the United States for investment in industrial enterprises will hardly yield a return that will be satisfactory ; and that because of disappointment in the realization of the high returns promised , the present tendency is but a temporary one . These prophets point to the fate which has overtaken // not a few of the railroad enterprises in which English capital has been largely interested , as in the Erie , the Reading , the Wabash , and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss and disaster which have overtaken English investments in ranching and cattle-breeding in the West . But the shape which British investments in industrial enterprises have taken in the past two years is widely different from the investments in railroads , ranches , mortgages , or other previous experiments in this direction . Whether it is from the experience of the past , or whether prompted by the conservatism of the leaders in this important movement , in order that it may be permanent , and of the most satisfactory character in its results , the utmost care has been exercised to base the operations on three great principles First , that the greatest possible pains is exercised to secure the most exhaustive investigation of the properties to be taken over ; second , that the control of the organization is irrevocably placed in the hands of the English parties who represent the new money put into the business ; third , that the utmost precaution is taken to secure the continuance of the services of the vendor and his staff for the perpetuation of the success of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous employment , but by their retention of a large proportionate interest . These three most important elements are as essential to success in floating a property in London as the sun is to daylight . With regard to the investigation which precedes these transactions , it would be impossible to have it more thorough . The instrumentality chosen is that of an independent , impartial , and chartered accountant , from some well-known and loncr-expert established firm , whose position is sufficiently guaranteed by the fact that his firm are members of the Society of London Chartered Accountants ( chartered by Parliament a century ago ) , famous the world over for their accuracy , probity , and sound judgment in matters of book-keeping . Without a certificate from a wellknown firm , or individual member of this organization , as the result of prolonged personal investigation , no attempt to float a property could succeed . The result is that numerous enterprises can not stand the test of this crucial examination , and only those whose claims to profit spread over a number of years are plainly demonstrable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chance of success . In addition to this , all outside // sources of information are made available , aTid reports as to the character , antecedents , and general business reputation of the parties concerned are most carefully gleaned , and even the debtpaying power of the bulk of the customers ascertained . So that , as far as is possible , a perfect photograph of the business is furnished from both the inside and outside . Having perfectly apprehended the condition of the business to be sold , both in its past and present condition , the next move is to control it perfectly for the future . The usual practice is to incorporate under the local law of the State in which the business is situated ( if it is not already in the shape of a corporation ) , and transfer every share of the stock , except that which is required for the qualification of local directors , to a trustee , who represents a second , or parent , company formed under the English Joint-Stock Act . This net is an extremely liberal one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been administered with safety and profit . The English company , thus solely based upon the American securities , is usually officered by men of prominence and position , whose presence in a board of directors is a guarantee to capitalists that thorough investigation has taken place , and that the business will be honestly and efficiently administered . It is true that this seems a cumbrous plan , and the objection seems well taken that men perfectly unfamiliar with the business are placed in its practical control ; that to manage affairs at long range has rarely succeeded ; and that the average London director-chosen in many instances because he has a handle to his name , and not a few of them are denominated " Guineapigs , " because they get a guinea for attending every directors ' meeting-is hardly likely to add greatly to the shrewd business sagacity essential to success in America . But it will be found that the sense of control which even this cumbrous plan of a joint English and American company imparts has its advantages . It provides against a reckless and unauthorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant acquaintance with the business on behalf of those whose money has gone into the investment . As to the objection that details can not be apprehended properly three or four thousand miles away , it must not be forgotten that the third condition of the trade is also rigidly adhered to , viz. , that the parties who have hithertQ made the business a suc // cess shall not only retain an interest at least equal to one-third of the securities issued as representing the property , but that the active management shall still be vested in those whose ability and energy have made the enterprise so conspicuously successful as to merit its recognition by British capitalists . With this latter condition complied with and a large interest maintained , and with little interference from the other side so long as the business is paying a return equal to its previous record , it would seem as if every precaution had been exercised . The foregoing principles being rigidly adhered to in the investment of British capital in American industries , there is good reason for the belief that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose profits for a series of years past afford a reasonable guarantee of equal success for years to come , have had a chance of ever being taken over . Should this expectation be borne out in the future , the amount of capital to come in this direction will certainly be very great . It is true that the price realized sometimes seems in excess of the possibilities of continued profit on the capitalization reached ; but it must be borne in mind that this capitalization is based on a regular percentage of ascertained profits , spread over a series of years , and that under ordinary circumstances the future may be relied upon to yield as good a profit as the past . Whether it will do so or not remains to be seen , but all the conditions to accomplish this success seem to have been complied with . It may be that in all cases the extraordinary expectation raised for the common stock will not be fulfilled ; but for the debentures and for the preferred stock , which comprise two-thirds of the securities issued , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return as that from any other field of investment now open to English capital . There will be , of course , instances of failure from lack of good management , from misfortune , and because , perhaps , of the changed conditions of capital and administration ; but it will be seen that all reasonable provision has been made against this possibility . In not a few instances great advantage may follow the introduction of enlarged monetary facilities , a close oversight in constant investigation by trained accountants , and the rigid methods of business which the English proprietors are likely to exact . The chances would seem to be about even that the thoroughly-organized establishments , based on really profitable // trade , and honestly administered by the men who have created them and who are still largely interested in them , will continue to yield returns that will fulfil the reasonable expectations of our new English partners . It is a matter of surprise , both in England and America , that large and prosperous concerns in the United States are in the market , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weakness in earning power or overvaluation in the price demanded . But it must be understood that in this country the rapid growth of large establishments has always been at the expense of perfect ease in money matters , because active money is in small proportion to growth in plant , in the necessary stock of raw material , and in outstandings ; that outside facilities in the shape of bank accommodations and outside loans have had to be relied upon for active capital in many instances , and the fact that the necessities of the business require constant permanent expenditure makes the attraction of new and active capital from abroad very difficult to resist . Further , men who have spent their lives in the promotion of great business establishments , possibly with no son or worthy successor fitted to carry on their business , and needing some leisure and ease of life , deem it prudent , in order that their business may go on , to avail themselves of the opportunity to interest foreign capital , especially when that capital comes in the impersonal shape of far-away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing management shall be perpetuated and strengthened , and , in a monetary sense , relieved . It is certain that the introduction of corporative proprietorship , accompanied by ample foreign capital , will greatly contribute to the conservation of some of the larger establishments , and greatly aid in their perpetuation . The fate that overtook the great business of Mr. A. T. Stewart , the possibilities that impend in numerous concerns after the death or incapacity of the men whose genius and credit sustain them , influence the prompt acceptance of an offer of new capital and new ability , on the condition of a participation in the profits and the division of the assets into shares that are much more easily handled than the business taken as a whole , arid in the distribution of which a certain succession can be secured . Not the least important consideration flowing from the introduction of English capital is the possibility of combinations , or // consolidations , in various localities , of different establishments heretofore competing with each other . It is certain that this tendency of the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that presses its desirability from a profit-earning point of view upon numerous competing esI*ablishments ; and notwithstanding the severest criticism by the press , and adverse action by national and State legislatures , so long as the liberty of the citizen to trade with whom he chooses remains , this disposition will manifest itself . Just how far the introduction of British capital will encourage the tendency towards consolidation and the elimination of competition , it hardly yet appears , for up to this time the purchase of properties has been based solely upon the distinctive earning power which separate establishments show , and not upon their earning possibilities under combination . But this is clear , that the corporative character which each establishment has to assume in order to sell out offers great facility toward amalgamation . The impersonal character of a corporation rids it of the pride of possession inherent in personal proprietorship ; and the impediments toward a union of interests , in rivalry , jealousy , and false or unjust estimates of value , are all removed . Indeed , it would seem as if the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their information and safety are the very first elements essential to combinations among competing establishments . Further , it may be said that the new capital to be introduced is an instrumentality of equal advantage in effecting consolidations , and it is certain enough that just so soon as it is apparent that , in addition to the profits promised by distinct establishments , still better results can be secured by consolidations , and the abandonment of wasteful methods of production and expensive modes of distribution , just so soon will the desire be manifest to encourage a consolidation of interests . Such a tendency may possibly be essential from want of success as the consequence of the management of separate establishments at such long range as from London to America , and it is one of the elements of advantage which the English investors will always have in hand that , should competing concerns not pay , being within easy facility of communication with each other in corporative form , and with no purpose to serve but to secure profit , they can encourage a consolidation of interests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make a good profit without the necessity of increasing prices to a point that will stimulate the creation of new and competing establishments . Possibly out of the changed conditions which impend for large individual industrial enterprises , in found elements productive of a great change in the principles which govern the business world . The growing tendency toward eliminating competition because of its excessive cost and waste , as the bulwark of safety against exaction , may have additional encouragement in this trend of British capital toward America , and resnlts far-reaching and influential may follow . Up to this time the conservative element among the investors in Great Britain has hardly been reached by the attractiveness of American industrial securities . This is shown by the fact that it is not the debentures , or preferred stock , respectively at 5 and 6 , and 7 and 8 per cent. , that has been taken , but the common stock has been largely absorbed , on which a high premium in the London Stock Exchange is possible . But with the creation of more perfect instrumentalities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being developed by some of the best banking ability in both countries , and working together in harmony on both sides of the Atlantic , an equipment will be afforded that will , with much less expense , greatly enlarge the area of supply of money , and more perfectly control and investigate the properties offered . It is abundantly clear from recent indications that a regular business is now being developed in the direction of English investment , in which some of the best financial minds of the country will find an honorable and profitable field of employment . With the conservative investors of Great Britain once satisfied as to the facilities afforded , and a fairly profitable return secured on the investments already made , the organizations referred to will be most influential , and there can hardly be any doubt that the supply of money for investment in industrial enterprises here , which for the past two years has been at the rate of a million dollars a week , will very soon equal three times that amount , and perhaps reach as high a sum eventually as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smaller than this , the influences set in motion may be most potential . It would not require more than twenty years at this rate to place Great Britain in control // of one-half the industrial enterprises of the United States , and to turn the tide of money back from profits and dividends to such an extent as to make this country pay a vast tribute to London . Already the amount of interest remitted abroad from the United States to England , Germany , and Holland , for governmental , state , municipal , railroad , and mortgage indebtedness must approach a hundred million dollars annually . If the amount to be invested from abroad should increase three-fold in the next two decades , twenty years hence would witness a repayment to European countries of a sum equal to three hundred million dollars anually , or at the rate of almost a million dollars per day for every business day in the year . This seems a startling conclusion , and , as the bulk of it would go to Great Britain , it irresistibly brings to recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the Boston tea-party and subsequently , the idea of paying tribute to England , the whirligig of time is bringing a condition of things by which the amount is increased ten-thousandfold , but under circumstances highly beneficial to both countries . It is impossible that there should have been for so many years so vast a stream of labor from Europe coming in the direction of the United States without in time being followed by a commensurate stream of capital ; and it is a reasonable conclusion that , while foreign labor has enormously benefited the country , the employment of the capital now and hereafter to arrive from abroad will be even more beneficial . For it is clear that the money now coming from Great Britain occupies a vastly different place in our economy from that which she contributes to any other country . Here it comes to us , not as loans , bearing irrevocable fixed charges , which must be paid whether or no ; it comes as a contribution to the business capital of the country , taking its chances of success with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a huge international partnership , in which individaals on both sides equally participate-a ' partnership in which the bargain is not to the disadvantage of either , but a profit is made for both , the extent and magnitude of which no man can tell . No country needs money more than the United States ; in no country can it be more safely employed . The increase of money capital has been small in proportion to the growth in the volume of business , to the developru3nt of natural resources , the growth of railway tonnage , or the enurinous output of cotton , corn , oil , // and other products . The banking facilities are shown , by the continuous pressure of the past few months , to be quite inadequate to the needs of legitimate business  --  a condition that is intensified by the transitional state of our chief monetary institutions , in their relation to the general government . But aside from this , the ability to employ more capital is everywhere apparent . The South , with its marvellous growth and possibilities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its variety of products ,  --  all are fields for enterprise for our own people , whose capital , being augmented , or released from investments in existing prosperous establishments , will stimulate our growth , and make this nation more than ever the wonder of the world , to the pride and profit of the mother-country that gave it birth . If to the opportunities already afforded within the boundaries of the United States should be added , for commercial purposes , that vast region of " The Greater Half of the Continents ' included within the British possessions in North America , so that the commerce of this country may become continental in extent and continental in profit , no one can tell how advantageous may be this monetary connection between the two countries . It is not difficult to estimate the ultimate influences set in motion by such a practical union of material interests between the two great English-speaking nations of the world . Mr. Gladstone , in his Paris speech , referring to the prediction that at the end of another hundred years the population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospective anJ approaching right of America to be the great organ of the powerful English tongue 's ; and , alluding to the United States and Great Britain , added these significant words , that " there was rio cause upon earth that should now or hereafter divide one from the other . " That the interests of mankind at large will be advanced by a close bond of union between the two great AngloSaxon nations , no one can doubt , and nothing will contribute more certainly to this harmony than the mutuality of interests which is certain to be created by the investment of British capital in American industrial enterprises.
