txt The iron steamboat Cepheus , which seems to have been wedded to mischance , has for a second time in her career found a resting place on the beach at Norton 's Point . As a slight variation in the mopotony of her mishaps , this last accident was due to a collision with another vessel . As a result of it she staggered toward the beach with her forward compartment filled with water and was run upon a shelving bank to prevent her sinking in deep water . The accident took place at 2:15 yesterday afternoon . The colliding vessel was the Cetus Of the same line . The latter sustained some injury to her bow , but it was not serious enough to prevent her transferring to her decks the passengers of the crippled Cepheus . These were subsequently landed at the Iron Steamboat pier , somewhat excited , but in other respects none the worse for the experience . The accident was due to fog . When the vapory mist set in both Captains took every precaution to prevent accident . But there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an evil against which no amount of care can insure immunity , and that so long as there are fogs and craft to run into each other , so long will there be collisions . The Cepheus and Cetus illustrated this theory . Both vessels were feeling their way through the thickness under slowed engines , and both were sounding warning signals . Everybody knows the depravity of sound where vision can not aid the ear . The whistles sounded first over the bow and then seemed to wail from over the stern . The two vessels continued to grope their way along . Suddenly the fog-veiled fabrics stole into view of each other ; there was a clanging of engine-room gongs , and then the Cepheus reeled from a blow implanted on her starboard side forward of the paddlebox . Neither vessel had many passengers on board , and the panic , which In this case , was short-lived , and which in all cases is inevitable when two pleasure craft collide , was soon subdued . Then came the transfer of passengers and beaching of the Cepheus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that the Cepheus was not more than fifty feet distant when he first descried her . The helm was thrown hard over , and the signal to stop the engines was rung , but the distance was too short , and the headway had hardly been checked when the shock of collision came . The Cetus was on her 1:15 P. M. trip from New-York to Coney Island , and the Cepheus was making her 1:30 P. M. journey from Rockaway to the city . Capt . Van Schaick was in command of the latter vessel . Pilot C. Loads was also on board . Pilot Quinn was on board the Cetus , but he was not in charge at the time of the accident . Capt . Morrell says there were not more than a score of passengers on his boat . The Captain of the Cepheus thinks there were about fifteen or twenty on board his craft . The latter says that When he found the forward compartment flooded with water he feared that the bulkhead might give way , and decided to beach the boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board the Cetus , the Cepheus was headed toward her old berth on Norton 's Point . She reached it under her own steam and slid gently up on the shelving bank . The hole which had been cut in her how by the iron stem of the Cetus was large enough for a man to walk through . The Cetus sustained but little injury . Her Captain said the boat would make her regular trips to-day . The Chapman Derrick and Wrecking Company 's tug Hustler was sent to the aid of the stranded Cepheus at 7 o'clock . The hole will be patched up . and , after the water in the flooded compartment is pumped out , the vessel will be floated and brought to this city . The company expects to have her in service again within a few days . The passengers , when landed at the pier , were not disposed to discuss the accident at any great length . One of the number was an elderly individual . A reporter asked him about the collision . The elderly one said nervously that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease and was afraid he would excite himself if. - he ventured to think about it again . A few of the passengers were landed at the company 's West Brighton pier . Among them was George Stanfield , who was in the barroom of the Cepheus at the time of the accident . He was thrown against a beam and received a cut In the forehead . Dr. Hill dressed the wound . Superintendent Kent of the Iron Steamboat Company said the accident was an unavoidable one , and that no one could be blamed . The Cepheus spitted herself on a hidden rock off Coney Island two years ago , and to prevent sinking was beached on Norton 's Point . Capt . Pearce was then in command . A short time previous she ran down a rowboat in the harbor , drowning two of the occupants . The vessel is one of the newest of the company 's boats . She is 213 feet 6 inches in length and has a beam of 36 feet . The 14 water-tight compartments with which the vessel is fitted have twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably have sunk and would probably have added many names to the list of drowned .
