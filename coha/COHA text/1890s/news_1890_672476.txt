txt The White Star Line 's new steamer Majestic , Capt . H. Parsell , was in great peril last night . Her " eyes " were on fire , and the fight to save her WES as fierce as it was successful . She was ready to sail at 8:20 o'clock this morning and a few cabin and twenty-five steerage passengers were on board . The latter went to their bunks only to rest uneasily because of the rumbling of the machinery and the cries of officers and longshoremen , who were packing Hold No. 1 with bales of cotton . The work went on , and at 10 o'clock about two hundred bales had been stowed away . The hold was so jammed that there was then room for only two more bales . The freight clerk on the dock ticked them off , the slings were traveling down the hoist plank for them , and sailors were getting ready the hatches and the battening cloths and wedges , when , from the hold , which runs under the steerage and forecastle , arose a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ringing over the decks . Officers and seamen rushed to the hatchway , and the steerage passengers started from their bunks . Capt . Parson learned that fire had been taken on board the ship in one of the bales of cotton . The danger was extreme , and delay meant perhaps the destruction of the craft . Orders were given to summon all hands forward , notify the land fire department , and clear Hold No. 1 as quickly as possible . The discovery of the fire was shouted ashore . In the office of the company the glass of a special building signal box was broken and the signal was struck . Five seconds later a shout came from the ship that the fire was fierce and gaining headway , and a regular alarm was turned in . The fire apparatus on tho steamer was reinforced by three laud steamers and the fireboat Zophar Mills . Fortunately there was no delay in running the hose on the dock or in starting water . The tire-boat 's stream was started on a full-sized hose and appeared strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a few minutes the steamer 's hose , with those of the land engines , turned on a deluge , but the lire hold on obstinately for ten minutes . Then Chief Reilly , who was in command , decided that he had the outbreak in check . The fire fighting was done at close quarters , as around the hatchway of the burning hold more than four score firemen and their commanders , seamen , and the officers of the ship were massed . Capt . Parsell was as active as . any . As soon as it was possible to enter the hold , longshoremen and sailors began handling the top bales and the hoisting machinery pulled them up and turned them over the rail to slide to the dock . Many of them were still burning . As the break in the charred bales grew larger the sufferings of the men and officers who were among them became greater , partly on account of the smoke and heat , and partly because of live steam which had been turned on as an auxiliary to the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were thus suffering . When the hold was half emptied it was seen that the damage to the vessel was only slight and that the iron bulkheads were - water tight , so that Capt . Parsell announced triumphantly that the steamer would sail to-day on schedule time , but with hold No. 1 empty . It was cleared and pumped out by 1 A. M. , and no doubt when the decks are washed down little trace of the disaster will be seen . The damage to the vessel may not amount to more than $2,000 , and the loss on the cotton is estimated at $20 a bale all around , or $3,500 . Capt . Parsell congratulated himself and the crew , passengers , and company on the discovery of the fire in port . At sea it would have been an alarming disaster , and might have destroyed the vessel . The losses are of course amply insured . The value of the vessel and cargo is little short of $1,750,000.                @ @ @ @ @
