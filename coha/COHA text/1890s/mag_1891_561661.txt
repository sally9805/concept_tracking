txt WE IN England and in Canada always desire to be most respectful to America , aud to all Americans , including Mr. Wiman , whom we would still like to think of as the engaging Toronto youth he once was . But little boys will grow up , and some young Canadians will become full-grown Americans , and we do not feel disposed to quarrel with this decree of Providence , however often we may heave a sigh and say , " What a nice little boy it once was ! " Especially in the pages of THE WORTH AMERICAN REVIEW are we always most respectful to our cousins of the United States ; else we should not be admitted into the pages of that patriotic print , nor could our words reach the sixty millions of readers everybody knows it commands . Thus disposed in our mind , we were prepared to find that Mr. Wimnan , writing in these pages , would be more American than the Americans ; just as Mr. Van Home , of a good old New York family , is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than are many " Kanucks . " We did not expect to find any trace of the exuberance of Ontario in his pages , but , to our surprise , we do . He still remembers some of the phrases of his neighbors of early days , and he still speaks of the dividing-line between the United States and Canada crossing the continent rather to the south of a line of equal division between the two nationalities . He says with pride that Canada possesses more than half of the continent , thereby placing the warm side of his heart close against the north pole . He also concedes that Canada is " loyal " in the sense of liking the old country , although he thinks that a mantle of union jack conceals a waistcoat and coat of stars and stripes . But where his Americanism comes in is where he generously disposes of all the north to the United States after a generation has passed away . Then will there be but one country , in his belief , and all the frozen portion of the continent shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he thinks the United States are as yet indifferent to the great good he means // to bring them by this annexation in another score of years , he insists that they shall have Labrador , the shores of Hudson 's Bay , and the Mackenzie River . So much cold water may well damp annexation ardor ; but are not all Americans said to be fond of drinking iced water , and what , under these circumstances , can the prospect of owning so much of it bring but pleasure ? Ungenerous doctors sometimes say that a great deal of dyspepsia comes from over-indulgence in iced water ; but no , Mr. Wiman does not believe it , and Uncle Sam must drink of the waters of the St. Lawrence , Athabasca , and Mackenzie , and call them his . He must " cast his shoe " over this land he is said not to want , and trample out all individualism in French Canada , and among the descendants of the English loyalists , because trade connections along a strip of frontier can be made better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the end of things created ? " Yes ; all yields to a little more trade connection . Patriotism , loyalty , pride in country and in the continuity of its history , in its institutions , in its freedom , that gives its people now a sovereign power , all-all must go before a little more-if only a percentage-of increased trade connection Horace said that they who crossed the sea changed the sky only , not the mind . But our friend has only gone a few hundred miles from his old home , and lo ! a changed mind indeed . Do his old fellow-countrymen agree with that mind ? Let the continuance in power of the Prime Minister who is opposed to Mr. Wiman 's ideas answer the question . Sir John Macdonald has been at the head of the government for much more than the time , " the passing of a generation , " which Mr. Wiman claims as sufficient for the plans he favors , and has been kept in power for that long period because Canada believes that she would be called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Washington instead of at home . There are many reasons why the United States should regard with indifference any attempt to " round up " Canada into the Union . The American policy has always been to make her people as homogeneous as possible . It is not possible to do so in the South , where the negroes , in spite of ancient Southern prophecies to the contrary , will go on increasing in a far greater ratio than ca* in a hot country , the white population . But elsewhere the U ni*d States system is to grind into one Englishspeaking // democratic community all foreigners and their descendants who settle in America . German boys are chaffed at school ont of their German . Frenchmen hardly attempt to go as settlers , and their fate is the same if they do ; for even in the South , where conditions are more favorable to the retention of peculiarities , where there are few but negroes around , witness the decay of French in Louisiana . English , English everywhere ,  --  in school , in the counting-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada there isa great population of French-speaking Catholics , who refuse thus to be amalgamated , and who rejoice in their province of Quebec , in their own laws , language , institutions . It is a population constantly growing , and the most sturdy in physique on the continent . To try to absorb this population would he one of the cold-water draughts that would give Uncle Sam dyspepsia . It is difficult to say whether they would vote Republican or Democratic . Certain it is that they would puzzle the wire-pullers , and , owing to their rapid natural increase in numbers ,  --  few families among them having less than eight children ,  --  the problem of their management would be more difficult to solve as time passed . But even without taking into account the difficulties involved in the absorption of a wholly foreign race such as the French Canadian , there are other reasons which may well excuse the indifference with which any project for the annexation of Canada is regarded in the United States . The country in that mighty union of commonwealths is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needful , and gives its central government already sufficient occupation . It is often remarked how indifferent the Mississippi-valley population are to the interests of the East , as shown in the manner in which they question the utility of spending money on a powerful navy and the arming of the Atlantic ports . The same tendency may be observed among the rapidly-increasing people of the Pacific coast . And this happens in spite of the more rapid communication constantly insured to an ever-increasing degree by the construction of railroads . The tendencies to what the Germans call " particularism " are always latent in so huge a bundle of sticks . Patriotism may scout the idea as traitorous , but there are other causes besides that which produced the Southern " Rebellion , " capable of being nurtured into disaffection to a central government . Phrases are // awkward things when they have a wide bearing , and the " sovereignty " of each State is a phrase that may be grown into a growth not wholly compatible with a due relegation into the shades of obedience . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sway of the Washington government one that has cherished a separate sentiment and constitution for a time equal to the period of the life of the American nation itself ? Augustus knew when to check the wings of victory , so that the empire he ruled should not be overweighted with its own immensity . The peoples on the north of the St. Lawrence and the lakes have lived for a century and a half under a rule which is wholly different from that type brought into existence in the States . It is one where the democracy , proud of the continuity of their history as symbolized by the crown , has no strong bureaucracy fixed in power over it . It changes the government as it chooses by the votes of its representatives , sitting in an assembly where the ministers have also seats , and can be questioned by the independent or by the opposition members . This is a species of liberty unknown in the constitution of the United States ; and it may fairly be said that the Canadians , when they formed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best in the British constitution , most of what is best in the American , and left behind them the antiquated absurdities of the British , at the same time rejecting the more novel defects which have become apparent in the American . They had the benefit of the experience of the old world and the new world for their guidance . Goldwin Smith and a few other essayists may sneer at the Governor-General as a figurehead , and at the title " Sir " given to eminent men in office or at the head of the learned professions in Canada ; but they must be conscious that these trivial personalities must be taken for the crotchets they represent by their utterance , and that a system which is alive because it suits a free people can not be hindered by the few bacilli who do not find their surroundings suited to the further propagation of their little crooked species . Whatever we may think as to the relative advantages of the two types of government to the north and the south of the international boundary , certain it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole people to regard it as good , and to look upon the southern type as faulty . Is it for the advantage of the United States that there should be within its borders a northern tier // or two of new States looking to the Canadian form of monarchical institutions as insuring more liberty than can be obtained under a republican form ? or is it not best to keep on developing these countries under the flag of the federal government at Washington , whose people have grown up under and been accustomed to the presidential type , more autocratic than the monarchical ? It will be long before the territories now under the southern government are so filled with men that more elbow-room is wanted . Until that time comes , would it not be best for the most enthusiastic believer in the old Monroe Doctrine to waive the right of conquest , whether by arms or by bribery ? It will be said that there is little use in discussing an annexaation for which nobody specially cares ; the American people having enough to do at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goods . So it is in the main ; but if the main body allow a few energetic individuals , whether they be secretaries of state from near the frontier or humbler members of Congress , to pursue a policy of pressure through diplomatic devices , or congressional acts raising the tariff against their agricultural neighbors over the frontier line , there may well be misunderstanding as to the attitude of indifference . It is more likely that it will be assumed that , judging from appearances , there is a fair amount of disposition to engulf the smaller nation . It is probably only the northern row of States who desire it . But if , as the official announcement says , there is no desire on the part of the United States to engulf Canada , or on the part of Canada to be annexed , is there no intermediate result aimed at by the heightening of the American tariff , and the refusal to consider the free interchange of raw products only ? Yes ; there is , first , commercial union , which the advocates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I write , the news of the result of the elections in the Dominion is published , and a sufficient working majority returned to support Sir John Macdonald 's policy has told the world that Canada wishes to pursue her own path . Commercial union can not be based on any abiding certainty , as Mr. Blake has pointed out , so long as there are two points of control , one at Washington and one at Ottawa . So long as such a dual management exists , commercial union would repose on no assured foundation . The Washington management would necessarily demand more and // more power over the joint arrangement , which might be liked in the southern capital , but would hardly be appreciated in the northern . The paddling of your own canoe becomes a manifestly unnecessary performance when the canoe is hauled along by a powerful propeller ahead of her . " Quite so ; then why paddle at all ? " the reader will ask ; and the answer must be that the paddlers think their mode of propulsion rapid enough , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their waters , and can exploit them better , as answering better to the exigencies of the currents and more easily launched on fresh waters that may open up before the voyager . It is , in other words , the love of their own ; the love of that land their fathers went , to and believed in when no one else believed in her ; the love of fulfilling the hopes of their fathers ; the love iii the pride of much doiie under many difficulties ; the love of freedom which is assured to them by the rule they themselves have fashioned as they chose ; the proud affection of manly hearts for the promise of a great future to be greatly earned-this is the sentiment that makes Canada wish to paddle her own canoe . Now , let us see if this is altogether the folly that our too comfortable critic , Mr. Wiman , imagines it to be . Canada was " once upon a time " a ihere string of settlements stretching along the United States boundary , disconnected with each other , and cherishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any assured fortune . What is she now ? The string of settlements has widened out into a splendid zone of prosperous provinces , steadily increasing in wealth , in population , in power of intercom nunication , and in the development of undreamed-of mineral and agricultural wealth . The article Mr. Wiman wrote in this REVIEW may talk in too lofty a strain about more tlnn half a continent , when part of it is likely to be used only to supj ly the world with ice ; but he does not exaggerate when lie speaks of the large value of Canada 's raw products . Coal , gold , silver , nickel , copper , iron , belong to her in immense quantities . Wheat , wood , and barley are abundant , and the furs of the far north almost justify the phrase we have just taken exception to as being too magniloquent . These resources she possesses in a territory which , under the old flag , she has made her own in peace and happiness . More laud towards the " divides ' that separates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being occupied . // *63 A railway reaches now one hundred miles north of Quebec . Behind the Ottawa there is plenty of land as good as that which has made the French Canadian happy in his earlier home . Lines , again , penetrate now to the North Saskatchewan . Great tracts of oil-bearing strata have been discovered even further north . It is evident that the vein of good country is no shallow or niggardly strip , but a broad belt in which the white man , like the wheat , attains the greatest strength of body . Grumblers there always will be . Some point to emigration to the States . But with a redundant increase does not every prosperous state pour its " overflow " into the United States ? Does any one say that Germany is a decaying power because her superabundance finds an outlet in the States ? So in Canada does her abundance overflow , taking its way along the railways to places where wages are highest at the moment . But she is , at the same time , steadily filling her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one too hasty patriot , about the " empty " northwest . if he had travelled there when I traversed that country , only ten years ago , and compared its state then with its state after one decade , he would not have called it " empty , " but " pre*mpting . " There is eagerness to get the best lands there , because they are being taken up . Then the revenue throughout the provinces at large has been steadily augmenting , and the vast sums spent in promoting public works belong to that class of state expenditure called in india " reproductive . " Ten years ago not a single member of the Canadian government had ever seen the northwest . The present Minister of the Interior , to whose thoughtful energy much of the success of our Indian policy is due , was not then in the cabinet , but at the head of the Indian administration on the plains . If any one had predicted , only in Lord Monck 's time , that in 1891 there would not be a buffalo on the prairies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considered a queer crank . In every department of national prosperity , in settlement , good agriculture , enterprise in mining and lumbering industry , in the fisheries , everywhere from east to west definite and steady progress of the best type , not spasmodic , but sure and lasting , is visible to the stranger , if certain natives shut their eyes to it . The factories that have arisen have sprung into being since a certain tariff has been imposed on foreign manufacturers . Undoubtedly in a country capable of much // development , and exposed to the hostile action of more powerful rival factories , such a measure of protection is legitimate , if by this only the beginning of industrial enterprise of this description can be planted . Some economists speak of supply and demand as if those terms included all circumstances . But through human ingenuity , " rings " and devices of combination can keep all the supply to themselves , and do much to regulate the demand . It is no answer to this that in the long run the eternal principles will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees them insulted are in their graves . Canada has had ample cause to know that combination in trade among her more powerful neighbors may " slaughter " her factories , and that the prices show , in spite of the massacre of their innocent infant factories , no abatement . I repeat , therefore , that , when a country has great natural wealth to safeguard and exploit for her own people , the protective tariff may often be necessary to plant factories . This is considered heresy in England , but England , under similar circumstances to those of Canada , would do precisely the same . She is now a seething fac tory in mid-channel between the old and the new world , and her interests now are to take all she can of raw and manufactured goods , because her territories are too small to let her people live except as general brokers on their own and other nations ' products . Canada is small in population , but vast in land and latent resource , and she gets the capital of the old world to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of her revenue from import duties , for she becomes stronger every year to bear any strain . Let it not be imagined , then , that a high tariff against her agricultural products enacted in the States will turn more than a few frontier countries in favor of a plan that would deprive her of " ruling her own roost . " Her border countri6s have developed faster than those of the Nexv England States contiguous to her . The progress of the Quebec population has been mentioned with the admiration it deserves . Ontario has sent many of her sons to the northwestern territories and Manitoba , as well as to the United States , and is quite as well off as corresponding districts south of the line . Yes , everywhere the conviction is growing that along those grand parallels of latitude can be built up a nation worthy to find its place in the world , worthy to stand near its great neighbor to the south , able to achieve what it designs , // and to make itself respected by an independence which is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subservient . Thus Canada tells the mother-land that she wishes to live on in alliance with her , and under her flag to make the treaties which shall be correlative to her own extending commerce . Thus she tells the States that she desires to be friendly with them , to live alongside of them and work with them for the civilization of the continent , in all amity and good neighborhood . And here I must protest against the utterly unfounded language Mr. Wiman is pleased to use regarding what he calls Canada 's unfriendly attitude to the United States in some matters , such as the fisheries , salvage on the lakes , and such like . If he had taken the smallest pains to look through the history of these small matters of difference incidental to the rivalries , not of nations , but of all neighb9ring communities , he would have found in the past of his own people , whose conduct he thus shamefully traduces , the most eager desire to be generous to their neighbors while just to themselves . In regard to protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruisers against poaching ? IDo the salvage combinations of the cities southwest of the lakes do less than do the Canadians to guarantee the proper earnings of their salvage vessels ? Is he unaware of the special order issued by Mr. Mackenzie Bowell , Minister of Customs , as long ago as 1880 , that no vessel should ever be left in distress , and that it did not matter whence came the aid , from Americans or Canadians , so long as the succor was afforded ? To represent the Canadian government in any other light than ax a most friendly neighbor is a mischievous and wholly unfounded statement . The underwriters on both sides of the lakes have a trade interest in salvage , and the northern vessels are quite competent to assist any ship in trouble ; but the government have gone out of their way to assure the southern salvage companies that all assistance will be welcomed in case of trouble where the local succor may be retarded . It is wholly wrong to attribute , in this or any other international relation , the slightest want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond are not equally allowed to pass the frontiers . Again this is not the case , all goods in bond being allowed to pass , except those few articles reserved by treaty , such as fish and fish oil . Again , it is not the case that there is unequal treatment in regard to canal traffic . All vessels // are allowed to pass all canals under equal rates , whether Canadian or American . It is difficult to conceive the motive of these imputations , coming as they do from a Canadian born ; and perhaps it is best in this case to stick very rigidly to the polite rule of comity that asks us not to impute any motive . The modus vivendi , or license system , at present in force is a most striking instance of the desire of the northern people to be friendly . No country can ever be worthy of friendship if it does not respect itself by enforcing its undoubted rights , and this is all that has been done . And this is the action that must necessarily be pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in frontier countries . It would swamp the manufacturers and give the more numerous nation to the south entire control of the northern market , while Canada would not have the market of the 60,000,000 , but be at their mercy as to the disposition of her trade . She prefers to direct her own destiny , and is conscious of her duty to herself . Her trade with the United States increased greatly during the term of the treaty negotiated in 1854 and broken off by the Americans in 1866 . The breaking of that treaty , which we suppose Mr. Wiman would reckon among the most neighborly of the acts of the Washington government , was one of the causes that led to the union of the Canadian provinces . Since those days the provinces have yearly become more and more knit together , and the practical common-sense of their peoples has told them that they can form a nation , and have a voice to which men shall listen . The old world , as well as the new , believes this confidence to be well founded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her municipal bonds . New lines of steamers are about to connect her yet more with the trade of Europe and Asia . Should the United States be neighborly , they will arrange that some such treaty as that which lasted for twelve years , and was advantageous to the border countries on both sides , be again enacted . Should they refuse , the interruption will but make more visible that bright spark of patriotism whose light has before now illuminated the darker passages of Canada 's history , and will become yet more intense as the mighty motive power of national life makes her move with an ever-firmer step towards that future she is conscious she will inherit.
