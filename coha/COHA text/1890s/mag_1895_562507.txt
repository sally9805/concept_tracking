txt I AM asked by the editor of the NORTH AMERICA* REVIEW to say what I think about the influence of the American press in the fomentation of international strife and ill feeling . This influence is exerted in two ways , on diplomacy and on popular thought . I must at the outset , however , guard myself against the supposition that my remarks will apply to the press as a whole . Luckily , there is a considerable number of newspapers edited by serious men who have a sense of responsibility for their utterances , and who address themselves to the more intelligent portion of the community . It is they who in times of excitement generally have the last word , and express the sober second thought of the public . But most of what I say will apply to the papers with largest circulation , to which large circulation is the chief end of existence , and which are ready to take any line on topics of the day that seems likely to increase it . No proper estimate of the strength of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without taking into account the difference between our machinery of intercourse with foreign nations and that of Europe . We have no diplomatic service properly so-called , for much the same reason that we have no standing army or large navy . That is , our situation differs from that of the powers of the old world in having no formidable neighbors , in running no risk of conquest or humiliation , or of serious disputes about territory or influence . We are not , in short , in immediate contact with anybody who is likely to want to quarrel with us , or gainsay our wishes . This , in the early part of the century , was considered a piece of very good fortune , as it seemed likely to enable us to cultivate with // greater success the art of government , with the art of quarreling , which has absorbed so much of the talent and attention of the human race , left out . Considering the great absorptiou of human resources in this business of quarreling , from the earliest ages , and the frightful drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isoliltion of the United States was very reasonably looked on at one time as a great blessing . It removed the element most likely to disturb the experiment of purely democratic government made on this continent for the first time . But to it , one caniiot help thinking , we owe the popular indifference to the character and training of our representatives abroad , and the selection of them without any special reference to their fitness for their duties . Their functions being likely to prove unimportant , they have generally been appointed with regard solely to their rOle in home politics , and one is bound to acknowledge that from this no great mischief has resulted . It has brought considerable ridicule on us . It has given foreigners a low idea of our social culture , and of the national standards of efficiency , but it has not in any marked case involved 11S in international difficulties . But a new school of thought on this matter has sprung lip among us within a few years , composed largely of naval officers , and Republican politicians of greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of " Jingoes , " and are profoundly dissatisfied with this isolation . They wish to bring the United States into contact with considerable foreign powers at as many points as possible , and failing the possibility of this on this continent , to advocate the annexation of islands , some of them at great distances from our coasts , like Hawaii , and Samoa , and Cuba , and the West Indies generally , and the acquisition of interests on foreign soil , like the Nicaragua Canal , the joint use of which other powers would probably claim . They admit the probability of frequent quarrels arising out of this contact , by asking at the same time for a very large increase of the navy to carry on the wars which it would probably cause , and to which they seem to look forward with a certain exultation . Moreover , they seem to treat even the extension of our commerce as a military operation . The mere sale of our goods to foreigners , is to incline them to fight us . These expectations , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These powers // are represented , especially Great Britain , as watching us with extreme jealousy , and as incessantly devising plans either for evading the Monroe doctrine , or for keeping us out of the Pacific Ocean , or for obtaining control of the Nicaragua Canal . Most of the expressions of this policy can only be met with ridicule . But ridicule can only be effective among those who have some knowledge of foreign nations and of foreign ideas . It is difficult , for instance , to ridicule it effectively to the population of the Mississippi Valley who know nothing of Europe or Europeans , except what they get from the newspapers , and to whom it seems most rational , human and likely , that the European monarchies should try to prevent the expansion of the United States , partly through jealousy and partly through greed . The advocates of it , too , very cleverly ignore all the arguments against it , and by repeating their assertions , give them finally the air of accepted facts . Should this sect be successful In getting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , have to adapt ourselves to the situation , and provide ourselves with the instruments of intercourse suited to our new relations with foreign powers . We can not any longer fill our legations and consulates , with the waifs and strays of our political contests , the invalids , the broken men , the reformed drunkards , the unknown colonels , and the Mississippi editors , who now represent us . If we are to become a fighting people we must have trained regulars , who understand the diplomatic art , as the other fighting peoples practise it . Now , what is this art ? Well , it is very simple . It may be said with at least a close approach to accuracy , that ever since the Middle Ages , the intercourse of the civilized powers of the world has been modelled on the duelling code , and the diplomatists play very much the part of the seconds . Since the French Revolution , the growth of democracy and , above all , of the habit of discussion , which is inseparable from democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , much of it intended for the popular ear . But in its main features the treatment of any question which may lead to a rupture or quarrel , is a copy of that of the seconds who are charged with the duty of obtaining " satisfaction** for a supposed insult or slight . There is the same studied politeness of form , the *same assumption that if any wrong has been done it will be rectified without further trouble ; the same care in ascer // taming whether the offender or his servants really said , or did , the thing complained of , whether it meant what it appeared to mean , whether he stands by it , or can explain it away , and so on . All abuse , or invective , or threats or boasts , or suggestion of bad motives or bad character , all attempts to hurry the denoa*nen1 , and all allusions to possible settlement by force , are carefully barred out . I do not mean to say , by any means , that all diplomatic correspondence is free from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatist endeavors to work on these lines , that this is the theory of the profession , and that the diplomatist who disregards it , is what is in athletics called a " duffer . " But not only are these methods modelled on those of the duelling code , but they are those which are prescribed by the growth of civilization . In truth , it may be said that the growth of civilization or of culture , among a people or a class , may be measured by its mode of settling disputes . In the lowest stages , among savages , or Calabrian peasants , or Arizona miners , the misunderstood jest , or the insulting word , is promptly punished by the knife or the pistol . There is no debate , no opportunity for explanation or retraction . In fact , the readiness to fight of the mass of mankind is one of the oddest and saddest facts in human history . A North Carolinian farmer the other day , hearing from a New York sportsman of the crowds who walked up and down Broadway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If as many people as that , " said he , " were walkin ' on the road here , they 'd all fall to fightin ' . " Readiness to fight without discussion is , in fact , all over the world the most evident mark , except dirt , of a low civilization . As a community or a class rises in civilization , it tends more and more to discuss matters of difference , to improve its forms of discussion , and to make peaceful settlement easy , by the use of polite phrases and the absence of threats and abuse . Jn all this people follow human nature . The very object of a dispute with any one is to get from him what you want with the least possible trouble , and the less yon wound his self-love the more likely he is to yield . This art of getting what you want without quarreling is , in fact , known as " diplomacy " in common parlance . Now , the unorganized and untrained character of our diplomatists has not , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of our geographical isolation from the other great Powers , and because , therefore , the great Powers have generally agreed to treat us as mere amateurs who were not to be held accountable for our language . The American Minister is nowhere abroad considered a real member of the diplomatic corps . His mistakes , therefore , do not count . His indiscretions excite amusement or sympathy . He is understood to be a politician , with home interests which are much more important to him than his diplomatic interests . He is not supposed , really , to wish to quarrel with anybody . If the blood of an English , a Russian , a French ex-Cabinet Minister , had " boiled " as Mr. W. C. Whitney 's is said to have done at Naples the other day , over the Spanish shots fired at the Allian9a , it would have sent a thrill over Europe . He would have been supposed to have weighed his words , and to have been acting under inspiration . In the case of an American , such a statement excites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this irresponsibility will pass away . The words of our public men will begin to be listened to as indicative of a policy of some kind , and when disputes arise , the fierce language will be taken , not as a means of winning votes for a party , but of a desire to fight . If we had a large navy such declarations as Mr. Frye 's , for instance , that he would like to seize Cuba by conquest , si mply because we wanted it , would probably lead to negotiations for a European combination against us . A power which openly avowed that might made right , and that it meant to ' seize whatever it desired , without regard to morality or international law , would certainly , if strong enough to make its threats seem serious , be met by the same sort of resistance which was offered to Charles V. , Louis XIV. , and Napoleon I. There is considerable looseness in what is called international law , and violation of its obligations by great States is not uncommon ; but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Power which said openly that it would do as it pleased . Some sort of alliance for resistance to it , for its compulsory entrance into the family of nations , and for its subjection to the common rules of morality , is sure to arise . Civilized mankind has never submitted longer than it could help to an unmoral Power , that is , to a Power which made its own will its only law . It is in pushing us towards some such crisis that the newspaper press becomes // dangerous . I do not believe it has much direct influence on the mind of any politician . He does not weigh its arguments , and , in fact , secretly despises it . What renders it formidable to him is what renders it formidable to most men , and especially timid men , that is the belief , that it influences other people . Most men , for instance , who wince under newspaper attacks or ridicule , do not really care much about it as addressed to themselves . If addressed to a public man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , it would in the majority of cases , simply amuse him . It is the supposed effect on other people which gives them sting or makes them grateful . Politicians especially labor under this delusion . To them , the people , or a considerable portion of them , believe everything they see in the newspaper , or at all events agree with it , and when the statesman is bearding Great Britain , or proposing to wipe Spain out of existence , editorial approval is sweet and encouraging . The newspapers , too , have the strongest possible motive for approving hostile demonstrations . They are , as they often openly avow , enterprises for making money , and they find money very hard to make . They rely mostly on large sales for profits , and for large sales on sensational news . Now , nothing does so much to keep sensational news coining in over considerable periods of time , as war . Our war was , in fact , the halcyon period of newspaper literature as regarded pecuniary returns . Many previously struggling journals made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales and the rush of advertising caused by the rise of prices and the inflation of the currency , gave newspaper publishers the happiest days they have ever known in America . Since then the decline has been steady and serious . In New York the number of newspapers which pay dividends is wretchedly small . The competition among the sensational kind is very great . Some barely exist , or they rely on some capitalist to fill up the yearly deficit . The watch which they all keep up for something startling in the way of news is painful in its eagerness . War would , therefore , be a godsend to them . It would renew the rage for " extras , " which attended the varying fortunes of our civil conflict . It would raise hundreds of journals out of want and anxiety , and , next to war , they welcome " the promise of war , " with which Byron 's tambourgi gave " hope to // the valiant . " Hence every incident which can by any possibility lead to an international conflict is greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct orders of a superior , and is converted into a deliberate insult . All foreign statesmen are made to plot against the United States , and concoct schemes for depriving us of something , or in some manner humiliating us . Apologies are treated as lies meant to throw us off our guard . I do not think I exaggerate when I say that upon any private matter of business no sensible man would think of heeding talk like that to which some of our statesmen have lately treated us on our foreign relations . Most of it , like that about the Hawaiian cable , such as Mr. Morgan 's suggestion , that a " militiry cable " would in some manner differ from a commercial cable , would discredit a smart boy or girl of twelve . But it suits the purpose of the militant press to call the jingo orators " well-informed men who have the courage of their convictions , " or " students of the foreign policy " of some other nation . Along with this goes daily abuse of the Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying to keep the peace . Everything he does is a blunder . Common politeness in his despatches is base truckling to foreigners . His ignorance is unparalleled . Care for the honor of his country he has none . Foreign ministers write his despatches , and it is well if he is not receiving a salary from England or Germany . Now for whom is this stuff intended ? On whom is it supposed likely to have some effect ? Well , on a very large body of persons , mostly farmers , but also veterans of the late war , and military and naval men , who think the time has come for something remarkable to happen in American history . The abounding , unparalleled prosperity of the country which set in very soon after the Revolution , was sure in the long run to affect the national temperament very seriously , and it did affect it , in the direction of greater hopefulness , greater indifference to consequences , and greater confidence in the national destiny . Along with this came the cultivation of enthusiasm , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coldness , reflectiveness , and caution , as unsuited to the conditions of life on this continent . Indeed , excitability may almost be said to have become a cherished trait , which the American // boy learns from his earliest years to consider a necessary part of his equipment as a citizen . A more desirable surface than this for newspapers to play on , it would be hard to contrive . Given enthusiasm , and sensitiveness under the slights to which the less advanced state of our material civilization exposes us at the hands of our foreign critics , and we have almost complete materials for those peculiarly savage and truculent wars for which people who do not mean to share in their dangers or responsibilities , are always ready . No wars are so relentless , so difficult to end , or so exacting in their aims , as wars set on foot by persons who will suffer in neither mind nor body from defeat . Not only are the directors of newspaper wars , however , exempt from responsibility , but defeat is just as profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to be even greater after a disaster than after a triumph . Now the medium through which the newspaper acts most effectively on the enthusiastic temperament is what is known as " true Americanism , " or " thorough Americanism , " or better than all , " intense Americanism . " I have studied these phrases a good deal with the view of finding out their exact meaning , but have not been successful in ever getting any exact definition of them from any one who used them in good faith . As a rule , one 's merely asking for the meaning of them is taken as a sign of a spirit of ridicule or mockery , which makes real explanation of them difficult , or impossible . Consequently an earnest seeker after the truth is compelled-at least such has been my experience  --  to rely largely on the context , or on surrounding circumstances , or on collateral remarks , in trying to discover what they really mean who say they are " intense Americans . " I used at one time to suppose that an intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content with his country just as it is , its laws , religion , manners and morals ; who was , in spite of its defects , reasonably proud of it , and not disturbed by the judgments passed on it by hostile foreign observers . But it soon became apparent to me that the phrase meant much more than this . I found it did not stand for any piece of American political philosophy . It did not mean simply faith in any particular set of the ideas which are not unnaturally supposed to animate American institutions , such as the equality of man , or the perfectibility of the race , or the continuity of progress , or every // man 's natural fitness for office , or the certainty of American good luck . All these are the joint property of many nations , part of the common inheritance of the human race with which it tries to make tolerable its lot on earth . Nor does " intense Americanism " mean glory in the prospect of American growth in wealth and population and revenue , potentiality for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we chose to try , we could " whip creation . " It means , as well as I have been able to make out , and after approaching the matter from every side , and applying to it every test I can think of , simple readiness to take offense . An intense American** is constantly on the lookout for somebody who either expresses , or implies by his looks or manner , doubts of the ability of the United States to thrash other nations ; or who fails to acknowledge the right of the United States to occupy such territories , canals , isthmuses or peninsulas , as they may think it desirable to have , or who speaks disrespectfully of the Monroe doctrine , or who doubts the need of a large navy , or who admires European society , or who likes to go to Europe , or who fails , in case he has to go , to make comparisons unfavorable to Europe . This state of mind is , of course , accompanied with great sensitiveness to criticism of every description and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind which is known as " ill-conditioned , " and which usually ends in chronic peevishness and irritability . In private life persons thus afflicted become the pests of the household , from whom everybody flees who can , both in business and pleasure . A nation which undertakes such a rOle can not long maintain a decent footing in the family of nations . Its attempts to embody morbid conceit and suspicion in a foreign policy would result either in its being sent to Coventry , or in receiving a sound thrashing froni the combined forces of the civilized world . Good temper , civility , politeness of form , patience and self-restraint have become part of the common law of Christendom which no nation is powerful enough to disregard . And they never would be disregarded , or only very rarely , if diplomatic intercourse were carried* on solely by diplomatists . But side by side with all diplomatic controversy , there usually goes on a newspaper controversy , which can not be silenced , and which is by no means always confined to the merits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always be well informed , but if they are really discussions of questions , they can not do much harm ; nay , they may do some good . Their mischief begins when they begin to hurl defiance , heap abuse , and impute motives . The more the democracy of every country comes to the front in international controversy , the more it listens to and is led by the journalistic objurgations of the other side , the more difficult it becomes for tim professional diplomatist to maintain the measure and precision of his language , and justify his moderation to his own countrymen . So that , until we get a race of editors who will consent to take a share of the diplomatist 's responsibility for the national peace and honor , the newspapers will constitute a constant danger to the amicable relations of great powers.
