A PREFATORY WORD ABOUT THE MERCHANT OF VENICE . BY WILLIAM WINTER . No one of the plays of Shakespeare is more generally known or more popular than " The Merchant of Venice . " It was written three hundred years ago ; it has held the stage , in one form or another , ever since ; and , in the world 's admiration , it is as fresh and bright now as ever it could have been even in the morning of its life . One reason for its vitality , no doubt , is the fascinating charm of its style . The simple , direct , fluent , sweet , natural language of human feeling , sometimes irradiated with the fire of poetic thought , and sometimes expanded and elevated with the fervour of noble eloquence . Its more decisive power , however , consists in the felicity of its fable , and in the force , interest , and variety of its happily harmonized and as happily contrasted characters . The love story of Bassanio and Portia is most ingeniously fanciful , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of the poetic drama , there is any woman who can vie with Portia , as a type of blended intellect , brilliancy , and essentially feminine fascination . No characters in Shakespeare are more sharply discriminated or more vigorously drawn and handled than those of Portia , Shylock , Antonio , Gratiano , and Lancelot Gobbo . Nowhere else has the poet been more eloquent than he is in this play , in expressing the elemental passions of human nature . Portia is the perfect and final expression of love ; Shylock the perfect and final expression of hate ; Antonio incarnates the temperament of constitutional melancholy ; Gratiano is embodied glee ; and Lancelot is the consummate flash of idle drollery and heedless happiness . The word that should accompany an acting copy of any play is such a one as , at least , may prove helpful to the actors who make use of it . New thoughts upon " The Merchant of Venice " are not , at this late day , expected ; but even those readers who are most familiar with it may like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shakespeare may have derived the principal incidents of his plot from Giovanni 's tale , called " Il Pecorone , " published at Milan , in 1558 , or he may have found them in the " Gesta Romanorum . " He probably knew the old Ballad of Gernutus , which especially sets forth the story of the bard . But more probably he built upon the basis of an older play , which was on the stage when he was a boy . That older play is mentioned in " The School of Abuse , " 1579 , by Stephen Gosson , clergyman and poet , 1554-1623 , who says that it was " shewn at the Bull , " and that it represented " The greedynesse of worldly chusers and the bloody minds of usurers . " The cruel Jew is one of the most ancient denizens of the world of fiction . Dowden remarks that the story of the casket may be found in the medival romance of " Barlaam and Josaphat , " written by Joannes Damascenus , about the year 800 , and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1320-1402 . The choice of the materials , however , was not so important as the use of them . Shakespeare was an interpreter and in this case , as in so many others , the magical touch of his genius transmuted the dross of legendary lore into the pure gold of poetry , and lit the still life of a narrative with the blaze of action . The most astute judges of dramatic art have long been agreed that Shakespeare , in this comedy , shows himself the absolute master of his craft . " The union of the two actions in one event , " said Dr. Johnson , " is eminently happy : Dryden was much pleased with his own address in connecting the two plots of his ' Spanish Friar , ' which yet I believe the critic will find excelled by this play . " " In the management of the plot , " said Hallam , " which is sufficiently complex , without the slightest confusion or incoherence , I do not conceive that it has been surpassed in the annals of any theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Venice " in 1596 , when he was thirty-two years old . It is mentioned by Meres , in that precious record of his , " Palladis Tamia , Wit 's Treasury , " 1598 , and it was first printed in 1600 . Studies of character that the poet began in " The Two Gentlemen of Verona , " are massed and completed in " The Merchant . " Launce , in the former comedy , foreshadows Lancelot in the latter , Lucetta is the germ of Nerissa , Julia preludes Portia . Marlowe 's play , " The Rich Jew of Malta , " in which Alleyne acted the Jew , with great effect , preceded Shakespeare 's comedy by two years , its date being 1594 ; but " The Merchant of Venice , " when once it ? gained possession of the stage , seems to have held pre-eminence for a long time . The first representative of Shylock was Burbage , and there is reason to think that he embodied the character in a mood of grim , sardonic , grotesque comedy . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become customary on the modern stage , and which certainly is correct , was not used in the time of the author , for the Jews were not liked in England either in Elizabeth 's reign or that of James , and a high view of Shylock would not have been accepted . When " The Merchant " re-appeared upon the stage , after the Restoration , and a long time after , it came in the form of Lord Landsdowne 's alteration , first acted at Lincoln 's Inn Fields theatre , and published in 1701 . That piece opens with a colloquy between the Ghosts of Shakespeare and Dryden , and it contains a Masque , called Peleus and Thetis . Dogget acted in it , as Shylock , wearing a red wig , as Burbage had done , and making the part comic . Forty years later Macklin , for his benefit at Drury Lane , not only restored the original text of Shakespeare , but , for the first time , made Shylock the formidable and tremendous character so obviously intended by the poet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in stage annals , from that day to this . The great performers of Shylock , after Macklin , were Henderson , George Frederick Cooke , and Edmund Kean . A most interesting chapter in stage history is Macklin 's account of his own splendid triumph in the part , which may be found in either of the two authentic biographies of him . Footnote : 1Kb While in every life of Edmund Kean there is a narrative of his victory in Shylock  --  a success as pathetic as it was superb . On the American stage the fame of James W. Wallack , as Shylock , has become traditional , and so , on the German stage , has that of Bogumil Davison . It was long thought that " The Merchant of Venice , " was the play presented on the occasion of the first dramatic performance ever given in America , but the research of Judge C. P. Daly , to whose scholarship all students of stage history are much indebted , has discovered that nineteen years before Hallam 's company gave the memorable performance of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1752 , a regular dramatic company , headed by Thomas Kean , acted in New York ( 1733 ) , in " Richard the Third . " It is a pleasure to think that the dramatic movement in America started with Shakespeare . Persons Represented . DUKE OF VENICE . PRINCE OF MOROCCO , suitor to PORTIA .

Antonio In sooth , I know not why I am so sad ; It wearies me ; you . say it wearies you ; But how I caught it , found it , or came by it , What stuff ' t is made of , whereof it is born , I am to learn ; And such , a want-wit sadness makes of me , That I have much ado to know myself .

But tell not me ; I know , Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise . ANT . Antonio Believe me , no ; I thank my fortune for it , My ventures are not in one bottom trusted , Nor to one place ; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year : Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .

ANT . Antonio Well ; tell me now , what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage , That you to-day promis 'd to tell me of ? BASS . Bassanio ' T is not unknown to you , Antonio , How much I have disabled mine estate , By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance : To you , Antonio , I owe the most in money and in love ; And from your love I have a warranty To unburthen all my plots and purposes , How to get clear of all the debts I owe .

BASS . Bassanio In my school-days , when I had lost one shaft , I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way , with more advisd watch , To find the other forth ; and by adventuring both I oft found both : I urge this childhood proof , Because what follows is pure innocence . I owe you much ; and , like a wilful youth , That which I owe is lost : but if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first , I do not doubt , As I will watch the aim , or to find both , Or bring your latter hazard back again , And thankfully rest debtor for the first .

Bassanio In Belmont is a lady richly left : Her name is Portia ; nothing undervalued To Cato 's daughter , Brutus ' Portia . Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth ; For the four winds blow in from every coast Renownd suitors : O , my Antonio ! had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them , I have a mind presages me such thrift , That I should questionless be fortunate . ANT . Antonio Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea ; Neither have I money , nor commodity To raise a present sum : therefore go forth , Try what my credit can in Venice do ; That shall be rack 'd , even to the uttermost , To furnish thee to Belmont , to fair Portia .

Well , my conscience , hanging about the neck of my heart , says very wisely to me ,  --  my honest friend Launcelot , being an honest man 's son : or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience says , Launcelot , budge not : budge , says the fiend ; budge not , says my conscience : Conscience , say I , you counsel well ; fiend , say I , you counsel well : to be ruled by my conscience , I should stay with the Jew my master , who ( God bless the mark ! ) is a kind of devil ; and to run away from the Jew , I should be ruled by the fiend , who , saving your reverence , is the devil himself . Certainly , the Jew is the very devil incarnation : and , in my conscience , my conscience is a kind of hard conscience , to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew : the fiend gives the more friendly counsel : I will run , fiend ; my heels are at your commandment , I will run . Enter Old GOBBO , with a basket . GOB . Gobbo Master , young man , you ; I pray you , which is the way to master Jew 's ? LAUN . Launcelot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , being more than sand-blind , high-gravel blind , knows me not : I will try confusions with him . GOB . Gobbo Master , young gentleman , I pray you , which is the way to master Jew 's ? LAUN . Launcelot Turn upon your right hand at the next turning , but , at the next turning of all , on your left ; marry , at the very next turning , turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the Jew 's house . GOB . Gobbo ' Twill be a hard way to hit . Can you tell me whether one Launcelot , that dwells with him , dwell with him , or no ? LAUN . Launcelot Talk you of young master Launcelot ?  --  Mark me now  --  aside  --  now will I raise the waters .  --  Talk you of young master Launcelot ? GOB . Gobbo No master , sir , but a poor man 's son : his father , though I say it , is an honest exceeding poor man , and , God be thanked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father be what a will , we talk of young master Launcelot . GOB . Gobbo Of Launcelot , a n't please your mastership . LAUN . Launcelot Ergo , master Launcelot ; talk not of master Launcelot , father ; for the young gentleman ( according to fates and destinies , and such odd sayings , the sisters three , and such branches of learning ) is , indeed , deceased ; or , as you would say in plain terms , gone to heaven . GOB . Gobbo Marry , God forbid ! the boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop . LAUN . Launcelot Do I look like a cudgel , or a hovel  --  post , a staff , or a prop ? aside  --  Do you know me , father ? GOB .

GOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you not . LAUN . Launcelot Nay , indeed , if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me : it is a wise father that knows his own child .

GOB . Gobbo Pray you , sir , stand up ; I am sure you are not Launcelot , my boy . LAUN . Launcelot Pray you , let 's have no more fooling about it , but give me your blessing ; I am Launcelot , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be . GOB .

Lord worshipped might he be ! what a beard hast thou got ! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my phill-horse has on his tail . LAUN . Launcelot It should seem then , that Dobbin 's tail grows backward ; I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face , when I last saw him . GOB . Gobbo Lord , how art thou changed ! How dost thou and thy master agree ? I have brought him a present . How ' gree you now ? LAUN . Launcelot My master 's a very Jew . Give him a present ! give him a halter : I am famished in his service ; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs .

Exeunt . Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK . SHY . Shylock Three thousand ducats ,  --  well . BASS . Bassanio Ay , sir , for three months . SHY . Shylock For three months ,  --  well . BASS . Bassanio For the which , as I told you , Antonio shall be bound . SHY . Shylock Antonio shall become bound ,  --  well . BASS . Bassanio May you stead me ? Will you pleasure me ? Shall I know your answer ? SHY . Shylock Three thousand ducats , for three months , and Antonio bound . BASS . Bassanio Your answer to that . SHY . Shylock Antonio is a good man . BASS . Bassanio Have you heard any imputation to the contrary ? SHY . Shylock Ho ! no , no , no , no ;  --  my meaning in saying he is a good man , is , to have you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in supposition : he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis , another to the Indies ; I understand moreover , upon the Rialto , he hath a third at Mexico , a fourth for England ; and other ventures he hath , squander 'd abroad . But ships are but boards , sailors but men : there be land-rats and water-rats , land-thieves and water-thieves ; I mean , pirates ; and then , there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks . The man is , notwithstanding , sufficient ;  --  three thousand ducats ;  --  I think I may take his bond . BASS . Bassanio Be assured you may . SHY . Shylock I will be assured I may ; and that I may be assured , I will bethink me . May I speak with Antonio ? BASS . Bassanio If it please you to dine with us . SHY . Shylock Yes , to smell pork ; to eat of the habitation which your prophet , the Nazarite , conjured the devil into ! I will buy with you , sell with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so following ; but I will not eat with you , drink with you , nor pray with you .  --  What news on the Rialto ?  --  Who is he comes here ? BASS . Bassanio This is signior Antonio . Exit as if to meet ANTONIO . SHY . Shylock How like a fawning publican he looks ! I hate him for he is a Christian : But more , for that , in low simplicity , He lends out money gratis , and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice . If I can catch him once upon the hip , I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him . He hates our sacred nation ; and he rails , Even there where merchants most do congregate , On me , my bargains , and my well-won thrift , Which he calls interest . ( Re-enter BASS . and ANT . ) Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him ! BASS . Bassanio Shylock , do you hear ? SHY . Shylock I am debating of my present store : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats . What of that ? Tubal , a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe , Will furnish me . But soft : how many months Do you desire ?  --  Rest you fair , good signior : To ANTONIO . Your worship was the last man in our mouths . ANT . Antonio Shylock , albeit I neither lend nor borrow , By taking , nor by giving of excess , Yet , to supply the ripe wants of my friend , I 'll break a custom :  --  Is he yet possess 'd , How much you would ? To BASSANIO . SHY . Shylock Ay , ay , three thousand ducats . ANT . Antonio And for three months . SHY . Shylock I had forgot ;  --  three months , you told me so . Well then , your bond ; and , let me see . But hear you : Methought you said , you neither lend nor borrow , Upon advantage . ANT . Antonio I do never use it . SHY . Shylock When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob from our holy Abraham was ( As his wise mother wrought in his behalf ) The third possessor ; ay , he was the third . ANT . Antonio And what of him ? did he take interest ? SHY . Shylock No , not take interest ; not , as you would say , Directly interest : mark what Jacob did . When Laban and himself were compromis 'd , That all the eanlings which were streak 'd and pied Should fall , as Jacob 's hire , The skilful shepherd pill 'd me certain wands , And , in the doing of the deed of kind , He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes ; Who , then conceiving , did in eaning-time Fall party-colour 'd lambs , and those were Jacob 's . This was a way to thrive , and he was blest ; And thrift is blessing , if men steal it not . ANT . Antonio This was a venture , sir , that Jacob serv 'd for ; A thing not in his power to bring to pass , But sway 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this inserted to make interest good ? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ? SHY . Shylock I can not tell ; I make it breed as fast . ANT . Antonio Mark you this , Bassanio , The devil can cite scripture for his purpose . An evil soul , producing holy witness , Is like a villain with a smiling cheek ; A goodly apple rotten at the heart ; O , what a goodly outside falsehood hath ! Retires up stage . SHY . Shylock Three thousand ducats ,  --  ' t is a good round sum . Three months from twelve , then let me see the rate . ANT . Antonio Well , Shylock , shall we be beholden to you ? Advancing . SHY . Shylock Signior Antonio , many a time and oft , In the Rialto you have rated me About my monies , and my usances : Still have I borne it with a patient shrug , For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe : You call me ,  --  misbeliever , cut-throat dog , And spet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is mine own . Well then , it now appears you need my help : Go to then : you come to me , and you say , Shylock , we would have monies ; You say so ; You , that did void your rheum upon my beard , And foot me , as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold ; monies is your suit . What should I say to you ? Should I not say , Hath a dog money ? is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats ? or Shall I bend low , and in a bondman 's key , With ' bated breath , and whispering humbleness , Say this ,  --  Fair sir , you spet on me on Wednesday last ; You spurn 'd me such a day ; another time You call 'd me  --  dog ; and for these courtesies I 'll lend you thus much monies ? ANT . Antonio I am as like to call thee so again , To spet on thee again , to spurn thee too . If thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy friends ; ( for when did friendship take A breed of barren metal of his friend ? ) But lend it rather to thine enemy ; Who , if be break , thou mayst with better face Exact the penalties . SHY . Shylock Why , look you , how you storm ! I would be friends with you , and have your love , Forget the shames that you have stain 'd me with , Supply your present wants , and take no doit Of usance for my monies , and you 'll not hear me : This is kind I offer . ANT . Antonio This were kindness . SHY . Shylock This kindness will show : Go with me to a notary , seal me there Your single bond ; and , in a merry sport , If you repay me not on such a day , In such a place , such sum , or sums , as are Express 'd in the condition , let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh , to be cut off and taken In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio Content , in faith ; I 'll seal to such a bond , And say there is much kindness in the Jew . BASS . Bassanio You shall not seal to such a bond for me . I 'll rather dwell in my necessity . ANT . Antonio Why , fear not , man , I will not forfeit it ; Within these two months ,  --  that 's a month before This bond expires ,  --  I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond . ANTONIO and BASSANIO retire up . SHY . Shylock O father Abraham , what these Christians are , Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others ! They advance Pray you , tell me this ; If he should break his day , what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture ? A pound of man 's flesh , taken from a man , Is not so estimable , profitable neither , As flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats . I say , To buy his favour , I extend this friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , adieu ; And , for my love , I pray you wrong me not . ANT . Antonio Yes , Shylock , I will seal unto this bond . SHY . Shylock Then meet me forthwith at the notary 's ; Give him direction for this merry bond , And I will go and purse the ducats straight ; See to my house , left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave ; and presently I will be with you . ANT . Antonio Hie thee , gentle Jew . Exit SHYLOCK . This Hebrew will turn Christian ; he grows kind . BASS . Bassanio I like not fair terms and a villain 's mind . ANT . Antonio Come on ; in this there can be no dismay , My ships come home a month before the day . Exit ANTONIO , and , as BASSANIO is about to re-enter his boat , Enter GOBBO and LAUNCELOT . LAUN .

Launcelot Indeed , the short and the long is , I serve the Jew , and have a desire , as my father shall specify ,  --  GOB . Gobbo His master and he ( saving your worship 's reverence ) are scarce cater-cousins :  --  LAUN . Launcelot To be brief , the very truth is , that the Jew having done me wrong , doth cause me , as my father , being I hope an old man , shall frutify unto you ,  --  GOB .

Launcelot The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you , sir ; you have the grace of God , sir , and he hath enough . BASS . Bassanio Thou speak'st it well . Go , father , with thy son :  --  Take leave of thy old master , and inquire My lodging out :  --  give him a livery To LEONARDO . More guarded than his fellows : see it done .

Nerissa You would be , sweet madam , if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are ; and yet , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with too much , as they that starve with nothing . It is no small happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean : superfluity comes sooner by white hairs , but competency lives longer . POR . Portia Good sentences , and well pronounced . NER . Nerissa They would be better , if well followed . POR . Portia If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do , chapels had been churches , and poor men 's cottages princes ' palaces . It is a good divine that follows his own instructions : I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done , than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching . But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband :  --  O me , the word choose ! I may neither choose whom I would , nor refuse whom I dislike ; so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father :  --  Is it not hard , Nerissa , that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nerissa Your father was ever virtuous ; and holy men at their death have good inspirations ; therefore , the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests , of gold , silver , and lead , ( whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you , ) will , no doubt , never be chosen by any rightly , but one who you shall rightly love . But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come ? POR . Portia I pray thee , overname them ; and as thou namest them I will describe them ; and according to my description level at my affection . NER . Nerissa First , there is the Neapolitan prince . POR . Portia Ay , that 's a colt , indeed , for he doth nothing but talk of his horse ; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself . NER . Nerissa Then , is there the county Palatine . POR . Portia He doth nothing but frown ; as who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose ; he hears merry tales , and smiles not : I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth . I had rather be married to a death 's head with a bone in his mouth , than to either of these . Heaven defend me from these two ! NER . Nerissa How say you by the French lord , monsieur le Bon ? POR . Portia God made him , and therefore let him pass for a man . In truth , I know it is a sin to be a mocker ; but if I should marry him I should marry twenty husbands . NER . Nerissa What say you then to Fauconbridge , the young baron of England ? POR . Portia You know I say nothing to him ; for he understands not me , nor I him .

Portia Therefore , for fear of the worst , I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket ; for , if the devil be within , and that temptation without , I know he will choose it .

Portia Yes , yes , it was Bassanio ; as I think , so was he called . NER . Nerissa True , madam ; he , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .

Hear you me , Jessica : Lock up my doors ; and when you hear the drum , And the vile squealing of the wry-neck 'd fife , Clamber not you up to the casements then , Nor thrust your head into the public street , To gaze on Christian fools with varnish 'd faces : But stop my house 's ears , I mean my casements ; Let not the sound of shallow foppery Enter my sober house :  --  By Jacob 's staff I swear , I have no mind of feasting forth to-night : But I will go .  --  Go you before me , sirrah ; Say , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir .  --  Mistress , look out at window for all this ; There will come a Christian by , Will be worth a Jewess ' eye .

Myself , and what is mine , to you and yours Is now converted : I give them with this ring ; Which when you part from , lose , or give away , Let it presage the ruin of your love , And be my vantage to exclaim on you .

Portia Approaching BASSANIO , who has been reading the letter There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper , That steals the colour from Bassanio 's cheek ; Some dear friend dead ; else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man . What , worse and worse ?  --  With leave , Bassanio ; I am half yourself , And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you . BASS . Bassanio O sweet Portia , Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words That ever blotted paper ! Gentle lady , When I did first impart my love to you , I freely told you , all the wealth I had Ran in my veins ,  --  I was a gentleman ; And then I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nothing , you shall see , How much I was a braggart . When I told you , My state was nothing , I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing ; for , indeed , I have engag 'd myself to a dear friend , Engag 'd my friend to his mere enemy , To feed my means . Here is a letter , lady ; The paper as the body of my friend , And every word in it a gaping wound , Issuing life-blood . But is it true , Solanio ? Have all his ventures fail 'd ? What , not one hit ? From Tripolis , from Mexico , and England , And not one vessel ' scape the dreadful touch Of merchant-marring rocks ? SOLAN . Solanio Not one , my lord . Besides , it should appear , that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew , He would not take it . Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man , So keen and greedy to confound a man : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice : twenty merchants , The duke himself , and the magnificoes Of greatest port , have all persuaded with him ; But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture , of justice , and his bond .

Bassanio The dearest friend to me , the kindest man , The best condition 'd and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies ; and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears , Than any that draws breath in Italy . POR . Portia What sum owes he the Jew ? BASS . Bassanio For me , three thousand ducats . POR . Portia What , no more ? Pay him six thousand , and deface the bond ; Double six thousand , and then treble that , Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio 's fault .

Bassanio Since I have your good leave to go away , I will make haste : but , till I come again , No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay , Nor rest be interposer ' twixt us twain . Exit , meeting GRATIANO and SOLANIO , who go off with him . POR . Portia I never did repent for doing good , Sits by a table and writes as she speaks . Nor shall not now ; for in companions That do converse and waste the time together , Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love , There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments , of manners , and of spirit ; Which makes me think , that this Antonio , Being the bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord .

Nerissa Shall they see us ? POR . Portia They shall , Nerissa ; but in such a habit , That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack .

But come , I 'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach , which stays for us At the park gate ; and therefore haste away , For we must measure twenty miles to-day . Exeunt . Curtain .

ANT . Antonio I have heard , Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course ; but since he stands obdurate , And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy 's reach , I do oppose My patience to his fury ; and am arm 'd To suffer , with a quietness of spirit , The very tyranny and rage of his . DUKE . Go one , and call the Jew into the court . SOLANIO stands by the door . SOLAN . Solanio He 's ready at the door : he comes , my lord . Enter SHYLOCK . DUKE . Make room , and let him stand before our face . Shylock , the world thinks , and I think so too , That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act ; and then , ' t is thought Thou'lt show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange apparent cruelty : And where thou now exact'st the penalty , ( Which is a pound of this poor merchant 's flesh , ) Thou wilt not only lose the forfeiture , But , touch 'd with human gentleness and love , Forgive a moiety of the principal ; Glancing an eye of pity on his losses , That have of late so huddled on his back , Enough to press a royal merchant down , And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms , and rough hearts , ne'er train 'd To offices of tender courtesy . We all expect a gentle answer , Jew . SHY . Shylock I have possess 'd your grace of what I purpose ; And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn , To have the due and forfeit of my bond : If you deny it , let the danger light Upon your charter , and your city 's freedom . You 'll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh , than to receive Three thousand ducats : I 'll not answer that : But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer 'd ? What , if my house be troubled with a rat , And I be pleas 'd to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban 'd ? What , are you answer 'd yet ? Some men there are love not a gaping pig ; Some that are mad if they behold a cat . Now , for your answer . As there is no firm reason to be render 'd , Why he can not abide a gaping pig ; Why he , a harmless necessary cat ; So can I give no reason , nor I will not , More than a lodg 'd hate , and a certain loathing , I bear Antonio , that I follow thus A losing suit against him . Are you answer 'd ? BASS . Bassanio This is no answer , thou unfeeling man , To excuse the current of thy cruelty . SHY . Shylock I am not bound to please thee with my answer . BASS . Bassanio Do all men kill the things they do not love ? SHY . Shylock Hates any man the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a hate at first . SHY . Shylock What , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ? ANT . Antonio I pray you , think you question with the Jew ; You may as well go stand upon the beach , And bid the main flood bate his usual height ; You may as well use question with the wolf , Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb ; You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops , and to make no noise When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven ; You may as well do anything most hard , As seek to soften that ( than which what 's harder ? ) His Jewish heart .  --  Therefore , I do beseech you , Make no more offers , use no farther means , But , with all brief and plain conveniency , Let me have judgment , and the Jew his will .

You have among you many a purchas 'd slave , Which , like your asses , and your dogs , and mules , You use in abject and in slavish parts , Because you bought them .  --  Shall I say to you , Let them be free , marry them to your heirs ? Why sweat they under burthens ? Let their beds Be made as soft as yours , and let their palates Be season 'd with such viands ? You will answer , The slaves are ours :  --  so do I answer you .

Gratiano O , be thou damn 'd , inexorable dog ! And for thy life let justice be accus 'd . Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith , To hold opinion with Pythagoras , That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men : thy currish spirit Govern 'd a wolf ; for thy desires Are wolfish , bloody , starv 'd , and ravenous . SHY . Shylock Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond , Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud : Repair thy wit , good youth ; or it will fall To cureless ruin .  --  I stand here for law .

Your grace shall understand , that at the receipt of your letter , I am very sick : but in the instant that your messenger came , in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome ; his name is Balthazar : I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant : we turned o'er many books together : he is furnished with my opinion ; which , bettered with his own learning ( the greatness whereof I can not enough commend ) , comes with him , at my importunity , to fill up your grace 's request in my stead .

Antonio and old Shylock , both stand forth . They both advance a step . POR . Portia Is your name Shylock ? SHY . Shylock Shylock is my name . POR .

Antonio Ay , so he says . POR . Portia Do you confess the bond ? ANT . Antonio I do . POR . Portia Then must the Jew be merciful . SHY . Shylock On what compulsion must I ? tell me that . POR . Portia The quality of mercy is not strain 'd , It droppeth , as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath : it is twice bless 'd ; It blesseth him that gives , and him that takes : ' T is mightiest in the mightiest ; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown ; His sceptre shows the force of temporal power , The attribute to awe and majesty , Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ; But mercy is above this sceptred sway , It is enthrond in the hearts of kings , It is an attribute to God himself ; And earthly power doth then show likest God 's , When mercy seasons justice . Therefore , Jew , Though justice be thy plea , consider this  --  That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see salvation : we do pray for mercy ; And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy . I have spoke thus much , To mitigate the justice of thy plea , Which if thou follow , this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence ' gainst the merchant there . SHY . Shylock My deeds upon my head ! I crave the law , The penalty and forfeit of my bond . POR . Portia Is he not able to discharge the money ? BASS . Bassanio Yes , here I tender it for him in the court ; Yea , twice the sum : if that will not suffice , I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er , On forfeit of my hands , my head , my heart : If this will not suffice , it must appear That malice bears down truth .

Shylock An oath , an oath , I have an oath in heaven : Shall I lay perjury upon my soul ? No , not for Venice . POR . Portia Why , this bond is forfeit ; And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh , to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant 's heart .  --  Be merciful ; Take thrice thy money ; bid me tear the bond .

ANT . Antonio Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment . POR . Portia Why then , thus it is : You must prepare your bosom for his knife . SHY . Shylock O noble judge ! O excellent young man ! POR . Portia For the intent and purpose of the law , Hath full relation to the penalty Which here appeareth due upon the bond ;  --  SHY .

Portia It is not so express 'd , but what of that ? ' T were good you do so much for charity . SHY . Shylock I can not find it ; ' t is not in the bond . POR . Portia Come , merchant , have you anything to say ? Sits . ANT . Antonio But little ; I am arm 'd , and well prepar'd.  --  Give me your hand , Bassanio : fare you well ! Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you ; For herein fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom : it is still her use , To let the wretched man out-live his wealth , To view with hollow eye , and wrinkled brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of such a misery doth she cut me off .

Repent not you that you shall lose your friend , And he repents not that he pays your debt ; For , if the Jew do cut but deep enough , I 'll pay it instantly with all my heart . BASS . Bassanio Antonio , I am married to a wife , Which is as dear to me as life itself ; But life itself , my wife , and all the world Are not with me esteem 'd above thy life ; I would lose all , ay , sacrifice them all Here to this devil , to deliver you .

The Doge rises to pronounce sentence . POR .

I was always plain with you , and so now I speak my agitation of the matter : therefore , be of good cheer ; for , truly , I think you are damned . JES . Jessica I shall be saved by my husband ; he hath made me a Christian . LAUN . Launcelot Truly , the more to blame he : we were Christians enow before : e'en as many as could well live , one by another : this making of Christians will raise the price of hogs ; if we grow all to be pork-eaters we shall not shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

JES . Jessica In such a night , Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew , And saw the lion 's shadow ere himself , And ran dismay 'd away . LOR . Lorenzo In such a night , Did Jessica steal , And with an unthrift love did run from Venice , As far as Belmont . JES . Jessica In such a night , Did young Lorenzo swear he lov 'd her well : Stealing her soul with many vows of faith , And ne'er a true one . LOR .

By yonder moon , I swear you do me wrong ; In faith , I gave it to the judge 's clerk : Would he were gelt that had it , for my part , Since you do take it , love , so much at heart . POR . Portia A quarrel , ho , already ! what 's the matter ? GRA . Gratiano About a hoop of gold , a paltry ring That she did give me ; whose poesy was For all the world , like cutler 's poetry Upon a knife , Love me , and leave me not ! NER .

The clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it . GRA . Gratiano Now , by this hand , I gave it to a youth ,  --  A kind of boy ; a little scrubbed boy , No higher than thyself , the judge 's clerk ; A prating boy , that begg 'd it as a fee ; I could not for my heart deny it him . POR . Portia You were to blame , I must be plain with you , To part so slightly with your wife 's first gift ; A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger , And riveted so with faith unto your flesh . I gave my love a ring , and made him swear Never to part with it ; and here he stands ,  --  I dare be sworn for him , he would not leave it , Nor pluck it from his finger , for the wealth That the world masters . BASS . Bassanio Aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , And swear , I lost the ring defending it . GRA . Gratiano My lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg 'd it , and , indeed , Deserv 'd it too ; and then the boy , his clerk , That took some pains in writing , he begg 'd mine : And neither man , nor master , would take aught But the two rings . BASS . Bassanio Sweet Portia , If you did know to whom I gave the ring , If you did know for whom I gave the ring , And would conceive for what I gave the ring , And how unwillingly I left the ring , When nought would be accepted but the ring , You would abate the strength of your displeasure .

Bassanio No , by mine honour , madam , by my soul , No woman had it , but a civil doctor , Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me , And begg 'd the ring ; What should I say , sweet lady ?

Portia Sir , grieve not you ; you are welcome notwith standing . BASS . Bassanio Portia , forgive . Nay , but hear me : Pardon this fault , and by my soul I swear , I never more will break an oath with thee . ANT . Antonio I once did lend my body for his wealth ; Which , but for him that had your husband 's ring , Had quite miscarried : I dare be bound again , My soul upon the forfeit , that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly .

Portia You are all amaz 'd : Here is a letter , read it at your leisure ; It comes from Padua , from Bellario : There you shall find , that Portia was the doctor ; Nerissa there , her clerk : Antonio , you are welcome ; And I have better news in store for you , Than you expect : unseal this letter soon ; There you shall find , three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly . ANT . Antonio I am dumb . BASS . Bassanio Were you the doctor , and I knew you not ? ANT . Antonio Sweet lady , you have given me life , and living ; For here I read for certain , that my ships Are safely come to road . POR . Portia How now , Lorenzo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NER .
