txt The proposition to revive the grade of Lieutenant General is not at all timely , and the appearance of it at this time is suspicious . Of course there is theoretically room not for one Lieutenant General only but for several . If the command of a brigade involves a Brigadier and the command of a division a Major General , the command of a corps ought to call for a Lieutenant General , and there should be a. full and simple " General " in command of each army . The Spanish Army and Navy are much better equipped in this respect than our own . There are said to be over 200 Lieutenant Generals on the army list , and we know that the Queen took sweet naval counsel with no fewer than twenty-eight Admirals at once . It is hard to see how we can stand up against such a superiority of rank . But we seem to do it . Admiral MoNToso was satisfactorily smashed by a plain Commodore , since made an Admiral , for cause , and our Atlantic fleet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere low and grovelling Captain . That which we call a Brigadier will fight quite as well under that name as if he were a Field Marshal , and can wait for his Lieutenant Generalship until he has earned it . This is really the point . There is no way of finding out who has the capacity for the command of a large body of troops except by actual trial in war . We were over two years in finding out during the civil war . We have just been making a number of Brigadier and Major Generals ' because they distinguished themselves in r. war'which ended a full generation ago . We should not make any higher promotion except for actual service in this present war . Any appointment now of a Lieutenant General would almost certainly be a mistake . It would be a matter at best of conjecture and at worst of mere favoritism . The Secretary of War has nobody but himself to blame if the army sees in the proposition to revive the grade of Lieutenant General , before anybody has had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ALona 's jobs .
