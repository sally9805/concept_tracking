txt State Street Block , a six-story granite structure , bounded by Atlantic Avenue on the east , India Street on the south , and State Street on the north , was badly damaged and part of its contents ruined by fire and water early this morning . It was used as a United States bonded warehouse . The structure is valued at $200,000 , and is damaged to the extent of $50,000 . It is owned by Mrs. Paran Stevens of New-York . The Custom House , which is close by the burned building , was not injured . Appraiser Dodge said this afternoon that he did not believe the loss would be much more than $150,000 , although it may possibly go above that figure . The reason for this comparatively slight loss is that for many months past the importations have been light on account of poor business , and business men have imported only sufficient goods to keep them supplied in trade , keeping but very few in the warehouse at one time . While the loss by fire did not go below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors , including the stores of the Appraisers , were damaged badly by water . The merchants who have goods in the warehouse insure for themselves with whatever brokers they are accustomed to deal with . The entire stock of the building is in the hands of the Appraisers , and only their books will show the amount of the loss . In the section adjoining the burned portion is the wholesale liquor store of J. D. &; M. Williams , running from 82 and 84 Central Street to 181 and 183 State Street . The stock of this store was damaged considerably by water . The cellars on . the Central Street side , opposite the burned building , were flooded , and the occupants will suffer considerable damage by water . The upper floors of the warehouse contained all the records of the Port of Boston from the time the British evacuated the city to 1889 . When the French spoliation claims were being heard these records were of immense value .. The records were simply filed in wooden boxes . This loss is irreparable .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
