txt The Health Department 's chemical analysis of the water flowing from the so-called " healing spring " at the base of the rocks in Morningside Park affords ample proof of very dangerouspollution . It appears- that this water leaks out of an old and abandoned well , into which is discharged a part of the contents of an ancient sewer ncP loner in use . Hereafter no one will . be permitted to drink from this " spring . " The water of wells situated in a city is continually exposed to dangerous pollution . It flows into the well cavity from the surrounding soil through which a great part of it makes its - way downward from the surface . In thickly settled places the soil is charged with impurities , and the water that passes through it and is collected in a well cavity is inevitably contaminated by them . it carries them to the well , where they are held iu golution . The use of ordinary wells in cities should always be forbidden by the health authorities , and in many places die water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is collected within fifty feet of the surface . Some years ago there were many artesian wells in this city , and the number of such wells was increasing . In several places , where the patronage of the public Was invited , the proprietors sought to attract buyers by advertising the fact fhat their supply of water was obtained from such wells . After a time the Health Depart ? ment , was led to make an investigation , the result of which was the annothacement that the water procured from the artesian wells was unfit for use . The wells were closed , and . now it is generally known that , owing to the peculiar geological formation of Manhattan Island , which permits polluting matter to make its way down to a great depth , it is almost impossible to obtain uncontaminated water here by the artesian method . The following reference to the dangerous character of artesian waters in this city may be found in the report of the Health Department for the year 1891 : " It is well known that , over a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wells of varying depths may be driven or sunk , which will yield an abundant supply of colorless , clear , and apparently pure Water . The geological formation of New-York Island 18 , however , such that water from wells on the Wand can not with safety be used for d " ruestio purposes . This statement will be made clear by a consideration of the strata underlying the city . and the geological changes which these hare undergone . Tao underlying rock is of igneous origin , and the dip of the strata is so groat , varying from 750 to 903 , that no impervious viater-aearing stratum exists , beneath which water free from contamination can bd found . " When the upheaval of the rock took place , it was left in a series of elevations with corresponding depressions . Through subsequent glacial action the elevations were around down and the depressions tilled with the drift . If , therefore , a well Is sunk over one of the areas of former depression , the water obtained can be Only the surface water which has percolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk over one of the areas of former elevation will yield no water , save possibly a small amount which has percolated through crevices in the rock . " It is evident that water derived from the surface of an area so thickly populated as that on which New-York City is built must be badly contaminated by the dirt of the streets and the inevitable leakage of sewers ; drain pities. very large number of analyses , made during a number of years , of the water from so-called ? artesian ' wells on New-York Island by Drs . CHANDLER and WALLER of the Columbia Bohool of Baines and by ourselves , substantiate the above , While water irom these sources may present no evidence of contamination to the senses , analysis has Invariably shown it to be grossly contaminated with the products of sewage decomposition , and unfit for domestic ) use . " Where the water drawn from artesian wells situated in a city comes to these wells from places many miles away , where it enters the ground under conditions which prevent pollution , and is protected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is as good as water for domestic use should be . These are the conditions under which the water supply of Memphis is procured .
