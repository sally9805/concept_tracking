txt It seems a pity that none of Mir naval blithers are serving either with the Chinese or the Japanese fleet . Those fleets are engaged in the only practical test that has been furnished of the value Of the improvements or changes in the cenititietioil and equipment of Men-Of-War . There hat been no . naval war since Our own civil war on such a scale as to afford any ' Valuable lessons , and in that war there were . no naval battles , properly so called . The Confederates fitted out commerce destroyers to prey upon the inefcantile Marine of the North , and the United States sent its swiftest Chips Ili search of these . There was " nothing proved " by the duel between the Alabama and the Kearsarge , and the exploits of Parra:gut at New-Orleans and Mobile Bay were achieved in conflicts between ships and forts , and not between ships and ships . The main duty of the navy was a police duty . Its business was to make an effective blockade of the Southern ports , so that fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to get in with supplies or out with cotton . Before the war was over the blockade had become very effective , but the blockade was not naval warfare . Now , the ships of 1861-5 are as obsolete as the ships that fought at Trafalgar and the Nile , and every step that has been taken toward the establishment of a ne*-2 type , or , rather , of several new briies , hat been taken upon theory only , or upon such tests as proving grounds and measured Miles furnish . Not one has been the result Of a lesson learned in act-. ual Warfare . it is such a lesson that the conflict between China and Japan is furnishing , 71.14 ft does not appear that there are any professional students of Other nation-5 in a petition to apply that lesson for the benefit of their respective countries . There is one lesson , however , that it seems may be learned without personal participation In the battles and without professional knowledge , and that may lead to a wiser choice than we should otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern war ships . Tn tills country it has seemed to many observers that we were making a mistake in spending so much of our money upon battleships , and that *hat we needed Were commerce destroyers and coast defenders and nothing else . A battleship , it may be said , is not good for much else than to fight " one of her own size . " She . is too slow and unwieldy for a coinni-erce destroyer , while a much simpler and cheaper Vessel that does not pretend to be a seagoing vessel in any proper sense Will do quite as Well for a coast defender . A floating fortress is one thing ; a very tWift and highly manageable cruiser , armed with powerful weapons , is another . The first is the coast defender ; the " second is the commerce destroyer . The attempt to combine the diverse merits of the two did not seem , for our special purposes , to be worth making . It appears now to be doubtful Whether it is worth making for anybody , and whether the battleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mistake . That it is seems to be the opinion Lord Charles Beresford , one of the British authorities On the subject , has derived from the war news froth the East . The battle off the Yalu this expert describes as " bearing out the opinion of those the held that the power of offense of modern fleets is infinitely superior to their defensive powers . " Japan owns but five armored shins , , four of which v17616 built before 1880 , and it dees.nOt appear that one of them was engaged off the Yalu . Tier vessels were all cruisers , the largest of them , the Matsushima class , of about 4-,000 tons , being protected only by a two-inch ' steel deck . On the other hand , the Chinese had tWo iron-clads of over 7,000. tons and five vessels classed as battleships and meant to be invulnerable . Speed and handiness are in this class sacrificed to invulnerableness . But the Yalu tight shows that the sacrifice is altogether too great , while they are not , in fact , invulnerable , but can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far swifter and More Manageable cruiser 's . The merit of a war ship , as Lord Charles suggests , is to inflict as much . injury as possible . It is true that it is also to escape injury so far as possible , but it is plain that she can do that best by speed and handiness , and not by being overloaded and arinerlogged in the vain effort to make her shell-proof . The practical question is deleted 8 lines was no more formidable than a cold - cookstove . As tile force projectiles creased it was found that the armor w4s worse than useless , and it was accordingly discarded , - With hoW breastplates rice only word for Purposes of Pageantry by a very few household regiments , and it is reCeigniied as part of the efficiency Of a cavalryman ; as well as Of an infantryman , that he should be as unincumbered as possible . The same course of evolution is likely to follow in naval warfare as the floating fortresses evolved from theory are tested in practice .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
