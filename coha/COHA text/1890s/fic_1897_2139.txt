Enchantments tangible : The under-brink Of dawns that launched the sight Up seas of gold : The dewdrop on the pink , With all the green earth in it and blue height Of heavens infinite : The liquid , dripping songs of orchard-birds --  The wee bass of the bees ,  --  With lucent deeps of silence afterwards ; The gay , clandestine whisperings of the breeze And glad leaves of the trees . * * * * * O Child-World : After this world -- just as when I found you first sufficed My soulmost need -- if I found you again , With all my childish dream so realised , I should not be surprised .

" " And why ' Good Old ' ? " once a rare Old chronicler was asked , who brushed the hair Out of his twinkling eyes and said ,  --  " Well John , They 're ' good old times ' because they 're dead and gone ! " The old home site was portioned into three Distinctive lots . The front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dahlia , rose , and flowering vine --  The dwelling stood in ; and behind that , and Upon the alley north and south , left hand , The old wood-house , half , trimly stacked with wood , And half , a work-shop , where a workbench stood Steadfastly through all seasons.  - -  Over it , Along the wall , hung compass , brace-and-bit , And square , and drawing-knife , and smoothing-plane --  And little jack-plane , too -- the children 's vain Possession by pretense -- in fancy they Manipulating it in endless play , Turning out countless curls and loops of bright , Fine satin shavings -- Rapture infinite ! Shelved quilting-frames ; the toolchest ; the old box Of refuse nails and screws ; a rough gun-stock 's Outline in " curly maple " ; and a pair Of clamps and old krout-cutter hanging there . Some " patterns , " in thin wood , of shield and scroll , Hung higher , with a neat " cane-fishing-pole " And careful tackle -- all securely out Of reach of children , rummaging about . Beside the wood-house , with broad branches free Yet close above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvest "  - -  Magic phrase ! That was a boy 's own tree , in many ways !  --  Its girth and height meet both for the caress Of his bare legs and his ambitiousness : And then its apples , humoring his whim , Seemed just to fairly hurry ripe for him --  Even in June , impetuous as he , They dropped to meet him , halfway up the tree . And O their bruised sweet faces where they fell !  --  And ho ! the lips that feigned to " kiss them well " ! " The Old Sweet-Apple-Tree , " a stalwart , stood In fairly sympathetic neighborhood Of this wild princeling with his early gold To toss about so lavishly nor hold In bounteous hoard to overbrim at once All Nature 's lap when came the Autumn months . Under the spacious shade of this the eyes Of swinging children saw swift-changing skies Of blue and green , with sunshine shot between , And " when the old cat died " they saw but green . And , then , there was a cherry-tree.  - -  We all And severally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , The blessed fact -- There was a cherry-tree . There was a cherry-tree . Its bloomy snows Cool even now the fevered sight that knows No more its airy visions of pure joy --  As when you were a boy . There was a cherry-tree . The Bluejay set His blue against its white -- O blue as jet He seemed there then !  - -  But now -- Whoever knew He was so pale a blue ! There was a cherry-tree -- Our child-eyes saw The miracle :  - -  Its pure white snows did thaw Into a crimson fruitage , far too sweet But for a boy to eat . There was a cherry-tree , give thanks and joy !  --  There was a bloom of snow -- There was a boy --  There was a Bluejay of the realest blue --  And fruit for both of you . Then the old garden , with the apple-trees Grouped ' round the margin , and " a stand of bees " By the " white-winter-pearmain " ; and a row Of currant-bushes ; and a quince or so . The old grape-arbor in the center , by The pathway to the stable , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of pigeons , and the cutest " martin-box " !  --  Made like a sure-enough house -- with roof , and doors And windows in it , and veranda-floors And balusters all ' round it -- yes , and at Each end a chimney -- painted red at that And penciled white , to look like little bricks ; And , to cap all the builder 's cunning tricks , Two tiny little lightning-rods were run Straight up their sides , and twinkled in the sun . Who built it ? Nay , no answer but a smile.  --  It may be you can guess who , afterwhile . Home in his stall , " Old Sorrel " munched his hay And oats and corn , and switched the flies away , In a repose of patience good to see , And earnest of the gentlest pedigree . With half pathetic eye sometimes he gazed Upon the gambols of a colt that grazed Around the edges of the lot outside , And kicked at nothing suddenly , and tried To act grown-up and graceful and high-bred , But dropped , k'whop ! and scraped the buggy-shed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp-end of a gate-hinge there . Then , all ignobly scrambling to his feet And whinneying a whinney like a bleat , He would pursue himself around the lot And -- do the whole thing over , like as not ! ... Ah ! what a life of constant fear and dread And flop and squawk and flight the chickens led ! Above the fences , either side , were seen The neighbor-houses , set in plots of green Dooryards and greener gardens , tree and wall Alike whitewashed , and order in it all : The scythe hooked in the tree-fork ; and the spade And hoe and rake and shovel all , when laid Aside , were in their places , ready for The hand of either the possessor or Of any neighbor , welcome to the loan Of any tool he might not chance to own . THE OLD-HOME FOLKS Such was the Child-World of the long-ago --  The little world these children used to know :  --  Johnty , the oldest , and the best , perhaps , Of the five happy little Hoosier chaps Inhabiting this wee world all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native tone Of grave command -- a general on parade Whose each punctilious order was obeyed By his proud followers . But Johnty yet --  After all serious duties -- could forget The gravity of life to the extent , At times , of kindling much astonishment About him : With a quick , observant eye , And mind and memory , he could supply The tamest incident with liveliest mirth ; And at the most unlooked-for times on earth Was wont to break into some travesty On those around him -- feats of mimicry Of this one 's trick of gesture -- that one 's walk --  Or this one 's laugh -- or that one 's funny talk ,  --  The way " the watermelon-man " would try His humor on town-folks that would n't buy ;  --  How he drove into town at morning -- then At dusk ( alas ! ) how he drove out again . Though these divertisements of Johnty 's were Hailed with a hearty glee and relish , there Appeared a sense , on his part , of regret --  A spirit of remorse that would not let Him rest for days thereafter.  - -  Such times he , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fer common boys like us , you know , To ' sociate with -- less'n we ' ud go And jine his church ! " Next after Johnty came His little tow-head brother , Bud by name.  --  And O how white his hair was -- and how thick His face with freckles ,  - -  and his ears , how quick And curious and intrusive !  - -  And how pale The blue of his big eyes ;  - -  and how a tale Of Giants , Trolls or Fairies , bulged them still Bigger and bigger !  - -  and when " Jack " would kill The old " Four-headed Giant , " Bud 's big eyes Were swollen truly into giant-size . And Bud was apt in make-believes -- would hear His Grandma talk or read , with such an ear And memory of both subject and big words , That he would take the book up afterwards And feign to " read aloud , " with such success As caused his truthful elders real distress . But he must have big words -- they seemed to give Extremer range to the superlative --  That was his passion . " My Gran'ma , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Some heavy old historical review --  With copious explanations thereunto Drawn out by his inquiring turn of mind ,  --  " My Gran'ma she 's read all books -- ever ' kind They is , ' at tells all ' bout the land an ' sea An ' Nations of the Earth !  - -  An ' she is the Historicul-est woman ever wuz ! " ( Forgive the verse 's chuckling as it does In its erratic current.  - -  Oftentimes The little willowy waterbrook of rhymes Must falter in its music , listening to The children laughing as they used to do . ) Who shall sing a simple ditty all about the Willow , Dainty-fine and delicate as any bending spray That dandles high the happy bird that flutters there to trill a Tremulously tender song of greeting to the May . Ah , my lovely Willow !  - -  Let the Waters lilt your graces ,  --  They alone with limpid kisses lave your leaves above , Flashing back your sylvan beauty , and in shady places Peering up with glimmering pebbles , like the eyes of love . Next , Maymie , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes beneath it there . Her dignified and " little lady " airs Of never either romping up the stairs Or falling down them ; thoughtful everyway Of others first -- The kind of child at play That " gave up , " for the rest , the ripest pear Or peach or apple in the garden there Beneath the trees where swooped the airy swing --  She pushing it , too glad for anything ! Or , in the character of hostess , she Would entertain her friends delightfully In her play-house , with strips of carpet laid Along the garden-fence within the shade Of the old apple-trees -- where from next yard Came the two dearest friends in her regard , The little Crawford girls , Ella and Lu --  As shy and lovely as the lilies grew In their idyllic home ,  - -  yet sometimes they Admitted Bud and Alex to their play , Who did their heavier work and helped them fix To have a " Festibul "  - -  and brought the bricks And built the " stove , " with a real fire and all , And stovepipe-joint for chimney , looming tall And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And swooped and swirled about them till their sight Was feverish even as their high delight . Then Alex , with his freckles , and his freaks Of temper , and the peach-bloom of his cheeks , And " amber-colored hair " his mother said ' T was that , when others laughed and called it " red " And Alex threw things at them -- till they 'd call A truce , agreeing " ' t'uz n't red ut-tall ! " But Alex was affectionate beyond The average child , and was extremely fond Of the paternal relatives of his Of whom he once made estimate like this :  --  " I 'm only got two brothers ,  - -  but my Pa He 's got most brothers'n you ever saw !  --  He 's got seben brothers !  - -  Yes , an ' they 're all my Seben Uncles !  - -  Uncle John , an ' Jim , an ' I ' Got Uncle George , an ' Uncle Andy , too , An ' Uncle Frank , an ' Uncle Joe.  - -  An ' you Know Uncle Mart.  - -  An ' , all but him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Sarah -- she makes eight !  --  I 'm got eight uncles !  - -  'cept Aunt Sarah ca n't Be ist my uncle ' cause she 's ist my aunt ! " Then , next to Alex -- and the last indeed Of these five little ones of whom you read --  Was baby Lizzie , with her velvet lisp ,  --  As though her Elfin lips had caught some wisp Of floss between them as they strove with speech , Which ever seemed just in yet out of reach --  Though what her lips missed , her dark eyes could say With looks that made her meaning clear as day . And , knowing now the children , you must know The father and the mother they loved so :  --  The father was a swarthy man , black-eyed , Black-haired , and high of forehead ; and , beside The slender little mother , seemed in truth A very king of men -- since , from his youth , To his hale manhood now --  ( worthy as then ,  --  A lawyer and a leading citizen Of the proud little town and county-seat --  His hopes his neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known outdoor labor -- rain and shine --  Bleak Winter , and bland Summer -- foul and fine . So Nature had ennobled him and set Her symbol on him like a coronet : His lifted brow , and frank , reliant face.  --  Superior of stature as of grace , Even the children by the spell were wrought Up to heroics of their simple thought , And saw him , trim of build , and lithe and straight And tall , almost , as at the pasture-gate The towering ironweed the scythe had spared For their sakes , when The Hired Man declared It would grow on till it became a tree , With cocoanuts and monkeys in -- maybe ! Yet , though the children , in their pride and awe And admiration of the father , saw A being so exalted -- even more Like adoration was the love they bore The gentle mother.  - -  Her mild , plaintive face Was purely fair , and haloed with a grace And sweetness luminous when joy made glad Her features with a smile ; or saintly sad As twilight , fell the sympathetic gloom Of any childish grief , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the window and the sunshine gone . Her brow , below her fair hair 's glimmering strands , Seemed meetest resting-place for blessing hands Or holiest touches of soft finger-tips And little roseleaf-cheeks and dewy lips . Though heavy household tasks were pitiless , No little waist or coat or checkered dress But knew her needle 's deftness ; and no skill Matched hers in shaping pleat or flounce or frill ; Or fashioning , in complicate design , All rich embroideries of leaf and vine , With tiniest twining tendril ,  - -  bud and bloom And fruit , so like , one 's fancy caught perfume And dainty touch and taste of them , to see Their semblance wrought in such rare verity . Shrined in her sanctity of home and love , And love 's fond service and reward thereof , Restore her thus , O blessed Memory !  --  Throned in her rocking-chair , and on her knee Her sewing -- her workbasket on the floor Beside her ,  - -  Springtime through the open door Balmily stealing in and all about The room ; the bees ' dim hum , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , And neighbor-children from across the way Calling in gleeful challenge -- save alone One boy whose voice sends back no answering tone --  The boy , prone on the floor , above a book Of pictures , with a rapt , ecstatic look --  Even as the mother 's , by the selfsame spell , Is lifted , with a light ineffable --  As though her senses caught no mortal cry , But heard , instead , some poem going by . The Child-heart is so strange a little thing --  So mild -- so timorously shy and small.  --  When grown-up hearts throb , it goes scampering Behind the wall , nor dares peer out at all !  --  It is the veriest mouse That hides in any house --  So wild a little thing is any Child-heart ! Child-heart !  - -  mild heart !  --  Ho , my little wild heart !  --  Come up here to me out o ' the dark , Or let me come to you ! So lorn at times the Child-heart needs must be . With never one maturer heart for friend And comrade , whose tear-ripened sympathy And love might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aches and stings . Over poor little things Were pitiful as ever any Child-heart . Child-heart !  - -  mild heart !  --  Ho , my little wild heart !  --  Come up here to me out o ' the dark , Or let me come to you ! Times , too , the little Child-heart must be glad --  Being so young , nor knowing , as we know . The fact from fantasy , the good from bad , The joy from woe , the -- all that hurts us so ! What wonder then that thus It hides away from us ?  --  So weak a little thing is any Child-heart ! Child-heart !  - -  mild heart !  --  Ho , my little wild heart !  --  Come up here to me out o ' the dark , Or let me come to you ! Nay , little Child-heart , you have never need To fear us ,  - -  we are weaker far than you --  T is we who should be fearful -- we indeed Should hide us , too , as darkly as you do ,  --  Safe , as yourself , withdrawn , Hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Child-heart !

The clock chats on confidingly ; a rose Taps at the window , as the sunlight throws A brilliant , jostling checkerwork of shine And shadow , like a Persian-loom design , Across the homemade carpet -- fades ,  - -  and then The dear old colors are themselves again . Sounds drop in visiting from everywhere --  The bluebird 's and the robin 's trill are there , Their sweet liquidity diluted some By dewy orchard spaces they have come : Sounds of the town , too , and the great highway --  The Mover-wagons ' rumble , and the neigh Of overtraveled horses , and the bleat Of sheep and low of cattle through the street --  A Nation 's thoroughfare of hopes and fears , First blazed by the heroic pioneers Who gave up old-home idols and set face Toward the unbroken West , to found a race And tame a wilderness now mightier than All peoples and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds within :  --  In mild remoteness falls the household din Of porch and kitchen : the dull jar and thump Of churning ; and the " glung-glung " of the pump , With sudden pad and skurry of bare feet Of little outlaws , in from field or street : The clang of kettle ,  - -  rasp of damper-ring And bang of cookstove-door -- and everything That jingles in a busy kitchen lifts Its individual wrangling voice and drifts In sweetest tinny , coppery , pewtery tone Of music hungry ear has ever known In wildest famished yearning and conceit Of youth , to just cut loose and eat and eat !  --  The zest of hunger still incited on To childish desperation by long-drawn Breaths of hot , steaming , wholesome things that stew And blubber , and up-tilt the pot-lids , too , Filling the sense with zestful rumors of The dear old-fashioned dinners children love : Redolent savorings of home-cured meats , Potatoes , beans , and cabbage ; turnips , beets And parsnips -- rarest composite entire That ever pushed a mortal child 's desire To madness by new-grated fresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watery , anticipating all The cloyed sweets of the glorious festival.  --  Still add the cinnamony , spicy scents Of clove , nutmeg , and myriad condiments In like-alluring whiffs that prophesy Of sweltering pudding , cake , and custard pie --  The swooning-sweet aroma haunting all The house -- upstairs and down -- porch , parlor , hall And sitting-room -- invading even where The Hired Man sniffs it in the orchard-air , And pauses in his pruning of the trees To note the sun minutely and to -- sneeze . Then Cousin Rufus comes -- the children hear His hale voice in the old hall , ringing clear As any bell . Always he came with song Upon his lips and all the happy throng Of echoes following him , even as the crowd Of his admiring little kinsmen -- proud To have a cousin grown -- and yet as young Of soul and cheery as the songs he sung . He was a student of the law -- intent Soundly to win success , with all it meant ; And so he studied -- even as he played ,  --  With all his heart : And so it was he made His gallant fight for fortune -- through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the children had Another relative who kept them glad And joyous by his very merry ways --  As blithe and sunny as the summer days ,  --  Their father 's youngest brother -- Uncle Mart . The old " Arabian Nights " he knew by heart --  " Baron Munchausen , " too ; and likewise " The Swiss Family Robinson . "  - -  And when these three Gave out , as he rehearsed them , he could go Straight on in the same line -- a steady flow Of arabesque invention that his good Old mother never clearly understood . He was to be a printer -- wanted , though , To be an actor.  - -  But the world was " show " Enough for him ,  - -  theatric , airy , gay ,  --  Each day to him was jolly as a play . And some poetic symptoms , too , in sooth , Were certain.  - -  And , from his apprentice youth , He joyed in verse-quotations -- which he took Out of the old " Type Foundry Specimen Book . " He craved and courted most the favor of The children.  - -  They were foremost in his love ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it young and fresh in every part . So was it he devised for them and wrought To life his quaintest , most romantic thought :  --  Like some lone castaway in alien seas , He built a house up in the apple-trees , Out in the corner of the garden , where No man-devouring native , prowling there , Might pounce upon them in the dead o ' night --  For lo , their little ladder , slim and light , They drew up after them . And it was known That Uncle Mart slipped up sometimes alone And drew the ladder in , to lie and moon Over some novel all the afternoon . And one time Johnty , from the crowd below ,  --  Outraged to find themselves deserted so --  Threw bodily their old black cat up in The airy fastness , with much yowl and din . Resulting , while a wild periphery Of cat went circling to another tree , And , in impassioned outburst , Uncle Mart Loomed up , and thus relieved his tragic heart : " ' Hence , long-tailed , ebon-eyed , nocturnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cases ? Didst thou not know that running midnight races O'er standing types was fraught with imminent danger ? Did hunger lead thee -- didst thou think to find Some rich old cheese to fill thy hungry maw ? Vain hope ! for none but literary jaw Can masticate our cookery for the mind ! ' " So likewise when , with lordly air and grace , He strode to dinner , with a tragic face With ink-spots on it from the office , he Would aptly quote more " Specimen-poetry --  " Perchance like " ' Labor 's bread is sweet to eat , ( Ahem ! ) And toothsome is the toiler 's meat . ' " Ah , could you see them all , at lull of noon !  --  A sort of boisterous lull , with clink of spoon And clatter of deflecting knife , and plate Dropped saggingly , with its all-bounteous weight , And dragged in place voraciously ; and then Pent exclamations , and the lull again.  --  The garland of glad faces ' round the board --  Each member of the family restored To his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance guests so often there.  --  The father 's farmer-client , brought home from The courtroom , though he " did n't want to come Tel he jist saw he hat to ! " he 'd explain , Invariably , time and time again , To the pleased wife and hostess , as she pressed Another cup of coffee on the guest.  --  Or there was Johnty 's special chum , perchance , Or Bud 's , or both -- each childish countenance Lit with a higher glow of youthful glee , To be together thus unbrokenly ,  --  Jim Offutt , or Eck Skinner , or George Carr --  The very nearest chums of Bud 's these are ,  --  So , very probably , one of the three , At least , is there with Bud , or ought to be . Like interchange the town-boys each had known --  His playmate 's dinner better than his own --  Yet blest that he was ever made to stay At Almon Keefer 's , any blessed day , For any meal ! ...

ALMON KEEFER Ah , Almon Keefer ! what a boy you were , With your back-tilted hat and careless hair , And open , honest , fresh , fair face and eyes With their all-varying looks of pleased surprise And joyous interest in flower and tree , And poising humming-bird , and maundering bee . The fields and woods he knew ; the tireless tramp With gun and dog ; and the night-fisher 's camp --  No other boy , save Bee Lineback , had won Such brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood had he shown These traits that marked him as his father 's own . Dogs all paid Almon honor and bow-wowed Allegiance , let him come in any crowd Of rabbit-hunting town-boys , even though His own dog " Sleuth " rebuked their acting so With jealous snarls and growlings . But the best Of Almon 's virtues -- leading all the rest --  Was his great love of books , and skill as well In reading them aloud , and by the spell Thereof enthralling his mute listeners , as They grouped about him in the orchard grass , Hinging their bare shins in the mottled shine And shade , as they lay prone , or stretched supine Beneath their favorite tree , with dreamy eyes And Argo-fandes voyaging the skies . " Tales of the Ocean " was the name of one Old dog's-eared book that was surpassed by none Of all the glorious list.  - -  Its back was gone , But its vitality went bravely on In such delicious tales of land and sea As may not ever perish utterly . Of still more dubious caste , " Jack Sheppard " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . And , painful as the fact is to convey , In certain lurid tales of their own day , These boys found thieving heroes and outlaws They hailed with equal fervor of applause : " The League of the Miami "  - -  why , the name Alone was fascinating -- is the same , In memory , this venerable hour Of moral wisdom shorn of all its power , As it unblushingly reverts to when The old barn was " the Cave , " and hears again The signal blown , outside the buggy-shed --  The drowsy guard within uplifts his head , And " ' Who goes there ? ' " is called , in bated breath --  The challenge answered in a hush of death ,  --  " Sh !  --  ' Barney Gray ! ' " And then " ' What do you seek ? ' " " ' Stables of The League !

The " secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foe ; And , safe once more within his " cavern-halls , " He shakes his clenched fist at the warped plank-walls And mutters his defiance through the cracks At the balked Enemy 's retreating backs As the loud horde flees pell-mell down the lane , And -- Almon Keefer is himself again ! Excepting few , they were not books indeed Of deep import that Almon chose to read ;  --  Less fact than fiction.  - -  Much he favored those --  If not in poetry , in hectic prose --  That made our native Indian a wild , Feathered and fine-preened hero that a child Could recommend as just about the thing To make a god of , or at least a king . Aside from Almon 's own books -- two or three --  His store of lore The Township Library Supplied him weekly : All the books with " or " s --  Sub-titled -- lured him -- after " Indian Wars , " And " Life of Daniel Boone , " not to include Some few books spiced with humor ,  --  " Robin Hood " And rare " Don Quixote.

O Wonderland of wayward Childhood ! what An easy , breezy realm of summer calm And dreamy gleam and gloom and bloom and balm Thou art !  - -  The Lotus-Land the poet sung , It is the Child-World while the heart beats young ....

The fairest , rarest morning of the blossom-time of May Is not so sweet a season as the season of to-day While Youth 's diviner climate folds and holds us , close caressed , As we feel our mothers with us by the touch of face and breast ;  --  Our bare feet in the meadows , and our fancies up among The airy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beats young and our pulses leap and dance .

While the heart beats young !  - -  While the heart beats young !

And he was awkward , fat and overgrown , With a round full-moon face , that fairly shone As though to meet the simile 's demand . And , cumbrous though he seemed , both eye and hand Were dowered with the discernment and deft skill Of the true artisan : He shaped at will , In his old father 's shop , on rainy days , Little toy-wagons , and curved-runner sleighs ; The trimmest bows and arrows -- fashioned , too . Of " seasoned timber , " such as Noey knew How to select , prepare , and then complete , And call his little friends in from the street .

I 'll make a bow o ' that ' at common bows Wo n't dast to pick on ner turn up their nose ! " And Noey knew the woods , and all the trees , And thickets , plants and myriad mysteries Of swamp and bottom-land . And he knew where The ground-hog hid , and why located there.  --  He knew all animals that burrowed , swam , Or lived in tree-tops : And , by race and dam , He knew the choicest , safest deeps wherein Fish-traps might flourish nor provoke the sin Of theft in some chance peeking , prying sneak , Or town-boy , prowling up and down the creek . All four-pawed creatures tamable -- he knew Their outer and their inner natures too ; While they , in turn , were drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , as true as truth from end to end , Between themselves and this strange human friend . The same with birds -- he knew them every one , And he could " name them , too , without a gun . " No wonder Johnty loved him , even to The verge of worship.  - -  Noey led him through The art of trapping redbirds -- yes , and taught Him how to keep them when he had them caught --  What food they needed , and just where to swing The cage , if he expected them to sing . And Bud loved Noey , for the little pair Of stilts he made him ; or the stout old hair Trunk Noey put on wheels , and laid a track Of scantling-railroad for it in the back Part of the barn-lot ; or the cross-bow , made Just like a gun , which deadly weapon laid Against his shoulder as he aimed , and --  " Sping ! " He 'd hear the rusty old nail zoon and sing --  And zip ! your Mr. Bluejay 's wing would drop A farewell-feather from the old tree-top ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect carriage for her favorite doll --  A lady 's carriage -- not a baby-cab ,  --  But oilcloth top , and two seats , lined with drab And trimmed with white lace-paper from a case Of shaving-soap his uncle bought some place At auction once . And Alex loved him yet The best , when Noey brought him , for a pet , A little flying-squirrel , with great eyes --  Big as a child 's : And , childlike otherwise , It was at first a timid , tremulous , coy , Retiring little thing that dodged the boy And tried to keep in Noey 's pocket ;  - -  till , In time , responsive to his patient will , It became wholly docile , and content With its new master , as he came and went ,  --  The squirrel clinging flatly to his breast , Or sometimes scampering its craziest Around his body spirally , and then Down to his very heels and up again . And Little Lizzie loved him , as a bee Loves a great ripe red apple -- utterly . For Noey 's ruddy morning-face she drew The window-blind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coming , as she heard His tuneless whistling -- sweet as any bird It seemed to her , the one lame bar or so Of old " Wait for the Wagon "  - -  hoarse and low The sound was ,  - -  so that , all about the place , Folks joked and said that Noey " whistled bass "  --  The light remark originally made By Cousin Rufus , who knew notes , and played The flute with nimble skill , and taste as wall , And , critical as he was musical , Regarded Noey 's constant whistling thus " Phenominally unmelodious . " Likewise when Uncle Mart , who shared the love Of jest with Cousin Rufus hand-in-glove , Said " Noey could n't whistle ' Bonny Doon ' Even ! and , he 'd bet , could n't carry a tune If it had handles to it ! "  - -  But forgive The deviations here so fugitive , And turn again to Little Lizzie , whose High estimate of Noey we shall choose Above all others.  - -  And to her he was Particularly lovable because He laid the woodland 's harvest at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dewy-cool , in mats of greenest moss And leaves , all woven over and across With tender , biting " tongue-grass , " and " sheep-sour , " And twin-leaved beach-mast , prankt with bud and flower Of every gypsy-blossom of the wild , Dark , tangled forest , dear to any child.  --  All these in season . Nor could barren , drear , White and stark-featured Winter interfere With Noey 's rare resources : Still the same He blithely whistled through the snow and came Beneath the window with a Fairy sled ; And Little Lizzie , bundled heels-and-head , He took on such excursions of delight As even " Old Santy " with his reindeer might Have envied her ! And , later , when the snow Was softening toward Springtime and the glow Of steady sunshine smote upon it ,  - -  then Came the magician Noey yet again --  While all the children were away a day Or two at Grandma 's !  - -  and behold when they Got home once more ;  - -  there , towering taller than The doorway -- stood a mighty , old Snow-Man ! A thing of peerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Praxiteles.  - -  Alone It loomed in lordly grandeur all its own . And steadfast , too , for weeks and weeks it stood , The admiration of the neighborhood As well as of the children Noey sought Only to honor in the work he wrought . The traveler paid it tribute , as he passed Along the highway -- paused and , turning , cast A lingering , last look -- as though to take A vivid print of it , for memory 's sake , To lighten all the empty , aching miles Beyond with brighter fancies , hopes and smiles . The cynic put aside his biting wit And tacitly declared in praise of it ; And even the apprentice-poet of the town Rose to impassioned heights , and then sat down And penned a panegyric scroll of rhyme That made the Snow-Man famous for all time . And though , as now , the ever warmer sun Of summer had so melted and undone The perishable figure that -- alas !  --  Not even in dwindled white against the grass --  Was left its latest and minutest ghost , The children yet -- materially , almost --  Beheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place it used to stand )  --  With " Ring-a-round-a-rosy ! Bottle full O ' posey ! " and , with shriek and laugh , would pull From seeming contact with it -- just as when It was the real-est of old Snow-Men . " A NOTED TRAVELER " Even in such a scene of senseless play The children were surprised one summer-day By a strange man who called across the fence , Inquiring for their father 's residence ; And , being answered that this was the place , Opened the gate , and with a radiant face , Came in and sat down with them in the shade And waited -- till the absent father made His noon appearance , with a warmth and zest That told he had no ordinary guest In this man whose low-spoken name he knew At once , demurring as the stranger drew A stuffy notebook out and turned and set A big fat finger on a page and let The writing thereon testify instead Of further speech . And as the father read All silently , the curious children took Exacting inventory both of book And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head , and under that Rather long silvery hair , or iron-gray --  For he was not an old man ,  - -  anyway , Not beyond sixty . And he wore a pair Of square-framed spectacles -- or rather there Were two more than a pair ,  - -  the extra two Flared at the corners , at the eyes ' side-view , In as redundant vision as the eyes Of grasshoppers or bees or dragonflies . Later the children heard the father say He was " A Noted Traveler , " and would stay Some days with them -- In which time host and guest Discussed , alone , in deepest interest , Some vague , mysterious matter that defied The wistful children , loitering outside The spare-room door . There Bud acquired a quite New list of big words -- such as " Disunite , " And " Shibboleth , " and " Aristocracy , " And " Juggernaut , " and " Squatter Sovereignty , " And " Anti-slavery , " " Emancipate , " " Irrepressible conflict , " and " The Great Battle of Armageddon "  - -  obviously A pamphlet brought from Washington , D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of like views with " The Noted Traveler . " A PROSPECTIVE VISIT While any day was notable and dear That gave the children Noey , history here Records his advent emphasized indeed With sharp italics , as he came to feed The stock one special morning , fair and bright , When Johnty and Bud met him , with delight Unusual even as their extra dress --  Garbed as for holiday , with much excess Of proud self-consciousness and vain conceit In their new finery.  - -  Far up the street They called to Noey , as he came , that they , As promised , both were going back that day To his house with him ! And by time that each Had one of Noey 's hands -- ceasing their speech And coyly anxious , in their new attire , To wake the comment of their mute desire ,  --  Noey seemed rendered voiceless . Quite a while They watched him furtively.  - -  He seemed to smile As though he would conceal it ; and they saw Him look away , and his lips purse and draw In curious , twitching spasms , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white Predominated strangely.  - -  Then the spell Gave way , and his pent speech burst audible : " They wuz two stylish little boys , and they wuz mighty bold ones , Had two new pairs o ' britches made out o ' their daddy 's old ones ! " And at the inspirational outbreak , Both joker and his victims seemed to take An equal share of laughter ,  - -  and all through Their morning visit kept recurring to The funny words and jingle of the rhyme That just kept getting funnier all the time . AT NOEY 'S HOUSE At Noey 's house -- when they arrived with him --  How snug seemed everything , and neat and trim : The little picket-fence , and little gate --  It 's little pulley , and its little weight ,  --  All glib as clock-work , as it clicked behind Them , on the little red brick pathway , lined With little paint-keg-vases and teapots Of wee moss-blossoms and forgetmenots : And in the windows , either side the door , Were ranged as many little boxes more Of like old-fashioned larkspurs , pinks and moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Them rioted the morning-glory-vines On taut-set cotton-strings , whose snowy lines Whipt in and out and under the bright green Like basting-threads ; and , here and there between , A showy , shiny hollyhock would flare Its pink among the white and purple there.  --  And still behind the vines , the children saw A strange , bleached , wistful face that seemed to draw A vague , indefinite sympathy . A face It was of some newcomer to the place.  --  In explanation , Noey , briefly , said That it was " Jason , " as he turned and led The little fellows ' round the house to show Them his menagerie of pets . And so For quite a time the face of the strange guest Was partially forgotten , as they pressed About the squirrel-cage and rousted both The lazy inmates out , though wholly loath To whirl the wheel for them.  - -  And then with awe They walked ' round Noey 's big pet owl , and saw Him film his great , clear , liquid eyes and stare And turn and turn and turn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he Could turn it one way thus eternally . Behind the kitchen , then , with special pride Noey stirred up a terrapin inside The rain-barrel where he lived , with three or four Little mud-turtles of a size not more In neat circumference than the tiny toy Dumb-watches worn by every little boy . Then , back of the old shop , beneath the tree Of " rusty-coats , " as Noey called them , he Next took the boys , to show his favorite new Pet ' coon -- pulled rather coyly into view Up through a square hole in the bottom of An old inverted tub he bent above , Yanking a little chain , with " Hey ! you , sir ! Here 's comp'ny come to see you , Bolivur ! " Explanatory , he went on to say , " I named him ' Bolivur ' jes thisaway ,  --  He looks so round and ovalish and fat , ' Peared like no other name ' ud fit but that . " Here Noey 's father called and sent him on Some errand . " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A half a ' hour.  - -  Take Bud , and go on in Where Jason is , tel I git back agin . " Whoever Jason was , they found him there Still at the front-room window.  - -  By his chair Leaned a new pair of crutches ; and from one Knee down , a leg was bandaged.  --  " Jason done That-air with one o ' these-'ere tools we call A ' shin-hoe '  - -  but a foot-adz mostly all Hardware-store-keepers calls ' em . "  --  ( Noey made This explanation later . ) Jason paid But little notice to the boys as they Came in the room :  - -  An idle volume lay Upon his lap -- the only book in sight --  And Johnty read the title ,  --  " Light , More Light , There 's Danger in the Dark , "  - -  though first and best --  In fact , the whole of Jason 's interest Seemed centered on a little dog -- one pet Of Noey 's all uncelebrated yet --  Though Jason , certainly , avowed his worth , And niched him over all the pets on earth --  As the observant Johnty would relate The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noey 's kinsman and his tribute there :  --  " THAT LITTLE DOG " " That little dog ' ud scratch at that door And go on a-whinin ' two hours before He 'd ever let up !

" rang out a gleeful call ,  --  " The Loehrs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much elated little chap , In snowy linen-suit and tasseled cap , Leaped from the back-fence just across the street From Bixlers ' , and came galloping to meet His equally delighted little pair Of playmates , hurrying out to join him there --  " The Loehrs is come !  - -  The Loehrs is come ! " his glee Augmented to a pitch of ecstasy Communicated wildly , till the cry " The Loehrs is come ! " in chorus quavered high And thrilling as some paean of challenge or Soul-stirring chant of armied conqueror . And who this avant courier of " the Loehrs " ?  --  This happiest of all boys out-o ' - doors - -   Who but Will Pierson , with his heart 's excess Of summer-warmth and light and breeziness ! " From our front winder I ' uz first to see ' Em all a-drivin ' into town ! " bragged he --  " An ' seen ' em turnin ' up the alley where Your folks lives at .

" Glorious news !  --  Even more glorious when verified In the boys ' welcoming eyes of love and pride , As one by one they greeted their old friends And neighbors.  - -  Nor until their earth-life ends Will that bright memory become less bright Or dimmed indeed . ... Again , at candle-light , The faces all are gathered . And how glad The Mother 's features , knowing that she had Her dear , sweet Mary Loehr back again.  --  She always was so proud of her ; and then The dear girl , in return , was happy , too , And with a heart as loving , kind and true As that maturer one which seemed to blend As one the love of mother and of friend . From time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something low , whereat A tender , wistful look would gather in The mother-eyes ; and then there would begin A sudden cheerier talk , directed to The stranger guests -- the man and woman who , It was explained , were coming now to make Their temporary home in town for sake Of the wife 's somewhat failing health . Yes , they Were city-people , seeking rest this way , The man said , answering a query made By some well meaning neighbor -- with a shade Of apprehension in the answer .... No ,  --  They had no children . As he answered so , The man 's arm went about his wife , and she Leant toward him , with her eyes lit prayerfully : Then she arose -- he following -- and bent Above the little sleeping innocent Within the cradle at the mother 's side --  He patting her , all silent , as she cried.  --  Though , haply , in the silence that ensued , His musings made melodious interlude . In the warm , health-giving weather My poor pale wife and I Drive up and down the little town And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , from the main highway , In through the wood 's green solitudes --  Fair as the Lord 's own Day . We have lived so long together . And joyed and mourned as one , That each with each , with a look for speech , Or a touch , may talk as none But Love 's elect may comprehend --  Why , the touch of her hand on mine Speaks volume-wise , and the smile of her eyes , To me , is a song divine . There are many places that lure us :  --  " The Old Wood Bridge " just west Of town we know -- and the creek below , And the banks the boys love best : And " Beech Grove , " too , on the hill-top ; And " The Haunted House " beyond , With its roof half off , and its old pump-trough Adrift in the roadside pond . We find our way to " The Marshes "  --  At least where they used to be ; And " The Old Camp Grounds " ; and " The Indian Mounds , " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have crunched and splashed through " Flint-bed Ford " ; And at " Old Big Bee-gum Spring " We have stayed the cup , half lifted up . Hearing the redbird sing . And then , there is " Wesley Chapel , " With its little graveyard , lone At the crossroads there , though the sun sets fair On wild-rose , mound and stone ... A wee bed under the willows --  My wife 's hand on my own --  And our horse stops , too ... And we hear the coo Of a dove in undertone . The dusk , the dew , and the silence . " Old Charley " turns his head Homeward then by the pike again , Though never a word is said --  One more stop , and a lingering one --  After the fields and farms ,  --  At the old Toll Gate , with the woman await With a little girl in her arms . The silence sank -- Floretty came to call The children in the kitchen , where they all Went helter-skeltering with shout and din Enough to drown most sanguine silence in ,  --  For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cheers they went . THE HIRED MAN AND FLORETTY The Hired Man 's supper , which he sat before , In near reach of the wood-box , the stove-door And one leaf of the kitchen-table , was Somewhat belated , and in lifted pause His dextrous knife was balancing a bit Of fried mush near the port awaiting it . At the glad children 's advent -- gladder still To find him there --  " Jest tickled fit to kill To see ye all ! " he said , with unctious cheer.  --  " I 'm tryin ' - like to he'p Floretty here To git things cleared away and give ye room Accordin ' to yer stren'th . But I p'sume It 's a pore boarder , as the poet says , That quarrels with his victuals , so I guess I 'll take another wedge o ' that-air cake , Florett ' , that you 're a-learnin ' how to bake . " He winked and feigned to swallow painfully.  --  " Jest ' fore ye all come in , Floretty she Was boastin ' ' bout her biscuits -- and they air As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to braggin ' on their bread , I 'm s'picious ' bout their pie -- as Danty said . " This raillery Floretty strangely seemed To take as compliment , and fairly beamed With pleasure at it all .  --  " Speakin ' o ' bread --  When she come here to live , " The Hired Man said ,  --  " Never ben out o ' Freeport ' fore she come Up here ,  - -  of course she needed ' sperience some.  --  So , one day , when yer Ma was goin ' to set The risin ' fer some bread , she sent Florett To borry leaven , ' crost at Ryans '  - -  So , She went and asked fer twelve.  - -  She did n't know , But thought , whatever ' twuz , that she could keep One fer herse'f , she said . O she wuz deep ! " Some little evidence of favor hailed The Hired Man 's humor ; but it wholly failed To touch the serious Susan Loehr , whose air And thought rebuked them all to listening there To her brief history of the city-man And his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  - -  So Susan testified ,  --  And so attested all the Loehrs beside.  --  So entertaining was the history , that The Hired Man , in the corner where he sat In quiet sequestration , shelling corn , Ceased wholly , listening , with a face forlorn As Sorrow 's own , while Susan , John and Jake Told of these strangers who had come to make Some weeks ' stay in the town , in hopes to gain Once more the health the wife had sought in vain : Their doctor , in the city , used to know The Loehrs -- Dan and Rachel -- years ago ,  --  And so had sent a letter and request For them to take a kindly interest In favoring the couple all they could --  To find some home-place for them , if they would , Among their friends in town . He ended by A dozen further lines , explaining why His patient must have change of scene and air --  New faces , and the simple friendships there With them , which might , in time , make her forget A grief that kept her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor yet could she find sleep by night nor rest By day , for **28;1895;TOOLONG still Upon a grief beyond the doctor 's skill ,  --  The death of her one little girl . " Pore thing ! " Floretty sighed , and with the turkey-wing Brushed off the stove-hearth softly , and peered in The kettle of molasses , with her thin Voice wandering into song unconsciously --  In purest , if most witless , sympathy.  --  " ' Then sleep no more : Around thy heart Some ten-der dream may i-dlee play . But mid-night song , With mad-jick art , Will chase that dree muh-way ! ' " " That-air besetment of Floretty 's , " said The Hired Man ,  --  " singin -- she inhairited ,  --  Her father wuz addicted -- same as her --  To singin ' yes , and played the dulcimer ! But -- gittin ' back ,  - -  I s'pose yer talkin ' ' bout Them Hammondses . Well , Hammond he gits out Pattents on things -- inventions-like , I 'm told --  And 's got more money'n a house could hold !

" It was good To hear him now , and so the children stood Closer about him , waiting . " Things to eat , " The Hired Man went on , " ' s mighty hard to beat ! Now , when I wuz a boy , we was so pore , My parunts could n't ' ford popcorn no more To pamper me with ;  - -  so , I hat to go Without popcorn -- sometimes a year er so !  --  And suffer'n ' saints ! how hungry I would git Fer jest one other chance -- like this -- at it ! Many and many a time I 've dreamp ' , at night , About popcorn ,  - -  all busted open white , And hot , you know -- and jest enough o ' salt And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  Well ! as I was goin ' on to say ,  --  After a-dreamin ' of it thataway , Then havin ' to wake up and find it 's all A dream , and hai n't got no popcorn at-tall , Ner haint had none -- I 'd think , ' Well , where 's the use !

And yit I 've noticed -- more'n likely so have you --  That things do n't happen when you want ' em to . " And thus he ran on artlessly , with speech And work in equal exercise , till each Tureen and bowl brimmed white . And then he greased The saucers ready for the wax , and seized The fragrant-steaming kettle , at a sign Made by Floretty ; and , each child in line , He led out to the pump -- where , in the dim New coolness of the night , quite near to him He felt Floretty 's presence , fresh and sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with loud delight of laugh and jest , They plied their subtle alchemy with zest --  Till , sudden , high above their tumult , welled Out of the sitting-room a song which held Them stilled in some strange rapture , listening To the sweet blur of voices chorusing :  --  " ' When twilight approaches the season That ever is sacred to song , Does some one repeat my name over , And sigh that I tarry so long ? And is there a chord in the music That 's missed when my voice is away ?  --  And a chord in each heart that awakens Regret at my wearisome stay-ay --  Regret at my wearisome stay . ' " All to himself , The Hired Man thought --  " Of course They 'll sing Floretty homesick ! " ... O strange source Of ecstasy ! O mystery of Song !  --  To hear the dear old utterance flow along :  --  " ' Do they set me a chair near the table When evening 's home-pleasures are nigh ?  --  When the candles are lit in the parlor . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just then the moonlight sliced the porch slantwise , And flashed in misty spangles in the eyes Floretty clenched -- while through the dark --  " I jing !

'  - -  which I done Last I was home at Freeport.  - -  S'pose you run And git it -- and we 'll all go in to where They 'll know the notes and sing it fer ye there . " And up the darkness of the old stairway Floretty fled , without a word to say --  Save to herself some whisper muffled by Her apron , as she wiped her lashes dry . Returning , with a letter , which she laid Upon the kitchen-table while she made A hasty crock of " float , "  - -  poured thence into A deep glass dish of iridescent hue And glint and sparkle , with an overflow Of froth to crown it , foaming white as snow.  --  And then -- poundcake , and jelly-cake as rare , For its delicious complement , with air Of Hebe mortalized , she led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE EVENING COMPANY Within the sitting-room , the company Had been increased in number . Two or three Young couples had been added : Emma King , Ella and Mary Mathers -- all could sing Like veritable angels -- Lydia Martin , too , And Nelly Millikan.  - -  What songs they knew !  --  " ' Ever of Thee -- wherever I may be , Fondly I 'm drea-m-ing ever of thee ! ' " And with their gracious voices blend the grace Of Warsaw Barnett 's tenor ; and the bass Unfathomed of Wick Chapman -- Fancy still Can feel , as well as hear it , thrill on thrill , Vibrating plainly down the backs of chairs And through the wall and up the old hall-stairs.  --  Indeed young Chapman 's voice especially Attracted Mr. Hammond -- For , said he , Waiving the most Elysian sweetness of The ladies ' voices -- altitudes above The man 's for sweetness ;  - -  but - -  as contrast , would Not Mr. Chapman be so very good As , just now , to oblige all with -- in fact , Some sort of jolly song , to counteract In part , at least , the sad , pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Noted Traveler " made second to With heartiness -- and so each , in review , Joined in -- until the radiant basso cleared His wholly unobstructed throat and peered Intently at the ceiling -- voice and eye As opposite indeed as earth and sky.  --  Thus he uplifted his vast bass and let It roam at large the memories booming yet : " ' Old Simon the Cellarer keeps a rare store Of Malmsey and Malvoi-sie , Of Cyprus , and who can say how many more ?  --  But a chary old so-u-l is he-e-ee --  A chary old so-u-l is he ! Of hock and Canary he never doth fail ; And all the year ' round , there is brewing of ale ;  --  Yet he never aileth , he quaintly doth say , While he keeps to his sober six flagons a day . ' " ... And then the chorus -- the men 's voices all Warred in it -- like a German Carnival.  --  Even Mrs. Hammond smiled , as in her youth , Hearing her husband -- And in veriest truth " The Noted Traveler 's " ever-present hat Seemed just relaxed a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stirred his " float " vehemently and long . Then Cousin Rufus with his flute , and art Blown blithely through it from both soul and heart --  Inspired to heights of mastery by the glad , Enthusiastic audience he had In the young ladies of a town that knew No other flutist , nay , nor wanted to , Since they had heard his " Polly Hopkin 's Waltz , " Or " Rickett 's Hornpipe , " with its faultless faults , As rendered solely , he explained , " by ear , " Having but heard it once , Commencement Year , At " Old Ann Arbor . " Little Maymie now Seemed " friends " with Mr. Hammond -- anyhow , Was lifted to his lap -- where settled , she --  Enthroned thus , in her dainty majesty , Gained universal audience -- although Addressing him alone :  --  " I 'm come to show You my new Red-blue pencil ; and she says "  --  ( Pointing to Mrs. Hammond )  --  " that she guess ' You 'll make a picture fer me . " " And what kind Of picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child as bidden , folding square The piece of paper she had brought him there.  --  " I do n't know , " Maymie said --  " only ist make A little dirl , like me ! " He paused to take A sharp view of the child , and then he drew --  Awhile with red , and then awhile with blue --  The outline of a little girl that stood In converse with a wolf in a great wood ; And she had on a hood and cloak of red --  As Maymie watched --  " Red Riding Hood ! " she said . " And who 's ' Red Riding Hood ' ? " " W'y , do n't you know ?

LIMITATIONS OF GENIUS The audience entire seemed pleased -- indeed Extremely pleased . And little Maymie , freed From her task of instructing , ran to show Her wondrous colored picture to and fro Among the company . " And how comes it , " said Some one to Mr. Hammond , " that , instead Of the inventor 's life you did not choose The artist 's ?  - -  since the world can better lose A cutting-box or reaper than it can A noble picture painted by a man Endowed with gifts this drawing would suggest "  --  Holding the picture up to show the rest . " There now ! " chimed in the wife , her pale face lit Like winter snow with sunrise over it ,  --  " That 's what I 'm always asking him.  - -  But he --  Well , as he 's answering you , he answers me ,  --  With that same silent , suffocating smile He 's wearing now ! " For quite a little while No further speech from anyone , although All looked at Mr. Hammond and that slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The encouraged querist asked him yet again Why was it , and etcetera -- with all The rest , expectant , waiting ' round the wall ,  --  Until the gentle Mr. Hammond said He 'd answer with a " parable , " instead --  About " a dreamer " that he used to know --  " An artist "  --  " master "  - -  all - -  in embryo . MR . HAMMOND 'S PARABLE THE DREAMER I He was a Dreamer of the Days : Indolent as a lazy breeze Of midsummer , in idlest ways Lolling about in the shade of trees . The farmer turned -- as he passed him by Under the hillside where he kneeled Plucking a flower -- with scornful eye And rode ahead in the harvest field Muttering --  " Lawz ! ef that-air shirk Of a boy was mine fer a week er so , He 'd quit dreamin ' and git to work And earn his livin '  - -  er - -  Well ! I know ! " And even kindlier rumor said , Tapping with finger a shaking head ,  --  " Got such a curious kind o ' way --  Would n't surprise me much , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming away his days . No companions ? Yes , a book Sometimes under his arm he took To read aloud to a lonesome brook . And school-boys , truant , once had heard A strange voice chanting , faint and dim --  Followed the echoes , and found it him , Perched in a tree-top like a bird , Singing , clean from the highest limb ; And , fearful and awed , they all slipped by To wonder in whispers if he could fly . " Let him alone ! " his father said When the old schoolmaster came to say , " He took no part in his books to-day --  Only the lesson the readers read.  --  His mind seems sadly going astray ! " " Let him alone ! " came the mournful tone , And the father 's grief in his sad eyes shone --  Hiding his face in his trembling hand , Moaning , " Would I could understand ! But as heaven wills it I accept Uncomplainingly ! " So he wept . Then went " The Dreamer " as he willed , As uncontrolled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loosed from its moorings and afloat : Drifted out from the busy quay Of dull school-moorings listlessly ; Drifted off on the talking breeze , All alone with his reveries ; Drifted on , as his fancies wrought --  Out on the mighty gulfs of thought . II The farmer came in the evening gray And took the bars of the pasture down ; Called to the cows in a coaxing way , " Bess " and " Lady " and " Spot " and " Brown , " While each gazed with a wide-eyed stare , As though surprised at his coming there --  Till another tone , in a higher key , Brought their obeyance lothfully . Then , as he slowly turned and swung The topmost bar to its proper rest , Something fluttered along and clung An instant , shivering at his breast --  A wind-scared fragment of legal cap , Which darted again , as he struck his hand On his sounding chest with a sudden slap , And hurried sailing across the land . But as it clung he had caught the glance Of a little penciled countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A minute later , over the fence , " Here and there and gone astray Over the hills and far away , " He chased it into a thicket of trees And took it away from the captious breeze . A scrap of paper with a rhyme Scrawled upon it of summertime : A pencil-sketch of a dairy-maid , Under a farmhouse porch 's shade , Working merrily ; and was blent With her glad features such sweet content , That a song she sung in the lines below Seemed delightfully apropos :  --  SONG " Why do I sing -- Tra-la-la-la-la ! Glad as a King ?  -- Tra-la-la-la-la ! Well , since you ask ,  --  I have such a pleasant task , I can not help but sing ! " Why do I smile -- Tra-la-la-la-la ! Working the while ?  -- Tra-la-la-la-la ! Work like this is play ,  --  So I 'm playing all the day --  I can not help but smile ! " So , If you please -- Tra-la-la-la-la ! Live at your ease !  -- Tra-la-la-la-la ! You 've only got to turn , And , you see , its bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The farmer pondered and scratched his head , Reading over each mystic word.  --  " Some o ' the Dreamer 's work ! " he said --  " Ah , here 's more -- and name and date In his hand-write ' ! "  - -  And the good man read ,  --  " ' Patent applied for , July third , Eighteen hundred and forty-eight ' ! " The fragment fell from his nerveless grasp --  His awed lips thrilled with the joyous gasp : " I see the p'int to the whole concern ,  --  He 's studied out a patent churn ! " FLORETTY 'S MUSICAL CONTRIBUTION All seemed delighted , though the elders more , Of course , than were the children.  - -  Thus , before Much interchange of mirthful compliment , The story-teller said his stories " went " ( Like a bad candle ) best when they went out ,  --  And that some sprightly music , dashed about , Would wholly quench his " glimmer , " and inspire Far brighter lights . And , answering this desire , The flutist opened , in a rapturous strain Of rippling notes -- a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;1969;TOOLONG the dusk sheds dew , It fell , by velvety , staccatoed halts , Swooning away in old " Von Weber 's Waltz . " Then the young ladies sang " Isle of the Sea "  --  In ebb and flow and wave so billowy ,  --  Only with quavering breath and folded eyes The listeners heard , buoyed on the fall and rise Of its insistent and exceeding stress Of sweetness and ecstatic tenderness ... With lifted finger yet , Remembrance -- List !  --  " Beautiful isle of the sea ! " wells in a mist Of tremulous ... ... After much whispering Among the children , Alex came to bring Some kind of letter -- as it seemed to be --  To Cousin Rufus . This he carelessly Unfolded -- reading to himself alone ,  --  But , since its contents became , later , known , And no one " plagued so awful bad , " the same May here be given -- of course without full name , Fac-simile , or written kink or curl Or clue . It read :  --  " Wild Roved an indian Girl Brite al Floretty " deer freind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you &amp; make my Promus good to you in the Regards Of doing What i Promust afterwards , the notes &amp; Words is both here Printed SOS you *kin* can git uncle Mart to read you *them* those &amp; cousin Rufus you can git to Play the notes fur you on eny Plezunt day His Legul Work ai nt *Pressin* Pressing . Ever thine As shore as the Vine doth the Stump intwine thou art my Lump of Sackkerrine Rinaldo Rinaldine the Pirut in Captivity . ... There dropped Another square scrap.  - -  But the hand was stopped That reached for it -- Floretty suddenly Had set a firm foot on her property --  Thinking it was the letter , not the song ,  --  But blushing to discover she was wrong , When , with all gravity of face and air , Her precious letter handed to her there By Cousin Rufus left her even more In apprehension than she was before . But , testing his unwavering , kindly eye , She seemed to put her last suspicion by , And , in exchange , handed the song to him.  --  A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes and words were -- but as plain as day They seemed to him , as he began to play --  And plain to all the singers , as he ran An airy , warbling prelude , then began Singing and swinging in so blithe a strain , That every voice rang in the old refrain : From the beginning of the song , clean through , Floretty 's features were a study to The flutist who " read notes " so readily , Yet read so little of the mystery Of that face of the girl's.  - -  Indeed one thing Bewildered him quite into worrying , And that was , noticing , throughout it all , The Hired Man shrinking closer to the wall , She ever backing toward him through the throng Of barricading children -- till the song Was ended , and at last he saw her near Enough to reach and take him by the ear And pinch it just a pang 's worth of her ire And leave it burning like a coal of fire . He noticed , too , in subtle pantomime She seemed to dust him off , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if she Had never heard the song before --  " What ! me ? " She said -- then blushed again and smiled ,  --  " I 've knowed that song sence Adam was a child !  --  It 's jes a joke o ' this-here man's.  - -  He 's learned To read and write a little , and its turned His fool-head some -- That 's all ! " And then some one Of the loud-wrangling boys said --  " Course they 's none No more , these days !  - -  They 's Fairies ust to be , But they 're all dead , a hunderd years ! " said he . " Well , there 's where you 're mustakened ! "  - -  in reply They heard Bud 's voice , pitched sharp and thin and high.  --  " An ' how you goin ' to prove it ! " " Well , I kin !

'  --  You fire away , Bud , on your Fairy-tale --  Your Uncle 's here to back you ! " Somewhat pale , And breathless as to speech , the little man Gathered himself . And thus his story ran .

A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud 's Fairy ; but another stir above That murmur was occasioned by a sweet Young lady-caller , from a neighboring street , Who rose reluctantly to say good-night To all the pleasant friends and the delight Experienced , as she had promised sure To be back home by nine . Then paused , demure , And wondered was it very dark.  - -  Oh , no !  --  She had come by herself and she could go Without an escort . Ah , you sweet girls all ! What young gallant but comes at such a call , Your most abject of slaves ! Why , there were three Young men , and several men of family , Contesting for the honor -- which at last Was given to Cousin Rufus ; and he cast A kingly look behind him , as the pair Vanished with laughter in the darkness there . As order was restored , with everything Suggestive , in its way , of " romancing , " Some one observed that now would be the chance For Noey to relate a circumstance That he -- the very specious rumor went --  Had been eye-witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned pale As death ; then turned to flee , without avail.  --  " There ! head him off ! Now ! hold him in his chair !  --  Tell us the Serenade-tale , now , Noey.  - -  There ! " NOEY 'S NIGHT-PIECE " They ai n't much ' tale ' about it ! " Noey said.  --  " K'tawby grapes wuz gittin ' good-n-red I rickollect ; and Tubb Kingry and me ' Ud kindo ' browse round town , daytime , to see What neighbers ' peared to have the most to spare ' At wuz git-at-able and no dog there When we come round to git ' em , say ' bout ten O'clock at night when mostly old folks then Wuz snorin ' at each other like they yit Helt some old grudge ' at never slep ' a bit .

And , bless their hearts , that 's all the ' tale ' they is ! " And even as Noey closed , all radiantly The unconscious hero of the history , Returning , met a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , although Most gratifying ,  - -  and he told them so . " I only urge , " he said , " my right to be Enlightened . " And a voice said : " Certainly :  --  During your absence we agreed that you Should tell us all a story , old or new , Just in the immediate happy frame of mind We knew you would return in . " So , resigned , The ready flutist tossed his hat aside --  Glanced at the children , smiled , and thus complied . COUSIN RUFUS ' STORY My little story , Cousin Rufus said , Is not so much a story as a fact . It is about a certain willful boy --  An aggrieved , unappreciated boy , Grown to dislike his own home very much , By reason of his parents being not At all up to his rigid standard and Requirements and exactions as a son And disciplinarian . So , sullenly He brooded over his disheartening Environments and limitations , till , At last , well knowing that the outside world Would yield him favors never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even before the call for breakfast -- and , Climbing the alley-fence , and bitterly Shaking his clenched fist at the woodpile , he Evanished down the turnpike.  - -  Yes : he had , Once and for all , put into execution His long low-muttered threatenings -- He had Run off !  - -  He had -- had run away from home ! His parents , at discovery of his flight , Bore up first-rate -- especially his Pa ,  --  Quite possibly recalling his own youth , And therefrom predicating , by high noon , The absent one was very probably Disporting his nude self in the delights Of the old swimmin ' - hole , some hundred yards Below the slaughter-house , just east of town . The stoic father , too , in his surmise Was accurate -- For , lo ! the boy was there ! And there , too , he remained throughout the day --  Save at one starving interval in which He clad his sunburnt shoulders long enough To shy across a wheatfield , shadow-like , And raid a neighboring orchard -- bitterly , And with spasmodic twitchings of the lip , Bethinking him how all the other boys Had homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no home !  - -  At least These very words seemed rising mockingly , Until his every thought smacked raw and sour And green and bitter as the apples he In vain essayed to stay his hunger with . Nor did he join the glad shouts when the boys Returned rejuvenated for the long Wet revel of the feverish afternoon.  --  Yet , bravely , as his comrades splashed and swam And spluttered , in their weltering merriment , He tried to laugh , too ,  - -  but his voice was hoarse And sounded to him like some other boy 's . And then he felt a sudden , poking sort Of sickness at the heart , as though some cold And scaly pain were blindly nosing it Down in the dreggy darkness of his breast . The tensioned pucker of his purple lips Grew ever chillier and yet more tense --  The central hurt of it slow spreading till It did possess the little face entire . And then there grew to be a knuckled knot --  An aching kind of core within his throat --  An ache , all dry and swallowless , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend He did n't notice it as when he did . It was a kind of a conceited pain --  An overbearing , self-assertive and Barbaric sort of pain that clean outhurt A boy 's capacity for suffering --  So , many times , the little martyr needs Must turn himself all suddenly and dive From sight of his hilarious playmates and Surreptitiously weep under water . Thus He wrestled with his awful agony Till almost dark ; and then , at last -- then , with The very latest lingering group of his Companions , he moved turgidly toward home --  Nay , rather oozed that way , so slow he went ,  --  With lothful , hesitating , loitering , Reluctant , late-election-returns air , Heightened somewhat by the conscience-made resolve Of chopping a double-armful of wood As he went in by rear way of the kitchen . And this resolve he executed ;  - -  yet The hired girl made no comment whatsoever , But went on washing up the supper-things , Crooning the unutterably sad song , " Then think , Oh , think how lonely this heart must ever be ! " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantry ; but the cupboard-door Was locked . He sighed then like a wet fore-stick And went out on the porch.  - -  At least the pump , He prophesied , would meet him kindly and Shake hands with him and welcome his return ! And long he held the old tin dipper up --  And oh , how fresh and pure and sweet the draught ! Over the upturned brim , with grateful eyes He saw the back-yard , in the gathering night , Vague , dim and lonesome , but it all looked good : The lightning-bugs , against the grape-vines , blinked A sort of sallow gladness over his Home-coming , with this softening of the heart . He did not leave the dipper carelessly In the milk-trough.  - -  No : he hung it back upon Its old nail thoughtfully -- even tenderly . All slowly then he turned and sauntered toward The rain-barrel at the corner of the house , And , pausing , peered into it at the few Faint stars reflected there . Then -- moved by some Strange impulse new to him -- he washed his feet . He then went in the house -- straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evening lamp.  - -  The father all intent Reading his paper , and the mother quite As intent with her sewing . Neither looked Up at his entrance -- even reproachfully ,  --  And neither spoke . The wistful runaway Drew a long , quavering breath , and then sat down Upon the extreme edge of a chair . And all Was very still there for a long , long while.  --  Yet everything , someway , seemed restful-like And homey and old-fashioned , good and kind , And sort of kin to him !  - -  Only too still ! If somebody would say something -- just speak --  Or even rise up suddenly and come And lift him by the ear sheer off his chair --  Or box his jaws -- Lord bless ' em !  - -  anything !  --  Was he not there to thankfully accept Any reception from parental source Save this incomprehensible voicelessness . O but the silence held its very breath ! If but the ticking clock would only strike And for an instant drown the whispering , Lisping , sifting sound the katydids Made outside in the grassy nowhere . Far Down some back-street he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town-fox , " But now with no desire at all to be Participating in their sport -- No ; no ;  --  Never again in this world would he want To join them there !  - -  he only wanted just To stay in home of nights -- Always -- always --  Forever and a day ! He moved ; and coughed --  Coughed hoarsely , too , through his rolled tongue ; and yet No vaguest of parental notice or Solicitude in answer -- no response --  No word -- no look . O it was deathly still !  --  So still it was that really he could not Remember any prior silence that At all approached it in profundity And depth and density of utter hush . He felt that he himself must break it : So , Summoning every subtle artifice Of seeming nonchalance and native ease And naturalness of utterance to his aid , And gazing raptly at the house-cat where She lay curled in her wonted corner of The hearth-rug , dozing , he spoke airily And said : " I see you 've got the same old cat ! " BEWILDERING EMOTIONS The merriment that followed was subdued --  As though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appealing quite As much to sorrow as to mere delight , According , haply , to the listener 's bent Either of sad or merry temperament.  --  " And of your two appeals I much prefer The pathos , " said " The Noted Traveler , "  --  " For should I live to twice my present years , I know I could not quite forget the tears That child-eyes bleed , the little palms nailed wide , And quivering soul and body crucified .... But , bless ' em ! there are no such children here To-night , thank God !  - -  Come here to me , my dear ! " He said to little Alex , in a tone So winning that the sound of it alone Had drawn a child more lothful to his knee :  --  " And , now-sir , I 'll agree if you 'll agree ,  --  You tell us all a story , and then I Will tell one . " " But I ca n't . " " Well , ca n't you try ? " " Yes , Mister : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , ' at you made up so well , About the Bear . He allus tells that one , " Said Bud ,  --  " He gits it mixed some ' bout the gun An ' ax the Little Boy had , an ' apples , too . "  --  Then Uncle Mart said --  " There , now ! that 'll do !  --  Let Alex tell his story his own way ! " And Alex , prompted thus , without delay Began . THE BEAR-STORY THAT ALEX " IST MAKED UP HIS-OWN-SE'F " W'y , wunst they wuz a Little Boy went out In the woods to shoot a Bear .

" And now "  - -  the serious host said , lifting there A hand entreating silence ;  --  " now , aware Of the good promise of our Traveler guest To add some story with and for the rest , I think I favor you , and him as well , Asking a story I have heard him tell , And know its truth , in each minute detail : " Then leaning on his guest 's chair , with a hale Hand-pat by way of full indorsement , he Said , " Yes -- the Free-Slave story -- certainly . " The old man , with his waddy notebook out , And glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still firmer drew His hat on , with a nervous cough or two : And , save at times the big hard words , and tone Of gathering passion -- all the speaker 's own ,  --  The tale that set each childish heart astir Was thus told by " The Noted Traveler . " TOLD BY " THE NOTED TRAVELER " Coming , clean from the Maryland-end Of this great National Road of ours , Through your vast West ; with the time to spend , Stopping for days in the main towns , where Every citizen seemed a friend , And friends grew thick as the wayside flowers ,  --  I found no thing that I might narrate More singularly strange or queer Than a thing I found in your sister-state Ohio ,  - -  at a river-town -- down here In my notebook : Zanesville -- situate On the stream Muskingum -- broad and clear , And navigable , through half the year , North , to Coshocton ; south , as far As Marietta.  - -  But these facts are Not of the story , but the scene Of the simple little tale I mean To tell directly -- from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to : Eastward of Zanesville , two or three Miles from the town , as our stage drove in , I on the driver 's seat , and he Pointing out this and that to me ,  --  On beyond us -- among the rest --  A grovey slope , and a fluttering throng Of little children , which he " guessed " Was a picnic , as we caught their thin High laughter , as we drove along , Clearer and clearer . Then suddenly He turned and asked , with a curious grin , What were my views on Slavery ? " Why ? " I asked , in return , with a wary eye . " Because , " he answered , pointing his whip At a little , whitewashed house and shed On the edge of the road by the grove ahead ,  --  " Because there are two slaves there , " he said --  " Two Black slaves that I 've passed each trip For eighteen years.  - -  Though they 've been set free , They have been slaves ever since ! " said he . And , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , All briefly I heard the history Of this little old Negro woman and Her husband , house and scrap of land ; How they were slaves and had been made free By their dying master , years ago In old Virginia ; and then had come North here into a free state -- so , Safe forever , to found a home --  For themselves alone ? for they left South there Five strong sons , who had , alas ! All been sold ere it came to pass This first old master with his last breath Had freed the parents.  --  ( He went to death Agonized and in dire despair That the poor slave children might not share Their parents ' freedom . And wildly then He moaned for pardon and died . Amen ! ) Thus , with their freedom , and little sum Of money left them , these two had come North , full twenty long years ago ; And , settling there , they had hopefully Gone to work , in their simple way , **27;2024;TOOLONG sweet Corn , and popcorn.  - -  Bird and bee In the garden-blooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day , with its dust and heat --  The crops that thirst and the rains that fail ; Or in Autumn chill , when the clouds hung low , And hand-made hominy might find sale In the near town-market ; or baking pies And cakes , to range in alluring show At the little window , where the eyes Of the Movers ' children , driving past , Grew fixed , till the big white wagons drew Into a halt that would sometimes last Even the space of an hour or two --  As the dusty , thirsty travelers made Their noonings there in the beeches ' shade By the old black Aunty 's spring-house , where , Along with its cooling draughts , were found Jugs of her famous sweet spruce-beer , Served with her gingerbread-horses there , While Aunty 's snow-white cap bobbed ' round Till the children 's rapture knew no bound , As she sang and danced for them , quavering clear And high the chant of her old slave-days --  " Oh , Lo 'd , Jinny ! my toes is so ' , Dancin ' on yo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought all ways To earn the pennies , and hoard them , too ,  --  And with what ultimate end in view ?  --  They were saving up money enough to be Able , in time , to buy their own Five children back .

But the pride and glory that was theirs When they first hitched up their shackly cart For the long , long journey South.  - -  The start In the first drear light of the chilly dawn , With no friends gathered in grieving throng ,  --  With no farewells and favoring prayers ; But , as they creaked and jolted on , Their chiming voices broke in song --  " ' Hail , all hail ! do n't you see the stars a-fallin ' ? Hail , all hail ! I 'm on my way . Gideon1 am A healin ' ba'm --  I belong to the blood-washed army . Gideon am A healin ' ba'm --  On my way !

And the son , restored , and welcomed so , Found service readily in the town ; And , with the parents , sure and slow , He went " saltin ' de cole cash down . " So with the next boy -- and each one In turn , till four of the five at last Had been bought back ; and , in each case , With steady work and good homes not Far from the parents , they chipped in To the family fund , with an equal grace . Thus they managed and planned and wrought , And the old folks throve -- Till the night before They were to start for the lone last son In the rainy dawn -- their money fast Hid away in the house ,  - -  two mean , Murderous robbers burst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scuffle -- a fall --  An old man 's gasping cry -- and then A woman 's fife-like shriek . ... Three men Splashing by on horseback heard The summons : And in an instant all Sprung to their duty , with scarce a word . And they were in time -- not only to save The lives of the old folks , but to bag Both the robbers , and buck-and-gag And land them safe in the county-jail --  Or , as Aunty said , with a blended awe And subtlety ,  --  " Safe in de calaboose whah De dawgs caint bite ' em ! "  - -  So prevail The faithful !  - -  So had the Lord upheld His servants of both deed and prayer ,  --  HIS the glory unparalleled --  Theirs the reward ,  - -  their every son Free , at last , as the parents were ! And , as the driver ended there In front of the little house , I said , All fervently , " Well done ! well done ! " At which he smiled , and turned his head And pulled on the leaders ' lines and --  " See ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sign ? " And , peering down through these specs of mine On a little , square board-sign , I read : " Stop , traveler , if you think it fit , And quench your thirst for a-fip-and-a-bit . The rocky spring is very clear , And soon converted into beer . " And , though I read aloud , I could Scarce hear myself for laugh and shout Of children -- a glad multitude Of little people , swarming out Of the picnic-grounds I spoke about.  --  And in their rapturous midst , I see Again -- through mists of memory --  A black old Negress laughing up At the driver , with her broad lips rolled Back from her teeth , chalk-white , and gums Redder than reddest red-ripe plums . He took from her hand the lifted cup Of clear spring-water , pure and cold , And passed it to me : And I raised my hat And drank to her with a reverence that My conscience knew was justly due The old black face , and the old eyes , too --  The old black head , with its mossy mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the snows on Alpine hills ; Drank to the old black smile , but yet Bright as the sun on the violet ,  --  Drank to the gnarled and knuckled old Black hands whose palms had ached and bled And pitilessly been worn pale And white almost as the palms that hold Slavery 's lash while the victim 's wail Fails as a crippled prayer might fail.  --  Aye , with a reverence infinite , I drank to the old black face and head --  The old black breast with its life of light --  The old black hide with its heart of gold . HEAT-LIGHTNING There was a curious quiet for a space Directly following : and in the face Of one rapt listener pulsed the flush and glow Of the heat-lightning that pent passions throw Long ere the crash of speech.  - -  He broke the spell --  The host :  - -  The Traveler 's story , told so well , He said , had wakened there within his breast A yearning , as it were , to know the rest --  That all unwritten sequence that the Lord Of Righteousness must write with flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just then it was , his good old mother caught His blazing eye -- so that its fire became But as an ember -- though it burned the same . It seemed to her , she said , that she had heard It was the Heavenly Parent never erred , And not the earthly one that had such grace : " Therefore , my son , " she said , with lifted face And eyes , " let no one dare anticipate The Lord 's intent . While He waits , we will wait " And with a gust of reverence genuine Then Uncle Mart was aptly ringing in --  " ' If the darkened heavens lower , Wrap thy cloak around thy form ; Though the tempest rise in power , God is mightier than the storm ! ' " Which utterance reached the restive children all As something humorous . And then a call For him to tell a story , or to " say A funny piece .

" He had It there in print , and knew all would be glad To hear it rendered by the author . And , All reasons for declining at command Exhausted , the now helpless poet rose And said : " I am discovered , I suppose . Though I have taken all precautions not To sign my name to any verses wrought By my transcendent genius , yet , you see , Fame wrests my secret from me bodily ; So I must needs confess I did this deed Of poetry red-handed , nor can plead One whit of unintention in my crime --  My guilt of rhythm and my glut of rhyme.  --  " Maenides rehearsed a tale of arms , And Naso told of curious metatmurphoses ; Unnumbered pens have pictured woman 's charms , While crazy I 've made poetry on purposes !

" LITTLE JACK JANITOR " And there , in that ripe Summer-night , once more A wintry coolness through the open door And window seemed to touch each glowing face Refreshingly ; and , for a fleeting space , The quickened fancy , through the fragrant air , Saw snowflakes whirling where the roseleaves were , And sounds of veriest jingling bells again Were heard in tinkling spoons and glasses then . Thus Uncle Mart 's old poem sounded young And crisp and fresh and clear as when first sung , Away back in the wakening of Spring When his rhyme and the robin , chorusing , Rumored , in duo-fanfare , of the soon Invading johnny-jump-ups , with platoon On platoon of sweet-williams , marshaled fine To bloomed blarings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moment with " The Noted Traveler . " Then left the room , tripped up the stairs , and then An instant later reappeared again , Bearing a little , lacquered box , or chest , Which , as all marked with curious interest , He gave to the old Traveler , who in One hand upheld it , pulling back his thin Black lustre coat-sleeves , saying he had sent Up for his " Magic Box , " and that he meant To test it there -- especially to show The Children . " It is empty now , you know . "  --  He humped it with his knuckles , so they heard The hollow sound --  " But lest it be inferred It is not really empty , I will ask Little Jack Janitor , whose pleasant task It is to keep it ship-shape . " Then he tried And rapped the little drawer in the side , And called out sharply " Are you in there , Jack ? " And then a little , squeaky voice came back ,  --  " Of course I 'm in here -- ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Traveler leisurely Felt through his pockets , and at last took out The smallest key they ever heard about !  --  It , was n't any longer than a pin : And this at last he managed to fit in The little keyhole , turned it , and then cried , " Is everything swept out clean there inside ? " " Open the drawer and see !  - -  Do n't talk to much ; Or else , " the little voice squeaked , " talk in Dutch --  You age me , asking questions ! " Then the man Looked hurt , so that the little folks began To feel so sorry for him , he put down His face against the box and had to frown.  --  " Come , sir ! " he called ,  --  " no impudence to me !  --  You 've swept out clean ? " " Open the drawer and see ! " And so he drew the drawer out : Nothing there , But just the empty drawer , stark and bare . He shoved it back again , with a shark click. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-snap it -- quick !  --  You 've got my nose pinched in the crack ! " And then The frightened man drew out the drawer again , The little voice exclaiming , " Jeemi-nee !  --  Say what you want , but please do n't murder me ! " " Well , then , " the man said , as he closed the drawer With care , " I want some cotton-batting for My supper ! Have you got it ? " And inside , All muffled like , the little voice replied , " Open the drawer and see ! " And , sure enough , He drew it out , filled with the cotton stuff . He then asked for a candle to be brought And held for him : and tuft by tuft he caught And lit the cotton , and , while blazing , took It in his mouth and ate it , with a look Of purest satisfaction . " Now , " said he , " I 've eaten the drawer empty , let me see What this is in my mouth : " And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of narrow silken ribbons , every hue And tint ;  - -  and crisp they were and bright and new As if just purchased at some Fancy-Store . " And now , Bub , bring your cap , " he said , " before Something might happen ! " And he stuffed the cap Full of the ribbons . " There , my little chap , Hold tight to them , " he said , " and take them to The ladies there , for they know what to do With all such rainbow finery ! " He smiled Half sadly , as it seemed , to see the child Open his cap first to his mother ..... There Was not a ribbon in it anywhere ! " Jack Janitor ! " the man said sternly through The Magic Box --  " Jack Janitor , did you Conceal those ribbons anywhere ? " " Well , yes , " The little voice piped --  " but you 'd never guess The place I hid ' em if you 'd guess a year ! " " Well , wo n't you tell me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice , " and make Me first do something for the Children 's sake . " " Well , then , fill up the drawer , " the Traveler said , " With whitest white on earth and reddest red !  --  Your terms accepted -- Are you satisfied ? " " Open the drawer and see ! " the voice replied . " Why , bless my soul ! "  - -  the man said , as he drew The contents of the drawer into view --  " It 's level-full of candy !  - -  Pass it ' round --  Jack Janitor sha n't steal that , I 'll be bound ! "  --  He raised and crunched a stick of it and smacked His lips.  --  " Yes , that is candy , for a fact !  --  And it 's all yours ! " And how the children there Lit into it !  - -  O never anywhere Was such a feast of sweetness ! " And now , then , " The man said , as the empty drawer again Slid to its place , he bending over it ,  --  " Now , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , tell Us where you hid the ribbons -- ca n't you ? " " Well , " The squeaky little voice drawled sleepily --  " Under your old hat , maybe.  - -  Look and see ! " All carefully the man took off his hat : But there was not a ribbon under that.  --  He shook his heavy hair , and all in vain The old white hat -- then put it on again : " Now , tell me , honest , Jack , where did you hide The ribbons ? " " Under your hat " the voice replied  --  " Mind ! I said ' under ' and not ' in ' it.  - -  Wo n't You ever take the hint on earth ? or do n't You want to show folks where the ribbons at ?  --  Law ! but I 'm sleepy !  - -  Under - -  unner your hat ! " Again the old man carefully took off The empty hat , with an embarrassed cough , Saying , all gravely to the children : " You Must promise not to laugh -- you 'll all want to --  When you see where Jack Janitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My feelings.  - -  But no matter !  - -  Know the worst --  Here are the ribbons , as I feared at first . "  --  And , quick as snap of thumb and finger , there The old man 's head had not a sign of hair , And in his lap a wig of iron-gray Lay , stuffed with all that glittering array Of ribbons ... " Take ' em to the ladies -- Yes . Good-night to everybody , and God bless The Children . " In a whisper no one missed The Hired Man yawned : " He 's a vantrilloquist " * * * * * So gloried all the night Each trundle-bed And pallet was enchanted -- each child-head Was packed with happy dreams . And long before The dawn 's first far-off rooster crowed , the snore Of Uncle Mart was stilled , as round him pressed The bare arms of the wakeful little guest That he had carried home with him ....
