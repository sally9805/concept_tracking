REMINISCENCES OF JULIA WARD HOWE . II . LITERARY AND SOCIAL NEW YORK , 1830-1840 . ALTHOUGH the New York of my youth had little claim to be recognized as a literary centre , it yet was a city whose tastes and manners were much influenced by people of culture . One of these , Robert Sands , was the author of a poem entitled Yamoyden , its theme being an Indian story or legend . His family dated back to the Sands who once owned a considerable part of Block Island , and from whom Sands Point takes its name . If I do not mistake , they were connected by marriage with one of my ancestors , who were also settlers in Block Island . I remember having seen the poet Sands in my childhood , - a rather awkward , near-sighted man . His life was not a long one . A sister of his , Julia Sands , wrote a biographical sketch of her brother , and was spoken of as a literary woman . It must have been in the twenties that James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodical called Salmagundi . The motto of this announced its character and intention - " In hoc est hoax , cum quiz et jokeses , Et roastum , toastum , boilum folkses . " William Cullen Bryant took a prominent part in politics , but mingled little in general society , being much absorbed in his duties as editor of The Evening Post , of which he was also the founder . I first heard of Fitz-Greene Halleck as the author of various satirical pieces of verse relating to personages and events of nearly eighty years ago . He is now best remembered by his Marco Bozzaris , a noble lyric , which we have heard quoted in view of recent lamentable encounters between Greeks and barbarians . Among the lecturers who visited New York I recall Professor Silliman of Yale College ; Dr. Follen , who spoke of German literature ; George Combe and Sir Charles Lyell . Charles King , for many years editor of a daily paper entitled The New York American , was a man of much literary taste . He had been a pupil at Harrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciative friend of my father , although as convivial in his tastes as my father was the reverse . One evening when a temperance meeting was going on in one of our large parlors Mr. King called , and , finding my father thus engaged , began to frolic with us young people . He even dared to say , " Now I should like to open those folding doors just wide enough to fire off a bottle of champagne at those temperance people . " He was the patron of my early literary ventures , and kindly allowed my fugitive pieces to appear in his paper . He always advocated the abolition of slavery , and could never forgive Henry Clay his part in effecting the Missouri Compromise , confirming the rights of slaveholders below Mason and Dixon 's line . He and his brother James , my father 's junior partner , were sons of Rufus King , who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence . I was a child of perhaps eight years when I heard my elders say with regret that " old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Charles King became president of Columbia College , which then , with the homes of its officers , occupied the greater part of Park Place . Its professors were well known in society , and the college was very conservative in its management . The professor of mathematics , when he was asked one day by one of his class whether the sun did not really stand still in answer to the prayer of Joshua , laughed at the ques // tion , and was in consequence reprimanded by the faculty . Professor Anthon , of the college , became known through his school and college editions of many Latin classics . Professor Morse , in the department of Hellenics , was popular among the undergraduates , - partly , it was said , on account of his very indulgent method of conducting examinations . Professor MacVickar , in the chair of philosophy , was one of the early admirers of Ruskin . The families of these gentlemen mingled a good deal in the society of the time , and contributed , no doubt , to impart to it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forties the sons of the best families were usually sent to Columbia College . My own brothers , three in number , were among its graduates . New York parents in those days looked upon Harvard as a Unitarian institution , and shunned its influence for their children . The venerable Lorenzo Da Ponte was for many years a resident of New York , and a teacher of the Italian language and literature . When Dominick Lynch introduced the first opera troupe to the New York public , some time in the twenties , the audience must surely have comprised some of the old man 's pupils well versed in the language of the librettos . In earlier life he had furnished the text of several of Mozart 's operas , among them Don Giovanni and Le Nozze di Figaro . Charles Augustus Davis , the author of Jack Downing 's Letters , was a gentleman well known in the New York society of my youth . The letters in question contained imaginary reports of a tour which the writer professed to have made with General Jackson , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were very popular at the time , but have long since passed into oblivion . In one of them Major Downing describes an occasion on which it was important that the general should interlard his address with a few Latin quotations . Not possessing any learning of that kind , he concluded his speech with , " E pluribus unum , gentlemen , sine qua non . " The great literary boast of the city , at the time of which I speak , was undoubtedly Washington Irving . I was still a child in the nursery when I heard of his return to America , after a residence of some years in Spain . A public dinner was given in honor of this event . One of the guests told of Mr. Irving 's embarrassment when he was called upon for a speech . He rose , waved his hand in the air , and could only utter a few sentences , which were heard with difficulty . Many years after this time , I was present , with other ladies , at a public dinner given in honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ladies were not bidden to the feast , but were allowed to occupy a small anteroom which , through an open door , commanded a view of the tables . When the speaking was about to begin , a message came suggesting that we should take possession of some vacant seats at the great table . This we were glad to do . Washington Irving was president of the evening , and upon him devolved the duty of inaugurating the proceedings by an address of welcome to the distinguished guest . People who sat near me whispered , " He 11 break down , - he always does . " Mr. Irving rose and uttered a sentence or two . His friends interrupted him by applause , which was intended to encourage him , but which entirely overthrew his selfpossession . He hesitated , stammered , and sat down , saying , " I can not go on . " It was an embarrassing and painful moment , but Mr. John Duer , an eminent lawyer , caine to his friend 's assistance , and with suitable remarks proposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded . This he did in his happiest manner , covering Mr. Irving 's defeat by a glowing eulogy of his literary merits . " Whose books do I take to bed with me , night after night ? Washington Ir // ving 's , as one who is present can testify . " This one was evidently Mrs. Dickens , who was seated beside me . Mr. Dickens proceeded to speak of international copyright , saying that the prime object of his visit to America was the promotion of this important measure . I met Washington Irving several times at the house of John Jacob Astor . He was silent in general company , and usually fell asleep at the dinner table . This occurrence was , indeed , so common with him that the other guests noticed it only with a smile . After a nap of some ten minutes he would open his eyes and take part in the conversation , apparently unconscious of having been asleep . In his youth Mr. Irving had traveled extensively in Europe . While in Rome he had received marked attention from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , the opera , and so on . He was at a loss to account for this , until his last visit to the bank , when Torlonia , taking him aside , said , " Pray tell me , is it not true that you are a grandson of the great Washington ? " Mr. Irving in early life had given offense to the descendants of old Dutch families in New York by the publication of Knickerbocker 's History of New York , in which he had presented some of their forbears in a humorous light . The solid fame which he acquired in later days effaced the remembrance of this old-time grievance , and in the days in which I had the pleasure of his acquaintance he held an enviable position in the esteem and affection of the community . He always remained a bachelor , owing , it was said , to an attachment the object of which had been removed by death . I have even heard that the lady in question was a beautiful Jewess , the same one whom Walter Scott has depicted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued prosperity of France under varying forms of government is due to the fact that the municipal administration of the country is not affected by these changes , but continues much the same under king , emperor , and republican president . I find something analogous to this in the permanence of certain underlying tendencies in the society of New York , despite the continual variations which diversify the surface of the domain of fashion . The earliest social function which I remember is a ball given by my parents when I must have been about four yei*rs of age . Quite late in the evening I was taken out of bed and arrayed in an embroidered cambric slip . Some one tried to fasten a pink rosebud on the waist of my dress , but did not succeed to her mind . I was brought into the drawingrooms , which had undergone a surprising transformation . The floors were bare , and from the ceiling of either room was suspended a circle of wax lights and artificial flowers . The orchestra included a double bass . I surveyed the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa , where one of the dowagers fed me with ice cream . This entertainment took place at our house on Bowling Green , a neighborhood which has long been given up to business . In the days of my childhood silver forks were in use at dinner parties , though on ordinary occasions we used the three-pronged steel fork , which is now rarely seen . My father sometimes admonished my maternal grandmother not to put her knife into her mouth , but in her youth every one had used the knife in this way . Meats were carefully roasted in what was called a tin kitchen , before an open fire . Desserts 6n state occasions consisted of pastry , wine jelly , and blanc mange , with pyramids of ice cream , which was always supplied by a French resident , Jean Contoit by name , whose very modest garden long continued to be the only place at which such a dainty could be obtained . It may have been M. Contoit who , speaking to a compatriot of his first days in America , said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people cooked vegetables with water only , and the calf 's head was thrown away . The ladies of that period wore white cambric gowns , finely embroidered , in winter as well as in summer , and walked abroad in thin morocco slippers . Pelisses were worn in cold weather , often of some bright color , rose pink or blue . I have found in a family letter of that time the following description of a bride 's toilet : " Miss E. was married in a frock of white merino , with a full suit of steel , comb , ear-rings , and so on . " I once heard Mrs. William Astor , n*e Armstrong , tell of a pair of brides , twin sisters , who appeared at church dressed in pelisses of white merino trimmed with chinchilla , with caps of the same fur . They were much admired at the time . Among the festivities of old New York the observance of New Year 's Day held an important place . In every house of any pretension the ladies of the family sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentlemen of their acquaintance made short visits , during which wine and rich cakes were offered . It was allowable to call as early as ten o'clock in the morning , but the visitor sometimes did little more than appear and disappear , hastily muttering something about the " compliments of the season . " The gentlemen prided themselves upon the number of visits paid , the ladies upon the number received . Girls at school vexed one another with emulative boasting . " We had fifty callers on New Year 's Day . " " Oh ! but we had sixty-five . " This perfunctory performance grew very tedious by the time that the calling hours were ended , but apart from this the day was one on which families were greeted by distant relatives rarely seen , while old friends met and revived their pleasant memories . In our house the rooms were all thrown open , and bright fires burned in the grates . My father , after his adoption of temperance principles , forbade the offering of wine to visitors , and ordered it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were rather chagrined , but his will was law . I recall a New Year 's Day , early in the thirties , on which a yellow chariot stopped before our door . A stout elderly gentleman descended from it , and came in to pay his compliments to my father . This gentleman was John Jacob Astor , who was already known to be possessed of great wealth . The pleasant custom just described was said to have originated with the Dutch settlers of the olden time . As the city grew in size , it became difficult and wellnigh impossible for gentlemen to make the necessary number of visits . Finally , a number of young men of the city took it upon themselves to call in squads at houses which they had no right to molest , consuming the refreshments provided for other guests , and making themselves disagreeable in various ways . This offense against good manners led to the discontinuance , by common consent , of the New Year 's receptions . Mrs. Jameson 's visit to the United States in the year 1835 gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady and author . I was then a girl of sixteen summers , but I had read The Diary of an Ennuy6e , which first brought Mrs. Jameson into literary prominence . I afterward read with avidity the two later volumes in which she gives so good an account of modern art works in Europe . In these she speaks with enthusiasm of certain frescoes in Munich , which I was sorry , many years later , to be obliged to consider less remarkable than her description of them had warranted me in supposing . When I perused these works , having myself no practical knowledge of art , their graphic style gave me a vision of the things described . The beautiful Pinakothek and Glyptothek of Munich became to me as if I actually saw them ; and when it was // my good fortune to visit them , I seemed , especially in the case of the marbles , to meet with old friends . Mrs. Jameson ' s connoisseurship was not limited to pictorial and sculptural art ; she Was passionately fond of music , also . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composer Wieck in his German home . In this she mentions his daughter Clara , and her lover , young Schumann . Clara Wieck became well known in Europe as a pianist of eminence , and of Schumann as a composer there is now no need to speak . There were various legends regarding Mrs. Jameson 's private history . It was said that her husband , marrying her against his will , parted from her at the church door , and thereafter left England for Canada , where he was residing at the time of her visit . I first met her at an evening party at the house of a friend . I was invited to make some music , and sang , among other things , a brilliant bravura air from Semiramide . When I would have left the piano Mrs. Jameson came to me and said , " Altrct cosa , my dear . " My voice bad been cultivated with care , and though not of great power was considered pleasing in quality , and was certainly very flexible . I met Mrs. Jameson at several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle height and red blonde in color ; her face was not handsome , but sensitive and sympathetic in expression , and her want of taste in dress somewhat scandalized the elegant dames of New York . I actually heard one of them say , " How like the devil she does look ! " After a winter passed in Canada , Mrs. Jameson again visited New York , on her way to England . She called upon me one day with a friend , and asked to see my father 's pictures . Two of these , portraits of Charles I. and his queen , were supposed to be by Vandyke , but Mrs. Jameson doubted their genuineness . She spoke of her intimacy with the celebrated Mrs. Somerville , and said , " I think of her as a dear little woman who is very fond of drawing . " When I went to return her visit , I found her engaged in earnest conversation with a son of Sir James Mackintosh . When he had taken leave she said to me , " Mr. Mackintosh and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could learn , their dispute related to democratic forms of government and the society therefrom resulting , which he viewed with favor and she with bitter dislike . I inquired about her winter in Canada . She replied , " As the Irishman said , I had everything that a pig could want . " Soon after this time her volume entitled Winter Studies and Summer Rambles appeared ; her work on Sacred and Legendary Art and her Legends of the Madonna were not published , however , until after a long interval of time . My first peep at the gay world in grownup days was at a dinner party given by the lady mentioned above , a daughter of General Armstrong married to the eldest son of the original John Jacob Astor . Mrs. Astor was a person of very elegant taste . She had received a part of her education in Paris at the time when her father represented our government at the court of France , and her notions of propriety in dress were stringent . According to these , jewels were not to be worn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he avoided . Much that is in favor to-day would have been ruled out by her as inadmissible . At the dinner of which I speak the ladies were in evening dress , which in those days did not exceed modest limits . One pretty married lady wore a white turban , which was much admired . Another lady was adorned with a coronet of fine stone cameos , which has recently been presented to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts by a surviving member of her family . My head was dressed for this occasion by Martel , a dainty half Spanish or French octoroon , endowed with exquisite taste , a ready wit , and a saucy tongue . He was // the Figaro of the time , and his droll sayings were often quoted among his lady customers . The hair was then worn low at the back of the head , woven into elaborate braids and darkened with French pomade , and upon the forehead , or just above it , there was usually an ornament called a fe'roni*re . This was sometimes a string of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gold chain or hand ornamented with a jewel . The fashion , white it prevailed , was so general that evening dress was scarcely considered complete without it . Not long after the dinner party just mentioned my eldest brother married the eldest daughter of the Astor family . I officiated at the wedding as first bridesmaid , the others being a sister of the bride and one of my own sisters . The bride wore a dress of rich white silk , and was coifed with a scarf of some precious lace in lieu of a veil . On her forehead shone a diamond star , the gift of her grandfather , Mi ' . John Jacob Astor . The bridesmaids ' dresses were of white moire , then a material of the newest vogue . I had begged my father to give me a f6roni*re for this occasion , and he had presented me with a very pretty string of pearls , with a pearl pansy and drop in the centre . This fashion , I afterward learned , was ill suited to the contour of my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort of supposing that I looked uncommonly well . The ceremony took place in the evening , at the house of the bride 's parents , and an elaborate supper was afterward served , at which the first groomsman proposed the health of the bride and groom , which was drunk , I remember , without response . A wedding journey was not a sine qua non in those days , but a wedding reception was usual . In this instance it took the form of a brilliant ball , every guest being in turn presented to the bride . On the floor of the ballroom a floral design had been traced in colored chalks . The evening was at its height when my father gravely admonished me that it was time to go home ; and since paternal authority was without appeal , in those days , I sadly withdrew . In my character of bridesmaid , I was allowed to attend one or two of the entertainments given in honor of this marriage . The gayeties of New York were then limited to balls , dinners , and evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imported , until a much later period . A very few extra e'le'gantes received on stated afternoons . A dear uncle of mine , taking up a card left for me , with the inscription , " Mrs. S. at home on Thursday afternoons , " remarked , " At home on Thursday afternoons ? I am glad to learn that she is so domestic . " This lady , who was a leading personage in the social world , used also to receive privileged friends one evening in the week , when she served only a cup of chocolate and some cakes or biscuits . Young as my native city was in my youth , it still retained some fossils of an earlier period . Conspicuous among these were two sisters , of whom the elder had been a recognized beauty and belle at the time of the war of independence . Miss Charlotte White was what was called " a character " in those days . She was tall and of commanding figure , and was always attired after an ancient fashion , but with great care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in company with a lady friend much inclined to embonpoint . The lady 's name was Euphemia , and Miss White addressed her thus : " Feme , thou female Falstaff . " She took some notice of me , and began to talk of the gayeties of her youth , and especially of a ball given at Newport during the war , at which she had received special attention . " I was unwilling , " she said , " to have my hair , which was the finest I ever saw , touched by a hairdresser . It was considered necessary , however , and I consented . " I can not now remember the // names of the distinguished officers with whom she had danced , though they impressed me at the time . On returning the visit we found the sisters in the quaintest little sitting-room imaginable , the floor covered with a green Brussels carpet that had a medallion of flowers in the centre , evidently woven to order and in one piece . The furniture was of enameled whitewood , and we were entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of lightning , and had devised a curious little refuge to which she always betook herself when a thunderstorm appeared imminent . This was a wooden platform standing on glass feet , with a seat and a silken canopy ; the latter the good lady drew closely around her , remaining thus enveloped until the dreaded danger was past . My father sometimes endeavored to overcome my fear of lightning by taking me up to the cupola of our house and bidding me admire the beauty of the storm . Wishing to impress upon me the absurdity of giving way to fear , he told me of a lady whom he had known in his youth , who , being overtaken by a thunderstorm at a place of public resort , so lost her head that she seized the wig of a gentleman standing near her and waved it wildly in the air , to his great wrath and discomfiture . I am sorry to say that this dreadful warning provoked my laughter , but did not increase my courage . My brother and his bride came to reside with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often visited the Astor mansion , which was made delightful by good taste , good manners , and hospitable entertainments . Mr. William B. Astor , the head of the family , was a rather shy and silent man . He had received the best education that a German university could offer . The Chevalier Bunsen had been his tutor , and Schopenhauer , then a student at the same university , had been his friend . He had a love for letters , and might perhaps have followed his natural leaning to advantage had he not become his father 's man of business , and thus been forced to devote much of his life to the management of the great estate . At the time of which I speak he resided on the unfashionable side of Broadway , not far below Canal Street . I was often invited to the house of his father , Mr. John Jacob Astor , - a house which the old gentleman had built for himself , situated on Broadway , between Prince and Spring streets . Adjoining it was one he had built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of music , and sometimes engaged the services of a professional pianist . I remember that he was much pleased at recognizing , one evening , the strains of a brilliant waltz , of which he said , " I heard it at a fair in Switzerland , years ago . The Swiss women were whirling round in their red petticoats . " On another occasion we sang the well-known song Am Rhein , and Mr. Astor , who was very stout and infirm of person , rose and stood beside the piano , joining with the singers . " Am Rhein , am Rhein , da wachset siisses Le-ben , " he sang , instead of " unsrer Leben . " My sister-in-law , Emily Astor Ward , was gifted with a voice whose unusual power and beauty had been enhanced by careful training . We sometimes sang together or separately at old Mr. Astor 's musical parties , and at one of them he said to us , as we stood together , " You are my singing birds . " Of our two repertoires , mine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs , while she sang mostly operatic music ; the rich volume of her voice , however , carried her hearers quite away . Her figure and carriage were fine , and in her countenance beauty of expression lent a great charm to features which in themselves were not handsome . The presence of the opera in New York had // done much to create a taste for Italian , and especially for operatic music . One or two of the artists who accompanied Garcia 's troupe remained in the city after his departure , and found occupation in cultivating the voices of amateur singers . Garcia 's eldest daughter , the signorina so much admired in her early performances , had married a French resident of New York , Malibran by name . He was supposed to be very rich , but went into bankruptcy soon after his marriage , and his young wife was obliged to work for her own support . She gave singing lessons in families , and sang in the choir of Grace Church , which was then by far the best in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John Henry Hobart , Bishop of New York , then recently deceased . A soprano solo was introduced , of which the words were , " When the eye saw him , it blessed him , and when the ear heard him , it gave witness of him . " A female voice , rich , powerful wonderful , seemed to fill the building with pathetic melody . Every heart was thrilled , and those who listened whispered , " Malibran . " Although the elder Astor had led a life mainly devoted to business interests , he found great pleasure in the society of literary men . Fitz-Greene Halleck and Washington Irving were among his familiar visitors , and he conceived so high a regard for Dr. Cogswell , the founder and former principal of Round Hill School , as to insist upon his becoming one of his household . Dr. Cogswell made his home with us for some years after the closing of his famous school , but finally went to reside with Mr. Astor , attracted partly by the latter 's promise to endow a public library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after some delay , and the doctor was for many years director of the Astor Library . He used to relate some humorous anecdotes of excursions which he made with Mr. Astor . In the course of one of these the two gentlemen took supper together at a hotel recently opened . Mr. Astor remarked , " This man will never succeed . " " Why not ? " inquired the other . " Do n't you see , " replied the financier , " what large lumps of sugar he puts in the sugar-bowl ? " As they were walking slowly to a pilot boat which the old gentleman had chartered for a trip down the harbor , Dr. Cogswell said , " Mr. Astor , I have just been calculating that this boat costs you twenty-five cents a minute . " Mr. Astor immediately hastened his pace , reluctant to waste so much money . In his own country Mr. Astor had been a member of the German Lutheran Church . He once mentioned this fact to a clergyman who called on him in the interest of some charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do good which his great fortune gave him . " Ah ! " said Mr. Astor , " the disposition to do good does not always increase with the means . " In the last years of his life he was afflicted with insomnia , and Dr. Cogswell often sat with him through a large part of the night ; the coachman , William , being also in attendance . In these sleepless nights his mind appeared to be much exercised with regard to a future state . On one occasion , when the doctor had done his best to expound the theme of immortality , Mr. Astor suddenly said to his servant , " William , where do you expect to go when you die ? " The man replied , " Why , sir , I always expected to go where the other people went . " The house of my young-ladyhood was situated at the corner of Bond Street and Broadway . When my father built it , the fashion of the city had not proceeded so far up town . The model of the house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study occupied the first floor . These were furnished with curtains of blue , yellow , and red silk . The red room was that in which 45 // we took our meals . The blue room was the one in which we received visits and passed the evenings . The yellow room was thrown open only on high occasions , but my desk and grand piano were placed in it , and I was allowed to occupy it at will . This and the blue room were adorned with beautiful sculptured mantelpieces , the work of Thomas Crawford , afterward known as a sculptor of great merit . Many years after this time he became the husband of the sister next me in age , and the father of F. Marion Crawford , the now celebrated novelist . Our family was patriarchal in its dimensions . The aunt who had taken my dear mother 's place lived with us thenceforth . She had married the young physician of whom my father was so fond . Their children , born in our house , were very dear to him . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two younger brothers , Henry and Marion , were at home with us after a term of years at Round Hill School . My eldest brother , Samuel ( the Sam Ward of the Lobby ) , was sent to Europe immediately after graduating from Columbia College . He had shown an unusual aptitude for mathematics , and it was hoped that he would become eminent as a scientist . His residence in Europe , however , was not strictly devoted to mathematical studies . He returned home after an absence of some years , speaking French and German with fluency , - a most accomplished and agreeable young man . He had been permitted to collect a noble library , and my father , having added to his large house a spacious art gallery , added to this a study whose walls were entirely occupied by my brother 's books . I had free access to them , and did not neglect to profit by it . From what I have said it may rightly be inferred that my father was a man of fine tastes , inclined to generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best educational opportunities , the best and most expensive mas ters . He filled his art gallery with the finest pictures that money could command in the New York of that day . He gave largely to public undertakings , and was one of the founders of the New York University and one of the foremost promoters of church building in the then distant West . He relucted only at expenses connected with dress and fashionable entertainment , for he always disliked and distrusted the great world . Our way of living was simple ; though the table was abundantly supplied , it was not with  --  the richest food , and for many years no alcoholic stimulant appeared on it . My father gave away by dozens the bottles of costly wine stored in his cellar , but neither tasted it nor allowed us to do so . He was for a great part of his life a martyr to rheumatic gout , and a witty friend of his once said , " Ward , it must be the poor man 's gout that you have , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter , at half past seven in the summer . My father read prayers before breakfast and before bedtime . If my brothers lingered over the morning meal , he would come in , hatted and booted for the day , and would say , " Young gentlemen , I am glad that you can afford to take life so easily ! I am old and must work for my living , " - a speech which broke up our coterie . Dinner was served at four o'clock , - a light lunch abbreviating the fast for those at home , - and at half past seven we sat down to tea , a meal of which toast , preserves , and cake formed the staple . In the evening we usually sat together , with books and needlework , often with an interlude of music . An occasional lecture , concert , or evening party varied this routine . My brothers went much into fashionable society , but my own participation in its doings came only after my father 's death , and after the two years ' mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed it . He had retained the Puritan feeling with regard to Saturday evening , // and would remark that it was not a proper evening for company , but a time of preparation for the exercises of the day following , the order for which was very strict . We were indeed indulged on Sunday morning with coffee and muffins at breakfast , but , besides the morning and afternoon services at church , we young folks were expected to attend the two meetings of the Sunday school . We were supposed to read only Sunday books , and I must here acknowledge my indebtedness to Mrs. Sherwood , an English writer now almost forgotten , whose religious stories and romances were supposed to come under this head . In the evening we sang hymns , and sometimes received a quiet visitor . My readers may ask whether this restricted routine satisfied my mind , and whether I was at all sensible of the privileges which I really enjoyed or ought to have enjoyed . I must own now that , after my schooldays , I warmly coveted an enlargement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be counted among fashionables , but I did aspire to much greater freedom of association than was allowed me . I lived , indeed , much in my books , and my sphere of thought was a good deal enlarged by the foreign literatures , German , French , and Italian , with which I became familiar . Yet I seemed to myself like a young damsel of olden time , shut up within an enchanted castle , and I must say that my dear parent , with all his noble generosity and overweening affection , sometimes appeared to me as my jailer . My brother 's return from Europe and his subsequent marriage opened the door a little for me . It was through his intervention that Mr. Longfellow first visited us , to become a valued and lasting friend . Through him , in turn , we formed an acquaintance with Professor Felton , Charles Sumner , and Dr. Howe . My brother was very fond of music , of which he had heard the best in Paris and in Germany . He often arranged musical parties at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Schubert were given . His wit , social talent , and literary taste unfolded a new world to me , and enabled me to share some of the best results of his long residence in Europe . My father 's extremely jealous care of us was by no means the result of a disposition tending to social exclusiveness . It proceeded , on the contrary , from an over-anxiety concerning the moral and religious influences to which his children might become subjected . His ideas of propriety were very strict . He was , moreover , not only a strenuous Protestant , but also an ardent Evangelical , holding the Calvinistic views which then characterized that portion of the Episcopal Church in America . I remember that he once spoke to me of the anguish he had felt at the death of his own father , of the orthodoxy of whose religious opinions he had had no sufficient assurance . My grandfather , indeed , was supposed in the family to be of a rather skeptical and philosophizing turn of mind . He fell a victim to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain austerity of character , my father was greatly beloved and honored in the business world . He did much to give to the firm of Prime , Ward &amp; King the high position which it attained and retained during his lifetime . He told me once that when he first entered the office , he found it , like many others , a place where gossip circulated freely . He determined to put an end to this , and did so . Among the foreign correspondents of his firm were the Barings of London , and Hottinguer &amp; Cie of Paris . In the great financial trouble which followed Andrew Jackson 's overthrow of the Bank of the United States , several states became bankrupt , and repudiated the obligations incurred by their bonds , to the exceeding indignation of business people in both hemispheres . Time state of New York was // at one time on the verge of pursuing this course , which my father strenuously opposed . He called meeting after meeting , and was unwearied in his efforts to induce the financiers of the state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook that his firm should negotiate with English correspondents a loan to carry the state over the period of doubt and difficulty . This he was able to effect . My eldest brother came home one day and said to me , " As I walked up from Wall Street to-day , I saw a dray loaded with kegs on which were inscribed the letters P. W. &amp; K. ' " Those kegs contained the gold just sent to the firm from England , to help our state through this crisis . My father once gave me some account of his early experiences in Wall Street . He had been sent , almost a boy , to New York , to try his fortune . His connection with Block Island families , through his grandmother , Catherine Ray Greene , had probably aided in securing for him a clerk 's place in the banking house of Prime &amp; Sands , afterward Prime , Ward &amp; King . He soon ascertained that the Spanish dollars brought to the port by foreign trading vessels could be sold in Wall Street at a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those coins , which he carried to Wall Street and there sold . This was the beginning of his fortune . A work published a score or more of years since , entitled The Merchant Princes of Wall Street , concluded a sketch of my father with the statement that he died without fortune . This was far from true . His death came indeed at a very critical moment , when , on account of extensive investments in real estate , his skill would have been requisite to carry this extremely valuable property over a time of great financial disturbance . His brother , our uncle , who became the guardian of our interests , was familiar with the stock market , but little versed in real estate transactions . By forced and untimely sales , much of the valuable estate was scattered . Yet it gave to each of my father 's six children a fair inheritance for that time ; for the millionaire fever did not break out until long afterward . The death of this dear and noble parent took place when I was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I attained the period of legal responsibility ; but before this a new sense of the import of life had begun to alter the current of my thoughts . With my father 's death came to me a realization of my lamentable insensibility to his great kindness , and of my ingratitude for the many comforts and advantages which his affection had secured to me . He had given me the most delightful home , the most careful training , the best masters and books . He had eveim built a picture gallery for my especial instruction and enjoyment . All this I had taken as a matter of course and as my natural right . He had done his best to keep me out of frivolous society , and had been extremely strict about the visits of young men to the house . Once , when I expostulated with him upon these points , he told me that he had early recognized in me a temperament and an imagination oversensitive to impressions from without , and that his wish had been to guard me from exciting influences until I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was hardly to be expected that a girl in her teens , or just out of them , should acquiesce in this restrictive guardianship , tender and benevolent as was its intention . My little acts of rebellion were met with considerable severity , but I now recall my father 's admonitions as " soft rebukes in blessings ended . "
