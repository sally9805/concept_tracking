txt Y this time , the latter part of 1806 , Captain Hathaway received letters and invoices from Providence , B. I. , from the owners and underwriters of a bark bound from St. Petersburg to Providence , B. I. , with a cargo of hemp , iron , Russian sail duck , and sheeting of the value of thirty thousand dollars , giving him full powers to reclaim the said vessel and cargo from the Spanish authorities at Baracoa . This vessel and cargo had arrived on the coast during the winter of 1805-6 , but was obliged by the severity of wind and weather to stand to the south , where , several hundred miles east of the British port of Providence , on the Bahama Banks , she fell in with a French privateer , who , on account of the name of Providence , IR . I. , where she was bound , insisted upon it that her papers were spurious and that in reality she was bound to the British port of that name ; for how else could she have been met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of destination , and within a few hundred miles of the British port of the same name ? He consequently declared her a good prize , and took her into Baracoa as the most convenient port , until he could get her regularly condemned at San Domingo , from where he was commissioned . However , the Spanish Government , after investigating her papers and examining the captain and the crew , had their doubts as to the legality of the capture , and took possession of the vessel and cargo , thereby giving both claimants an equal right to repossession . Thus stood the affairs of this vessel and cargo when Captain Hathaway at Santiago received his letters and power of attorney . He did not feel himself sufficiently qualified to contest this claim successfully without assistance , particularly as he was entirely unacquainted with the Spanish and French languages . He consequently made a proposal to me to assist him in this difficult affair being empowered to avail himself of such assistance as he should deem necessary , and offered me one-half of his commission , charging my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as there was no safe or expeditious communication between Santiago and Baracoa by land , we purchased a clinker-built sail-boat , large enough to hold seven or eight persons , in order to go around by sea coastwise , a distance of about one hundred and twenty miles . We hired an experienced pilot ( who served also as interpreter ) and three hands , who , with Captain Hathaway , myself , and a middle-aged French gentleman , who solicited a passage to Baracoa , made seven in number . We had an interview with the Governor at Santiago , to whom we made known our business in the presence of the American Consul , and received from him not alone passports and protection on the coast , but also letters of introduction to Don Bepilado , Governor of Baracoa . Thus furnished we commenced our precarious voyage . I found the boat so small that after the baggage and provisions had been stowed away , and room left for the rowers , there was just space enough left for two to occupy the stern and one narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preference . The weather was fine , and there was so little wind that we were chiefly borne along by rowing . The first and second day and night we passed Cumberland Harbor and Porto Escondido . By the evening // of the third day we were only about twenty miles from Cape Maize , and expected to be by morning at Baracoa . After sundown the wind freshened , but we still kept our course , a few miles from the shore , which is bold and inaccessible for many miles , except some small and hidden inlets among rocks known only to experienced pilots . The wind gradually veered around to the northeast , and increased to such a degree that we could hardly keep the boat free from water , in spite of the cloths we had up on both sides . All idea of reaching Baracoa was given up , and our pilot turned about to reach a harbor . The only one was within ten miles from us , and so small and hidden that it was difficult to find it in broad daylight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and raining hard , the wind increased to a gale , and thus we danced on the billows of the sea like a cockle-shell , our safety depending entirely on the skill and success of our pilot . Thus passed nearly three tedious hours , and we had approached the dark walls of the iron-bound coast so near that I thought we must inevitably be dashed to pieces against them-a thought which was confirmed when I saw our boat suddenly bearing close on to a confused mass of black rocks , by which we seemed for a moment entirely surrounded , but the next moment I found our boat in still water , although I could hear the billows roaring at no great distance . We were in a small cove , sheltered from the sea by rocks , which formed a secure harbor , with a small patch of sandy beach on which we landed and drew our boat ashore . I was so fatigued from want of sleep , my long and cramped position in the boat , augmented by wind , rain , and danger , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the shore , wet as I was , than I wrapped myself in a blanket and lay down under a large tree , where I slept soundly until sunrise . On the following morning , the storm and rain continuing with unabated fury , we made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would admit , and after having enjoyed a hearty meal of such provisions as we had taken with us , we held a general council , in order to adopt such measures as would enable us to reach Baracoa as soon as possible . Our pilot and the other Spaniard assured us that the present storni was likely to continue for a week or two , until the quartering of the moon , and that therefore it would not be possible to reach Baracoa by water until after that event had taken place . They stated that the nearest plantation from where we were was seven miles distant , but that horses and mules could there be obtained to carry us and some necessary baggage across the mountains . Having no other choice we determined that Hathaway , myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plantation , leaving the boat under guard of the other three men . We accordingly started , each armed with a gun or fowling-piece , besides which I myself carried my famous tarantula broadsword . Our wet and dirty garments , our slouched , broad-brimmed sombreros , and our heterogeneous armament no doubt gave us the appearance of a scurvy set of pirates instead of distressed mariners . Thus we walked for an hour or two along the rugged barriers of the seaboard , when we discovered the smoke from a habitation on the other side of the mouth of a small creek . We presently perceived it to be an armed Spanish post , stationed there to prevent smuggling , which was facilitated by a short , sandy beach terminating the inlet to the creek . We had been observed by the garrison , and although at a considerable distance we could plainly perceive that our unexpected appearance had caused alarm , as we saw the soldiers running in and out of the barracks , loading* and priming their guns . When we arrived at the bank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they waved their hands and arms with great violence , indicating to us not to approach any nearer . We , however , had no choice , and tying my handkerchief to a ramrod as a flag of truce we lustily waded through the creek toward the garrison . They were drawn up under arms in rank and file ready for any emergency , and suffered us to approach . To show them our peace-A // able intentions , I had requested my companions to place their guns against some tree or door , in a careless and unpremeditated manner , which I was the * first to do . No sooner had we done so , than the sergeant beckoned us into the guard-house , which we entered , but not before I saw one of the soldiers take up my gun , measure the charge , and blow off the priming . It appeared that the chief officers had gone off on a frolic , and the post was under command of the sergeant . To him our pilot explained our affairs and requested permission to proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was refused until some more satisfactory inquiries had been instituted ; and our pilot offered to proceed to the boat under guard of an armed picket of six men to show them the license and protection of the Governor of Santiago de Cuba , which he had not about him . The sergeant , probably thinking our story might be true , informed us rather politely that we must consider ourselves prisoners until further notice . The whole of these proceedings had something so grotesque and Quixotic on the face of them that it put us into an extravagant good - humor , and we treated the whole affair with mock solemnity . We remained in this condition for several hours , but our own good - humor , supported by our liberal offers for refreshment , soon imparted itself to our guards , and we were served with excellent coffee and cigars . At length we heard a considerable noise on the outside of the barracks , occasioned by the return of the corps of observation , and presently the sergeant and several soldiers entered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us amigos Amencanos and other endearing epithets . Permission to proceed was granted , although with seeming reluctance , by the non-commissioned officer , who doubted his power during the absence of his superiors . He freely opened their stores of provisions especially of liquors , for which we compensated them liberally before we proceeded . This delay made us arrive at the plantation so late that we could not return to the boat until the next morning . We , however , made arrangements and obtained a mule and three horses , first to carry us and our baggage from the boat to the plantation , and subsequently under charge of a guide to proceed to Baracoa . The next day found us mounted , and on our return to the boat for our baggage . The only road we could take passed in the immediate neighborhood of the revenue guards , upon reaching whom we were stopped by the sentinels and ordered , in rather a harsh manner , to appear at head-quarters . We dismounted , and on our way I was astonished and mortified to perceive our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare ground , and confined hands and feet in the stocks . All that I had time to hear was , " Yesterday 's frolic . " It appears that in the evening of that day the captain and lieutenant of the post had returned from their pleasure party and found most of the garrison intoxicated , but especially the sergeant , who had suffered his joy and the spirits to overcome him so far that he could give only a very confused and unsatisfactory account of the proceedings of the day ; hence the punishment we witnessed . Understanding , however , that we were to return , it was no wonder we were detained to afford further information . The captain seemed disposed to be haughty and crabbed ; but , after showing him our papers and explaining to him the whole affair , he suppressed a smile and with assumed gravity reproved us all for bribing the guard to insubordination and unsoldierlike conduct . I knew all the time what he wanted , and after testifying our regret for the occurrence threw out some hints that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's punishment for his civility toward us , we would not hesitate on his release to pay for the trouble and expenses occasioned . This had the desired effect . The poor fellow was released , we paid the consideration , and after very civil treatment during one hour , parted with mutual satisfaction . On our retrfrn , after having left the boat and greater part of our baggage in the care of our pilot and men , with orders to come around to Baracoa as soon as the weath // er should permit , we pushed for the plantation , but did not stop again at the barracks . Travelling in the interior parts of this island , and particularly in the eastern section where we found ourselves , is different from any other that I ever experienced . It is in the highest degree picturesque , laborious , dangerous , and sometimes awful . We had to cross several ridges of cloud-topped mountains and to circumvent others by narrow chasms , following the courses of creeks and runs of water , the tops of whose perpendicular walls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight and converting it into evening gloom . When we were within about a mile of the plantation the boy who had charge of our horses advised us to cross the brow of a steep mountain on foot , while he would lead the horses around . By this we should gain more than half a mile , and stretch our limbs from the fatigue of riding through these awful and dangerous passages . We accordingly commenced our ascent in angles from thirty to forty-five degrees . We at first made rapid progress , but by degrees the atmosphere became so light and our exertions so great that we had to stop every few minutes for want of breath . We were , however , richly recompensed-at least I was-during the moments of rest by the appearance from our lofty perch of the ocean below us . It was cloudy but did not rain , and the mountain above us sheltered us completely from a storm raging below , the effects of which we could plainly perceive on the waters before us , which , although more than three miles distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by the French gentleman , our passenger , who resided in Baracoa and seemed well acquainted with the country , that in clear weather the island of San Domingo , and even Jamaica , are visible from this point . Our route at length took a turn to the right long before we had reached the top of the mountain , but high enough to pass through an electric cloud which rested onits side for several miles like a belt . We could plainly perceive the influence of the electric matter on our clothes and skins , but particularly on our hair , which vibrated up and down without the ap pearance of a breath of wind , and in an entirely different manner . We emerged from this cloud into sunshine , but the scene below us was completely hidden , and we witnessed the rare spectacle of a slight thunderstorm below us . If the travelling in the island of Cuba at that period was difficult , rugged , and dangerous , the manners and mode of life of the inhabitants , especially in the interior , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncultivated . With the exception of their indomitable pride and love of titles and imaginary rank , the people were little elevated above the aborigines . There was no real poverty or distress , for the island produces in abundance everything necessary to sustain life and make it agreeable . The natural disposition to indolence . *nd ease , and the consequent habits descending from father to son , make the people appear to the eye of the stranger both poor and miserable in the midst of plenty . This was the case with the proprietor of the plantation where we had procured the horses and mules . We had not seen one woman since we had left Santiago , nor did we find any in this place . So rude and desolate was this island that we did not encounter one human being on our travels until we arrived in the neighborhood of Baracoa , except the soldiers at the barracks and the family at the farm . The latter consisted of the proprietor , an elderly man , called Don Jos6 , two sons from twelve to sixteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of a tall and rawboned figure , and dressed in the meanest manner ; the sons bareheaded and barefooted , with nothing but a shirt and pantaloons to cover them ; but still in demeanor he was full of mock importance , doing apparently nothing but smoking , eating , drinking , and sleeping , while the boys and slaves gathered the fruits of the earth , raised pigs and poultry , and cooked the meals . The Don was , notwithstanding , sufficiently shrewd to make us pay an exorbitant price for the horses , mules , and guide , knowing that we could not do without them . He stipulated at the same time that our guides-his eldest son and one of the slaves-should be permitted , while giv // ing us convoy , to drive some twenty or thirty pigs to the Baracoa market , a distance of nearly fifty miles . While these preparations were going on , we were detained a day and a half at the farm , and as this was an important , profitable , and unexpected windfall , the Don exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cigars were excellent , and between breakfast and dinner I observed one of the men killing and dressing a very lean pig , the dressing of which particularly engaged my attention . From the fleshy parts , if they deserved that name , he cut the meat from the bones , and the flanks he cut as paper is cut for festoons , so as to make a rope of them , of which he had about twenty yards hung on horizontal poles . The dwelling which this family occupied consisted , like most of those in the interior , of a number of posts and poles firmly lodged in the ground in a spacious circular form , and was covered , at the distance from the ground of about ten feet , with a rude roof , left open in the middle to carry off the smoke which rose from a perpetual fire on a space underneath that served as a kitchen . At the distance of ten or twelve feet from the ground a strong beam was placed horizontally , furnished with iron hooks of several dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron pot , in which were cooked all manner of provisions . Some bags of salt were suspended above the beams to prevent their absorbing the moisture of the rainy season . This rotunda of poles had no walls , but was open like a horse-shed , excepting so much as was partitioned off to form an apology for two small rooms for the Don . The ceiling of these rooms consisted of half-rounded wooden slabs , the flat part underneath and the rounded part forming a garret floor covered with raw oxhides . Knives , forks , and spoons were at this time not yet in use , except among some of the grandees on the seaboard , having been but lately introduced by the French fugitives from San Domingo , and otherwise were only used at the hotels for the accommodation of foreign traders . When dinner-time arrived we all assembled in the large open space under the roof around the lire and the huge iron pot , each providing for himself such materials as would serve him for a temporary seat and table . Hathaway and myself rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our table , and fixed ourselves as we thought very comfortably . Large cocoa-nut shells , with excellent coffee , supported on straw grummets or rings , upholding the round part of the shell , were handed around , and a calabash filled with the contents of the pot was served to each of us with becoming gravity . To hungry persons like ourselves , and not very fastidious , all this would have been very welcome , although the mess was a kind of claret-colored soup seasoned with bananas , Seville oranges , salt , and pepper , enriched with many yards of pork and interspersed with chicken-bones from which the meat had probably dissolved in the boiling . On the whole I thoug.ht the mess savory , and could have enjoyed it had it not been for the constant warfare to which we were driven to keep off the fowls and dogs by which we were surrounded . They pertinaciously disputed every morsel with us , and there were fowls bold and impudent enough to snatch bits from between our fingers while in the act of conveying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to our bedchamber . The steps were nothing but cross - pieces nailed against a perpendicular post , and led to the holes above the two rooms . We were without a light , and creeping under the low roofs felt in vain for some bed or bedding , but found nothing else than the raw ox-hides spread over the round slabs of the floor . Here Captain Hathaway and myself stretched ourselves for repose . Our bones , however , soon began to ache from the effects of the hard and uneven floor , which all our turnings and twistings could only alleviate for a few minutes . Our clothes being still very damp , and the farm being on very elevated ground , we sensibly felt the effects of a cold and chill atmosphere during the night , and I descended our ship-ladder to seek for some covering . Nothing presented itself but some large , dry , palmetto leaves , somewhat in the shape of the lid of a // coffin and long enough to cover one person . Two of these I dragged along to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night - air , though they prevented us from sleeping for some time by the rattling noise they made when we turned over , which was very often . The next morning at daybreak we prepared for a start . The boys had prepared moccasins of twisted straw to protect their feet on the journey , and were busily engaged in yoking the pigs in couples to prevent them from running away , an operation that was conducted under the most awful squealing of the devoted herd , and amid oaths and execrations on the part of the operators . The slave , with our assistance , was busy preparing our horses and loading our mule , while the Don and his younger son were emptying the large iron pot and stowing the contents in water - tight baskets , to form , with fruit and bananas , the stock of our provisions on the road . We at length started , but the progress of the first few miles was exceedingly ludicrous . The pigs , being unwilling to proceed and obstreperous from their constraint , frequently broke their fastenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overtaken , and rebound by the guides , and nothing was heard for hours but a mixture of squealing and Spanish oaths . Some time afterward , however , things became more orderly , and in spite of our disagreeable escort , rain , and awful roads , I had time and took delight in contemplating the novel , majestic , and frequently terrific scenery around me , which it would be very difficult to describe . Suffice it , therefore , to draw a few general but faint outlines . No high roads exist between these mountains and towns , but simply a few mule tracks winding in various gyrations among cliffs and narrow valleys . Their circular and contradictory bends have often to be shortened by crossing almost inaccessible promontories , incapable of being climbed and descended in safety except by these mountain horses and mules . The sagacity and firmness of these animals is so great that on several occasions , when we came to smooth and slippery descents , which in consequence of continued rain afforded no foothold , they would sink , encumbered with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out thus slide down more than fifty yards until they reached a better leveL We followed them in a sitting position , occasionally stopping our career by holding to some shrubs and brushwood in passing . Thus we passed , sometimes for a mile , between chasms of perpendicular rocks in gloomy twilight at noonday , being barely able to see above our heads a streak of blue sky . In one of these places , but of a more extensive magnitude , the perpendicular rocks on our left hand were covered with a multitude of patches of wild honeycomb as far and as high as the eye could reach , until the patches appeared no larger than a pocket-handkerchief , although , to judge from the nearest ones , they could not have been less than from forty to one hundred square yards in extent . This was one of the numerous places with which the island abounds for gathering at the proper seasons vast quantities of honey and beeswax . Our guides informed us that one of the seasons would begin in a couple of months , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty skins , baskets , ladders , ropes , and other instruments to gather the rich product . These expeditions were connected with much risk and personal danger , as hardly any of these combs could be got at except at immense heights and by contriving to reach narrow ledges of perpendicular rocks by means of ropes and baskets . Although the most of these ledges afforded a safe footing when reached , and room enough to operate , the men appeared at the distance below as if suspended against the naked walls . The honeycomb thus obtained is let down by ropes from ledge to ledge , and the mules are constantly going between the places of gathering and the plantations , where it is melted in large caldrons , the wax cast in blocks , and the honey put up in earthen vessels and skins and barrels . Toward evening on the second day of our journey we came in sight of // Baracoa . We were unwilling , as well as ashamed , to enter with our distressed cavalcade and personal appearance , be ing soaked with rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the city passed along the beach near the margin of the sea . Here we halted on the highway , stripped and washed ourselves , and the clothes from our saddle-bags , though far from dry and much crushed and rumpled , had still the advantage of being clean . Thus somewhat remodelled , and after sending our guides and escort of swine by another route , we at length reached the port of our destination and took our lodgings at the house of a French restaurateur . The fatigue and constant exposure to rain for nearly a week had but one disagreeable effect upon me , which , however , wore off in a few days . When I awoke on the following morning I could not open my eyes until after repeated bathing in warm water , the eyelids having become inflamed and glued together during my sleep . Iv . TOWN LIFE AT BARAcoA . As soon as it was practicable we paid a visit to the Governor , Don iRepilado , to present to him our credentials , make him acquainted with the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . I have before observed the primitive manners which at that time still existed in this island even among the Spanish grandees . Our reception was a fair specimen of them . We were ushered into the office of the Governor by his master of ceremonies , a huge black fellow , probably a favorite slave . The Governor himself was an elderly , tall , and weather - beaten man , but still had something stately and very respectable in his appearance . His office looked more like a large cell in one of our prisons than a reception-room , consisting of bare walls , a smooth clay floor , a large old-fashioned table , and three massive chairs . Notwithstanding all this he received us in a friendly and polite manner , conversed with us for nearly an hour in French and Spanish , with the latter of which I was not sufficiently conversant to express myself without the help of the former , and this was the same case with the Governor as regarded the French language . We were in the meantime helped to cigars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very satisfactory and augured well for the success of our cause . We were shortly afterward introduced to the Intendant of the Port , Don Luis Arruiz , a native Spaniard and a man of great worth and amiability . We also made the acquaintance of the Collector of the Port , a ceremonious , stiff , and hightoned Spanish Don , with whom we never got beyond the intercourse of civility . I had subsequently reasons to believe that his friendship leaned somewhat in favor of the captors of our bark . My first endeavor was through the friendship and kind manifestations of Don Luis to engage an able counsellor to conduct our affairs through the intricacies of a Spanish court , and we made him acquainted with every circumstance relative to the captured ship and cargo . Thus we became perfectly initiated in the course of a very few days . There were at that time four or five American vessels in port , the society of whose captains we much enjoyed . The indefatigable Don Luis , to whom I became much attached , introduced Captain Hathaway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our entertainment . Don Luis , a man of not yet forty years , had been in the naval service in Spain , where he was married to the beautiful widow whom Don Delabatt left with an infant daughter . He afterward obtained the post of Intendant at Baracoa , where he had resided a few years when I arrived , at which period his step . daughter , Senorita Dolores Delabatt , had reached her sixteenth or seventeenth year . Her mother , who had married when very young , was still handsome and engaging , but rather enbonpoint . She was lively , fond of company and dancing , extremely well bred , but of a quick temper and of rather a jealous disposition , which sometimes made her un // happy for a brief period . Miss Dolores was a very sensible and well bred young lady , and had received many advantages of education . She was instructed in French , dancing , music , and painting , and was not deficient in history . She possessed an agreeable person , her countenance was intelligent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been so large as to be constantly visible even when she was not speaking . Not that the teeth were misshapen , nay , they were beautiful , but rather that the upper lip was a little too narrow to cover them . Don Luis himself was as sprightly as champagne , a gay Lothario , and ever ready to enjoy good society , but withall dignified , brave , and intelligent . By these means and the natural disposition to sociability , we soon got intimate with all the respectable families of Baracoa , both Spanish and French . The love of social intercourse , music , and dancing , and the primitive habits of the citizens were such that we formed many immediate acquaintances without previous introductions , and often in the course of our walks , where respectable young ladies were assembled at the doors , the liberty of addressing and discoursing with them was not deemed rude , but , on the contrary , ended generally in our being invited into the house to be regaled with songs and tunes on the guitar and frequently invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were common articles which on such occasions were lustily turned by one of the younger brothers . Don Luis gave a ball at his house once every two weeks , and some of the French and Spanish families occasionally returned the compliment . While our occupation and amusements were thus going on , several remarkable occurrences took place in which I had a share , as well at that time as subsequently , and which I therefore have to relate , perhaps , more minutely than I would otherwise have done . Great Britain being at that time ( 1805-6 ) at war with the allies , Spain and France , the government of the island of Cuba was frequently disturbed by predatory English parties , but no serious attempt at a landing on any part of the coast by a British naval force had as yet been apprehended . The alarm , therefore , at Baracoa was very considerable when , early one morning two British frigates were discovered off the coast to the eastward , apparently standing for the harbor . Everybody was instantly on foot . The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then in port , put springs on her cables to command the entrance to the harbor . The fort , on a fiat but elevated piece of ground , formed a crescent of nearly two - thirds of a circle , and protected the harbor on the left and the city and coast on the right , having sixteen pieces of forty - two pound ordnance mounted . This fort had not been regularly manned for a great length of time , but could , if necessary , be supplied with men and ammunition at short notice . To this place Don Luis and some other officers repaired to ascertain if steps more decisive were deemed necessary . Every American citizen in port volunteered his services for the defence of the city , and accompanied Don Luis to the fort . While we were contemplating the manoeuvres , one of the frigates fired several shots in the direction of the fort , which , although quite harmless in consequence of the great distance , terrified the wealthy citizens to such a degree that several made hasty preparations to move their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort , although the fort itself was not manned , were always kept loaded with balls ; and after the first gun was fired from the frigate , Don Luis primed one of them which bore in the direction of the vessel and touched it off with his lighted cigar , coolly observing , " I only want to show the fellows that we are prepared for them . " The garrison of the barracks was by this time getting ready to man the fort ; but before they approached a solemn procession of priests arrived , headed by the Grand Inquisitor . They walked up with much solemnity to the first loaded cannon , and the high - priest , unclasping his mantle , spread it over the touch-hole , I // thereby forbidding any further firing . The effect of this action on the common soldiers and others was electric * - -* and they sank down on their knees . Don Luis and other officers , though obliged to make a slight genuflection , looked daggers and seemed greatly vexed at this interference , the cause of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the priests were satisfied that no serious attack was meditated and sought to avoid creating a useless irritation . In the course of a few hours , however , it was apparent that the frigates had altered their course and stood farther off the coast , having probably attempted this feat from mere wantonness . While engaged in these various pursuits some of the seamen in port discovered , at a very great distance , a schooner , apparently standing for the harbor , but evidently in distress and unmanageable , as her approach was hardly perceptible . The American captains , ever ready to render assistance , after having satisfied themselves by the aid of spy-glasses that the schooner was water - logged and without help could not reach the port that day , promptly offered to man a couple of boats for her relief , but as no boat could leave the harbor without permission , I was requested to obtain it from Don Luis . We soon set out on our expedition with twelve stout sailors , four captains , and myself , and after rowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the distressed schooner . She proved to be the Newbern , of North Carolina , laden with boards , staves , and shingles , bound for Jamaica . The vessel was nearly new , but slightly built , and had sprung a leak soon after leaving port , which greatly increased when she encountered the stormy weather before spoken of , of which , however , she fell in only with the tail end . Finding themselves unable to keep the vessel free by incessant pumping , they gave up the idea of reaching Jamaica and endeavored to reach Baracoa . We found the whole ship 's company , consisting of only six men , so much worn out by fatigue , pumping , and watching , that they could hardly support themselves on their feet . No set of poor fellows ever seemed more rejoiced at succor in time of need . Our fresh and hardy boys succeeded , with pumping and towing , in reaching the harbor before dark , but we were obliged to run her on the beach on a fine sandy bottom . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain , in legal form , and vessel and cargo were advertised for sale for the account of the concerned . Hathaway and myself became the purchasers at a low rate , it is true , but we spent much money to get her pumped free of water so as to find and repair the leak . We had to hire two gangs of lazy Spaniards , to relieve each other night and day for several days . We were compelled to watch them ourselves , as they frequently attempted to take resting spells , during which as much water entered again as they had pumped out . When the leak was at length found and stopped , which was under her bows , the repairs were very expensive , as she wanted a new mast and anchor , which had been lost , and some rigging and sails , besides which the cargo had to be landed and reshipped . In the meantime we had gained our suit against the captors of our bark , and the cargo , which had been during a year in the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron were unsalable , and excepting a part which we traded away in barter , had to be reshipped . The canvas and Russian sheeting , however , were in great demand , the latter commanding twenty-eight dollars a piece . We chartered an American schooner , which we freighted with the bulk of the hemp and the iron , and after considerable trouble and expense for the different commissions , despatched this vessel for Providence , B. I. , under charge of Captain Nichols . The day after she sailed we had invited Don Louis and the ladies , as well as our counsellor , to partake of a morning ride and breakfast at a beautiful spot on the sea-coast , about one mile and a half from Baracoa . These little attentions were naturally expected , in consequence of the many favors and kindnesses we had received , and we had a delightful ride in the // early part of the morning . We had not yet finished our breakfast when a vessel hove in sight standing for the port , and I soon recognized her to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This circumstance completely marred my pleasure and broke up our party several hours sooner than we had intended . We found , however , on our return that she had carried away her main-boom and put back for repairs , which were completed on the following day . Having in the meantime repaired our waterlogged schooner and sold our bark from St. Petersburg , which was perfectly worm-eaten and good for nothing , we prepared to reship our lumber and staves , in order to take them to Jamaica as the best market , the cargo having been designed for that island . Our business at Baracoa drawing now rapidly to an end , we deemed it indispensable , as a token of our gratitude to the Governor and authorities of that place , to give them a public dinner before our departure . For this purpose we engaged our host , the French restaurateur , to whom we gave carte blanche as to the particulars of a sumptuous dinner for about forty persons , and authorized him to rent a room , capable of containing at least one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cards of invitation to all the great personages in Baracoa . But as the dinner was intended for men only , we distributed about one hundred cards more , inviting the Spanish ladies and a number of French gentlemen and ladies to participate in a ball in the evening . The whole affair went off with great #*clat and to the satisfaction of all parties . The Governor , the Inquisitor-General ( the highest clerical functionary ) , the Intendant , the Collector of the Customs , and the commander of the brigof-war , Leopard , were among the most distinguished guests . I was much surprised at a little incident which occurred during dinner . In pledging a glass of wine to the health of the most distinguished of our guests when I drank that of the Inquisitor he made himself known to me as a brother Mason , and notwithstanding the austerity of his general character was subsequently on the most friendly and familiar terms with me . The dinner was ended at about six o'clock , and while the room was being prepared for the ball most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house to amuse themselves with various games at cards and dice . At eight o'clock our galaxy of beauty and fashion began to assemble , and at nine we were in the full enjoyment of dancing and gaming . Nothing occurred to mar our hilarity and pleasure . Those who lost at the various tables were used to the temporary change of fortune , and at least did not seem to mind it . Those who gained had an additional spur for mirth , among whom was our worthy Governor , Don Repilado , who , it was said , came off winner to a considerable amount . Participating in doing the honors of the day , I alternately attended in the ball-room and visited the company at play in the piazza , but did not deprive myself of the pleasure of dancing . We broke up about three o'clock , and what with the exertion of the day , dancing , and drinking more wine than I did in a week , I had my full burden to stand upright under . Captain Hathaway and our jovial counsellor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were no better off than myself , though we all kept in a suitable condition to escort several of the young ladies to their homes . The expense of the entertainment , about two hundred dollars , Captain Hathaway charged to the account of the concern , with explanations of the reasons which made this expenditure proper , observing that if the slightest objection was made we would stand the cost ourselves . We had , however , the satisfaction to learn that our course was approved . When we were ready to reship our lumber , we engaged a mate , crew , and colored cook . These cooks are great vagabonds . On shipping they generally plead poverty , insist on having a part of their wages paid in advance to pay their store debts , after which they contrive every means of making their escape before sailing . In this manner we had already lost two cooks and sixteen // dollars of advance money . When we engaged the third I seriously warned him that if he attempted to abscond I 4 would pay one hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished . While the vessel was loading Captain Hathaway and myself slept on board , the cabin being prepared for our reception . One evening before ten , when we went on board for the night , I missed , on entering the cabin , my greatcoat , which I had placed at the foot of my berth ; and while inquiring for the same we were hailed from on board a vessel , not far off , asking whether we had lost anything , and informing us that not long since a man had been seen descending from the cabin window into a boat with something dark across his shoulders and something white under his arms , and that the boat had been previously seen coming from the direction of the Spanish brig-of-war Leopard . On this information Captain Hathaway also missed a favorite cat , which had been made a present to him . We resolved that I , accompanied by the mate , should immediately go on board and lodge my complaint with the officer of the day . Being well known I was very politely received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mustered on deck and the roll called , when it appeared that there were three absentees whose names were marked , and I was politely assured that all necessary inquiries would be made on the following day . I was informed by Don Luis , about fourteen hours after the event , that the three absentees had been arrested and that there was no doubt that one of them , named Pisano , was the guilty thief , but that no trace of the greatcoat or cat could be discovered , though the culprit had been punished by receiving a severe lashing . I put up with the loss of my coat and soon forgot all about this business , when , a few days after , and the day be fore we intended to sail for Jamaica , our third cook absconded . I was much * vexed at this audacity after the warn ing I had given him . By advice I sent his name and a description of his per son to the barracks , with an offer of ten dollars reward for his arrest . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shipped , our mate accompanied me to some obscure place in a street along the beach of the harbor , about half a mile from the city . Here we got no information ; he had no clothing there , and had not been seen since he shipped . On our return along the beach we were stopped by a Spaniard with whom I was well acquainted , as he had assisted as overseer of the gang that pumped out the schooner . This man with great humility begged of me the favor of stopping a few minutes to acquaint him with the contents of a note written in French which he could not understand . Little courtesies of that kind on my part had been common , and I therefore consented without hesitation or suspicion . I requested the mate to walk slowly forward that I might overtake him , and followed the Spaniard up an alley to a mean-looking one-storied house . We entered , and he opened the door of a room darkened , but not sufficiently to prevent me from discerning a figure standing upright in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , who when he entered suddenly thrust his hand in his bosom . My acquaintance entered first , and at the threshold took hold of the wrist of my left hand and said to the man sitting , " Here , Pisano , I have him . " This exclamation saved me , and the truth flashed instantly on my mind that I had been decoyed in order to be made a victim of revenge to the thief Pisano for the flogging he had received . No sooner had he uttered these words than I violently flung him from me , exclaiming in a thundering voice , " Not yet , you villain , " and the next moment found me on the beach . Our mate , an athletic man and true Yankee sailor , was not yet out of ear-shot and instantly answered my hail . When we met and I had briefly stated to him my narrow escape , he wrought himself up to so great a degree of passion as to propose to go back instanter and root the villains up , stock and fluke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince him that two unarmed men were no match for three armed ones , who could besides at any moment of // peril command the assistance of a dozen more desperadoes . He swore , however , that in the evening he would muster a ship 's crew and scatter the fragments of their dwelling about their ears . On my return I lost no time to acquaint Don Luis with all the circumstances and ask his advice how to proceed . He said he had no doubt that this vagabond was capable of having executed the foulest revenge , and he would immediately arrest him and his associates , provided my departure could be postponed for a day or two in order to give my testimony on oath as to the conspiracy and attempt at violence . But this I could not agree to , as we were ready to sail on the following morning . On arriving on board I was informed that a soldier from the barracks had caught our runaway cook and lodged him for safety on board the man-ofwar . I proceeded , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board the Leopard , where we found our fugitive , a very good-looking young mulatto , in irons . He was brought before us and identified by Captain Hathaway as the person who shipped himself for cook . I addressed him without anger , but reminded him of the consequences which I had solemnly assured him would follow any attempt on his part to escape and break his engagement . I told him that I thought a dozen lashes well laid on his bare back by the boatswain of the man-of-war the mildest punishment he deserved , and that if I could obtain the consent of the officer of the day it should be done forthwith ; and I threw a Spanish dollar on the table as a fee for the boatswain . Leave was politely granted , but it was observed that twelve lashes were far too few , and that he ought at least to have thirty - nine . This I as politely declined , being naturally averse to severe corporal punishment . We then took our cook on board and kept him confined until we had quitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in preparations for sailing to enable him to execute his threatened vengeance , which , moreover , had been strictly forbidden by Captain Hathaway and myself . We paid a short adieu visit to our numerous friends and spent the remainder of the evening at Don Luis 's house , from whom and his family for more than one hundred days we had received so many tokens of kindness . I felt as sincerely attached to them as if they had been near relatives , and although there was no affaire de cceur between me and Senorita Dolores Delabatt , there was , notwithstanding , a freedom of intercourse between us based on mutual esteem and regard . She presented me that evening , as a token of remembrance , with a landscape drawn and painted by herself , stating it would have been worthy of my acceptance if she had not been so ill - provided with painting materials . I on my part begged permission on arrival in the United States to send her a paint - box of water - colors-an offer which was accepted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hopes of ever seeing such a box were but small . However this may have been at that moment , she did receive a splendid and completely furnished paint-box in the early part of 1808 , as acknowledged by a letter of thanks I received in her name from Don Luis . On the next morning we set sail for Jamaica.
