txt In an address before the Young Men 's Business League of Eastman , Ga. , Mr. James B. Best said : " Up in Habersham County a few years ago a party of Swiss farmers bought some worn-out cotton fields on the thin ridge lands near Mount Airy . They fertill2ed them , planted to grapes , and made wine . To-day they are the most prosperous farmers in that region , living in better homes than those of the average Georgia farmers . At the State Dairymen 's convention last year it was clearly proved by the testimony and actual experiences of Georgia dairymen that buttermaking pays better in Georgia than in the Northern States . The food of cattle is cheaper down here , the pasturing season is several months longer , and the tested per cent . of butter fat in the milk is higher . Notwithstanding these conditions , 90 per cent . of the creamery products consumed in Georgia , it is estimated , are imported from other States . There are quite a number of fruit and vegetable growers in Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down in Glynn County , in the old piney woods which were supposed to be of no value after the turpentine and choice timber were gone , the Shakers have bought up thousands of acres to plant in grass , and these expert agriculturists are proceeding to raise cattle and sheep on a large scale . This Is a good grass State , and yet it is stated on authority that the railroads bring into the State annually more bales of hay than they take out bales of cotton . "
