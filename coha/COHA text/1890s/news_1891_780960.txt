txt More than a year 's time has elapsed since Andrew Carnegie formally proposed to erect a two-million-dollar free library and art gallery forPittsburg , and his cheek for $1.000,000 has been on deposit almost that length of time ready to start the work , but up to date not even a site for the buildings has been secured . By the delay Pittsburg artists ? are losing $50,000 . They are talking of holding an indignation meeting over the matter . Mr. Carnegie is said to be disgusted with the dilatory action , and if definite plans are not ii. ) rthcoming some further valuable conditions may be lost to the city . George A. Macbeth . who is a prominent member of the Art Society and of the Library Commission , said to-day : " The delay in getting the library buildings under way is disgraceful . No other city in the world has been so blessed by a gift of $2,000,000 as Pittsburg . The last time I saw Mr. Carnegie he said . ' Hurry and get your building up , and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art work , and have made a proviso in my will to lay aside $1,000,000 that the interest may keep up the work . ' Mr. Carnegie will be here in a few days . Four men are now dictating to the other members of the commission , and nothing can be done until they act . The members of the commission do n't know what to do , and It is hoped that Mr. Carnegie 's visit will stir up Pittsburgers to a sense of appreciation of the gift . " The delay has been caused by a squabble over the site . Mr. Carnegie wants it at the entrance to Schaub- Park , but four Conncilmen on tho commission have kept the city from apnropriating the $75,000 to buy it . Mr. Carnegie is willing to pay the $75,000 himself , but the majority of the commission do not think he should do so .
