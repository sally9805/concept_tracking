txt At the time of the Assembly Chamber ceiling scandal Mr. SHEEEULN , now Speaker of the Assembly and then a member of the committee that had charge of the construction of the sham ceiling , showed considerable sensitiveness regarding his reputation and official honor , but it looks now as though he were involved in a transaction quite as discreditable , for which he can not escape the responsibility . lie has been very active in working a bill through the Assembly for the expenditure of $60,000 in dredging Black Rock fiarbor at Buffalo . the falsification of the count by which the bill appeared to have passed on Thursday , when in fact it did not have the necessary majority , may have been an innocent mistake of the Clerk for which the Speaker was not responsible , though it has a suspicious look . But there is little doubt that this appropriation is intended mainly for the benefit of a private corporation for which Mr. SnEEtrafv ! s one of the attorneys , and of which his brother . JOHN C. SHEEHAN , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has granted to this same corporation the right to construct a section of railroad upon State land along one of the canals , a right . which Mr. SHANAHAN refused to grant and which he declares to be worth a million dollars . The SHEEHANS were instrumental in getting liarucax appointed Superintendent of Public Works In place of Mr. SHANAHAN , and it looks as though this job had something to do with their efforts . Altogether it has a bad look for the Speaker .
