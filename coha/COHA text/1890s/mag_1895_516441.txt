least , an interesting conversation over the affair . He asked me how many men I had , and I told him , and gave him a true account of those killed and wounded , and I saw that he was much pleased . He told the interpreter that I told the truth , as he had counted my men himself , that for four days they had been watching my every movement , gathering their warriors to meet us from far and near , and that I stopped and encamped about two miles below where they lay in ambush for me . He said that had I continued my march for another hour the day I encamped at four o'clock in the afternoon , every man of us would have been slaughtered . My occupation of the island was a surprise to them all , and it was the only thing that saved us . I then questioned him regarding their numbers and losses . He hesitated for some time , but finally told the interpreter something , and the interpreter told me that there were nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought the number about nine hundred and seventy . Regarding their losses , the chief held up his two hands seven times together , and then one hand singly , which , the interpreter told me , signified seventy-five . I asked the interpreter if that meant killed and wounded . " That , " said the interpreter , " signifies the killed only . He says there were heaps ' wounded . " Just as he started to go he stopped and spoke to the interpreter again . " He wishes to know whether you did not get enough of it , " said the interpreter . " Tell him , yes , all I wanted , " was my reply . " How about himself ? " As my words were interpreted he gave a grim , half - humorous look , and then unfolding his blanket and opening the breast of his buckskin shirt , pointed to where a bullet had evidently gone through his lungs , nodded , closed his shirt , wrapped his blanket around him , turned , and stalked quietly from the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAN HOWELLS . I. IT was by boat that I arrived from BosI ton , on an August morning of 18601 which was probably of the same quality as an August morning of 1894 . I used not to mind the weather much in those days ; it was hot or it was cold , it was wet or it was dry , but it was not my affair ; and I suppose that I sweltered about the strange city , with no sense of anything very personal in the temperature , until nightfall . What I remember is being high up in a hotel long since laid low , listening in the summer dark , after the long day was done , to the Niagara roar of the omnibuses whose tide then swept Broadway from curb to curb , for all the miles of its length . At that hour the other city noises were stilled , or lost in this vaster volume of sound , which seemed to fill the whole night . It had a solemnity which the modern corner to New York will hardly imagine , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has left the air to the strident discords of the elevated trains , the ear-slitting bells of the horse-cars , and the irregular alarum of the grip-car gongs , which blend to no such harmonious thunder as rose from the procession of those ponderous and innumerable vans . There was a sort of inner quiet in the sound , and when I chose I slept off to it , and woke to it in the morning refreshed and strengthened to explore the literary situation in the metropolis . II . Not that think I left this to the second day . 1Tery probably I lost no time in going to the office of the Saturday Press , as soon as I had my breakfast after arriving , and I have a dim impression of anticipating the earliest of the Bohemians ) vhose gay theory of life obliged them to a good many hardships in lying down early in the morning , and rising up late in the day . If it was the office-boy who bore me company during the first hour of my visit , by-and-by the editors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very specific about them if I could , for since that Bohemia has faded from the map of the republic of letters , it has grown more and more difficult to trace its citizenship to any certain writer . There are some living who knew the Bohemians and even loved them , but there are increasingly few who were of them , // even in the fond retrospect of youthful follies and errors . It was in fact but a sickly colony , transplanted from the mother asphalt of Paris , and never really striking root in the pavements of New York ; it was a colony of ideas , of theories , which had perhaps never had any deep root anywhere . What these ideas , these theories , were in art and in life , it would not be very easy to say ; but in the Saturday Press they came to violent expression , not to say explosion , against all existing forms of respectability . If respectability was your bate noire , then you were a Bohemian ; and if you were in the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose into very fine paragraphs of a sentence each , or of a very few words , or even of one word . I believe this fashion still prevails with some of the dramatic critics , who think that it gives a quality of epigram to the style ; and I suppose it was borrowed from the more spasmodic moments of Victor Hugo , by the editor of the Press . He brought it back with him when he came home from one of those sojourns in Paris which possess one of the French accent rather than the French language ; I long desired to write in that fashion myself , but I had not the courage . This editor was a man of such open and avowed cynicism that he may have been , for all I know , a kindly optimist at heart ; some say , however , that he had really talked himself into being what he seemed . I only know that his talk , the first day I saw him , was of such a quality - that if he was half as bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up and down his room saying what lurid things he would directly do if any one accused him of respectability , so that he might disabuse the minds of all witnesses . There were four or five of his assistants and contributors listening to the dreadful threats , which did not deceive even so great innocence as mine , but I do not know whether they found it the sorry farce that I did . They probably felt the fascination for him which I could not disown , in spite of my inner disgust ; and were watchful at the same time for the effect of his words with one who was confessedly fresh from Boston , and was full of delight in the people he had seen there . It appeared , with him , to be proof of the inferiority of Boston that if you passed down Washington Street , half a dozen men in the crowd would know you were Holmes , or Lowoll , or Longfellow , or Wendell Phillips ; but in Broadway no one would know who you were , or care to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this more than once urged as a signal advantage of New York for the insthetic inhabitant , but I am not sure , yet , that it is so . The unre&amp;gnized celebrity probably has his mind quite as much upon himself as if some one pointed him out , and otherwise I can not think that the sense of neighborhood is such a had thing for the artist in any sort . It involves the sense of responsibility , which can not be too constant or too keen . If it narrows , it deepens ; and this may be the secret of Boston . III . It would not be easy to say just why the Bohemian group represented New York literature to my imagination , for I certainly associated other names with its best work , but perhaps it was because I had written for the Saturday Press myself , and had my pride in it , and perhaps it was because that paper really embodied the new literary life of the city . It was clever , and full of the wit that tries its teeth upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it made itself felt and feared . The young writers throughout the country were ambitious to be seen in it , and they gave their best to it ; they gave literally , for the Saturday Press never paid in anything but hopes of paying , vaguer even than promises . It is not too much to say that it was very nearly as well for one to be accepted by the Press as to be accepted by the Atlantic , and for the time there was no other literary comparison . To be in it was to be in the company of Fitz James O'Brien Fitzhugh Ludlow , Mr. Aldrich , Mr. Stedman , and whoever else was liveliest in prose or loveliest in verse at that day in New York . It was a power , and although it is true that , as Henry Giles said of it , " Man can not live by snappingturtle alone , " the Press was very good snapping-turtle . Or , it seemed so then ; I should be almost afraid to test it now , for I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have grown nicer in my taste , and want my snapping-turtle of the very best . What is certain is that I went to the office of the Saturday Press // in New York with much the same sort of feeling I had in going to the office of the Atlantic Monthly in Boston , but I came away with a very different feeling . I had found there a bitterness against Boston as great as the bitterness against respectability , and as Boston was then rapidly becoming my second country , I could not join in the scorn thought of her and said of her by the Bohemians . I fancied a conspiracy among them to shock the literary pilgrim , and to minify the precious emotions he had experienced in visiting other shrines ; but I found no harm in that , for I knew just how much to be shocked , and I thought I knew better how to value certain things of the soul than they . Yet when their chief asked me how I got on with Hawthorne , and I began to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the king of Bohemia took his pipe out to break in upon me with " Oh , a couple of shysters ! " and the rest laughed , I was abashed all they could have wished , and was not restored to myself till one of them said that the thought of Boston made him as ugly as sin : then I began to hope again that men who took themselves so seriously as that need not be taken very seriously by me . In fact I had heard thinga almost as desperately cynical in other newspaper offices before that , and I could not see what was so Thstinctively Bohemian in these anime prave , these souls so baleful by their own showing . But apparently Bohemia was not a state that you could well imagine from one encounter , and since my stay in New York was to be very short , I lost no time in acquainting myself farther with it . That very night I went to the beer-cellar , once very far up Broadway , where I was given to know that the Bohemian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far West as Ohio , that the queen of Bohemia sometimes came to Pfaff 's : a young girl of a sprightly gift in letters , whose name or pseudonym had made itself pretty well known at that day , and whose fate , pathetic at all times , out-tragedies almost any other in the history of letters . She was seized with hydrophobia from the bite of her dog , on a railroad train ; and made a long journey home in the paroxysms of that agonizing disease , which ended in her death after she reached New York . But this was after her reign had ended , and no such black shadow was cast backward upon Pfaff 's , whose name often figured in the verse and the epigrammatically paragraphed prose of the Saturday Press . I felt that as a contributor and at least a brevet Bohemian I ought not to go home without visiting the famous place , and witnessing if I could not share the revels of my comrades . As I neither drank beer nor smoked , my part in the carousal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had very good at Pfaff 's , and to listening to the whirling words of my commensals , at the long board spread for the Bohemians in a cavernous space under the pavement . There* ' were writers for the Saturday Press and for Vanity Fair ( a hopefully comic paper of that day ) , and some of the artists who drew for the illustrated periodicals . Nothing of their talk remains with me , hut the impression remains that it was not so good talk as I had heard in Boston . At one monient of the orgy , which went but slowly for an orgy , we were joined by some belated Bohemians whom the others made a great clamor over ; I was given to understand they were just recovered from a fearful debauch ; their locks were still damp from the wet towels used to restore them , and their eyes were very frenzied . I was presented to these types , who neither said nor did anything worthy of their awful appearance , but dropped into seats at the table , and ate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staid hoping vainly for worse things till eleven o'clock , and then I rose and took my leave of a literary condition that had distinctly disappointed me . I do not say that it may not have been wickeder and wittier than I found it ; I only report what I saw and heard in Bohemia on my first visit to New York , and I know that my acquaintance with it was not exhaustive . When I came the next year the Saturday Press was no more , and the editor and his contributors had no longer a common centre . The best of the young fellows whom I met there confessed , in a pleasant exchange of letters which we had afterwards , that he thought the pose a vain and unprofitable one ; and when the Press was revived , after the war , it was without any of the old Bohemian characteristics except that of not paying for material . It could not last long upon these terms , and again it passed away , and still waits its second palingenesis . The editor passed away too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had inspired altogether ceased to be . He was a man of a certain sardonic power , and used it rather fiercely and freely , with a joy probably more apparent than real in the pain it gave . In my last knowledge of him he was much milder than when I first knew him , and I have the feeling that he too came to own before he died that man can not live by snapping-turtle alone . He was kind to some neglected talents , and befriended them with a vigor and a zeal which he would have been the last to let you call generous . / The chief of these was Walt Whitman , who , when the Saturday Press took it up , had as hopeless a cause with the critics on either side of the ocean as any man could have . It was not till long afterward that his English admirers began to discover him , and to make his countrymen some noisy reproaches for ignoring him ; they were wholly in the dark concerning him when the Saturday Press , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Press gathered about it , made him their cult . No doubt he was more valued because he was so offensive in some ways than he would have been if he had been in no way offensive , but it remains a fact that they celebrated him quite as much as was good for them . He was often at Pfaff 's with them , and the night of my visit he was the chief fact of my experience . I did not know he was there till I was on my way out , for he did not sit at the table under the pavement , but at the head of one further into the room . There , as I passed , some friendly fellow stopped me and named me to him , and I remembe* how he leaned back in his chair , and reached out his great hand to me , as if he were going to give it me for good and all . He had a fine head , with a cloud of Jovian hair upon it , and a branching beard and mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seemed to wish the liking which I instantly gave him , though we hardly passed a word , and our acquaintance was summed up in that glance and the grasp of his mighty fist upoa my hand . I doubt if he had any notion who or what I was beyond the fact that I was a young poet of some sort , but he may possibly have remembered seeing my name printed after some very Heinesque verses in the Press . I did not meet him again for twenty years , and then I had only a moment with him when LITERARY NEW YORK . 65 he was reading the proofs of his poems in Boston . Some years later I saw him for ( the last time , one day after his lecture oni Lincoln , in that city , when he came down from the platform to speak with some hand-shaking friends who gathered about him . Then and always he gave me the sense of a sweet and true soul , and I felt in him a spiritual dignity which I will not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passage from a private letter of Emerson 's , though I believe he would not have seen such a thing as most other men would , or thought ill of it in another . The spiritual purity which I felt in him no less than the dignity is something that I will no more try to reconcile with what denies it in his page ; but such things we may well leave to the adjustment of finer balances than we have at hand . I will make sure only of the greatest benignity in the presence of the man . The apostle of the rough , the uncouth , was the gentlest person ; his barbaric yawp , translated into the terms of social encounter , was an address of singular quiet , delivered in a voice of winning and endearing friendliness . *As to his work itself , I suppose that I do not think it so valuable in effect as in intention . He was a liberating force , a very " imperial anarch " in literature ; but liberty is never anything but a means , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in what must be called his verse . I like his prose , if there is a difference , much better ; there he is of a genial and comforting quality , very rich and *ordial , such as I felt him to be when I met him in person . His verse seems to me not poetry , but the materials of poetry , like one 's emotions ; yet I would not misprize it , and I am glad to own that I have had moments of great pleasuAi in it . Some French critic quoted in the Saturday Press ( I can not think of his name ) said the best thing of him when he said that he made you a partner of the enterprise , for that is precisely what he does and that is what alienates and what endears in him , as you like or dislike the partnership . It is still something neighborly , brotherly , fatherly , and so I felt him to be when the benign old man looked on me and spoke to me . Iv . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohemians for me , and it was // the last of New York authorship too , for the time . I do not know why I should not have imagined trying to see Curtis , whom I knew so much by heart , and whom I adored , but I may not have had the courage , or I may have heard that he was out of town ; Bryant , I believe , was then out of the country ; but at any rate I did not attempt him either . The Bohemians were the beginning and the end of the story for me , and to tell the truth I did not like the story . I remember that as I sat at that table under the pavement , in Pfaff 's beer-cellar , and listened to the wit that did not seem very funny , I thought of the dinner with Lowell , the breakfast with Fields , the supper at the Autocrat 's , and felt that I had fallen very far. * In fact it can do no harm at this distance of time to confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good while afterward , that a person who had seen the men and had the things said before him that I had in Boston , could not keep himself too carefully in cotton ; and this was what I did all the following winter , though of course it was a secret between me and me . I dare say it was not the worst thing I could have done , in some respects . My sojourn in New York could not have been very long , and the rest of it was mainly given to viewing the monuments of the city from the windows of omnibuses and the platforms of horsecars . The world was so simple then that there were perhaps only a half-dozen cities that had horse - cars in them , and I travelled in those conveyances at New York with an unfaded zest , even after my journeys back and forth between Boston and Cambridge . I have not the least notion where I went or what I saw , but I suppose that it was up and down the ugly east and west avenues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now partly concealed by the elevated roads , and that I found them very stately and handsome . Indeed , New York was really handsomer then than it is now , when it has so many more pieces of beautiful architecture , for at that day the sky-scrapers were not yet , and there was a fine regularity in the streets that these brute bulks have robbed of all shapeliness . Dirt and squalor there were aplenty , but not so much dirt , not so much squalor , and there was infinitely more comfort . The long succession of cross streets was yet mostly secure from business , after you passed Clinton Place ; commerce was just beginning to show itself in Union Square , and Madison Square was still the home of the McFlimsies , whose kin and kind dwelt unmolested in the brownstone stretches of Fifth Avenue . I tried hard to imagine them from the acquaintance Mr. Butler 's poem had given me , and from the knowledge the gentle satire of the Potiphar Papers had spread broadcast through a community shocked by the excesses of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the best now , probably . But I do not think I made very much of it , perhaps because most of the people who ought to have been in those fine mansions were away at the sea-side and the mountains . The mountains I had seen on my way down from Canada , but the sea-side not , and it would never do to go home without visiting some famous summer resort . I must have fixed upon Long Branch because I must have heard of it as then the most fashionable ; and one afternoon I took the boat for that place . By this means I not only saw sea-bathing for the first time , but I saw a storm at sea : a squall struck us so suddenly that it blew away all the camp-stools of the forward promenade ; it was very exciting , and I long meant to use in literature the black wall of cloud that settled on the water before us like a sort of portable midnight ; I now throw it away upon the reader , as it were ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Long Branch , and I had a bath the next morning before breakfast : an extremely cold one , with a life-line to keep me against the undertow . In this rite I had the company of a young New - Yorker , whom I had met on the boat coming down , and who was of the light , hopeful , adventurous business type which seems peculiar to the city , and which has always attracted me . He told me much about his life , and how he lived , and what it cost him to live . He had a large room at a fashionable boardinghouse , and he paid fourteen dollars a week . In Columbus I had such a room at such a house , and paid three and a half , and I thought it a good deal . But those were the days before the war , when America was the cheapest country in the world , and the West was incredibly inexpensive . After a day of lonely splendor at this scene of fashion and gayety , I went back // THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the boat for Albany on my way home . I noted that I had no longer the vivid interest in nature and human nature which I had felt in setting out upon my travels , and I said to myself that this was from having a mind so crowded with experiences and impressions that it could receive no more ; and I really suppose that if the happiest phrase had offered itself to me at some moments , I should scarcely have looked about me for a landscape or a figure to fit it to . I was very glad to get hack to my dear little city in the West ( I found it seething in an August sun that was hot enough to have calcined the limestone State House ) , and to all the friends I was so fond of . V. I did what I could to prove myself unworthy of them by refusing their invitations , and giving myself wholly to literature , during the early part of the winter that followed ; and I did not realize my error till the invitations ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worst of it was that an ungrateful Muse did little in return for the sacrifices I made her , and the things I now wrote were not liked by the editors I sent them to . The editorial taste is not always the test of merit , but it is the only one we have , and I am not saying the editors were wrong in my case . There were then such a very few places where you could market your work : the Atlantic in Boston and Harper 's in New York were the magazines that paid . though the Independent newspaper bought literary material ; the Saturday Press printed it without buying , and so did the old Knickerbocker Magazine , though there was pecuniary good-will in both these cases . I toiled much that winter over a story I had long been writing , and at last sent it to the Atlantic , which had published five poems for me the year before . After some weeks , or it may have been months , I got it back with a note saying that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that in the May number of the Knickerbocker the first chapter of the story had appeared . Then I remembered that , years before , I had sent this chapter to that magazine , as a sketch to be printed by itself , and afterwards had continued the story from it . I had never heard of its acceptance , and supposed of course that it was rejected ; but on my second visit to New York I called at the Knickerbocker office , and a new editor , of those that the magazine was always having in the days of its failing fortunes , told me that he had found my sketch in rummaging about in a barrel of his predecessors ' manuscripts , and had liked it , and printed it . He said that there were fifteen dollars coming to me for that . sketch , and might he send the money to me ?

I sailed without the money for some verses that Vanity Fair bought of me , but I hardly expected that , for the editor , who was then Artemus Ward , hind frankly told me in taking my address that dueats were few at that moment with Vanity Fair . I was then on my way to be consul at Venice , where I spent the next four years in a vigilance for Confederate privateers which none of them ever surprised . I had asked for the consulate at Munich , where I hoped to steep myself yet longer in Gei* JOHN 3. rIATT. 4 // qwq spaired . The kindly chief of the consular bureau said that the President*s secretaries , Mr. John Nicolay and Mr. John Hay , were interested in my appointment , and he advised my going over to the White House and seeing them . I lost no time in doing that , and I learned that as young Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youn* , Western man who had done something in literature , and they were willing to help me for that reason , and for no other that I ever knew .

In the end they got it put up to fifteen hundred , and so I went to Venice , where if I did not live like a prince on that income , I lived a good deal more like a prince than I could have done at Rome on a third of it . If the appointment was not present fortune , it was the beginning , , of the best luck I have had in the world , and I am glad to owe it all MRS . JOHN J.

But I had already met , in my first sojourn at the capital , a young journalist who had given hostages to poetry , and whom I was very glad to see and proud to know . Mr. Stedman and I were talking over that meeting the other day , and I can be surer than I might have been without his memory , that I found him at a friend 's house , where he was nursing himself for some slight sickness , and that Isat by his bed while our souls launched together into the joyful realms of hope and praise . In him I found the quality of Boston , the honor and passion of literature , and not a mere pose of the literary life ; and the world knows without my telling how true he has been to his ideal of it . His earthly mission then was to write letters from Washington for the New York WILLIAM ALLEN BUTLER .

I think Mr. Stedn- ) an wrote for its editorial page at times , and his relation to it as a Washington correspondent had an authority which is wantinc , to the function in these days of perfected telegraphing . He had not yet achieved that seat in the Stock Exchange whose possession has justi fled his recourse to business , and has hel ped h i rn to mean something more single in literature than many more singly devoted to it . I used sometimes to speak about that with another eager young author in certain middle years when we were chafing in editorial harness , and we always decided that Stedman had the best of it in being able to earn his living in a sort so alien to literature that he could come CHARLE5 F.

MRS . R. H. STODnARD . I suppose it was he who introduced me to the Stoddards , whom I met in New qwq verse and fiction . In both it seems to me that she has failed of the recognition which her work merits , and which will be hers when Time begins to look about him for work worth remembering. / Her tales and novels have in them * of realism , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is now too familiar , perhaps . It is a peculiar fate , and would form the scheme of a pretty study in the history of literature . But in whatever she did she left the stamp of a talent like no other , and of a personality disdainful of literary environment . In a time when most of us had to write like Tennyson , or Longfellow , or Browning , she never would write like any one but herself . I remember very well the lodging over a corner of Fourth Avenue and some downtown street where I visited these winning and gifted people , and tasted the pleasure of their racy talk , and the hospitality of their good - will toward all literature , which certainly did not leave me out . We H. H. STODDARD. sat before their grate in the chill of the last October days , and they set and risen each other on to one wild flight of wit after another , and again I bathed my delighted spirit in the atmosphere of a realm where for the time at least no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful war , ' could penetrate . I liked the Stoddards because they were frankly not of that Bohemia which I disliked so much , and thought it of no promise or validity ; and because I was fond of their poetry and found them in it . I liked the absolutely literary keeping of their lives . He had then , and for long after , a place in the Custom-house , but he was no more of that than Lamb was of India House . He belonged to that better world where there is no interest but letters , and which was as much like heaven for me as anything I could think of . The meetings with the Stoddards repeated themselves when I came back to sail from New York , early in November . Mixed up with the cordial pleasure of them in my memory is a sense of the cold and wet ontdoors , and the misery of being in those infamous New York streets , then as now the squalidest in the world . The last night I saw my friends they told me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Hall Park . Fitz James O'Brien , the brilliant young Irishman who had dazzled us with his story of The Diamond Lens , and frozen our blood with his ingenious tale of a ghostWhat was ghost that could be felt and heard , but not seen-had enlisted for the war , to be an officer with the swift process of the first days of it . In that camp he had just then shot and killed a man for some infraction of discipline , and it was uncertain what the end would be . He was acquitted , however , and it is known bow he afterwards died of lockjaw from a wound received in battle . VII . Before this last visit in New York there was a second visit to Boston , which I need not dwell upon , because it was chiefly a // and eminently each . I met him afterwards in Rome , which the powers bestowed upon him instead of Venice , and he for*ave me , though I do not know whether he forgave the powers . We walked far atid long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most uncommon mind in talk which came out richest and fullest in the presence of the wild nature which he loved and knew so much better than most other men . I think that the book he would have written about Teriice is forever to be regretted , and I do not at all console myself for its loss with the book I have written myself . At Lowell 's table that day they spoke of what sort of winter I should find in Venice , and he inclined to the belief that I should want a fire there . On his study hearth a very brisk one burned when we went back to it , and kept out EDMUND CLARENCE 5TEDMAN. the chill of a cold easterly storm . We looked through one of the win- qwq THE NEW CZAR , AND WHAT WE MAY EXPECT FROM HIM . BY PROFESSOR E. BORGES , Ph.D .

In the morn the grief-stricken subjects of the late " White father " lament with tears and sobs , " Le roi est mnort I " and in the afternoon they hail the heralds of the new monarch with joyous shouts , " *Jive le roil " Still , every Russian asks , Will Nicholas Alexandrovich be like his father ?

The ruler , the absolute ruler of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as large as the United States , is a young man of whose childhood , youth , and adolescence comparatively little is known , whose temperament and character , ambitions and peculiarities , are concealed by clouds of the most contradictory rumors and romances . The world naturally desires to know as much as possible about this young monarch , not for mere curiosity 's sake , but because he has the power to declare war at any time , because he has an army of two million soldiers at his command , and has a military reserve of five more millions of well - trained men that he may call into the field in an emergency . What a power , what a responsibility for a mortal and fallible being , especially in this age ! And even , apart from this point of view , what an important factor in the world 's welfare and development is this young man through his absolute right to create and annul laws , through his unlimited power to be a benefactor or suppressor of his subjects ! Modern history shows only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present German Emperor ; but even this case is not of so far-reaching importance . Emperor William is checked and prevented from carrying out his will and whims by parliament , by the " Bundesrath " and the sovereigns of the German Empire , who have the right and power to resist any projects which fail to find their approval . Furthermore , the German army is not so numerous , the sphere of Germany 's interest geographically not so far-reaching as that of Russia , of that giant who touches with his arms the weakest points of Germany , the heart of Austria , the lungs of Turkey , the backbone of India , and the shoulders of China . Still , since the impulsive and self - willed young William sways the sceptre of the German Empire , Europe has trembled in expectancy of the unexpected , the whole world has studied his past and the qualities he may probably have inherited from his parents , has scrutinized his inclinations , ambitions , and // idiosyncrasies , has watched every step and every word of his to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not surprising , but very natural , that the interest of the world is centred in the same , if not to a greater , degree upon Czar Nicholas II . But the gratification of this interest is not so easily achieved . Since the death of Alexander III . newspapers and magazines all over the world have published numerous articles about the late and the new Czar , which contained , besides wellknown biographical facts and more or less true anecdotes , a vast amount of hearsay and guesswork , that forms in itself the most surprising contradictions . Some reports would have the new Czar be a half-idiotic epileptic , who resembles in his ravings Ivan the Terrible ; another wiseacre tells us that Nicholas is an incurable consumptive , with all the spiritual and sensual peculiarities of this unfortunate class ; some Russian correspondents ( generally they have never left " dear old London " ) declare positively that he is a religious fanatic , while others , just as well informed , assert most emphatically that he was a pronounced nihilist ' ' the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the new Czar adores the English ; another was informed by an " authority of the Imperial household** that Nicholas hates , despises the Germans ; a third one has found out " from a member of the personal staff " that the Emperor married a Jewish chorus girl , and so forth . The fact is , those scribblers know very little or nothing of the new Czar , and try merely to satisfy the appetite of their readers by more or less well-invented sensational stories . Every grain of truth is hidden in bushels of chaff and exaggerations and misrepresentations . I will try to tear the obscuring veils from these misleading portraits , and show Nicholas Alexandrovich as he looks in the eyes of wellinformed persons , who judge him justly and objectively . If we follow the trend of our timesand it is really difficult to deny the results of the discoveries of Lombroso , Charcot , Nordau , and others-we must first of all investigate the qualities , dispositions , and peculiarities of body and mind which Nicholas may have inherited from his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love-match , or of that irresis tible and all-conquering , although indescribable , feeling which poets like to praise to the skies . The history of the marriage between Alexander Alexandrovich and Princess Dagmar of Denmark is , though singularly romantic , only a variation of the customary union between children of sovereigns who marry for political or family reasons . It was truly a " manage de convenance pour des raisons diplomatiques . " Princess Dagmar had been the betrothed of Crown-Prince Nicholas , the elder brother of Alexander , who died at Nice , April , 1865 , of consumption , and the head of the Romanoffs found it desirable that the heir-apparent to the throne should also inherit the bride of his deceased brother . Although the two young people did not , to use a common phrase , " care very much for each other , " they obeyed the parental commands , and the union , based merely upon mutual esteem and a sense of duty , turned out to be a very happy one . It is a well-known fact , and , in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth laying stress upon , that the late Emperor and the Czaritza led an exemplary life , and that , although Alexander III . had been denounced for various and innumerable atrocities , never one voice dared to accuse him of conjugal infidelity . But it is less well known , and was mentioned only during his illness and after his death , that Alexander and Dagmar were attached to each other by a sincere and profound devotion , far above the customary worldly marriages , and even stronger than the affection of partners in a " love-match . " The ennobling influence of this devotion must doubtless have left a deep impression upon the warm heart of the prince , just as the happy home life of the Imperial parents must have brightened his boyhood . From the stand - point of natural selection and according to the Darwinian theory , that a union of heterogeneous and reciprocally supplementing individuals is the most desirable , the parentage of Nicholas ought to be very favorable for his body and mind . His father , physically strong , yea , even extraordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy , prudent and reserved in action , somewhat distrustful in judging situations and strangers , very exacting and strict toward others as well as to himself . His mo // ther , on the other hand , was physically frail and delicate , nervously impulsive , quick in comprehension and still quicker in decision , showed in her youth a buoyant spirit , and is one of those lovable womanly natures ; warm-hearted and confiding , unselfish and forbearing , always willing to help , to sacrifice , to gladden , and to brighten . If all signs do not deceive , the character of Nicholas is a fortunate and favorable blending of the most desirable and praiseworthy qualities of his parents . One thing is sure : Nicholas Alexandrovich is imbued with the warmheartedness of his mother and the imperturbable veracity of his father . W. T. Stead-by-the-way , the only Englishman who ever dared to publish the truth about the late Czar-says in a recent article in the Review of Reviews : " The Czar was an intensely human man , lovable , simple , and true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest soul . I have never met any one who impressed me more completely with a sense of absolute trust . He was not a brilliant talker . He was slow , reserved , and sparing in his words . But he always put his point clearly , and he always hit the nail square on the head . When he was puzzled , he said so . He did not pretend . " Lord Rosebery remarked in a public speech about Alexander III. , " The one sin he never forgives is the sin of personal deceit and untruthfulness . " These characteristics are likewise true of Nicholas , with the exception that the mental slowness of the father seems to have been overcome by the adaptability and quickness of his mother 's mind . Fortunately for Nicholas and his Empire , Alexander III . s healthy constitution and sound mind seem to have neutralized the nervous disposition of the Czaritza , and an outbreak of the mental derangement similar to that which made it necessary to place her sister , the Duchess of Cumberland , in a sanitarium is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities of the new Czar I will dwell later on . At this point I must mention only one more pronounced characteristic of Alexander III. , which has been inherited by his son - his decided sense of duty . It had influenced the Emperor through his whole official and private life , and was also the guiding-star of the education of his children . The education of the present Czar differed greatly from that of his predecessor . His father , as a younger son , had not been educated with the view of fitting him for the rulership of the vast Empire ; his instruction had been one-sided , almost exclusively military . He was brought up as a soldier , to become in time the military right hand of his brother , and eventually chief commander of the army , similar to the present position of the Grand-Dukes Vladimir and Michael . When Alexander Alexandrovich suddenly became the heir to the throne , he felt deeply the lack of knowledge and training for his future exalted position , and tried his best to avoid a similar mistake in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their studies and carefully selecting their tutors . In this selection he differed widely from the principles of his father , who had given his children a decidedly Western , that means European , cosmopolitan education . Crown-Prince Alexander influenced strongly by his intimate contact with the officers and common soldiers during the most impressionable period of his life , believed the salvation arid future greatness of Russia possible only through a strong Russian feeling of the whole people , and hoped to achieve the welfare of the Empire solely by a thorough amalgamation and strict Russification of its many nationalities . These views , possibly not correct or wise , but still based upon the wishes of the majority of Russians and kindled by Napoleon III . s principles of the crystallization of nations , grew even more distinct after Alexander had become Emperor . The cruel assassination of his father by " Western " revolutionists on the very day when the Czar - signed his name to a " Western " constitution -- -I use the word " Western " from the stand-point of an orthodox Russian -- aroused in Alexander III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , principles , and methods , which had slumbered in his soul for a long time . He looked upon the plans and intentions , the method of reigning , and the liberal interpretation of the laws by his father and his counsellors as a failure ; he regarded everything that was " Western , " foreign , and un-Russian with distrustful suspicion , and resolved to change all that , to give not only Russia to the Russians , but to make all his subjects , not merely in name but in reality , Russians . It may seem that I have dwelt too long // upon the sentiments and deeds of the late Czar and say too little of his son . But I do not want merely to explain a certain phase and some misunderstood principles of the life and reign of Alexander III . His belief and motto , " Russia for the Rutssians " - which Americans will more readily understand , because somewhat similarly situated-became such an important factor in the education and development of Nicholas that it must not be passed over lightly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russians , solely Russians , as teachers , tutors , and playmates for the Imperial children . True , there was an English governess , a German and a French governess , who in turn taught the children their respective mother-tongues . But that was all . They spoke to the princes , they read to them and with them from different books carefully selected by their parents , but they had neither any influence upon their education , nor did they spend their leisure time with them . For all branches of knowledge , for the physical , mental , and religious education of the princes , Russians exclusivelywere appointed . And this is one of the reasons why the general public knows so very little about the new Czar . In Russia it is regarded not only as unpermissible , but still more as tactless and ungentlemanly , for a tutor to speak about the character or peculiarities of his pupils , and this unwritten law of etiquette obliges tutors of Imperial princes no less to keep their observations to themselves . From what could be found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandrovich was a bright child and a very industrious and conscientious pupil , obedient and willing to the point where his nervousness or decided selfwill was unduly aroused . During his boyhood the progress in school-work was somewhat slow , not because he was dull , but on account of his frequent physical indisposition to attend the lessons . Nicholas Alexandrovich was a sickly boy , whether because he could not well endure the severe climate of Russia , or because his father insisted upon a system of hardening which was too rigorous for his frail constitution , must be left undecided . His early reading consisted chiefly of Russian masterpieces fit for his age , but scarcely less time was spent upon the reading of Grimm 's fairy-tales , F6n6lon 's Tdirnaque , and Walter Scott 's as well as Charles Dickens 's best works . As soon as the young prince was physically and mentally strong enough to enter into his studies more seriously , he received a regular staff of well-educated teachers for the various branches , and General Bogdan6vich became his chief tutor , upon whom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military matters , but also the responsibility to supervise the occupation and division of time of the Czarevich . The superior knowledge and refined manners of this gallant soldier qualified him exceedingly well for his difficult task , and his unrelenting strictness had a decided influence upon the work and development of the young prince . In consequence of the strict etiquette at the Russian court the liberty of Nicholas was very much restricted during his school-time , and nothing noteworthy as to his life reached the outer world with the exception of the publication of his examinations . Remarkable at this period was the truly home life which united all the members of the Imperial family . It was really more the life of a wealthy bourgeois than of a rich nobleman . Every minute which the Emperor could spare from his duties he spent in the school - rooms of his children , or in the plain sitting - room , reading , chatting , or listening to music . During the severe cold of the winter and the exceedingly warm summer months , which the Imperial family spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain and simple as that of a well-todo country gentleman , and the princes enjoyed their vacation heartily by roaming through the parks and fields with their papa , hunting , fishing , and even fighting the village boys . So also the visits to Copenhagen , which Alexander III . made regularly every year to spend a few weeks with the parents of the Czaritza , were great holidays for the princes . At the age of eighteen Nicholas was introduced into the official world and the court circle , but made very little use of the opportunities thus offered . This caused the old rumors of his poor health and weak constitution to be repeated more frequently , and the sensitive prince chose a peculiar manner of object lesson to contradict them peremptorily . At the first court ball which he attended , in 1886 , he danced with the daughter of // a famous general . Kola * waltzed the young lady four , five , six times around the large ballroom with great skill and greater vigor until she was exhausted , and nearly fainted . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but quite aloud , " I beg your pardon , Countess , for having fatigued you so much , but I wished to prove that the Crown-Prince of Russia has some vitality . " About two years later rumors of a different sort commenced circulating about Nicholas . Dignitaries of the Imperial household confided to their friends that the Czar had personally conducted a very strict inquiry into the associates and correspondence of the Crown-Prince ; official and court circles whispered of some connection with secret Panslavistic societies , and the English press-always excellently informed and well disposed-trumpeted the great news into the world that a gigantic nihilistic plot had been discovered , with the Czarevich as chief plotter . The truth was , a certain not numerically insignificant party in Russia , which desired a war with Austria , or even with the triple alliance , could not persuade the peace - loving Emperor to permit their dangerous scheming , and tried to entice the Czarevich into their nets . Mr. Pobiedon6stzeff , the head of the holy synod and the originator of the Czar 's persecuting policy against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanatic Panslavists Katkoff and Tschernisheffsky , succeeded in surrounding both princes with aides-de-carnp and companions who tried their utmost to incite their great Russian sympathies into the adoption of Panslavistic aims . Nicholas , with his susceptible heart and impulsiveness , became an easy victim to their schemes , the ends and aims of which were hidden from him . The Emperor learned of the whole intrigue , made a continuation of the relations impossible by energetic measures , and sent Nicholas abroad . His trip through Asia , and its sudden termination after the attack of a half-crazy policeman in Japan , are of too recent occurrence and so well known that I do not need to recall them . Worth mentioning is the intrepidity and presence of mind displayed on this occasion by Nicholas , especially in consideration of his youth and nervous temperament . After his return to Russia the Czare * Pet name for NichoIa*. vich was occupied in various official positions in order to make himself familiar with the administrative machinery of the Empire , and it can be said without exaggeration that he proved himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was permitted to see . In all positions and in every situation of his now wellvaried life he showed fine tact and a presence of mind which , in addition to his unbiassed judgment , made him a great favorite of the ultra-national as well as the liberal elements of Russia . This period and the intimate contact of Nicholas with all classes of the people brought about the romance of the prince 's life . The Czarevich fell in love . And , strange play of fate , fell in love with a daughter of that race which his father persecuted with inexorable severity . The prince , who would have been a welcome suitor for the hand of any princess in Christendom , gave his whole self , his heart and soul , to a poor Jewish ballet-girl . A great deal has been said and written about his relations to Miss L. , and the angry interference which they brought about from the Czar . But most of the stories are invented , and the truth is simply that Nicholas was so infatuated with his beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accomplished young lady , that he was determined to sacrifice everything , even his title to the throne , for the permission to marry her . Perhaps if his brother George had not been an incurable consumptive , the Emperor would have consented . But for the sake of lineal succession and to avoid possible future complications he withheld his permission , and Nicholas had to obey . It was repeatedly asserted , especially in German and English newspapers , that a clandestine marriage had taken place . To every one who is familiar with the house laws of the Romanoffs and the dogmas of the Greek Church this must appear ridiculous , because no member of the Imperial family can be wedded by a " pope** without the consent of the head of the Romanoffs . The Czar tried to persuade Nicholas to give up his love for the sake of state reasons , and not meeting a willing promise , he separated the lovers , hoping that time would mitigate the ardor of their affection . This seems to have come true . Nicholas withstood for quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven ( or is it heaven ? ) , // even the cunning devices of that famous match-maker Queen Victoria , until finally his energetic aunt Marie succeeded in bringing about his engagement to Princess Alice of Hesse when he attended the wedding of his cousin Melitta at Gotha . Some papers reported repeatedly that the engagement had been broken , and even some well - informed diplomats doubted its durability . But the Emperor had full confidence in his son , and knew well that his word was as good as a deed . Still , when his sudden illness developed so rapidly and seriously that he felt the approach of the end , he insisted upon a solemn betrothal in his presence , and Princess Alice was summoned hurriedly to his death-bed at Livadia . Be it that he feared the dislike of the Czaritza for everything German , and that the influence of the Pan slavists , who desired a union with the Princess of Montenegro , could contrive some intrigue to break the engagement , or be it that he wanted to prevent Nicholas from taking advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the betrothal , the fact is , Alexander III . did not rest until the young couple had solemnly joined hands before him , which was as binding as a marriage ceremony . Shortly afterwards , as if his last and fondest wish had been fulfilled , Alexander Alexandrovich breathed his last . Nicholas Alexandrovich , after escorting the remains of his sincerely beloved father through his grief - stricken country and interring them at St. Petersburg , took the reins of the government in his own so youthful hands . His first political , or rather official , act was a manifesto to his people . This simple message , with its winning tone full of love and reverence , which came from the bleeding heart of a grieving son , created universal sympathy and confidence . The manifesto was followed immediately by the proclamation of an amnesty for political and religious offenders as well as common criminals , the far - going liberality of which was unheard-of in Russia . As soon as etiquette permitted , the wedding ceremony was performed , and then , and not until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians . Here I would like to rectify a misunderstanding met with so frequently in the foreign press . It is often asserted that the heir to the Russian throne must be a married 4 man . This is not correct . Even the Emperor may be single , but he can not be crowned as a bachelor . Simultaneously with his coronation the Czar receives his consecration as the supreme head of the Greek Church , and as such he must be a married man , according to the dogmatic law , " A priest shall be the mate of a woman . " His honey-moon does not seem to have prevented Nicholas from attending to business . So far we have received the news of three very significant actions of the new Czar . First , he has ordered a thorough investigation of the administration of the Secretary of Railroads and Public Buildings , whom Mr. Witte , the Secretary of the Treasury , had reported as having sold timber and beams from his own estate to the government . Secondly , the Czar called a meeting of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most famous authorities on law and administrative matters , to confer about abuses and desirable changes in the existing government . The third , and not least significant , action of the new Czar I have found in an unpretentious report of a trustworthy German newspaper correspondent . The writer relates that he met by chance the Emperor driving unescorted in a plain carriage through a street in St. Petersburg . A shabby - looking individual threw a bulky envelope towards the carriage , but missed his aim , and the little parcel fell under the wheels . Some passer-by shouted in terror , frightened by the thought of a nihilistic bomb , and instantly a number of policemen in uniform and citizen 's dress-it is surprising how they grow , like mushrooms , on such occasions in the streets of St. Petersburg - surrounded the Imperial carriage and tried to grasp the envelope . But the Czar too had seen it , and ordered his aidede-camp to hand it to him . He opened it quietly , read carefully the letter it contained , and said warmly to the petitioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everything you ask for in this letter ; do you hear ? Everything as you wish it ! " And then he addressed the surrounding police sternly , " You let this man go , and mind well : do n't you dare to hurt a hair of his head , or to molest him in any way-you or anybody else I " This action of the Emperor does not need a commentary , and still speaks volumes . // But although such characteristic flashlight views serve to make us acquainted with the man Nicholas Alexandrovich , they do not suffice to answer that burning question , What may we expect from the Emperor Nicholas II. ? Still , on the strength of the foregoing sketch , we may be able to foretell his future policy , as well as human foresight can penetrate the dark . Four qualities , partly inherited and partly acquired by education , shine forth in the character of Nicholas H. Like his father , he loves the truth , and hates hypocrisy above everything . Like his father , he is religious , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Russian , although he may lean more to liberal innovations . Like his father , he is honest and moral in the highest sense of the word , and it can be safely predicted that his home and family life will be as exemplary as that of Alexander III . Not less deep than in these matters have his father 's example and teaching influenced the new Czar with regard to war and peace . Alexander Alexandrovich not only loved peace for the sake of peace , he worshipped it , because he despised war . During the Russian-Turkish war Alexander Alexandrovich had commanded the army on the Yarna , and the fearful outrages on the battle-fields , the cruelty of the slaughter itself , had made an indelible impression upon his religious mind . This accounts also for two very strange facts , which have puzzled the uninitiated not a little  --  the intimate friendship of the Czar and the famous painter Verestchagin , and his otherwise unexplainable indulgence for Leo Tolstoi . Both were fervid antagonists of war like Alexander himself . The one had painted with shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the other pleaded with the ardent inspiration of a prophet for peace among mankind , and protested unceasingly and energetically against the barbarous fratricide of nations . Count Tolstoi never would have been called to the important post of Secretary of Public Education , and he would never have been permitted to publish some of his books , otherwise impossible in Russia , if it was not for the sincere sympathy of the Emperor with his efforts to establish universal peace . This one thought , this intense " horreur " of blood and war , never ceased to possess the mind of Alexander . Whenever he V OL. xcI. - No. 541. -i 5 had to relate to his children his experiences in Turkey , he used the opportunity to impress them with his loathing , and frequently closed his remarks shuddering in recollection of some hideous scene : " Boys , war is dreadful , horrible , beastly ! May God keep you from seeing it , from drawing a sword ! " The civilized world has acknowledged these praiseworthy sentiments of Alexander III . by giving him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly be a doubt as to the like intentions of the son , fostered so impressively by the father . And in one other somewhat similar direction the character of the new Czar and his future development as a ruler may have a decided advantage over that of his predecessor . Alexander Alexandrovich was called to the throne after the sudden death of Alexander II . Over the dreadfully mangled body of him whom he had loved , whom he had believed to be good and noble and forbearing , he had to take the reins of the dangerous office . He never forgot that heart-rending sight , he could never forget or forgive the perpetrators of that beastly plot . He could not forget or forgive , because he knew that Alexander II . had signed the constitution demanded by the reform party on the very day when the assassins had slain him . Many of his seemingly cruel executions of so-called " Nihilists , " his often-condemned persecution of Hebrews and Poles and Germans ( not of Jews and Catholics and Protestants , as erroneously reported ) could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father 's assassination . Fortunately Nicholas II . does not bear such a sad heritage . Although his father was carried away quite unexpectedly in the prime of life , he died peacefully , resigned , and without leaving a painful blot upon the memory of his son . During the illness of Alexander , father and son , who had always been very candid and confiding with each other , had repeatedly long conversations , and there can not be any doubt that the Emperor has made his successor acquainted with his most cherished plans , and advised him as to the future . At that death-bed at Livadia many a wrong , many a failure of the past may have been lamented , and many noble resolutions , many liberal innovations been resolved upon amidst the irrepressible tears of parent and child . // All signs and frequent utterances of the new Czar intimate that he will continue to russify Russia , but that he will choose measures which differ from those of Alexander III . Every well-informed and unbiassed critic of Russian conditions must acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its population with regard to language , are indispensably necessary . The United States would play a risky game , with their Union as a stake , if they would not insist upon carrying out the principle of one official language in their administration , courts , and schools . If the Germans of Wisconsin and Illinois , the Swedes of Minnesota , the Czechs of Iowa , the French of Louisiana , and the Spaniards of New Mexico would be permitted to conduct their schools , courts , and legislatures in their respective mother-tongues , how long would it take until ultra-federalistic , yea , even centrifugal tendencies would arise and lead to grave differences , if not to a civil war ? The conditions in Russia are much more dangerous , because the population of the Empire consists of fourteen different nationalities , who live mostly in compact masses , distinctly separated from each other , and differ not only in language , but also in their state of culture and education , and in many cases in their religion . The russification of the Hebrews , Poles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it may be regretted or condemned by the members of these races and their sympathizers . Alexander III . would have achieved it much more easily and without arousing the indignation of the world if he had not lent his ear to Pobiedon6stzeff , the head of the holy synod , who tried to accelerate it by religious encroachments and a propaganda of the Greek Church . The new Czar intends to inaugurate a milder policy , as he gave proof in his manifesto to the Germans in the Baltic provinces , and by his recalling General Gurko , the iron hand of Poland , from his post as Governor at Warsaw . Much has been said and written about the dislike of Nicholas for the Germans . Certainly his father always felt like a sting the memory of the treaty of Berlin , where German diplomacy had robbed Russia of the well - earned fruits of the victory over Turkey . Doubtless his mother does not love Germany and the Hohenzollern , who have taken a province from her father and dispossessed her brother-in-law from the throne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the new Czar that it could prejudice him against Germany , or whether his wife , a German princess , will influence him sufficiently to overcome his dislike , the future will prove . But it can be taken for granted that his good common-sense and his pronounced judicial frame of mind will prevent him from letting an idiosyncrasy play an important role in his home or foreign policy . For the same reason the alleged French sympathies of his father and the Russian people will not dictate the future tactics of the new Czar . The alliance , or whatever it may be called , between Russia and France was necessarily created by the European constellation of the " Dreibund , " with England in the background , although a conservative , absolutistic monarchy coupled with a radical , liberal republic forms an unnatural , heterogeneous team . The world does not know the reason why Alexander III . never consented to have the diplomatic understanding sealed by a state document in black and white , but Nicholas II . is certainly familiar with every phase of this master-stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has assisted essentially in the financial consolidation of Russia , and the new Czar doubtless will not shake the foundation of this most reliable column of Russian and European peace . The point at which Nicholas differs widely from the views of his father and grandfather , and where he most likely will inaugurate a new policy diametrically opposed to a century 's traditions , is the relation of Russia towards England . The cable and the leaders of the great dailies in all European countries speak already quite familiarly of an " entente " between the bear and the lion . Lord Rosebery has launched a panegyric on Alexander III. , and numerous visible and concealed wires , worked by clever diplomats and members of Queen Victoria 's family , are trying to bring about an understanding between the two powers in various European and Asiatic questions . Is such an understanding , or even an alliance , possible between the two nations and governments , who have been antagonists for // decades ? I fully believe it is . Every one who knows the sentiments of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not the least antipatliy to England , and that amongst the educated , the society of the upper ten and the court circles , the preference for everything English , from language and literature down to dress and horses , is growing constantly . Actually the prejudice and dislike are only one-sided . The British accuse Russia of an invincible covetousness for India , and continually suspect some vile scheme for robbing them of their possessions in Asia . This suspicion is both unfounded and unjust . If the statesmen of England , and , for that matter , of the whole of Europe , would not be blind to the incontestable fact that the large population of Russia , with its enormous annual increase , needs an outlet , that the country naturally must have a seaport and a waterway in the south , Russia could develop organically and historically , and would not be forced to press in an easterly direction , contrary to its own vital interest . The famous political testament of Nicholas I. ought not to be construed as a greedy reaching out for Constantinople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be recognized by statesmen and the world in general as a logical politico-economic consequence of the geographical situation of Russia . England 's jealousy could be done away with , and at the same time the whole Eastern question solved , by making the Dardanelles as well as the Suez Canal neutral territory , to be used by all nations under the same conditions , and supervised by an international commission . Such a treaty would soon be followed by an agreement about a line of demarcation between the possessions of Russia and England in Asia , which would silence forever British fear , and foster the peace of the world essentially . By a curious chance I am in the position to give the views of the new Czar on this question . About a year ago a friend of mine , a German professor at St. Petersburg , who frequently published political and sociological essays on Russia , wrote a series of articles on the subject , " A Political and Economic Union of Russia and England . " After explaining the situation in a manner somewhat similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two countries on the ground of mutual benefit . Russia would find a profitable outlet for its surplus grain and meat in England by the establishment of direct steamship lines from the Baltic and Black Sea ports ; England would have in Russia the most advantageous market for machinery , agricultural implements , clothing , cutlery , and other manufactured products , which would constantl*r grow with the increasing agricultural prosperity of newly cultivated Russian territory . The two powers , so fortunately supplementing each other , could form a political union which would command the peace of the world by the unequalled strength of its army and navy , and could bring about the disarmament of Europe by an energetic appeal or by mere example , because neither the triple alliance nor any other combination of European powers would dare to face the Anglo-Russian league . My friend submitted his manuscript to the Grashdanin and the Times . From London he received a polite letter declining his article , because , as the editor wrote , " although the essay was admirably written , and would be interesting reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The grand mogul of the Grashdanin simply wrote on the titlepage , " My friend , thou art a fool ! " This fool was quite intimate with a young official who enjoyed the unlimited confidence of the Czarevich , and proposed to inform Nicholas of the professor 's work . ( In parenthesis I will relate the recent good fortune of this official , because it contains an interesting contribution to the characteristic of the new Czar . Mr. W .. as I will call him , served for the past three years in a subordinate position in the office of the Secretary of Education , and although being learned , bright , honest , and industrious , he could not rise for lack of a " protecteur . " The Czarevich , who liked to associate and chat with him , did not care or dare to push his promotion , and the superiors of Mr. W. were under the impression that the Emperor did not favor him . Shortly after Nicholas became Emperor the minister had an audience , and , after submitting some reports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquirements and diligence . Nicholas , guessing the real cause of this step , said , calmly : " Your Excellency needed three years to discover the fitness of this official for promotion . I do not think your Excellency // able to fill your position , and would advise your Excellency to resign . And as to Mr. W. , he does not need your promotion ; he will be my private secretary . " ) When Mr. W. handed the manuscript of my friend to the Czarevich , and told him of its fate , Nicholas studied it carefully , and said : " The author is a German idealist , but he is correct . I wish it would come true , although I do not see how it could . We can not propose such an alliance , and what English statesman would dare to do it ! " This remark of the new Czar shows more clearly than all official utterances his probable future policy . If Lord Rosebery , or any other English leader , would have the courage to break with traditional bias , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let this opportunity slip , we will see Nicholas try to reach his most desired aim by other means . It is true the Czar , be he ever so potent , can do very little by himself . He can neither stop the course of the world , nor alter substantially the trend of our times . But he may achieve a radical change of international politics ; he most likely will attempt it by an understanding if not a co-operation with Turkey . Some concession to the millions of Mohammedans in the Russian Empire , a treaty with the guarantee of the Turkish territory for a basis , may accomplish an alliance which would overturn all present conditions in the Orient and alter the existing European constellations . But such great political changes are not brought about in a twinkling , and the new Czar is too prudent to undertake them without careful preparation . Besides , he has other even more important matters on hand which require his attention . The great work commenced by his grandfather and continued by his father needs completion . I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the ball rolling by his decree to abolish serfdom . By the just manner with which he accomplished this difficult task he became the " Liberator of the people , " and at the same time brought Russia near the edge of ruin . The nobility had been recompensed for the loss of their farm hands , the liberated serfs provided with land from the crown or bought from their former owners . This required hundreds of millions , caused the extreme encum *I. brance of the government , and impeded the completion of other nost necessary improvements . Russia , hampered by the sudden change of agricultural methods from the operation of large estates to working small farms , weighed down by the burden of the enormous interest on her public debt , and boycotted by the European bourses , has successfully passed through one of the most dangerous financial crises in history . The peaceful policy of Alexander III . alone has saved the country from bankruptcy , and the unceasing labor and wise measures of a financial genius and honest official-Secretary Witte-have accomplished this difficult task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible time . Money was advanced to the former serfs to pay the indemnities to the nobles , and to buy livestock , implements , and seed ; many railroads were built and others bought by the government , the system of canals completed , mines developed , and the interest on the public debt reduced from ten and twelve per cent . to five per cent . annually . During the last years of serfdom the exportation of grain from Russia amounted to about 90 million poods ; in 1880 it had grown to 286 millions , and the latest statistics show an export of 405 million poods . The country is prosperous and progressing . All it needs is peace and time for a natural development . If Nicholas continue what his father started  --  and there can not be the slightest doubt as to his good-will - schools and higher educational institutions will increase , enlightenment and progress will flourish , commerce and industry will prosper , and Russia will take slowly , but steadily , its proper place in the line of civilized nations . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the man to lead his beloved people , that worship him , to the position which they deserve on account of many excellent qualities . If he continue as he commenced , if he make his conference of governors and law - makers a kind of " Lexow Committee " to investigate into the abuses of Russian law and officials , if he eradicate evil and promote merit as promptly as in the first weeks of his reign , he will indeed deserve to be mentioned prominently in history as " the Blesser " of Russia . From all we have heard about him , we may well expect it .
