txt That " the wicked stand in slippery places " is vouched for as a fact by authority so unimpeachable that Mr. PLATT , bruised by his fall on the snow-covered sidewalk , must yet find consolation in his pain , for wounds thus caused would seem to show how baseless is the general impression that Mr. PLATT is wicked . The place was slippery , and he fell . It takes faith of the real mountain-moving sort to enable one to believe that an adult resident of Chicago could rent a rice course to so distinguished a gambler as " MIKE " MCDONALD without being quite sure that betting would be a feature of subsequent equine contests on that track . Yet Mr. LAMBERT TREE , who , besides being a Chicagoan , is an ex-Judge and an ex-Minister to Belgium , to say nothing of several other opportunities he has had for learning the ways of the world , went into court this week and swore thot he had not suspected Mr. MCDONALD ' S intention to violate the betting laws . And the Chicago jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophistication , showed their confidence in its reality by giving Mr. TREE a verdict under which the Clark Street statesman will have to pay over as rent the comfortable sum of $38,320 . Lovely , indeed , are the flowers that bloom in the Garden . City , and the success with which these horticultural marvels can remain unspotted of the world is truly enchanting . From a catalogue just issued by an English dealer in second-hand books it appears that a new department in literature is forming , or at least that a new name has been found under which works of a certain class are to be grouped . This new name is " Trilbyism , " for under that heading the dealer in question groups a number of books relating to the Latin Quarter , and including , curiously enough , the " Vie de Bohelme " of HENRI MTJRGER . Now , as MERGER discovered  --  if he did not invent  --  the material which has since been rearranged so often by later writers , there is something of injustice in going to one of these imitators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is carrying injustice to the point of brutality - to label MURDER 'S own books with a word that makes thim out a follower of the school which he originated . If this kind of fiction really must have a generic name all to itself , Mimi Pinson , not Trilby , should be allowed to suggest it .
