txt It was said at the War Department late to-day that no news can be expected from any official source as to Gen. Miles 's movements until to-morrow at the earliest . It is calculated that he arrived this evening or to-night at the point on the coast of Puerto Rico selected as the rendezvous for all the vessels of the expedition . Whether or not he will undertake to make a landing in advance of the arrival of the whole expedition will probably depend en tirely upon conditions as he finds them . Should there be no Spanish force , or at least an inconsiderable one . on the coast , the troops will be landed to relieve them from the disastrous effects of being confined closely on shipboard under a tropical sun . The General has with him sufficient artillery to hold any position he may occupy , supplemented as this artillery will be by the guns of his naval convoy . Meanwhile the department is making every effort to hurry along the remainder of the expedition . Some troops are now on their way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the week . Naval officials are assisting actively in getting the troops off , and were engaged today in sending the necessary orders to that end to the commanders of the naval auxiliary vessels which have been placed at the service of the War Department . In the course of a day or two the troops brought from Chickamauga by Gen. Brooke will sail from Hampton Roads , where they have been arriving all day , and are ready for the transports . There is a probability that Gen. Miles may be delayed for several days in his landing operations for- lack of lighters , but several of these are now on their way , and others will be hurried forward as rapidly as possible . However it may be as to his speedy landing on Puerto Rican soil , it will be well along toward the end of this week before the active land campaign can be begun .
