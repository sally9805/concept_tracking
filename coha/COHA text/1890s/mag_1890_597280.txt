CHARLES W. SHIELDS . HENRY C. POTTER . THEODORE T. MUNGER . SAMUEL W. DIKE . SETH Low . RICHARD T. ELY . WM . CHAUNCY LANGDON . A PROGRAMME FOR LABOR REFORM . REPORT TO THE SOCIOLOGICAL GROUP BY A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF SETH LOW AND RICHARD T. ELY . I. STATEMENT OF THE LABOR PROBLEM . labor problem is not an isolated problem . The labor problem embraces a group of social phenomena which has the most vital connection with all other great groups of social phenomena . The labor problem belongs to the life of man as a member of industrial society and comprises one class of industrial problems . By industrial problems we mean those problems which find their origin in the efforts of men to gain a livelihood in organized society , and to do this in an orderly and peaceable manner , to secure justice , and to do right in these efforts , and to make all their efforts minister to the highest welfare of all men . The labor problem is but a part , although a very large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even our industrial life in its fullest sense does not exist apart by itself . All modern sociological researches show unmsstakably that the life of man as a member of society is truly one , whether this life manifests itself in language , in art , in literature , in religion , in the friendly intercourse and exchange of ideas among men , in the family , in education , or in the municipality , state , or nation . The branch of knowledge which deals with this entire immense territory is called sociology ; but anything like a complete sociology , or even a sociology complete enough for actual use , does not exist now , even if it may exlst at some future time . The weakness of the human mind compels us to separate by more or less arbitrary process the entire social life of man lnto parts and to pursue them separately . The discipline which deals with industrial society is called political economy , but we shall fall into serious error if we fail to remember that it is 1 Ingram 's " History of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1888 ) brings this out clearly in the treatment of the development of economic science . closely connected with every other social science.1 Industrial life , though dealing primarily with material things , is an integral part of the social organization ; it conditions all other departments of social life and is conditioned by them . The reciprocity of action-both beneficent and maleficent-between mind and body , by which health or disease in one produces the same in the other , is perfectly paralleled by the relation between the spiritual and scientific elements of civilization and the industrial element . The labor problem is not a single problem , but a whole group of interrelated problems to which , in popular language , the singular noun rightly attributes unity . The labor problem is a part of the great social question of our day , and it concef-ns us all vitally . We reach first of all this conclusion : The labor problem is only a fractional part of the entire problem of industrial society , andthe entire problem of industrial society is only one part of the whole social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the various other departments of social lJe . While , then , its scope is exaggerated by extreme labor reformers , its ramifications are such that it touches all men , and whoever fails to recognize this errs in an opposite direction . Recent industrial movements show that industrial questions now under discussion affect the merchant , the manufacturer , the farmer , and the professional classes , and in some cases perhaps even more keenly than the class of wage-workers . It is conceivable that a vast network of monopolies , crushing out all independent producers , might give to artisans , mechanics , and unskilled laborers as steady work as they now receive , or even steadier ; as high wages as they now receive , or even higher ; and might in the exercise of a beneficent paternalism cause strikes to cease . It by no means follows that this consummation would be a desirable one . We are not prepared to say that a society composed of a few plutocrats // and a vast mass of even contented day-laborers is in a truly prosperous condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with easy transition from any one grade to the next higher , or even the next lower . We arrive then at the second general conclusion : The labor problem is by 910 means merely a class problem , and we deprecate as most unfortunate any attempt to treat it as such . On the other hand , all social questions touch the labor problem , because the advance of civilization is a matter of vital concern to wageearners , who can not prosper as members of a diseased organism . The real advance of labor can come only as part of true social progress ; but true social progress is , in our day at least , impossible unless even the humblest classes participate to an increasing extent in the benefits of civilization . The most we could grant is this : as the most numerous class , and as the weaker industrial class upon whom burdens are too easily shifted , perhaps the laboring class is on the whole more deeply concerned in the various problems of industrial society than any other element of this society . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at society and its movements from the standpoint of the laborers , because their interests are identical with the interests of the whole of society . Wheneverwe truly advance the interests of wage-earners we necessarily advance the interests of all society . We might call this our third general conclusion . This can not be said without reserve for any other social class , for we see cliques and parties growing rich by the promotion of special interests in legislative halls and elsewhere , while society as a whole may languish . The laboring class is in reality the only class which is not merely a class , and this justifies the use of the now current expression , " The masses against the classes . " No one will , it may be hoped , take this as a justification of all measures which are urged upon or in the name of the laboring classes , or suppose that any sanction is hereby given to that claim of industrial preeminence sometimes advanced in their behalf . It was once supposed that factory legislation forbidding child labor , restricting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pluck me " stores , providing for general education of artisans , securing the safety of men and women employed in naturally dangerous occupations , was class legislation , but experience and science now have demonstrated that such is not the case . While English experience is not different from that of other countries , it speaks out more clearly because experimentation has there been carried farther than elsewhere . The seventh Earl of Shaftesbury- who perhaps did more for England than any other man who has lived in the present century was opposed by Cobden , Bright , and the entire school of doctrinaire political economists in his philanthropic efforts to secure what has become the present admirable code of factory laws in England , but he lived to see men like Sir James Graham and Gladstone publicly recant , while Cobden wavered . The nation , with the exception of a few extremists , now approves this legislation , and the political economist Newmarch but voiced the sentiment of scholars when , before the British Association , he declared that the Earl of Shaftesbury had by his efforts established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever.1 Scientific men like Huxley , however , come forward and from a biological and physiological standpoint claim that still greater efforts must be made to promote the intellectual , moral , and physical welfare of the masses , or the future of England will be sacrificed to an illusory and temporary prosperity . The argument is entirely in the interest of England as a whole , because it is seen that the foundation ofpermanent national well-being must in the future even more than in the past be found in the vigor of body and mind of the great masses . Ii . CAUSES OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE MODERN LABOR PROBLEM . WE must first notice that social problems may be a sign of health or of disease ; they may be growing pains of youthful condition or the symptoms of decrepitude or age . The masses are naturally conservative . A rude and uncultured mind is averse to change , but clings to tradition . The habits of forefathers are followed in speech , in garb , in manners , in industry . Servants in our kitchens resist undoubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that of an animal . It is only when man has attained a certain stage of development that he rises above a brutish conservatism and seeks - at first often in crude and mistaken manner - for changed and improved conditions . A youthful people , or an age of the world which exhibits the characteristics of rapidly developing youth , will show this restlessness under wrongs and sufferings , although a mitigation of these wrongs and sufferings has recently taken place , although this mitigation itself may have started the upward movement which looks like youthful growth . On the other hand , a decaying people , or an age of the world which is passing away , exhibits evidences of distress which are totally // different in character , however great to the superficial observer may be the resemblance . The distress of Rome under the later emperors was the agony of expiring life . We hold that we are now suffering from " growing pains . " So far we have reason for hope and gratitude . If we but know " the day of our visitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Almighty has given us in these last years of the nineteenth century , we shall find that we are but entering on the dawn of a more glorious civilization than the world has yet seen . This is our faith , and in it we find inspiration . A deterioration in the condition of the masses may be either absolute or relative . It may be positively worse than it has been in preceding periods , or it may have failed to keep pace with the general progress in wealth and civilization and with the growth of wants . On the whole , there is reason to believe that , absolutely speaking , the condition of the masses in all civilized lands has improved and not deteriorated in the past generation of the world 's history . Yet in some respects we are obliged to acknowledge even an absolute deterioration in large portions of civilized society . The old security of existence , which is a most important element in well-being , has largely passed away for artisans and mechanics . When industries were conducted on a small scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenter might never secure a fortune , but it was their own fault if they did not gain a modest competence . Work might be slack at times , but there was always something to be done . The skilled artisan owned his tools and called no man master . We can remember when in North and South he occupied an esteemed position in the American village . In the South , at least , though not presuming to social equality with the local magnate , he yet held up his head in his presence , and was at times invited to partake of his hospitality . Truly the golden age lies before us and not back of us , yet it were folly to deny that in leaving the past we have lost some good things . Existence now for the masses is insecure , because bread-winners , to a great extent , no longer owning the tools with which they work , are congregated in huge productive establishments and are manufacturing on an immense scale for an uncertain and even capricious world-market . To-day in the receipt of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , be thrown on the streets without a penny . This irregularity of employment and of income is most demoralizing . A man has a high industrial development who under such circumstances will carefully estimate average wages , and will in days of plenty save enough for days of dearth . The educated professional classes are unable to do this ; much less , then , the laboring class . Moreover , enforced idleness in our modern cities , almost devoid of opportunities for innocent and wholesome recreation , is apt to lead to intemperance and vice , both wasting the scanty savings of labor . The environment of the masses has , with the growth of cities and the concentration of industry , got to an ever-increasing extent beyond the control of the masses , and there is reason to fear that it has become morally worse ; certainly so for women and children , exposed to the debasing influence of the bad men found in every considerable human aggregate . The locations of industries are changing more rapidly than ever before , and this necessitates a roving laboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep root anywhere and loses the moral strength which comes from secure local connections . Taking human nature as we find it , we can scarcely expect that a roving population will fail to become a morally depraved population . Machinery has been both a blessing and a curse . It has in too many instances killed love for work , which is impossible where a man performs a mere routine operation , belonging to a whole which he does not understand , which he never sees . Mere soulless routine1 deadens all higher faculties . The mind and muscles acquire speedily certain aptitudes , but become inflexible at an early age . " What , " asks Professor Roscher , " must be the aspect of the soul of a workman who for forty years has done nothing but watch for the moment when silver has reached the degree of fusion which precedes vaporization ? " Perpetual changes in industrial processes render a former skill useless , and reduce artisans and mechanics to the overcrowded ranks of unskilled day-laborers , mere wretched drudges . When we compare the actual amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former wages , we find ourselves obliged to abandon that superficial optimism based on an imperfect analysis of industrial conditions . There seems to be an absolute improvement , but can we certainly say that this has been relative ? When we find men belonging to the same school of political economy , in arguments on commercial policy , arriving at the conclusion that the labor cost of manufactured articles is but eighteen or twenty per cent . of the entire cost , and then , by similar processes in arguments on labor and capital , endeavoring to convince us that labor receives over ninety per cent . of the product , 1 Called by Schiejermacher " immoral . " // we are justified in exercising a wholesome skepticism in regard to the value of all these statistics . The truth is that , as a whole , they are not worth the paper on which they are written . Scientifically speaking , they are not even worthy of refutation . A few establishments , belonging to a class in which competition is severe , are selected , and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduced . Meanwhile , instances tending in the other direction , such as railways and almost all monopolies , are passed over , and rent is not considered at all or is inadequately treated . The correct statement is that of Prof. Richmond M. Smith of Columbia College , in his excellent monograph , " Statistics and Economics , " that we do not know the proportions in which products are distributed among the various industrial classes , and until the science of statistics makes further advance we can not know . Several things should be borne in mind while granting a probable increase of wages in general . XVe must consider not the wages of a day , but the earnings for a year , making deductions for all the idle days . Furthermore , increased expenses in many directions should be noticed . We all understand this when we discuss the desirability of higher salaries for judges or college professors , but in talking about wagereceivers we too often lose our common sense . The migrations of which mention has been made , rendered necessary by modem production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had experience knows how serious a matter it is to move , even from one part of a city to another part . " Three removes equal a fire , " said Benjamin Franklin . Great cities which have grown up in this country render life more expensive than it was in rural communities . In Baltimore , street-car fares cost for a family living on the outskirts of the city one hundred dollars a year , at a very moderate estimate . Unsanitary conditions and sickness are another cause of increased expenses . A college professor , with a family living in a great city , will , it is safe to say , find it difficult to keep down street-car fares , medicines and medical attendance , and incidental expenses to the limit of the entire income of a day-laborer 's family . Increasing civilization means increasing wants of the most legitimate kind , and expenditure for food is now but a minor matter ; even food , cloihing , and fuel can hardly represent half of the expenses of a family living modestly but worthily in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . Missionaries among barbarous tribes find it necessary to arouse wants , even if but for a hat and a needless parasol , in order to start civilization . While we may lament the kind of wants too often experienced by the masses , we ought to rejoice in the fact that wants do increase , and strive to give right direction to expanding nature . Increasing wants signify that a formerly sufficient income has become insufficient . Formerly the rational expenditures of an ordinary laborer included nothing for books and magazines , but this is no longer the case . Another class of causes of the existence of the modern labor problem is to be found in the newness of our present industrial life . We look upon what we see about us as a mere matter of course , but the truth is , its most marked features are scarcely a generation old , and we have not learned to adjust ourselves to them . Let us turn our mind back a hundred years . There was then not a single railway company , not a single gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , still less any electric lighting company . No cause is more fruitful of social troubles than the corporation , but one hundred years ago we find Adam Smith gravely arguing that there was no future for the corporate form of industry , in his day weak and struggling ; because , acting through agents , it could never compete with individual effort ! What would we do without banks ? It is evident that a business world which could for a day exist without them must have been something very different from anything we know . Less than one hundred years ago there were but three banks in the United States , now there are over three thousand national banks alone . Free competition is something new ; industry on a great scale is comparatively new ; large aggregations of ski Wed workingmen not owning their tools , but working for employers whom they rarely if ever see , are very new ; the universal freedom in the civilized world of unskilled labor is not a generation old ; the right to buy and sell land as freely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer for the " Encyclopa*dia Britannica , " has well said : " The present system of competitive industry , which to most men is so rational and familiar that they can not even realize the possibilities of any other , is but of yesterday . Free private ownership of land , the free right to choose what industry you please , and to follow it as you please , have even in western Europe come into force only since 1789. " 1 ii ' . EviLs . LET us , in immediate connection with the foregoing , consider some of the evils of the 1 " Inquiry into Socialism , " p. 92. / // industrial situation which have a close connection with the labor problem . Only brief comment will be possible , though a. book might be written on any one of them . Child Labor . First of all must be mentioned child labor as one of the most fruitful sources of evil . Children are removed from home to the dangerous moral atmosphere of the store , shop , and factory at a tender age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is every Christian parent of the well-to-do classes to guard the every step of his little children . No one may associate freely with them without the closest scrutiny . Companions of evil natures and low tastes are zealously kept away . Even the law does not recognize the full responsibility of children , and at an early age recognizes no responsibility at all , or only a very limited one . Full legal rights and responsibilities do not belong to a person before the age of twenty-one . What then must be the natural and legitimate consequences of thrusting out into the great world , among the vicious and depraved , young boys and girls ? Intemperance and immorality are the fruits too often seen . Yet we have in the moral consequences only a part of the terrible evils which result from child labor in great factories . The children 's bodies are stunted , and a weak generation of workingmen and of mothers of workingmen 's offspring is the inevitable result . The mind is also dwarfed . Opportunities are offered to learn a few simple processes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often both mind and muscles refuse to learn new aptitudes after thirty . Normal growth is obstructed , and the very end of life , " the consistent and harmonious expansion of all one 's faculties , " is defeated . Childhood should be a period of innocent play and of growing bodily , mental , and moral power . A normal childhood is a source of strength to one 's entire life . The mind reverts to it and is refreshed . But in our great cities the children of the working poor are growing up without childhood . They leave infancy only to become little old men and women . They are wronged because not protected at a period when self-protection is an absolute impossibility . This is a matter of national importance , for as naturalists and economists both have shown , and as history has amply demonstrated , the source of permanent prosperity must be sought in the vigor of mind and body of the great masses . A successful national struggle for existence is otherwise out of the question , and decay must set in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing in the United States . The census shows that an everincreasing portion of our population is engaged in gainful vocations , and that this increasing proportion is largely to be attributed to the labor of women and children . The reports of the various bureaus of labor statistics but confirm the census reports . The number of children - boys under sixteen and girls under fifteen - who belong to the class of wage-earners , according to the census of 1870 , was 739,000 ; in i88o , x , xx8 ,  - -  000 ; an increase of 66 per cent. , and this appears to fail to reveal the true increase , because the enumeration is acknowledged to be defective . The increase of employees in manufacturing and mechanical industries was 43 per cent . for adult males , 5834 per cent . for children , and 64 per cent . for females . In twelve leading industries of this class women and children comprise a majority of all employed , and in some cases they have almost a monopoly . It is noteworthy that the evil of child labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from a valuable article on the employment of children , by Mr. John T. Crowell , which appeared in the " Andover Review " for July , 1885 . " If a child of a certain age , " says one operative whom Mr. Crowell quotes , " goes to work in a mill , constantly breathing a temperature of ninety degrees both winter and summer , it is suretogrow up puny and die young . " " Another stated , " says Mr. Crowell , " that children put into the mill at an early age become useless at the age of twenty . " Generally the children go out of the home into the mill or factory or store , but occasionally the shop is brought into that which serves as a pretext for a home . This was the case with the manufacture of cigars in tenements in New York , the law abolishing which the Court of Appeals most unfortunately declared unconstitutional . The Labor of Wome , i in Industrial Establis/irnents . This , like child labor , is rapidly on the increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is too often a most serious one , and it is desirable to restrict it . The wives and children of the laboring men become their unnatural competitors , and it has happened in Massachusetts and New Jersey , as well as in England , that the father has remained at home to care for the house and perform those duties which nature has assigned to woman , while wife and children are at work in the mill . Women become too often demoralized , and in mines so notoriously so that their employment // underground has been entirely prohibited in England . Children without a mother 's care grow up wild and undisciplined , an easy prey to the worst agitators and other bad men ! The question involved in the labor of women and children is no less than the preservation of the Americam home , the only sure foundation on which our institutions can rest . It is noteworthy in this connection that , in this country and in others , those establishments in which the laboring classes are employed for the largest number of hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children predominates . The Dwellings of the Urban Laboring Classes . This , like the labor of women and children , is a serious and perplexing problem in all nations of modem civilization . It is a live question in London and Berlin , as well as in New York , but nowhere is the situation more serious than in great American cities , and nowhere has so little been done to remedy it . Men , women , and children crowded together in unsanitary condition , and disease is accompanied by a fearful death-rate . The conditions of a wholesome family life are almost entirely wanting , and virtue is gone and character is destroyed before their value can by any possibility be realized . The slums of cities are breathing-holes of hell , and the only way to reform them is to sweep them from the face of the earth . " The mere endless persecuting opportunity " of the modern tenement house , to use the phrase of Mrs. Humphry Ward , is something which we have no right to expect feeble human nature to withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an hour or two is not rarely added to the working-day , thereby curtailing opportunities for cultivation and recreation . Formerly rent was a small matter for the greater part of the laboring classes , and frequently in the c6untry a garden helped to eke out a living . Now the growth of cities makes rent for an increasing number consume an undue portion of the family income . Formerly the artisan in village or country readily acquired a home of his own . Now in our great cities this is a difficult , and at times an impossible , thing for him to do . Sunday Work . This is a rapidly growing evil in all our cities , against which workingmen all over the length and breadth of the land are crying out , and their complaint is becoming bitter because their cry passes unheeded . Wherever laboring men meet in conventions this complaint is very apt to be heard , and labor papers agitate the matter perpetually . The barbers of Baltimore raised several hundred dollars to work an ordinance through the city council closing all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced , but workingmen elsewhere have not often been so fortunate . In some trades in New York , and doubtless elsewhere , Sunday work is all but universal . A few years ago there was , for example , scarcely a photographic gallery in New York City - even if there was one , which may be doubted - which did not do more or less work on Sunday , though perhaps not openly ; the great majority placed their show cases out for public inspection , and , making no pretense of observing Sunday , found that day the most profitable day in the week . A correspondent of " John Swinton 's Paper " uses this language : Is there any law in New Jersey in defense of Sunday ? If so , why is it not enforced against the railroad corporations ? When laboring men violate any law of the money power , it is anarchy , and the law-breakers are imprisoned or hanged . But when the money power violates all laws , both human and divine , there is neither penalty nor remedy . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Sunday , compelling its employees to work upon that day . True , the trainmen get paid for their Sunday work , because they are paid by the trip or day . But the men in telegraph offices all along the line are now compelled to work Sundays for nothing . So with the flagmen and others who are paid by the month . God knows it is hard enough to work for a mere pittance six days in the week , but it is intolerable to be compelled to work on Sundays for nothing , as we do  --  to desecrate the Sabbath and be deprived even of the boon of preaching . If this is not anarchy , what is it ? Arid how much longer shall the Golden Calf rule in New Jersey ? An editorial in the Chicago labor paper called " Knights of Labor " is entitled " Sunday Slavery , " and an extract from it reads thus : A grand mass meeting under the joint auspices of the Chicago Sabbath Association , Butcher and Grocer Clerks ' Association , and the Knights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , October 14 , i888 , to discuss the question of Sunday observance . Representatives from each of the above organizations , with other good speakers , will address the meeting . The question of closing the factories , workshops , and stores on Sunday is fast coming to the front as one of the important questions of the day . From thirty to forty thousand employees in Chicago alone are compelled to work for seven days in each week . How shall their shackles be unloosed and the slaves set free ? Men and women have been discussing this question as individuals for many months . It // is now time to discuss it as a body politic . Is it not time to cry halt ? Are the people , by their apathy , avarice , and selfishness , willing to blight the prospects of the working classes of America by condemning them to a slavery that knows no day of rest ? The secretary of the Journeymen Bakers ' National Union sent out appeals to the clergy of New York and Brooklyn to preach against Sunday labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sent out , but little response was met with . In reply to a query as to their success , the disgusted secretary sent this answer to the writer of the present paper : " Out of the five hundred circulars sent to the clergy of New York and Brooklyn , half a dozen answered . You will have a hard time , Professor , to convince the toilers of this country that the clergy will ever do anything for them . " The Philadelphia bakers , on the eve of appealing to the clergy of that city , wrote to the editor of their New York organ , the secretary just referred to , to get the results of their experience , but he dissuaded them from their project on the ground that nothing would come of it in Philadelphia , as nothing had come of it in New York . The purpose of this is not to condemn nor to uphold the clergy , but simply to call attention to a widespread cause of discontent . The spirit of the fourth commandment calls for one day 's rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be performed on Sunday . Night Work . This has become quite common in order to utilize the expensive plant of the modern manufacturing establishment . It is demoralizing for all , men , women , and children , and for the two latter classes ought never to be permitted . It is an evil to be kept within as narrow bounds as possible for all . One needs but to travel through manufacturing districts at night to see how widely extended is this evil . Overwork . It requires a perpetual struggle to keep the length of the labor day within the bounds required by physiology and hygiene , and often the struggle to do so is unsuccessful . No nation in which modern industry prevails has been exempt from the evils of overwork . Working days of fifteen , sixteen , and seventeen hours have not been infrequent , and cases are occasionally reported of men working for more than twenty-four . hours in succession . This used to be the case with bakers in some cities once a week , and we hear of such things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traveling public alike are endangered . Street-car employees have suffered in this way from corporate greed in all great cities . The labor day exceeded seventeen hours for street-car employees in Baltimore until 1886 , when the legislature reduced it to twelve . Excessively long hours weaken the nervous system and create a craving for stimjilants . It has been generally observed that shortening working hours leads , after a brief interval , if not immediately , to diminished intemperance . Another evil effect of an excessively long working-day is that the head of a xvorkingman 's family is thereby rendered incapable of performing his duties as the father of a family and as a citizen . Excessive Mortality of Working Pe*ple , especially of children . The influence of occupation and economic condition upon length of life has never been sufficiently investigated , but all investigations which have ever been conducted point with unmistakable clearness in one direction . There is no popular impression more entirely groundless than that the poor are blessed with good health . Physicians who work among the poor and in hospitals know well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bear convince people that they must be strong because they ought to be . For example , we often hear from American travelers a good deal about the robust health of German workingwomen , but an American lady who has worked among them in hospitals says that they are nearly all diseased , while it is well known that among German day-laborers in portions of Germany less than ten per cent . can pass the physical examination for the army . The most careful investigation as yet made into the effect of economic condition on mortality is that of K6r6si , Director of the Bureau of Municipal Statistics of Buda-Pesth , who divided the population of that city into three classes , rich , well-to-do , and poor , and had an examination made of every individual case of mortality . Excluding the children under five , among whom mortality is very great in the families of the poor , he found that the rich lived about ten years longer than the poor , and some five years longer than the well-to-do . English investigation about 1842 revealed a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the rich and professional classes as compared with the working classes . Among the children of the poor in New York over five hundred , at a moderate estimate , have died needlessly in one week - five hundred , that is to say , who would have lived had the conditions been what they should have been . // The chief health officer of Maryland calculates that two-thirds of the deaths in that State are needless . Careful investigations are wanting in the United States , but it is generally remarked that workingmen with white hairs are comparatively rare . The mortality among the negroes in the South , in some places , at least , appears to be nearly twice what it is among the whites . The negroes are nearly all of the laboring class , but many of the whites are also of the same class . On the other hand , a race problem complicates the question . The poor lack the means to guard their health , and their ignorance also shortens their life . Hazardous employments frequently produce recklessness . Certain occupations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distinguished statisticians of the century , Dr. Ernst Engel , says that the chief cause of death is social . In themselves the diseases of which men die are for the most part curable , but the resources to provide the means of cure are lacking . Does a physician tell a workingman suffering from consumption to take a year 's rest and go to Egypt , even if he knows it would cure the disease ? Immigration . Excessive immigration of foreigners , often of a low class , is a serious evil for American workingmen . It tends to degrade them and to make them socially less esteemed . These heterogeneous elements are unable to unite peaceably for the attainment of common ends . This renders workingmen weaker in all industrial struggles , at the same time that it inclines them more readily to the use of violence . We thus find all sorts of currents among this strange conglomeration , and a lack of harmony dangerous to the entire social structure . American workingmen , it is frequently observed , are inclined to respect the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless , when not interfered with , generally know well how to attain just ends in a peaceable manner . Whether or not this is quite a correct observation , the evils of excessive immigration are undoubted . Disadvantages of a Division of Labor . The division of labor is a necessity in our present industrial life . Nevertheless we should not be blind to its dark features . Some of these have been already mentioned . It develops onesided men who exhibit an excessive dependence upon employers . They lack the suppleness , so to speak , of the early Americans . They are not quick to turn hither and thither and seize industrial advantages . VOL . XXXIX. - 130 . A memorable remark of M. de Tocqueville attributed the superiority of Americans fifty years ago to precisely the absence of that division of labor now carried so far with us . These are his words : It sometimes happens that the same person tills his fields , builds his dwelling , contrives his tools , makes his shoes , and weaves the coarse stuff of which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to awaken the intelligence of the workman . Nothing tends to materialize man and to deprive his work of the faintest trace of mind more than the extreme division of labor . We may further observe the separation which it brings about between employers and employed . Formerly in manufactures they belonged to one social class , and even in this present century in New England it was a common practice for the apprentice to live in his master 's family . Now , often , they rarely see one another - sometimes never meet . Corj5orations and Trusts . These increase the separation already noticed , and large aggregations of capital acquire a dangerous control over the lives of employees . Vast combinations of capital lead in turn to vast combinations of labor , and in their contests the public welfare is seriously involved . Inventions and Discoveries . The benefits of these are well enough known . They also unfortunately too often reduce the skilled workingman to the ranks of unskilled labor . This evil has been already mentioned . It should ever be remembered that while labor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it is inseparably bound up with a human being , and direction over labor in so far carries with it control over another 's will . This manifests itself in the tyranny of unscrupulous employers over the politics and social life of the working classes , occasionally even over their religious life . The employer chooses the place of residence and , for the greater part of the working-day , the companions of the workingman . If the laboring classes attempt to control the selection of their companions , it is , according to the decision of the New York Court of Appeals , a penitentiary offense - the refusal to work with objectionable fellow-workmen being construed as a criminal conspiracy ! Accidents . These occur in large numbers and increase the class of helpless widows and orphans . It // is estimated that in England seventy-six per cent . of all accidents occur in industrial pursuits . Women and children are specially liable to accidents , and law has done less in this country than elsewhere to protect life and limb of the working classes . Probably no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees as the American . Over 2000 employees were killed and more than 20,000 injured in i888 . Their peril is spoken of by President Harrison as being as great as that of a soldier in time of war . This loss of life can be prevented , but money is valued more highly than human life , and it would involve expense for improved appliances . Elsewhere we find employers ' liability acts , but they are with us few and imperfect , and the tendency of our courts is to decide against workingmen in suits for damages . The New York Court of Appeals has so decided in case of accidents due to fellow-workmen . Moral Evils . These have already been incidentally mentioned . Churches have left overcrowded workingmen 's quarters , and spiritual oversight and culture are withdrawn . The family life is of a low type . Immorality is frequent . Marriages are thoughtlessly contracted at an early age , and the duties of parenthood are entered upon without any appreciation of their gravity . Parents neglect children , and later children neglect parents . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in labor quarters , while the modem city is almost wholly devoid of opportunities for wholesome , life-giving recreation for the poor . Insufficient food , more often insufficient variety of food , and poorly cooked food create a craving for strong drink and promote intemperance . One of the first physiologists in the land is authority for this . Girls are not trained to be housewives , and knowing nothing about cooking , sewing , or the care of the house , the dwellings of the poor present a cheerless appearance . Too few opportunities for saving exist , and these have too often forfeited the confidence of the masses . This and other causes produce thriftlessness . Class hate has been nourished by the struggles of social classes , and bitterness takes the place of affection and friendly intercourse . Both employers and employed must bear their share of the blame ; the former the larger share because their opportunities are greater . Employers too often look upon their relationship with their workmen as one of contract only , and fail to see that an opportunity to do good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A general widespread lawlessness is both a cause and a symptom of disease . Law too often would seem to be obeyed only when it is convenient and meets with the individual approval of the citizen . The highest and lowest classes sin most in this respect , but a true reverence for law is rarely found anywhere . That those in authority are " ministers of God " has become an empty formula . The disastrous and growing habit of the employment by corporations of armed bands of hirelings must be noticed as an anarchistic tendency . We may likewise mention as a serious evil , producing hatred and bitterness , the employment of spies and informers , with whom the ranks of laboring men in the United States are honeycombed as nowhere else in the civilized world . " The sure and steady increase of imprisoned criminals " is an expression used by Hon. T. R. Brockway , and this is only the logical outcome of the state of things described . The following statistics , even if accepted , as they should be , cu ; n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one prisoner to every 3,445 of the population . s86o 1,649 1870 1,172 s8So s88o aggregate 70,077 prisoners , and without counting juve nile delinquents , 58,609. iv . REMEDIES . THE evils described will suggest many of the remedies required for the diseased social body , but these remedies must be enumerated and described in the fewest possible words . Other evils than those mentioned will also be brought forward incidentally in the treatment of remedies . ppti inism . Perhaps one of the first things to be done is to vanquish and utterly drive from among us an ignoble but too common optimism , which blinds men to actual conditions , deadens conscience , and puts a stop to useful activity . This popular optimism of the day would have us believe that all things are as they should be , and bids us eat , drink , and be merry while our fellow-men are enduring such evils . This unworthy optimism is a lie , and surely those who keep it going are doing the devil 's service . From the rise of the first attempts to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has stood athwart the path of progress . Weak and imperfect as man is , it would be strange indeed if in this one department of social life which we are considering  --  the industrial field - he had attained perfection , while art , religion , // the family , literature , and politics are sadly faulty and defective . Sin , misery , and injustice everywhere abound , and all who try to be guided by ethical and Christian principles must strive uninterruptedly with all their resources to remove or mitigate these . While this ignoble optimism is rejected , we find as little occasion for pessimism . Progress has been made by those who in the past have suffered and toiled for humanity , and the field for reform was never more promising than to-day . It can scarcely be necessary to say that the attitude of mind for the study of the labor problem should be a sympathetic one . " The heart lying dead , the eye can not see , " says Carlyle truly . The personal concern of economists for the welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctness of the economic theories they advance . It is the business of life to perfect one 's own personality by the development of all one 's power , and also to strive unceasingly for the perfection of humanity . The two ends are not incompatible . Even were the labor troubles of the day all due to perversity and wrong-headedness on the part of the laboring classes , a thing quite inconceivable , it would but show the more strongly the need of missionary work of all kinds among them . It is true that many evils are due to ignorance and that this ignorance is common to all classes . Enlightenment is one of the prime needs of the time . The church . To establish a legitimate authority over the minds and wills of men , the Church must show the Christian faith and love of early Christianity - light for all and love for all from the ministers of the gospel will alone reestablish that authority which makes the Church what it should be , a healthy life-giving member of civilization . Individual and social moral virtues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be set selfdenial and simplicity , and those who occupy high station should lead in this . The Church finds part of her work in incitements to correct conduct , but her work should be more positive and should take hold of the life of men more directly and in more ways than at present . She is too modest in the territory which she claims for herself , and practically too much inclined to admit that there are secular concerns and secular days with which religion is not vitally concerned . The spirit of caste which separates man from man and produces mutual hatred is a chief cause of troubles , and against this headway must be made . But if the Church is to exercise control over social life , her ministers must understand this social life far better than they do , and this requires instruction from the best minds of our time . Social science should be pursued in every seminary for the training of ministers of religion . The Family . Perhaps a reform , purification , and elevation of the family ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is among the first ; and how far-reaching and diverse are the efforts needed for this purpose , what has already been said will indicate . The reforms which the family institution needs must be brought about partly by individual effort , partly through the effort of voluntary associations like the Divorce Reform League , partly through the Church , and partly through legislation and the action of government . One cause of labor troubles is imprudent and hasty marriages , also marriages at too early an age , resulting in feeble offspring , poorly cared for . It is the duty of all public teachers to impress upon the minds of the young the gravity of the duties which marriage brings , and to enforce in every way the responsibilities of parenthood . Among large classes of the community it is not realized that it is a grievous sin to bring children into the world without a prospect of means to bring them up properly . h*provcd Educational Facilities . Improved educational facilities are greatly needed , but our schools have not kept pace with the demands on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in the world thirty or forty years ago ,  - -  a doubtful statement ,  --  but that now other countries , like Germany , Switzerland , and England , are far ahead of us . The last part of the statement is true . While in the self-complacency of optimism the American eagle has been deafening us with his screams , other countries have been slowly but quietly improving their schools , and we have stood still or made but slight advance . Even such schools as we have are not sufficient to accommodate the children who desire to attend , and in cities like Chicago , Richmond , and New York children are turned from the school . But the demands on the schools have increased with the growth of cities and the division of labor . The old apprenticeship is antiquated and must be replaced by manual training and industrial schools . Girls ought also to be taught sewing , cooking , and other useful womanly occupations . Preparation for life must come to an increasing extent through the school . Compulsory education laws should everywhere // be passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right of a child ,  --  the right to existence carrying with it the right to an opportunity for an unfolding of its powers ,  --  and if parents fail to do their duty it only remains for the state to step in and protect the child . This is a more sacred duty even than the protection of property , for property is but a means to an end ; namely , the welfare of man . It is not an interference with the rights of the parent , but a protection of the rights of the child . Compulsory education should continue in ordinary schools until the age of fourteen , and be followed by continuation evening classes for three years , as in parts of Switzerland and Germany , where they have almost annihilated pauperism . Instructive are these remarks quoted from Mr. Samuel Smith , M. P. , who has made a study of common schools on the continent of Europe . The quotations are taken from an article which appeared in the London " Times . " Speaking of Germany , he says : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no such things , speaking broadly , as neglected and uncared-for children . . . . The great defect of our system that is , the English system is that it stops just at the time when real education begins . It allows a child to leave school at an age when its learning is soon forgotten and its discipline effaced . It is hardly too much to say that the two years ' additional training the German child receives in the elementary school doubles its chances in life as compared with the English child . The Germans are rapidly developing a system of evening continuation classes which carry on education for two or three years longer . In Saxony the boys who leave the primary school , if they do not go to the higher schools , must attend for three years longer- say until they are seventeen-continuation classes for at least five hours per week , but teaching is provided for them and they are encouraged to attend twelve hours per week . So complete is this system that even the waiters at the hotels up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two foreign languages . I must state as an undoubted fact that in Germany and Switzerland , and I believe in some other continental countries , the opinion is ripening into a conviction that the education , even of the poorest classes , should be continued in some form or another to the age of sixteen or seventeen . They find that wherever this is adopted it gives an enormous advantage to the people in the competition of life , and , above all , trains them to habits of industry and mental application . I believe that it is owing to this system of thorough education that Germany has almost extinguished the pauper and semi-pauper class , which is the bane and disgrace of our country . Indeed , I have not seen since I left home a single case of a ragged or begging child . . . . No country has ever suffered more from the abuse of individual liberty than England has done . Owing to this overstrained idea , we did not get compulsory education until long after the advanced nations of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into competition upon equal terms the Germans are beating us . . . . We , up to lately , resented all state interference , and so exaggerated the doctrines of freedom as almost to glory in our abuses . Private effort never has and never can carry forward universal education . Private gifts for educational purposes in the United States may amount to six or seven millions of dollars ,  --  a large part of it , as the president of Cornell has shown , misapplied and wasted ,  --  whereas the very inadequate expenditure of New York State alone is some sixteen millions a year . It is safe to say that we should spend three times what we do on our schools . Means for this can be secured by husbanding our resources , cutting off needless expenditures , and improving our system of taxation . Private individuals should continue to supplement public education and to take the initiative in reforms and experiments , doing in general what the taxpayers can not be persuaded to do . This is sufficient to occupy private philanthropy . Efforts like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these should be supplemented by a system of university extension lectures , giving to grown people instruction on economics , ethics , literature , natural sciences , etc. , and thus drawing closely together the masses and the highest institutions of learning to their mutual benefit . Dwellings of the Poor . Stricter sanitary laws are required , and a better organization of the sanitary administration of cities . Houses unfit for habitation should be torn down , and small parks provided to give breathing-places for the crowded sections . The beginning made in New York City deserves commendation . While not prepared to recommend at present the construction of houses by the municipality , we regard English experiments in this direction as worthy of study . Private philanthropy should concern itself more than heretofore with the dwellings of the poor and strive to make them fit for human beings . It is a sad commentary on our Christian civilization that when there is more than one man in New York City claiming to be a Christian who , alone and unaided , could reconstruct the entire tenement-house district or districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its slums continue almost unabated . Factory Laws . These have produced excellent effects wherever they have been honestly conceived and honestly administered . With us they have too often been a mere sham and farce . Unfortu // the rest of the civilized world . We recommend an adequate system of factory inspection by men of character - not political demagogues - and by men who have been trained for such work : further , heavier fines and even imprisonment for a violation of factory laws . These laws should include protection against dangerous machinery , sufficient fire-escapes , and satisfactory sanitary arrangement . It appears that , in the main , factory laws should concern themselves with women , children , and young persons ; not , as a rule , with grown men . No one should be permitted to work in a factory before the completion of the fourteenth year ; and up to the eighteenth , as well as for women , only fifty-four hours a week should be allowed , as in England . Physiological reasons and the interests of the home require this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a country ever yet suffered in competition on account of short hours . When they were being introduced in England , the ruin of English manufactures was predicted , but after their introduction England became more prosperous than ever . It was said that the ten-hour day would drive capital from Massachusetts , but larger sums were invested in manufactures after the law went into force than ever before . The calamities predicted in Rhode Island have not been realized . It is curious that never in the world 's history have shorter hours been introduced without prophecies of terrible evils and that never once in the world 's history have these prophecies been fulfilled . If we arrange in a line the names of the countries , placing them in order according to the number of hours worked per week , we shall find that the country with shortest hours is most dreaded in international competition , and as we go down the line we shall find longer hours mean increasing weakness in international competition , and that with few , if any , exceptions , countries with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with few hours and highly paid work . Factory laws do not prevent competition or weaken it , but simply raise its moral level in the manner described by Prof. Henry C. Adams in his monograph " Relation of the State to Industrial Action . " There may be instances , as in the case of street-car employees and steam-car employees , where the hours of labor for men should be regulated , but this is an exception . We may , however , lay down the general principle that interference with corporations , creatures of the state , may properly go further than with individual employers . Employers ' liabil*ity acts simply render employers responsible for the management of their 949 own affairs , and should become universal . We may further lay it down that we have come to a time for a higher development of laws protecting the person , shielding it , guarding it and all its capacities . Law has heretofore do exclusively been occupied with things . Administration of f/ic Law . This ought to be reformed in the direction of civil service , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . It ought to be firm but just . The letter of the law is equal , but he would be a rash man who would claim equality for its administration . This embitters the laboring classes , who feel the chicanery of law pressing on them . Police brutality in too many cities , and particularly in New York , has made extremists of once moderate reformers and ought to be stopped at all hazards . Already has American police brutality attracted the attention of foreigners . Responsibility should accompany power . Labor Organizations . Labor organizations ought to be carefully studied and their nature understood . They must exist , and to harass them by injustice , as is being done too often by our cou , rts under revival of obsolete laws and consffuctions , will inevitably lead to their degradation . A frank recognition of their necessity , an encouragement of all that is good in them , and repression of the evil , ought to be our aim . In the labor movement we have a stream which can be guided , but which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a call in every city , every State , and in the nation for public property defense leagues . It is by protecting the property of the public , that is , of the masses , that we shall secure general respect for the institution of property . The work of public property defense leagues would be , among other things , to guard public domain , public parks , and to secure for the public the full value of public rights , like the right to use streets by horse and electric cars , elevated roads , etc . The property of the public should be paid for and protected like property of individuals . Had that been done in the past , we should in our great cities have had three-cent street-car fares before this or large public revenues from street cars . Savings Banks . These occupy an important position in any programme for reform . Without thrift the masses can never prosper , and this must be cultivated by savings banks of undoubted se A PROGRAMME FOR LABOR REFORM . // 950 curity . Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state and municipal savings banks started . It would be well to have the debt of a city like New York held in small sums by the masses . This would also give them a " stake " in the city and produce excellent political effects . The admirable municipal savings banks of Germany deserve study . Should our National Government again have occasion to borrow money it is to be hoped that national postal savings banks will everywhere be established . Irn*nigration . General laws to keep out contract labor and all the most degraded and ignorant foreign elements are heartily to be recommended . JJIo ; zopolies and Corporations . The question of monopolies and corporations is a serious one . They have helped to make the labor problem assume its present dimensions , and that in many ways . Unlawful methods , such as " cookincr accounts , " declaration of unearned dividends , and the like , have defrauded tens of thousands , and have increased thereby the dependent classes . There is not a city in the United States where widows , orphans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been by them developed , and despair of honest government has nourished revolutionary and even anarchistic sentiments . Monopolies have their agents in all our legislative halls , municipal , State , and national ; bills are stolen from files , and legislators and judges are bribed . One form of bribing has become almost universal , and that is the free pass on street-car lines and steam railways , and telegraph franks . Popular rights are defied , and public property too often stolen with impunity . The remedies for these evils are of diverse kinds . First of all , the general corporation laws require reform in such manner as to secure individual responsibility of managers . Both civil and criminal remedies must be provided . Publicity and accountability are two proper demands . Experience shows that , where there is a determination to do it , measures can be adopted whereby it will be possible to place responsibility for corporate acts upon some one individual and to punish him like any other wrongdoer . Our national banking law may be recommended as a , model for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further restrictions for agricultural or manufacturing corporations are required . But what about natural monopolies , like gasworks , water works , electric-lighting works , telegraph companies , and railroads of various kinds ? These undertakings , according to English and American law , are public in their nature , but there are two methods of management ; namely , public management and delegated management of a corporation . Corporations become quasi-public agents and subject to control . We may fairly ask the question , in the light of experience , whether a satisfactory management by delegated agents is possible . There is no experience to show that it is . The agent becomes stronger than the principal , and a most disastrous struggle between public and private interests ensues . This inevitably leads to corruption . May it not be better by direct public management to draw a sharper line between the spheres of public and private activity ? Wherever this has been done the result has been most satisfactory . No town ever yet regretted , for example , the purchase of private gas or water works ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We thus separate on rational principles the sphere of the individual and the state , and erect a barrier against the progress of socialism . We at the same time coordinate public and private duties and provide a sphere for talent in both fields . Our life becomes a richer and fuller development . This is in accordance with the principles of self-help . The public bodies help themselves , municipalities providing themselves with water , . gas , etc. , instead of weakly calling on others-private corporations-to perform what are properly public functions . The weakness of States and cities is well known . They are unable now to protect individual rights . Not a city in the Union is strong enough to force street-car lines to lay properly grooved rails ; on the contrary here , all infringe on the rights of owners of carriages and other vehicles . Not a State in the Union is strong enough to protect the traveler by foot or by horse against dangers from steam railways crossing highways at grade . Not a State in the Union is strong enough to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle always goes on between corporations of a monopolistic nature and public authorities , and it lies in the very nature of things . Human nature is not good enough for our methods . We have developed paternalism of corporations , for which we should substitute , so far as this can be done , municipal , State , and national selfhelp . A beginning ought to be made in local governments . When they learn how to manage their own affairs it will be easier for State and nation to perform all their legitimate functions . It might perhaps then be possible even to leave railways in the hands of corporations , instead of placing them directly under the management of the Federal Government ; but at any rate , by // people of each locality beginning with reform at home , we should be best prepared for the future , whatever that may bring . There can be no surer way of improving administration than by making it of some vital importance.1 Other Remedies . Other remedies can only be mentioned . Amusement is of an importance increasingly recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these should be provided by the public when private initiative is wanting . This would prevent crime , and thereby lessen taxation . Every teacher of college boys knows that if a legitimate opportunity for the vent of animal spirits is not provided mischief will come . City boys have , however , no opportunities for innocent play , and mischief too often degenerates into bad habits , intemperance , cnme . Public libraries , like the Enoch Pratt library , which has done so much for Baltimore , ought to become more numerous . A reform of taxation has already been alluded to . Present State and local taxes are , according to unanimous testimony , unjustly distributed , bearing most heavily on the poor and on people in ordinary circumstances , those who are barely well-to-do . Besides , they obstruct industry and diminish opportunities for employment . A further development of labor bureaus may be mentioned , these to be managed by trained experts , and not by demagogues used as baits to catch the labor vote . Arbitration and conciliation have accomplished great things in some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper to make these methods of settling controversies compulsory for corporations . It is entirely a matter of expediency . We are not prepared to indorse compulsory State insurance like that which obtains in Germany , but we recommend the subject of insurance against accident , sickness , old age , and incapacity to general consideration , in hope that some plan may be devised for accomplishing so beneficent a purpose by ways more in consonance with American ideas . A development of fraternal beneficiary societies and of in- 1 Mr. Low 's opinion of that part of the present paper which treats of the duties of government is expressed in these words : " I have not studied the subject as widely or as deeply as Professor Ely , and I do not know that I am prepared to commit myself definitely to the principle which he has put forth as he has done . At the same time I am free to say that the result of my experience in the mayor 's office , for four years , has been to change the whole current of my thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts by insurance depart ments or by a competent registrar of friendly societies , is certainly desirable . Profit-sharing , when introduced by upright and prosperous employers , unites their interests with those of their employees most advantageously . Still better is it when laborers like the Minneapolis coopers themselves become capitalists and self-employers by placing in a common fund their savings and managing their own business . This always promotes thrift and temperance , and shows its highest success in the making of men.2 The prudent encouragement of codperation deserves commendation . Our ideal is a social state , not of equality , but of equal opportunities , giving to each the means for the development , complete and harmonious , of all his faculties . Not the self-made man - that is , the self-made millionaire - can ever be a model for the masses , but the contented and really prosperous artisan or mechanic , gradually getting ahead in the world , enjoying life , developing all his powers and living worthily with his family , partaking according to their capacities of the blessings of civilization . Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been left to themselves to work out the problems of industrial civilization , and they are not equal to the task . Our goal can be reached only by the harmonious working together of all classes , and whenever leadership falls out of the hands of the highest and best it shows disease . The laboring classes know their friends and will willingly follow culture and wealth , provided culture and wealth are wise and virtuous and show sincere devotion to their interests . The testimony of men like the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury bears witness to this , and Professor Brentano says that before the anti-socialistic law was passed in 1878 , even the German social democratssave , perhaps , a few insane extremists-were always ready to listen to a manly and sympathetic word , even from one who differed with them . We who write this paper have , in our experience with American workingmen , found abundant confirmation of this testimony . Let those who are fit for leadership assume leadership . Richard 7 ' .
