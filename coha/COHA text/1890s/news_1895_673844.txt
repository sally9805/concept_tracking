txt Miss Edith M. Thomas has in one of the . April magazines a poem entitled " The Compass . " It is a work of much literary . merit , but people who have really seen the instrument in question are likely to wonder whence the talented singer drew her information about its construction and idiosyncrasies . Miss Thomas shares , with a vast number of landsmen , the delusion that magnetic needles are " true to the pole , " and that , by noting the direction in which one of them points , the hardy mariner can find his way about the trackless ocean with ease and certainty . Such is by no means the case . As a symbol of fidelity the compass is famous , not for the reason that faithfulness is one of its characteristics , but because its numberless vagaries have rarely been called to public attention . As a matter of strict truth , the socalled " needle " shows a perverse and obstinate inclination to direct that end of itself which is marked with an " N " any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will a contrivance of this sort give much more than a hint as to the position of Alpha Ursae Minoris , and if , by some rare chance , it does for a while lie parallel to the terrestrial axis , the fact is of no particular consequence ; indeed , it is only an added cause of confusion , because , unless other and more trustworthy sources of information are available , nobody can know that the phenomenal event is really taking place . With but little exaggeration It may be said that no two compasses in actual use at any given moment point in the same direction ; that none of them points in any one direction for more than an hour or two at a time , and that it takes a man deeply learned in both mathematics and astronomy to discover just what even the best made and most docile of these queer machines may be up to . Sailors have a singularly charitable term for describing the freaks of compasses , and talk , not about their crimes and misdemeanors , but about their " errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , variation and deviation , to which all compasses are habitually addicted and to about the same degree . Being moderately regular , these are comparatively harmless , and to guard against their effects it is only necessary to be possessed of certain impressive books filled with figures delightfully abstruse , and which are changed with each frequent edition . About half a. dozen other errors which every compass is only too happy to commit if it has the slightest excuse , or even without any excuse at all , no computations applicable except in particular instances and at particular instants can be made . An instrument fairly well-behaved on . a wooden ship becomes an irresponsible and vicious maniac if transferred to one made of iron , A single illustration of this  --  dozens might be given  --  is the fact that according as an iron vessel is on one tack or the other , so will its " faithful needle " say first that one way is North and then without a blush contradict itself and as calmly tell the puzzled Captain that the meridians come together at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sometimes called " heeling error " and sometimes an eternally doomed outrage . The neighborhood of land , too , will often give rise to inexplicable freaks . Up in the Bay of Fundy a compass has been known to swing quite around on its own pivot within half an hour . Its owner 's state of mind at the end of that period can easily be imagined . No poems in honor of " the mariner 's guide " were ever the result , so far as known , of such an experience . So much for the compass 's reliability and its devoted affection for the pole . Miss Thomas is equally mistaken as to the construction of these instruments , at least as to those made for purposes other than the ornamentation of watch chains . She says that if you touch with a gentle finger the crystal which circles the subject of her verses , the light lance will drift to east and west , and then , after searching on every side , come to rest poised one self-same way , the way which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marvelous sea-wings and plunged her swan-breast through the spray . This is poetical license with a vengeance . No crystal circles a ship 's compass , though there is a strong pane of glass some distance above the card that hides the needle and accompanies its erratic drifting , and which would render impossible the experiment described unless the gentle fingers were armed with a hatchet or a belaying pin . As already stated , there is no " self-same way " for which the magnetized bar of steel searches , nor does it search at all , except , possibly , in ' order to find a way that it never used before . Of course the compass has its uses . Much more dependence can be placed upon it as a guide than upon the toss of a penny , and , with careful watching and much use of a lead pencil , its eccentricities can be controlled , but as a model of fidelity and as constancy 's exemplar it comes pretty near to being a joke . Its reputation is undeserved. ' and. - its ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of Jack ashore , and  --  poets must seek another simile for their own I devotion to duty .
