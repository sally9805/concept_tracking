THE ISTHMUS AND SEA POWER . FOR mor'e than four hundred years the mind of man has been possessed with a great idea , which , although by its wide diffusion and prophetic nature resembling one of those fundamental instincts whose very existence points to a necessary fulfillment , first quickened into life in the thought of Christopher Columbus . To him the vision , dimly seen through the scanty and inaccurate knowledge of his age , imaged a close and facile communication , by means of the sea , that great bond of nations , between two ancient and diverse civilizations , which centred , the one around the Mediterranean , the birthplace of European commerce , refinement , and culture , the other upon the shores of that distant Eastern Ocean which lapped the dominions of the Great Khan , and held upon its breast the rich island of Zipangu . Hitherto , an envious waste of land , entailing years of toilsome and hazardous journey , had barred them asunder . A rare traveler might now and again penetrate from one to the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of influence and benefit which , though on a contracted scale , had constituted the advantage and promoted the development of the Mediterranean peoples . The microcosm of the land-girt sea then only typified that future greater family of nations , which one by one have since been bound into a common tie of interest by the broad enfolding ocean , that severs only to knit them more closely together . So with a seer 's eye , albeit as in a glass darkly , saw Columbus , and was persuaded , and embraced the assurance . As the bold adventurer , walking by faith and not by sight , launched his tiny squadron upon its voyage , making the first step in the great progress which was to be , and still is not completed , he little dreamed that the mere incident of stumbling upon an unknown region that lay across his route should be with posterity his chief title to fame , obscuring the true glory of his grand conception , as well as delaying its fulfillment to a far distant future . The story of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not here be repeated . Amid the many disappointments and humiliations which succeeded the brief triumphant blaze of his first return , and clouded the latter years of his life , Columbus was spared the pang of realizing that the problem was for the time insoluble . Like many a prophet before him , he knew not what , nor what manner of time , the spirit that was in him foretold , and died the happier for his ignorance . The certainty that a wilderness , peopled by savages and semi-barbarians , had been added to the known world , would have been a poor awakening from the golden dreams of beneficent glory as well as of profit which had so long beckoned him on . That the western land he had discovered interposed a barrier to the further progress of ships towards his longed-for goal , as inexorable as the mountain ranges and vast steppes of Asia , was mercifully concealed from his eyes ; and the elusive " secret of the strait " through which he to the last hoped to pass , though tantalizing in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral energy which might have succumbed under the knowledge of the truth . It fell to the great discoverer , in his last voyage , to approach the continent , and examine its shores along the region where the true secret of the strait lay hidden , - where , if ever , it shall pass from a dream to a reality , by the hand of man . In the . autumn of 1502 , after many trials and misadventures , Columbus , having skirted the south side of // Cuba , reached the north coast of Honduras . There was little reason , except in his own unaccountable conviction , for continuing thence in one direction rather than in the other ; but by some process of thought , he had convinced himself that the sought-for strait lay to the south rather than to the north . He therefore turned to the eastward , though the wind was contrary , and , after a hard buffet against it , doubled Cape Gracias * Di6s , which still retains its expressive name , significant of his relief at finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow bis desired course with a fair wind . During the next two months he searched the entire coast line as far as Porto Bello , discovering and examining several openings in the land which have since been of historical importance , among others the mouth of the San Juan River and the Chiriqui Lagoon , one of whose principal divisions still recalls his visit in its name , Almirante Bay , the Admiral 's Bay . A little beyond , to the eastward of Porto Bello , he came to a point already known to the Spania.rds , having been reached from Trinidad . The explorer thus acquired the certainty that from the latter island to Yucatan there was no break in the obdurate shore which barred his access to Asia . Every possible site for an interoceanic canal lies within the strip of land thus visited by Columbus shortly before his death in 1504 . How narrow the insurmountable obstacle , and how tantalizing in the apparent facilities for piercing it extended by the formation of the land , were not known until ten years later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached the eminence whence he , first among Europeans , saw the South Sea , - a name long and vaguely applied to the Pacific , because of the direction in which it lay from its discoverer . During these early years , the history of the region we now know as Central America was one of constant strife among the various Spanish leaders , encouraged rather than stifled by the jealous home government ; but it was also one of unbroken and venturesome exploration , a healthier manifestation of the same restless and daring energy that provoked their internal collisions . In January , 1522 , one Gil Gonzalez started from Panama northward on the Pacific side , with a few frail barks , and in March discovered Lake Nicaragua , which has its name from the cacique , Nicaragua , or Nicarao , whose town stood upon its shores . Five years later , another adventurer took his'vessel to pieces on the coast , transported it thus to the lake , and made the circuit of the latter ; discoveriMg its outlet , the San Juan , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of the river . The conquest of Peru , and the gradual extension of Spanish domination and settlements in Central America and along the shores of the Pacific , soon bestowed upon the Isthmus an importance , vividly suggestive of its rise into political prominence consequent upon the acquisition of California by the United States , and upon the spread of the latter along the Pacific coast . The length and severity of the voyage round Cape Horn , then as now , impelled men to desire some shorter and less arduous route ; and , inconvenient as the land transport was , with its repeated lading and unlading , before the days of steam , it presented the better alternative as to some extent it still does . So the Isthmus and its adjoining regions became a great centre of commerce , a point where many highways converged and whence they parted ; where the East and the West met in intercourse , sometimes friendly , more often hostile . Thus was partially , though most incompletely , realized the vision of Columbus ; and thus , after many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , partial and incomplete , his great conception still remains . The secret of the strait is still the problem and the reproach of mankind . // By whatever causes produced , where such a centre of commerce exists , there always will be found a point of general interest to mankind , - to all , at least , of those peoples who , whether directly commercial or not , share in the wide-spreading benefits and inconveniences arising from the fluctuations of trade . But enterprising commercial countries are not content to be mere passive recipients of these diverse influences . By the very characteristics which make them what they are , they are led perforce to desire , and to aim at , control of these decisive regions ; for their tenure , like the key of a military position , exerts a vital effect upon the course of trade , and so upon the struggle not only for bare existence , but for that increase of wealth , of prosperity , and of general consideration which affect both the happiness and the dignity of nations . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circumstances , there will be found manifested this desire for control ; sometimes latent in an attitude of simple watchfulness ; sometimes starting into vivid action under the impulse of national jealousies , and issuing in diplomatic rivalries or hostile encounter . Such , accordingly , has been the history of the Central American Isthmus since the time when it became recognized as the natural centre , towards which , if not thwarted by adverse influences , the current of intercourse between East and West must inevitably tend . Here the direction of least resistance was clearly indicated by nature ; and a concurrence of circumstances , partly inherent in the general character of the region , partly adventitious or accidental , contributed at an early date , and until very recently , to emphasize and enlarge the importance consequent upon the geographical situation and physical conformation of this narrow barrier between two great seas . For centuries the West India Islands , circling the Caribbean , and guardi , ng the exterior approaches to the Isthmus , continued to be the greatest single source of tropical products , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In them , and in that portion of th' continent which extended on either side of the Isthmus , known under the vague am pellation of the Spanish Main , Great Britain , during her desperate strife with the first Napoleon , a strife for very existence , found the chief support of the commercial strength and credit that alone carried her to the triumphant end . The Isthmus and the Caribbean were vital elements in determining the issue of that stern conflict . For centuries , also , the treasures of Mexico and Peru , upon which depended the vigorous action of the great though decadent military kingdom of Spain , flowed towards and accumulated around the Isthmus , where they were reinforced by the tribute of the Philippine Islands , and whence they took their way in the lumbering galleons for the ports of the Peninsula . Where factors of such decisive influence in European politics were at stake , it was inevitable that the rival nations , in peace as well as in open war , should carry their ambitions to the scene ; and the unceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters , which , as in all maritime regions , must depend mainly upon naval preponderance , but also in part upon possession of those determining positions , of whose tenure Napoleon said that " war is a business of positions . " Among these the Isthmus was chief . The wild enterprises and bloody cruelties of the early buccaneers were therefore not merely a brutal exhibition of unpitying greed , indicative of the scum of nations as yet barely emerging from barbarism . They were this , doubtless , but they were something more . In the march of events , these early marauders played the same part , in relation to what was to succeed them , as the rude , unscrupulous , lawless adventurers // who precede the ruthless march of civi-. lized man , who swarm over the border , occupy the outposts , and by their excesses stain the fair fame of the race whose pioneers they are . But , while thus libels upon and reproaches to the main body , they nevertheless belong to it , share its essential character , and foretell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crest of a torrent , they betoken the approaching flood . So with the celebrated freebooters of the Spanish Main . Of the same general type , - though varying greatly in individual characteristics , in breadth of view , and even in elevation of purpose , - their piratical careers not only evidenced the local wealth of the scene of their exploits , but attested the commercial and strategic importance of the position upon which in fact that wealth depended . The carcass was there , and the eagles as well as the vultures , the far-sighted as well as the mere carrion birds of prey , were gathering round it . " The spoil of Granada , " said one of these mercenary chieftains , two centuries ago , " I count as naught beside the knowledge of the great Lake Nicaragua , and of the route between The Northern and Southern seas which depends upon it . " As time passed , the struggle for the mastery inevitably resulted , by a kind of natural selection , in the growing predominance of that island people in whom commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lawlessness of the period favored the ext*ension of their power and influence ; for it removed from the free play of a nation 's innate powers the fetters which are imposed by our present elaborate framework of precedents , constitutions , and international law . Admirably adapted as these are to the conservation and regular working of a political system , they are nevertheless , however wise , essentially artificial , and hence are ill adapted to a transition state , - to a period in which order is evolving out of chaos , where the result is durable exactly in proportion to the freedom with which the natural forces are allowed to act , and to reach their own equilibrium without extraneous interference . Nor are such periods confined to the early days of mere lawlessness . They recur whenever a crisis is reached in the career of a nation ; when old traditions , accepted maxims , or written constitutions have been outgrown , in whole or in part ; when the time has come for a people to recognize that the limits imposed upon its expansion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be applicable to its own changed conditions and those of the world . The question then raised is not whether the constitution , as written , shall be respected . It is how to reach modifications in the constitution - and that betimes - so that the genius and awakened intelligence of the people may be free to act , without violating that respect for its fundamental law upon which national stability ultimately depends . It is a curious feature of our current journalism that it is clear-sighted and prompt to see the unfortunate trammels in which certain of our religious bodies are held , by the castiron tenets imposed upon them by a past generation , while at the same time political tenets , similarly ancient , and imposed with a like ignorance of a future which is our present , are freely invoked to forbid this nation from extending its power and necessary enterprise into and beyond the seas , to which on every side it has now attained . During the critical centuries when Great Britain was passing through that protracted phase of her history in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became , through the power of the sea , the very keystone and foundation upon which rested the commercial - for a time even the political - fabric of Europe , the free action of her statesmen and people was clogged by no uneasy sense that the national genius was in // conflict with artificial , self-imposed restrictions . She plunged into the brawl of nations that followed the discovery of a new world , of an unoccupied if not unclaimed inheritance , with a vigor and an initiative which gained ever-accelerated momentum and power as the years rolled by . Far and wide , in every sea , through every clime , her seamen and her colonists spread ; but while their political genius and traditions enabled them , in regions adapted to the physical well-being of the race , to found selfgoverning colonies which have developed into one of the greatest of free states , they did not find , and have never found , that the possession of and rule over barbarous , or semi-civilized , or inert tropical communities were inconsistent with the maintenance of political liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad principle of freedom in the national life is sufficiently attested by centuries of steady growth , that surest evidence of robust vitality . But , while conforming in the long run to the dictates of natural justice , no feeble scrupulosity impeded the nation 's advance to power , by which alone its mission and the law of its being could be fulfilled . No artificial fetters were forged to cramp the action of the state , nor was it drugged with political narcotics to dwarf its growth . In the region here immediately under consideration , Great Britain entered the contest under conditions of serious disadvantage . The glorious burst of maritime and colonial enterprise which marked the reign of Elizabeth , and the dawn of a new era when the country recognized the sphere of its true greatness , was confronted by the full power of Spain , as yet outwardly unshaken , in actual tenure of the most important positions in the Caribbean and the Spanish Main , and claiming the right to exclude all others from that quarter of the world . How brilliantly this claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been then in fashion , there might have been urged , to turn England from the path which has made her what she is , the same arguments that are now so freely used to deter our own country from even accepting such advantages as are ready to drop into her lap . If it be true that Great Britain 's maritime policy is now to some extent imposed by the present necessities of the little group of islands which form the nucleus of her strength , it is not true that any such necessities first impelled her to claim her share of influence in the world , her part in the great drama of nations . Not for such reasons did she launch out upon the career which is perhaps the noblest yet run by any people . It could then have been said to her , as it is now said to us , " Why go beyond your own borders ? Within them you have what suffices for your needs and those of your population . There are manifold abuses within to be corrected , manifold miseries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Defend yourself , if attacked ; being , however , always careful to postpone preparation to the extreme limit of imprudence . Sphere of influence , ' ' part in the world , ' national prestige , ' - there are no such things ; or if there be , they are not worth fighting for . " What England would have been , bad she so reasoned , is matter for speculation ; that the world would have been poorer may be confidently affirmed . As the strength of Spain waned apace during the first half of the seventeenth century , the external efforts of Great Britain also slackened through the rise of internal troubles , which culminated in the Great Rebellion , and absorbed for the time all the energies of the people . The momentum acquired under Drake , Raleigh , and their associates was lost , and an occasion , opportune through the exhaustion of the great enemy , Spain , passed unimproved . But , though thus temporarily checked , the national tendency remained , and quickly resumed its sway when Cromwell 's mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His clear-sighted statesmanship , as well as the immediate necessities of his internal policy , dictated the strenuous assertion by sea of Great Britain 's claim not only to external respect , which he rigorously exacted , but also to her due share in influencing the world outside her borders . The nation quickly responded to his proud appeal , and received anew the impulse upon the road to sea power which has never since been relaxed . To him were due the measures - not , perhaps , economically the wisest , judged by modern lights , but more than justified by the conditions of his times - which drew into English hands the carrying trade of the world . The glories of the English navy as an organized force date also from his short rule ; and it was he who , in 1655 , laid a firm basis for the development of the country 's sea power in the Caribbean , by the conquest of Jamaica , from a military standpoint the most decisive of all single positions in that sea for the control of the Jsthmus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted from the failure of the leaders to accomplish Cromwell 's more immediate purpose of reducing San Domingo , - that in so far the particular fortunate issue was of the nature of an accident ; but this fact serves only to illustrate more emphatically that , when a general line of policy , whether military or political , is correctly chosen upon sound principles , incidental misfortunes or disappointments do not frustrate the conception . The sagacious , far-seeing motive which prompted Cromwell 's movement against the West Indian possessions of Spain was to contest the latter 's claim to the monopoly of that wealthy region ; and he looked upon British extension in the islands as simply a stepping-stone to control upon the adjacent continent . It is a singular commentary upon the blindness of historians to the true secret of Great Britain 's rise among the nations , and of the eminent position she has so long held , that writers so far removed from each other in time and characteristics as Huine and the late J. R. Green should detect in this farreaching effort of the Protector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper misled by the strength of religious enthusiasm . " " A statesman of wise political genius , " according to them , would have fastened his eyes rather upon the growing power of France , " and discerned the beginning of that great struggle for supremacy " which was fought out under Louis XIV . But to do so would have been only to repeat , by anticipation , the fatal error of that great monarch , which forever forfeited for France the control of the seas , in which the surest prosperity of nations is to be found ; a mistake , also , far more ruinous to the island kingdom than it was to her continental rival , bitter though the fruits thereof have been to the latter . Hallam , with clearer insight , says : " When Cromwell declared against Spain , and attacked her West Indian possessions , there was little pretense , certainly , of justice , but not by any means , as I conceive , the impolicy sometimes charged against him . So auspicious was his star that the very failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the triumphs of her former kings . " Most true ; but because his star was dispatched in the right direction to look for fortune , - by sea , not by land . The great aim of the Protector was checked by his untimely death , which perhaps also definitely frustrated a fulfillinent , in the actual possession of the Isthmus , that in his strong hands might have been feasible . His idea , however , remained prominent among the purposes of the English people , as distinguished from their rulers ; and in it , as has before been said , is to be recognized the significance of the exploits of the buccaneers , during the period of external debility which characterized the reigns of // the second Charles and James . With William of Orange the government again placed itself at the head of the national aspirations , as their natural leader ; and the irregular operations of the freebooters were merged in a settled national policy . This , although for a moment ( liverted from its course by temporary exigencies , was clearly formulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Dutchman entered upon the War of the Spanish Succession , the last great act of his political life . From the Peace of Utrecht , that closed this war in 1713 , the same design was pursued with everincreasing intensity , but with steady success , and with it was gradually associated the idea of controlling also the communication between the two oceans by way of the Isthmus . Of this , the best known instance , because of its connection with the great name of Nelson , was the effort made by him , in conjunction with a land force , in 1780 , when still a simple captain , to take possession of the course of the San Juan , and so of the interoceanic route through Lake Nicaragua . The attempt ended disastrously , owing partly to the climate , and partly to the strong series of works , numbering no less than twelve , which the Spaniards , duly sensible of the importance of the position , had constructed between the lake and the mouth of the river . Difficulties such as were encountered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While neither blind nor indifferent to the advantages conferred by actual possession , through which she had elsewhere so abundantly profited , the prior and longestablished occupation by Spain prevented her obtaining by such means the control she ardently coveted , and in great measure really exercised . The ascendency which made her , and still makes her , the dominant factor in the political system of the West Indies and the Isthmus resulted from her sea power , understood in its broadest s*nse . She was the great trader , source of supplies , and medium of intercourse between the various colonies themselves , and from theiii to the outer world ; while the capital and shipping employed hi this traffic were protected by a powerful navy , which , except on very rare occasions , was fully competent to its work . Thus , while unable to utilize and direct the resources of the region , as she could have done had it been her own property , she secured the fruitful use and reaped the profit of such commercial transactions as were possible under the inert and narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the conditions to-day are substantially the same as those of a century ago . Possession still vests in states and races which have not yet attained the faculty of developing by themselves the advantages conferred by nature ; and control will still abide with those whose ships , whose capital , whose traders support the industrial system of the region , provided these are backed by a naval force adequate to the demands of the military situation , rightly understood . To any foreign state , control at the Central American Isthmus means naval control , naval predominance , to which tenure of the land is at best but a convenient incident . Such , in brief , was the general tendency of events until the time when the Spanish colonial empire began to break up , in 1808-10 , and the industrial system of the West India islands to succumb under the approaching abolition of slavery . The concurrence of these two decisive incidents , and the confusion which ensued in the political and economical conditions , rapidly reduced the Isthmus and its approaches to an insignificance from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially restored . Its importance , however , depends upon causes more permanent , in the natural order of things , than does that of the islands , which , under existing circumstances , and under any circumstances that can as yet be fore* // seen , derive their consequence chiefly from the effect which may from them be exerted upon the tenure of the Isthmus . Hence , the latter , after a period of comparative obscurity , again emerged into notice as a vital political factor , when the spread of the United States to the Pacific raised the question of rapid and secure communication between our t*wo great seaboards . The Mexican War , the acquisition of California , the discovery of gold , and the mad rush to the diggings which followed , hastened , but by no means originated , the necessity for a settlement of the intricate problems involved , in which the United States , from its positions on the two seas , has the predominant interest . But , though predominant , ours is not the sole interest ; though less vital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , accordingly , no settlement can be considered to constitute an equilibrium , much less a finality , which does not at once effect our preponderating influence , and also insure the natural rights of other peoples . So far as the logical distinction between commercial and political will hold , it may be said that our interest is both commercial and political , that of other states almost wholly corninercial . The same national characteristics that of old made Great Britain the chief contestant in all questions of maritime importance - with the Dutch in the Mediterranean , with France in the East Indies , and with Spain in the West - have made her also the exponent of foreign opposition to our own asserted interest in the Isthmus . The policy initiated by Cromwell , of systematic aggression in the Caribbean , and of naval expansion and organization , has resulted in a combination of naval force with naval positions unequaled , though not wholly unrivaled , in that sea . And since , as the great seacarrier , Great Britain has a preponderating natural interest in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should jealously scrutinize every proposition for the modification of existing arrangements , conscious as she is of power to assert her claims , in* case the question should be submitted to the last appeal . Nevertheless , although from the nature of the occupations which constitute the welfare of her people , as well as from the characteristics of her power , Great Britain seemingly has the larger immediate stake in a prospective interoceanic canal , it has been on her part tacitly recognized , as on our side openly asserted , that the bearing of all questions of Isthmian transit upon our national progress , safety , and honor is more direct and more urgent than upon hers . That she has so felt is plain from the manner in which she has yielded before our tenacious remonstrances , in cases where the control of the Isthmus was evidently the object of her action , - as in the matters of the tenure of the Bay Islands , and of the protectorate of the Mosquito Coast . Our superior interest appears also from the nature of the conditions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as these changes are purely commercial , they will operate to some extent to the disadvantage of Great Britain ; because the result will be to bring our Atlantic seaboard , the frontier of a rival manufacturing and commercial state , much nearer to the Pacific than it now is , and nearer to many points of that ocean than is England . To make a rough general statement , easily grasped by a reader without the map before him , Liverpool and New York are at present about equidistant , by water , from all points on the west coast of America , from Valparaiso to British Columbia . This is due to the fact that , to go through the Straits of Magellan , vessels from both ports must pass near Cape St. Roque , on the east coast of Brazil , which is nearly the same distance from each . If the Nicaragua Canal existed , the line on the Pacific equidistant fr*m the two cities named // would pass , roughly , by Yokohama , Shanghae , Hong Kong , and Melbourne , or along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Liverpool , in this case , using the Suez Canal , and New York that of Nicaragua . In short , the line of equidistance would be shifted from the eastern shore of the Pacific to its western coast , and all points of that ocean east of Japan , China , and Australia , for example , the Hawaiian Islands , would be nearer to New York than to Liverpool . A recent British . writer calculates that about one eighth of the existing trade of the British Islands would be unfavorably affected by the competition thus introduced . But this result , though a matter of national concern , is political only in so far as commercial prosperity or adversity modifies a nation 's current history ; that is , indirectly . The principal questions affecting the integrity or security of the British Empire are not seriously involved , for almost all of its component parts lie within the regions whose mutual bond of union and shortest line of approach are the Suez Canal . Nowhere has Great Britain so little territory at stake , nowhere has she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon whose relations to the world at large , and to ourselves in particular , the Nicaragua Canal will exert the greatest influence . The chief political result of the Nicaragua Canal will be to bring our Pacific coast nearer , not only to our Atlantic seaboard , but also to the great navies of Europe . Therefore , while the commercial gain , through an uninterrupted water carriage , will be large , and is clearly indicated by the acrimony with which a leading journal , apparently in the interest of the great transcontinental roads , has lately maintained the singular assertion that water transit is obsolete as compared with land carriage , it is still true that the canal will present an elemuent of much weakness from the mili tary point of view . Except to those optimists whose faith in the regeneration of human nature is so robust as to reject war as an impossible contingency , this consideration must occasion serious thought concerning the policy to be adopted by the United States . The subject , so far , has given rise only to diplomatic arrangement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may always be confined ; but the misunderstandings and protracted disputes that followed the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty , and the dissatisfaction with the existing status that still obtains among many of our people , give warning that our steps , as a nation , should be governed by some settled notions , too universally held to be set aside by a mere change of adniinistration or caprice of popular will . Reasonable discussion , which tends , either by its truth or its evident errors , to clarify and crystallize public opinion on so important a matter , can never be amiss . This question , from an abstract , speculative phase of the Monroe Doctrine , took on the concrete and somewhat urgent form of security for our trans-isthmian routes against foreign interference towards the middle of this century , when the attempt to settle it was made by the oft-mentioned Clayton - Bulwer Treaty , signed April 19 , 1850 . Great Britain was then found to be in possession , actual or constructive , of certain continental positions and of some outlying islands which would contribute not only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which experience has shown to be the natural consequence of the proximity of a strong power to a weak one . These positions depended upon , indeed their tenure originated in , the possession of Jamaica , thus justifying Cromwell 's forecast . Of them , the Belize , a strip of coast two hundred miles long , on the Bay of Honduras , immediately south of Yucatan , wa* so far from the Isthmus proper , and so little likely to affect the canal question , that the American nego // tiator was satisfied to allow its tenure to pass unquestioned , neither admitting nor denying anything as to the rights of England thereto . Its first occupation had been by British freebooters , who " squatted " there a very few years after Jamaica fell . They went to cut logwood , succeeded in holding their ground against the efforts of Spain to dislodge them , and their right to occupancy and to fell timber was afterwards allowed by treaty . Since the signature of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty , this " settlement , " as it was styled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by a convention with Guatemala contracted in 1859 . Later , in 1862 , the quondam " settlement " and recent " possession " was , by royal commission , erected into *t full colony , subordinate to the government of Jamaica . Guatemala being a Central American state , this constituted a distinct advance of British dominion in Central America , contrary to the terms of our treaty . A more important claim of Great Britain was to the protectorate of the Mosquito Coast , - a strip understood by her to extend from Cape Gracias * Dios south to the San Juftn River . In its origin , this asserted right differed little from similar transactions between civilized man and savages , in all times and all places . In 1687 , thirty years after the island was acquired , a chiet of the aborigines there settled was carried to Jamaica , received some paltry presents , and accepted British protection . While Spanish control lasted , a certain amount of squabbling and fighting went on between the two nations ; but when the questions arose between England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the so - called protectorate , which rested , in her opinion , upon no sufficient legal ground as against the prior right of Spain , that was held to have passed to Nicaragua when the latter achieved its independence . The Mosquito Coast was too close to the expected canal for its tenure to be considered a matter of indi*Terence . Similar ground was taken with regard to the Bay Islands , Ruatan and others , stretching along the south side of the Bay of Honduras , near the coast of the republic of that name , and so uniting , under the control of the great naval power , the Belize to the Mosquito Coast . The United States maintained that these islands , then occupied by Great Britain , belonged in full right to Honduras . Under these de facto conditions of British occupatioti , the United States negotiator , in his eagerness to obtain the recession of the disputed points to the Spanish-American republics , seems to have paid too little regard to future bearings of the subject . Men 's minds were also dominated then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly half a century , by the maxims delivered as a tradition by the founders of the republic , who deprecated annexations of territory abroad . The upshot was that , in consideration of Great Britain 's withdrawal from Mosquitia and the Bay Islands , to which , by our contention , she had no right , and therefore really yielded nothing but a dispute , we bound ourselves , as did she , without term , to acquire no territory in Central America , and to guarantee time neutrality not only of the contemplated canal , but of any other that might be constructed . A special article , the eighth , was incorporated in the treaty to this effect , stating expressly that the wish of the two governments was " not only to accomplish a particular object , but to establish a general principle . " Considerable delay ensued in the restoration of the islands and of the Mosquito Coast to Honduras and Nicaragua , - a delay attended with prolonged discussion and serious misunderstanding between the United States and Great Britain . The latter claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debarred herself only from future acquisitions of // territory in Central America ; whereas our government asserted , and persistently instructed its agents , that its understanding had been that an entire abandonment of all possossion , present and future , was secured by the agreement . It is difficult , in reading the first article , not to feel that , although the practice was perhaps somewhat sharp , the wording can *ustain the British position quite as well as the more ingenuous confidence of the United States negotiator ; an observation interesting chiefly as showing the eagerness on the one side , whose contention was the weaker in all save right , and the wariness on the other , upon whom present possession and naval power conferred a marked advantage in making a bargain ; By 1860 , however , the restorations had been made , and the ClaytonBulwer Treaty has since remained the international agreement , defining our relations to Great Britain on the Isthmus . Of the subsequent wrangling over this unfortunate treaty , if so invidious a term may be applied to the dignified utterances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our own country can not but regret and resent any formal stipulations which fetter its primacy of influence and control on the American continent and in American seas ; and the concessions of principle over-eagerly made in 1850 , in order to gain compensating advantages which our weakness could not otherwise extort , must needs cause us to chafe now , when we are potentially , though , it must sorrowfully be confessed , not actually , stronger by double than we were then . The interest of Great Britain still lies , as it then lay , in the maintenance of the treaty . So long as the United States jealously resents all foreign interference in the Isthmus , and at the same time takes no steps to formulate a policy or develop a strength that can give shape and force to her own pretensions , just so long will the absolute control over any probable contingency of the future rest with Great Britain , by virtue of her naval positions , her naval power , and her omnipresent capital . A recent unofficial British estimate of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty , may here have interest : " In the United States was recognized a coming formidable rival to British trade . In the face of the estimated disadvantage to European trade in general , and that of Great Britain in particular , to be looked for from a Central American canal , British statesmen , finding their last attempt to control the most feasible route ( by Nicaragua ) abortive , accomplished the next best object in the interest of British trade . They cast the onus of building the canal on the people who would reap the greatest advantage from it , and who were bound to keep every one else out , but were at the same time very unlikely to undertake such a gigantic enterprise outside their own undeveloped territories for many a long year ; while at the same time they skillfully handicapped that country in favor of British sea power by entering into a joint guarantee to respect its neutrality when built . This secured postponement of construction indefinitely , and yet forfeited no substantial advantage necessary to establish effective naval control in the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the deliberate purpose of successive British governments may be doubtful , but it is an accurate enough estimate of the substantial result , as long as our policy continues to be to talk loud and to do nothing , - to keep others out , while refusing ourselves to go in . We neutralize effectually enough , doubtless ; for we neutralize ourselves , while leaving other powers to act efficiently , whenever it becomes worth while . In a state like our own , national policy means public conviction ; else it is but as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal . But public conviction is a very // different thing from popular impression , differing by all that separates a rational process , resulting in manly resolve , from a weakly sentiment that finds occasional hysterical utterance . The Monroe Doctrine , as popularly apprehended and endorsed , is a rather nebulous generality , which has condensed about the Isthmus into a faint point of more defined luminosity . To those who will regard , it is the harbinger of the day , incompletely seen in the vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West shall be brought into closer communion by the realization of the strait that baffled his eager search . But , with the strait , time has introduced a factor of which lie could not dream , - a great nation midway between the West he knew and the East he sought , spanning the continent he unwittingly found , itself both East and West in one . To such a state , which in itself sums up the two conditions of Columbus 's problem ; to which the control of the strait is a necessity , if not of existence , at least of its full development and of its national security , who can deny the right to predominate in influence over a region so vital to it ? N'one can deny save its own people ; and they do it , - not in words , perhaps , but in act . For let it not be forgotten that failure to act at an opportune moment is action as real as , though less creditable than , the most strenuous positive effort . Action , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction ; and conviction , if it is to be reasonable , and find expression in a sound and continuous national policy , must result from a careful consideration of present conditions in the light of past experiences . Here , unquestionably , strong differences of opinion will at first be manifested , both as to the true significance of the lessons of the past , and the manner of applying them to the present . Such differences need not cause regret . Their appearance is a sign of attention aroused ; and , when discussion has become general and animated , we may hope to see the gradual emergence of a sound and operative pub . lie sentiment . What is to be deprecated and feared is indolent drifting , in willful blindness to the approaching moment when action must be taken ; careless delay to remove fetters , if such there be in the constitution or in traditional prejudice , which may prevent ouy seizing opportunity when it occurs . Whatever be the particular merits of the pending Hawaiian question , it can scarcely be denied that its discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such clogs upon our action , and of a painful disposition to consider each such occurrence as a merely isolated event , instead of being , as it is , a warning that the time has come when we must make up our minds upon a broad issue of national policy . That there should be two opinions is not bad , but it is very bad to halt long between them . There is one opinion , - which it is needless to say the writer does not share , - that , because many years have gone by without armed collision with a great power , the teaching of the past is that none such can occur ; and that , in fact , the weaker we are in organized military strength , the more easy it is for our opponents to yield our points . Closely associated with this view is the obstinate rejection of any political action which implicitly involves the projection of our physical power , if needed , beyond the waters that gird our shores . Because our reasonable , natural - it might almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isthmus has heretofore compelled respect , though reluctantly conceded , it is assumed that no circumstances can give rise to a persistent denial of it . It appears to the writer - and to many others with whom he agrees , though without claim to represent them - that the true state of the case is more nearly as follows : Since our nation came into // being , a century ago , with the exception of a brief agitation about the year 1850 , - due to special causes , which , though suggestive , were not adequate , and summarized as to results in the paralyzing Clayton-Bulwer Treaty , - the importance of the Central American Isthmus has been merely potential and dormant . But , while thus temporarily obscured , its intrinsic conditions of position and conformation bestow upon it a consequence in relation to the rest of the world which is inalienable , and therefore , to become operative , only awaits those changes in external conditions that must come in the fullness of time . The indications of such changes are already sufficiently visible to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least two . The growth of the Pacific States enhances the commercial and political importance of the Pacific Ocean to the world at large , and to ourselves in particular ; while the productive energies of the country , and its advent to the three seas , impel it necessarily to seek access and outlet by them to the regions beyond . Under such conditions , perhaps not yet come , but plainly coming , the consequence of an artificial waterway that shall enable the Atlantic coast to compete with Europe , on equal terms as to distance , for the markets of eastern Asia , and shall shorten by two thirds the searoute from New York to San Francisco , and by one half that to Valparaiso , is too evident for insistence . In these conditions , not in European necessities , is to be found the assurance that the canal will be built . Not to ourselves only , however , though to ourselves chiefly , will it be a matter of interest when completed . Many causes will combine to retain in the line of the Suez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American shores of the Pacific the Isthmian canal will afford a much shorter and easier access for a trade already of noteworthy proportions . A weighty consideration also is involved in the effect upon British navigation of a war which should endanger its use of the Suez Canal . The power of Great Britain to control the long route from Gibraltar to the Red Sea is seriously doubted by a large and thoughtful body of her statesmen and seamen , who favor dependence , in war , upon that by the Cape of Good Hope . By Nicaragua , however , would be shorter than by the Cape to many parts of the East ; and the Caribbean is much more easily safeguarded against distant European states than the line through the Mediterranean , which passes close by their ports . Under this increased importance of the Isthmus , we can not safely anticipate for the future the cheap acquiescence which , under very different circumstances , has in the past been yielded to our demands . Already it is notorious that European powers are betraying symptoms of increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthening their grip upon those aey now hold . Moral considerations indoubtedly count for more than they did , and nations are more reluctant to enter into war ; but still , the policy of states is determined by the balance of advantages , and it behooves us to know what our policy is to be , and what advantages are needed to turn in our favor the scale of negotiations and the general current of events . If the decision of the nation , following one school of thought , is that the weaker we are the more likely we are to have our way , there is little to be said . Drifting is perhaps as good a mode as another to reach that desirable goal . If , on the other hand , we determine that our interest and dignity require that our rights should depend upon the will of no other state , but upon our own power to enforce them , we must gird ourselves to admit that freedom of interoceanic transit depends upon predominance in a maritime region - the Caribbean Sea - through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a maritime region is insured primarily by a navy ; secondarily , by positions , suitably chosen and spaced one from the other , upon which as bases the navy rests , and from which it can exert its strength . At present the positions of the Caribbean are occupied by foreign powers , nor may we , however disposed to acquisition , obtain them by means other than righteous ; but a distinct advance will have been made when public opinion is convinced that we need them , and should not exert our utmost ingenuity to dodge them when flung at our head . If the Constitution really imposes difficulties , it provides also a way by which the people , if convinced , can remove its obstructions . A protest , however , may be entered against a construction of the Constitution which is liberal , by embracing all it can be constrained to imply , and then immediately becomes strict in imposing these ingeniously contrived fetters . Meanwhile , no moral obligation forbids dev*1oping our navy upon lines and proportions adequate to the work it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a public impression , which limits our potential strength to the necessities of an imperfectly realized situation . A navy " for defense only " is a popular catchword . When , if ever , people recognize that we have three seaboards , that the communication by water of one of them with the other two will in a not remote future depend upon a strategic position hundreds of miles distant from our nearest port , at the mouth of the Mississippi , they will also see that the word " defense , " already too narrowly understood , has its application at points far away from our own coast . That the organization of military strength implies provocation to war is a fallacy , which the experience of each succeeding year is now refuting . The immense armaments of Europe are onerous ; but , nevertheless , by the mutual respect and caution they enforce , they present a cheap alternative , certainly in misery , probably in money , to the frequent devastating wars which preceded the era of general military preparation . Our own impunity has resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our rivals of the points in dispute , compared with their more immediate interests at home . With the changes consequent upon the canal , this indifference will diminish . We also shall be entangled in the affairs of the great family of nations , and shall have to accept the attendant burdens . Fortunately , as regards other states , we are an island power , and can find our best precedents in the history of the people to whom the sea has been a nursing mother .
