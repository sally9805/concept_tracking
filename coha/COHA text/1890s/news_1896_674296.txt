txt That was an interesting announcement that Dr. PARKHURST made in yesterday 's TIMES , that he " expected to see Mr. BLACK , the Republican candidate for Governor , and have a talk with him some day , " and that it was possible that the rimpressions he derived from the interclew " might be conveyed to others . " No well-informed citizen had any doubt what it was that Dr. PARKHURST wanted to see Mr. BLACK about . Of course , he wanted to find out whether Mr. BLACK , as Governor of the State of New-York , meant to be Mr. PLATT 'S man or his own man . This is a legitimate subject of curiosity for every citizen of the State of New-York . For a man who has assumed or had thrust upon him the responsibilities that Dr. PARKHURST carries it is really necessary for his own guidance that he should know . Not , of course , that it makes any difference to the election of next month or to Mr. BLACK 'S immediate political future . He is as sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live until the new year . The boss of his own party could no more defeat him than could the respectable division of the Democratic Party which supports Mr. GRIFFIN or the regular wing which supports Mr. PORTER . But it greatly concerns Mr. BLACK 'S ultimate political future wheth.er , as Governor , he is to be his own man or not . Why should he be Mr. PLATT 'S man ? So far as the public knows of the arrangement which terminated in his candidacy , he is under no obligations whatever to Mr. PLATT , who ostentatiously took his hands off when the contest seen1ed to lie between two of his obedient servants and declined to open the deadlock by becoming a candidate himself . If he had consented , it is a curious reflection that this year even he might be elected . But since he did not expose himself to the suffrages of his fellow-citizens , he declined to exercise his prerogative of boss in favor of anybody . As one of his Democratic predecessors in boss-ship , DEAN RICHMOND , used to say , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All that he did for the candidate of the caucus was not to put a veto on its decision . Therefore the candidate of the caucus owes him nothing , unless he executed a confidential mortgage of himself to the boss before his nomination . We see no reason to suppose that he did this . If he did not do it , we see as little reason why , as Governor , he should regard himself merely as the agent of the boss . Mr. BLACK 'S political prospects are as bright as those of any man in the United States , and he has thus far done nothing to cloud them . He did at the convention make a speech needlessly and unwisely irritating to the Democrats who were prepared to abandon their party for the present without recanting any of their allegiance to it in the past . But he has since made amends for that indiscretion . He has indicated that he is a man of independence and courage . If , as Governor , he makes good those indications , he is very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years hence . The Governor of the State of New-York is ex officio a candidate for the Presidency , since he has already shown his capacity to carry the biggest of the doubtful States and the most doubtful of the big States . His office has furnished since the war three candidates for the Presidency and one President , not counting Mr. TILDEN . Moreover , all three have been men distinctly of Presidential quality If , as Governor , he " measures up " to these men and to the high standard which they and their predecessors have set for the Governorship , his promotion to the candidacy for the higher office will be entirely natural . But there is one condition to be fulfilled . He must be Governor , and not soother , and he must be his own man . if he is a boss 's Governor , there is affecting and recent evidence that he will not cut much of a figure in a National Convention . More than that , and this is a consideration which we believe appeals strongly to Mr. BLACK , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good or an honored Governor . Upon the whole , we hope Dr. PARKHURST will carry out his intention of having a talk with Mr. BLACK and his suggestion of communicatingthe results of it to the public , .. so far as they concern the public .
