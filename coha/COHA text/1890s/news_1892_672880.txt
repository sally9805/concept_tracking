txt Two new light steel revenue cutters are about to be placed on the upper lakes by the Dominion Government ( for the protection of the fisheries in those waters from depletion by the use of gill and pound nets , both of which are illegal This notion of the Department of Marine and Fisheries is the outcome of a recommendation made in 1889 and again in 1890 . This recommendation pointed out that the revenue enttera intended for the protection of the fisheries were of too great draught to be able to ply in the shallow waters where these illegal practices are in vogue , and also were not of sufficient speed to be effective in the service , as the vessels used by the fishermen were light and fast . It was therefore suggested that the old vessels should be removed and replaced by now boats of light draught and built for speed . The new vessels will not add to the nnrabel of Canadian boats on these lakes . One of the new boats will be placed on Lake Superior and the other on Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coast service on the Gulf of St. Lawrence for preventive work in connection with smuggling by Frenchmen from the Miquelon and other islands . This &mug:ding; has not outy been very extonts1M hitherto , but is growing in extent year by year . The Hon. Mackenzie Howell , Minister of Militia and Acting Minister of Customs , was seen ou the subject this evening . lie said there was no intention either on the part or England or Canada of violating the treaty of Washington , which provides for the number of boats to be maintained by each power , the Canadian and United States Governments , on these lakes . The new i ; oats will not be heavily armed . In fact they will only carry the light armament abso , lutely necessary for their own protection . There will be no violation of old treaties in any way .
