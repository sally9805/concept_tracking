txt It was not an absolute discovery that Mr. Reed ( Rep. , Me. , ) made known to-day in the Rouse , but it was an amusing half-hour of comedy . in which he provided fun for most of the members a the body in showing that Mr. Holman , ( Dem. , Ind. , ) with all his devotion to economy , has a human side , and . that it Is prone to accept appropriations when they are for the people a Mr. Holman 's district . There were indications before the curtain was raised that Mr. Reed was preparing to play a part . When the House had reached an item in the River and Harbor bill providing for an expenditure upon a bar at the mouth of the Great Miami River , Mr. Reed sent up an amendment proposing to strike the item all out . Then , in his most playful , bland , and most irritating tone , he went on to ask the assistance of Mr. Holman to have this extravagant and unwarranted appropriation eliminated . He described the dike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove by the scouring process , and stated that the dike was so far from the river that only in eases of extraordinary rise could the water reach it , so that in ordinary times it could not restrict the flow of the stream , and , therefore . could not restrict the channel and force the river to scour away the objectionable bar , With mock courtesy he appealed to the gentleman from Indiana , to join with him in having the paragraph rejected . The House enjoyed the intense sarcasm of Mr. Reed thoroughly , and the enjoyment was not confined to the Republican side by any means . The fun made Mr. Holman very uncomfortable , and his reply , which was partly inaudible , was not very clear as a defense of his own abandonment of the principle of refusing appropriations except when they are needed to improve navigation . Mr. Reed returned to the assault and was more sarcastic than ever , since Mr. Holman had imputed to him a determination to charge him with acting on appropriatiqn bills in a selfish and . inconsistent manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of the Ohio River , flowing through the area in front of the Speaker 's chair . the Great Miami running down the aisle by the side of the gentleman from Indiana , and the dike right where the gentleman from Maine stood , assumed to be two miles from the river on high ground . Mr. Reed could find no recommendation for the appropriation in the engineers ' report . The engineers rather sarcastically threw upon Congress the responsibility for beginning the enterprise , and Mr. Reed then pointed out that the principal use that had been found for the dike was the construction , along its top , of a railroad that had borne part of the expense of putting it up . Of course , Mr. Holman came baok with one of his inaudible answers . He was in a steaming rage , and he had gone so far that he was really seen to helve been goaded into the attitude of defending an appropriation in the bill to which he had been devoting days in the hope of defeating some of its provisions . Mr. Blanchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rivers and Harbors Committee , seized the opportunity to allow that Mr. Holman , while opposing the contracting out of large works , had put in the Sundries Civil bill a contract paragraph for the Congressional Library , similar in purpose to the paragraphs which he had asked to have stricken from the bill under consideration , and Air ' . Breckinridge , in another bill . had proposed a similar course in regard to fortifications , although he had opposed the contraoting of work in the River and Harbor bill . When the House had put Mr. Holman sufficiently to the torture and it had been related by Mr. Blanchard that the appropriation proposed by Mr. Reed to be stricken out had been asked for in the Committee on Rivers and Harbors by Mr. Holman himself , the vote was taken , A few members voted in the affirmative . The great majority of the members sympathized with Mr. Holman and gave him for the Great Miami bar all that he had been able to get from the committee . As an exhibition of a famous economist it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever been witnessed . POWDER BOATS IN NEW-YORK HARBOR The resolution offered yesterday by Mr. ( Dem. , N. .1. , ) for the removal of powder boats from the harbor of New-York was laid before the Senate to-day . Mr. Chandler ( Rep. , N. H. , ) remarked that , when he objected to the consideration of the resolution yesterday , he supposed that it applied to army and navy powder boats . He had since learned , however , that there were none but mercantile powder boats in the harbor of New-York , and , although he supposed that that was the safest place for the storage of powder , he would make no further objection , except to suggest that the resolution should be made a Joint resolution . Mr. made some remarks to show the danger of the proximity of powder boats to Jersey City , to the hundreds of craft lying in the harbor and to Bedlow 's Island , with its Statue of Liberty . Mr. Hiscocar ( Rep .. N. Y. , ) said he did not know whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depleted by Mr. had existed for years . He moved the reference of the resolution to the Committee on Commerce , where the matter might be carefully looked into . The motion was agreed to and the resolution was referred . YOUNG- WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY . Mr. James R. Young , recently Executive Clerk of the Senate , is to have some attention from his brother correspondents on the Standing Committee of Press Representatives . They are to begin an inquiry Monday , not for the purpose , it is understood , of ascertaining Whether the Senate properly discharged Mr. " Young , but whether in discharging him under charges which the public were led to believe affected his reputation as a man , and to which he Was afforded no opportunity to reply , the presumption was not set up that he had committed an act so dishonorable that he is no longer entitled to be permitted to enjoy , with the other correspondents , the privileges of the gallery . The Press Committee has no right to question the action of the Senate , but as newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly afraid of Senatorial criticism . they are entitled to express an opinion as to the justification of the Senate in smirching a fellow newspaper man first and then depriving him ; in consequence , of an occupation that lie had followed acceptably under Senators who were probably just as fair judges of honorable conduct as those who have so shabbily treated Mr. Young . Mr. Young will probably have an opportunity to be heard , and other persons will be asked for facts which may throw light upon the subject of the inquiry . The Press Committee is free from partisan feeling , and it is not likely to assume that It has any judicial pOwers . But it has been asked by correspondents to perform a task , and la will discharge it without prejudice against a newspaper man because he was so unfortunate as to be an employe of the Senate . Meanwhile , several persons , regardless of the painful circumstances under which Mr. Young lost his place , are seeking for the office and are awaiting the election for which the Senatorial mind is now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very strangely constructed . Judging from the performance in the Young case , the only man who can get that situation and hope to keep It satisfactorily and with selfrespect should be a deaf , dumb , and blind idiot . NEW HIGH-EXPLOSIVE CANNON . Senator Teller ( Rep. , Col .. ) to-day proposed an amendment to the Naval Appropriation bill appropriating $50,000 to enable the Secretary of the Navy to have constructed one eight-inch fifty-calibre steel rifie , wire-wrapped or built up and /Moped , and firing a high-explosive projectile of great velocity . In order to test the gun , which will be something of a departure in the way of rifled guns of large calibre , the Secretary Is authorized to use the $50,000 appropriated in March , 1889 , for testing guns for secondary batteries . The amendment stipulates , however , that no part of the money shall be expended until the owners of the patent of the gun agree to construct it exclusively for the Government . The gun is known as the Hurst high-explosive eight-inch rifle , and is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard in Washington by the inventor and conducted in private by him , in connection with which Senator Hawley ( Irop .. Conn .. ) took a prominent part . Gem Hawley has great faith in the use of two charges of powder , one of the difficulties to be overcome being in providing a suitable gas check and sabot for the projectiles . This Gen. Hawley succeeded in patenting , and at first took the patent out in his own name , and afterward on joint invention with Gen. Hurst . The gun provided for by the proposed amendment will tire the Hawley projectile , which will be filled with dynamite , guncotton , or some other high explosive , and have , it is said , a range greater than that of any ' gun of similar calibre constructed in this or any ether atmtry . The inventors were both distinguished soldiers in the late war , Gen. Hawley wearing the blue from Connecticut and Gen. Hurst the gray from Mississippi . AFTER THE CORDAGE TRUST . Representative Scott ( Dom. , nu to-day offered for reference in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporation organized and operated as a trust to destroy competition and monopolize the ' trade and commerce in binding twipe and other cordage products between the Several States and foreign countries , and requesting the Attorney General to inform the House whether any information has been furnished the Department of Justice on this subject of such a character as will authorize him to institute proceedings under the law against the persons who it is alleged have combined in its violation . PROPOSED LEGISLATION . It has been suggested to Congress for many years that Commodores of the navy , while acting as Rear Admirals , should have the pay of the latter grade , and especially has this plea been made for Commodores while in command of squadrons , on the ground that they are often put to unusual expense in entertaining guests aboard ship and , as no allowance Is made by the Navy Department for this purpose , ( unlike foreign navies , ) it should be made up to them by an increase of salary . To-day Senator Butler , ( Dem. , S. 0. , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its object the allowance of Rear Admirals ' pay to all Commodores who have held the relative rank since 1884 . A bill designed to prevent the employment on public works of prison or convict labor or the products of such labor was reported to the House to-day from the Labor Committee by Representative Davis , ( Proh. , Kan . ) The willful violation of the law is to constitute a forfeiture of Contract . Representative Meredith ( Dem. , Va. , ) to-day introduced in the House a bill " to increase the revenue and improve the public health and for other purposes . " A preamble to the bill recites that there exists a deficit in the revenues caused by extravagance and recklessness of the Republican majority In the Fifty-first Congress , and it becomes necessary to raise additional revenue to meet the expense of the Government and the constantly increasing pension claims . The bill creates a Board of Medical and Chemical Experts , which is to fix all standards of medicines and drugs used in the United States . The revenue is to be raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers of patent and proprietary medicines and by requiring every box , package , or other article used in putting up for sale any patent medicine to be stamped with a revenue stamp equal to 5 per cent . of the retail value of the article . Representative Crosby ( Dem. , Mass. ) to-dap reported a bill providing that all mail matter heretofore included in the third and fourth classes shall in future be transported as thirdclass Matter , postage on which shall be ohargel 1 cent for every two ounces or fraction thereof . The passage of the bill , the committee thinks , will benefit every person who has occasion to use the mails for transpo rting small packages . INTERESTED IN TRADE MARKS . Morris S. Wise and G.
