txt The Evening Post on Tuesday printed , in terrorem , the section of the law of this State that makes it a misdemeanor to print an " account of the details of any epeution " beyond the statement of the fact that the convict was on the day in question duly executed . It added : " The provision in question is entirely comvuendable , and it ought to be enforced as strictly as any other section . " On the next day the Post violated the law and . committe d a misdemeanor by giving an account of the details of the execution of KEMAELER . It was a very bad account , we will say that for the Post , and sent every intelligent reader who had any curiosity-about the execution to some other paper to get it assuaged . Nevertheless , it was more of an account than the law permits . For it said " the shook was given at 6 : 43 A. M. " and was " continued for eighteen . seconds , " that " at the end of two minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current was again turned on , " and that " this was repeated a few minutes later . " If these are not " details " of the execution , what - are they ? Moreover , they are double-leaded , and though the letter of the law says nothing about double leads they are clearly opposed to its spirit . As a. law-abiding citizen and as a believer in the propriety- of the particular law he has been breaking , the editor of the Post ought to seek for an immediate chance to plead guilty- to a misdemeanor . It is not likely that he - will do this . It is more likely that , like Jill in the ballad , he will " come tumbling after " with an able leader this afternoon , in which the morning papers are held up to odium for being newspapers , and in which the revolting " details " are quoted from them with expressions of horror and derision . That is , he will do this unless these remarks head him off .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
