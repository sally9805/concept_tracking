txt ADMIRAL EARL HOWE . THE name of Howe , albeit that of a stranger to the land , has a just claim upon the esteem and cordial remembrance of Americans . The elder brother of the subject of this sketch , during the few short months in which he was brought into close contact with the colonists of 1758 , before the unlucky campaign of Ticonderoga , won from them not merely the trust inspired by his soldierly qualities and his genius for war , - the genius of sound common sense and solidity of character , - but got a deep hold upon their affections by the consideration and respect shown to them by him , traits to which they had been too little accustomed in the British officers of that day . Nor was this attitude on his part only a superficial disguise assumed by policy to secure a needed support . The shrewd , suspicious provincials would soon have penetrated a veil so thin , that covered only the usual supercilious arrogance which they had heretofore encountered . Lord Howe , almost alone among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of no alien or degenerate blood . He admitted at once the value of their experience , sought their advice , and profited by both ; thus gaining , besides the material advantage of methods adapted to the difficulties before him , the adhesion of willing hearts that followed enthusiastically , confident in their leader 's wisdom , and glowing with the unaccustomed sense of being appreciated , of receiving recognition long withheld , but now at last un* , rudjngly accorded . " The army felt him , from // general to drummer boy . He was its soul ; and while breathing into it his own energy and ardor , he broke through the traditions of the service , and gave it new shapes to suit the time and place . He made himself greatly beloved by the provincial officers , and he did what he could to break down the barriers between the colonial soldiers and the British regulars. " 1 In campaign , Lord Howe adopted the tried expedients of forest warfare , associating with himself its most practiced exponents ; and on the morning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cut short the career of so many promising soldiers , he discussed the question of Ticonderoga and its approaches , lying on a bearskin beside the colonial ranger , John Stark , to whose energy , nineteen years later , was due the serious check that precipitated the ruin of Burgoyne 's expedition . Endeared as he was to American soldiers by the ties of mutual labors and mutual perils gladly shared , and to all classes by genial bearing and social accomplishments , his untimely end was followed throughout the Northern colonies by a spontaneous outburst of sorrow , elicited not only by the anticipated failure of the enterprise that hung upon his life , but also by a sense of personal regret and loss . Massachusetts perpetuated the memory of her grief by a tablet in Westminster Abbey , which hands down to our day " the affection her officers and soldiers bore to his command . " Captain Richard Howe of the Royal Navy , afterwards Admiral and Earl , succeeded hini in the Irish viscounty which had been bestowed upon their grandfather by William III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than that of his brother , the new Lord Howe was distinguished by the same fairness of mind , and by an equanimity to which perturbation and impulsive injustice were alike unknown . There seems to have been in his bear* Parknian 's Montcalm and Wolfe , ii . 90. ing something of that stern , impassive gravity that marked Washington , and imposed a constraint upon bystanders ; but whatever apparent harshness there was in the face only concealed a genuine warmth of heart , which at times broke with an illumining smile through the mask that covered it , and was always ready to respond to the appeals of benevolence . If , as an officer , he had a fault conspicuously characteristic , it was a reluctance to severity , a tendency to push indulgence to undue extremes , into which may perhaps have entered not merely leniency of disposition , but the weakness of loving popularity . To be called by the seamen , as Howe was , the " sailor 's friend , " is in the experience of navies a suspicious encomium , involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to his discretion and his judgment . But at the time when the quarrel between Great Britain and her colonies was fast becoming imbittered , the same kindliness , coupled with a calm reasonableness of temper , ruled his feelings and guided his action . Although by political creed a moderate Tory , lie had none of the wrong-headedness of the party zealot ; and the growing alienation between those whom he , like his brother , regarded as of one family , , caused only distress and an earnest desire to avert coming evils . Influenced by these sentiments , he sought the acquaintance of Franklin , then in London as a commissioner from the colonies ; and the interviews between them , while ' resultless by reason of the irreconcib - ble differences of opinion severing the two parties to the dispute , convinced the wary American of the good will and open-mindedness of the already distinguished British seaman . The same qualities doubtless suggested the selection of Howe for the mission of conciliation to America , in 1776 , where his associate was his younger brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by exaggeration , degenerated into 1894.1 // an indolent good humor fatal to his military efficiency . The admiral , on the contrary , was as remarkable for activity and untiring attention to duty as he was for amiability and resolute personal courage , - traits which assured adequate naval direction , in case conciliation should give place , as it did , to coercive measures . It is to be regretted that the methods of naval biographers and historians of the past century have preserved to us little , in detail and anecdote , of a period whose peculiarities , if not exactly picturesque , were at least grotesque and amusing . The humor of Smollett has indeed drawn in broad caricature some of the salient features of the seaman of his day , which was that of Howe 's entrance into the navy ; and those who are familiar with the naval light literature based upon the times of Nelson can recognize in it characteristics so similar , though evidently softened by advancing civilization and increased contact with the world , as to vouch for the accuracy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , correct only as a general impression , in which , too , allowance must be made for the animus of an author who had grievances to exploit , and whose great aim was to amuse , even if exact truthfulness were sacrificed at the shrine of exaggerated portrayal . Though not wholly without occasional gleams of light , shed here and there by recorded incident and anecdote upon the strange life of the seamen of that period , the early personal experiences of individuals have had scant commemoration ; and with the exception of St. Vincent , who fortunately had a garrulous biographer , we learn little of men like Hawke , Howe , Hood , and Keppel , until , already possessors of naval rank , they stand forth as actors in events rather historical than biographical . Of Howe 's first services , therefore , not much record remains except a bare summary of dates - of promotions , and of ships to which he was attached - until 1755 , the beginning of the Seven Years ' War , when he was already a post-captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1739 , at the outbreak of the war with Spain which initiated a forty years ' struggle over colonies and colonial trade . With short intervals of peace , this contest was the prominent characteristic of the middle of the eighteenth century , and terminated in the conquest of Canada , the independence of the United States , and the establishment of British predominance in India and upon the ocean . This rupture of a quiet that had then endured a quarter of a century was so popular with the awakened intelligence of England , aroused at last to the imminent importance of her call to expansion by sea , that it was greeted by a general pealing of the bells , which drew from the reluctant prime minister , Walpole , that bitter gibe , " Ay , to-day they are ringing their bells , and to-morrow they will be wringing their hands . " Howe embarked with Anson 's squadron , celebrated for its sufferings , its persistence , and its achievements , to waste the Spanish colonies of the Pacific ; but the ship in which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn that she was forced to return to England . The young officer afterwards served actively in the West Indies and in home waters , and was posted just before the close of the war , on the 20th of April , 1747 , at the early age of twenty-two . Thus he was securely placed on the road to the highest honors of his profession , which were , however , not beyond the just claim of his already proved personal merit . During the first thirty months of the Seven Years ' War , Howe was closely engaged with , and at times in command of , the naval part of combined expeditions of the army and navy , fitted out to harass the French coasts . // The chief , though not the sole aim in these undertakings was to effect diversions in favor of Frederick the Great , then plunged in his desperate struggle with the allied forces of Russia , Austria , and France . It was believed that the latter would be compelled , for the defense of her own shores against these raids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the time and place where the attack would fall , - to withdraw a number of troops that would sensibly reduce the great odds then overbearing the Prussian king . It is more than doubtful whether this direction of British power , in partial , excentric efforts , produced results adequate to the means employed . In immediate injury to France they certainly failed , and it is questionable whether they materially helped Frederick ; but they made a brisk stir in the Channel ports , their operations were within easy reach of England in a day when news traveled slowly , and they drew the attention of the public and of London society to a degree wholly disproportionate to their importance relatively to the great issues of the war . Their failures , which exceeded their achievements , caused general scandal ; and their occasional triumphs aroused exaggerated satisfaction at this earlier period , before the round of unbroken successes under the first Pitt had accustomed men , to use Walpole 's lively phrase , to come to breakfast with the question , " What new victory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of the gossip arising from these usually paltry affairs ; and throughout , whether in success or disaster , the name of howe appears frequently , and always as the subject of praise . " Howe , brother of the lord of that name , was the third on the naval list . He was undaunted as a rock , and as silent , the characteristics of his whole race . He and Wolfe soon contracted a friendship like the union of cannon and gunpowder . " " Howe , " he says in another place , " never made a friendship except at the mouth of a cannon . " Of his professional merits , however , professional opinions will be more convincin* , . A Frenchman , who had acted as pilot of his ship , the Magnanime* when going into action , was asked if it were possible to take a lighter vessel , the Burford , close to the walls of another fort farther in . " Yes , " he replied , " but I should prefer to take the Magnanime . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burford draws less water . " " True , " he said , " mais le cc*pitaine Howe est jeune et brave . " Sir Edward Hawke , the most distinguished admiral of that generation , gave a yet higher commendation to the " young and brave " captain , who at this time served under his orders , - one that must cause a sigh of regretful desire to many a troubled superior . Fifteen years later he nominated Howe for a very responsible duty . The appointment was criticised on the ground that he was the junior admiral in the fleet ; but Hawke answered , in the spirit of St. Vincent defending his choice of Nelson , " I have tried Lord Howe on most important occasions . He never asked me how he was to execute any service entrusted to his charge , but always went straight forward and did it . " Some quaint instances are recorded of the taciturnity for which he was also noted . Amid the recriminations that followed the failure at Rochefort , Howe neither wrote nor said anything . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . In the somewhat ponderous style that marked his utterances , he replied , " With regard to the operations of the troops I was silent , as not being at that time well enough informed thereof , and to avoid the mention of any particulars that might prove not exactly agreeable to the truth . " The next year , an army officer of rank , putting several questions to him and receiving no answer , said , " Mr. Howe , do n't you // hear me ? I have asked you several questions . " Howe returned curtly , " I do n't like questions , " - in which he was perhaps not peculiar . It was during the continuance of these petty descents upon the French coast , in 12 ' 58 , that Howe was directed to receive on board , as midshipman , and for service in the fleet , the Duke of York , a grandson of the reigning monarch ; in connection with whom arose a saying that was long current , perhaps is still current , in the British navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine duties , held a reception on board Commodore Howe 's ship , at which the captains of the squadron were presented to him . The seamen , unpracticed in ceremonial distinctions other than naval , saw with wonder that the midshipman kept on his hat , while the rest uncovered . " The young gentleman , " whispered one , " is n't overcivil , as I thinks . Look if he do n't keep his hat on before all the captains ! " Why , " another was heard to reply , " where should he learn manners , seeing as how he was never at sea before ? " It is likewise from this period of Howe 's career that two of the rare personal anecdotes have been transmitted , illustrative of his coolness and selfpossession under all circumstances of danger , as well as when under the enerny 's fire ; one of them also touched with a bit of humor , - not a usual characteristic of his self-contained reticence . The service involved considerable danger , being close in with the enemy 's coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wind blow* mr dead on shore . On one such occashin his ship had anchored with two anchors ahead , and he had retired to his cabin , when the officer of the watch hurriedly entered , saying , " My lord , the anchors are coming home , " - the common sea expression for their failure to grip the bottom , whereupon the ship of course drags toward the beach . " Coining home , are they ? " rejoined Howe : " I am sure they are very right . I do n't know who would stay abroad on such a night , if he could help it . " Yet another time he was roused from sleep by a lieutenant in evident perturbation : " My lord , the ship is on fire close to the magazine ; but do n't be frightened ; we shall get it under shortly . " " Frightened , sir ! " said Howe . " What do you mean ? I never was frightened in my life . " Then , looking the unlucky officer in the face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man feel when he is frightened ? I need not ask how he looks . " During the Seven Years ' War , the French navy , through the persistent neglect of the government and its preoccupation with the continental war , - a misdirection due mainly to the intrigues of the Pompadour , - reached the lowest depths of material insufficiency that it has ever known . The official staff and the personnel generally were far better than in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period , but the mat*riel had dwindled to impotency . To this was due the loss of Canada , with its far-reaching effects upon the feeling of independence in the British colonies which became the United States to this the impunity with which the French coasts were harassed , the British squadrons having no cause to fear for British interests elsewhere ; and to this also that the period in question , though one of great naval activity , was marked by no great naval battle , a sure indication of the overwhelming predominance of one of the contestants of the sea . There was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to the name " battle , " characterized by an extreme of daring upon the part of the British admiral engaged , and accompanied by every element of terror and sublimity that the phases of the sea can present , in which Howe was privileged to bear a conspicuous part . In 1759 , after four years of disaster // upon the continent , of naval humiliation , and of loss of maritime and colonial power , the French government realized that its worst evils and greatest danger sprang from the sea power of England , and , like Napoleon half a century later , it determined upon an invasion . The bulk of the troops were collected in ports just south of Brest , on the Atlantic , and the Brest fleet was ordered to go thither and protect the transports . The great Admiral Hawke was charged to intercept this effort ; but having been driven off his station by a violent gale in mid-November , the French ran out . Hawke , a commander of the most active and fearless type , returned so speedily that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with twentythree ships caught sight of their twentyone drawing in with their own coast , towards nightfall of a wild autumn day , with an increasing gale . Howe 's ship , the Magnanime , had been sent forward by Hawke to make the land , and thus was in the lead in the headlong chase which at once ensued , as the British fleet rushed upon a combination of perils that embraced all most justly dreaded by the seaman , - darkness , an intricate navigation , a lee shore fringed with outlying and imperfectly known reefs and shoals , towards which they were hurried by a fast-rising wind and sea that forbade all hope of retracing their course during the long hours of the night then closing round them . The master of the flagship , upon whom , in the absence of a pilot , devolved the navigation of the fleet , called Hawke 's attention to some evident dangers . The single-minded admiral , intent upon his high charges saw before him only the flying foe , whom it was his task to insure should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have done your duty in warning me , " he answered " now lay us alongside the French commander in chief . " With canvas reefed close down , forty odd tall ships , pursuers and pursued , iii fierce career drove furiously on ; now rushing headlong down the forward slope of a great sea , now rising on its foaming crest as it swept beyond them ; now seen , now hidden ; the helmsmen straining at the wheels , upon which , at such moments , the big hulls , tossing their prows from side to side , tugged like a maddened horse , as though themselves feeling the wild " rapture of the strife " that animated their masters , rejoicing in their strength , and defying the accustomed rein . The French admiral , trusting in his greater local knowledge , sought to round a rocky point , beyond which , he flattered himself , the enemy would not dare to follow . He was soon undeceived . In no ranged order save that of speed , the leading British vessels mingled with the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falling spars and drifting clouds of smoke , now adding their part to the wild magnificence of the scene , upon which the sun went down just as Hawke and Howe , sailing fearlessly on over ground where their foe had led the way , were drawing up with the hostile van . As the ships , rolling heavily , buried their flanks deep in the followiu* , seas , no captain dared open his lower tier of ports , where the most powerful artillery was arrayed , - none save one , the French Th6s6e , whose rashness was rebuked by the inpouring waters that quickly engulfed both ship and crew . Balked of their expected respite , harried and worried by the foe , harnessed to no fixed plan of action , the French now , under cover of night , broke and fled . Seven went north , seven south , to be thenceforth hopelessly disunited fragments . Seven were lost , - some sunk , some captured , some hurled upon the beach . Two British ships were also wrecked ; but during the awful night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the stormy air proclaimed to Hawke and his fol // lowers , as their own vessels strained at the stout anchors which alone saved them from a like distress , that the invasion of England was become an empty threat . In this achievement Howe had borne a brilliant part , one third of the British loss falling upon his single ship . He continued to serve , but without further noteworthy incident , up to the peace made in the winter of 1762-63 . From that time until the difficulties with the American colonies came to a head in 1775 , he was not actively employed afloat , although continuously engaged upon professional matters , especially as a close student of naval tactics and its kindred subjects , to which he always gave systematic attention . During this period , also , he became a member of the House of Commons , and so continued until transferred from the Irish peerage to that of Great Britain , in 1782 . In 1770 , at the age of forty-five , he became a rear-admiral , in 1775 a vice-admiral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chief of the North American station . Together with his military duties , he was , as has before been said , given powers , conjointly with his brother , to treat for the settlement of existing troubles . Although his habitual reticence restrained his sentiments from finding expression in positive words , there can be little doubt that the necessity of raising his hand against the Americans caused Howe keener regret than it did many of his brother officers . He took instant occasion to address to Franklin a personal note , recalling their former association , and expressing an earnest hope that their friendship might contribute something to insure the success of his official mission . In the five years that had elapsed , however , Franklin had been in the heat of the political struggle , and , philosopher though he was , he had not Howe 's natural phlegm . Hence , his reply , while marked by respect and even formal cordiality toward the admiral himself , displayed a vivacity of resentment and a bitterness for which the latter had scarcely looked . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter with the simple comment , " My old friend expresses himself very warmly . " Howe 's arrival antedated the signature of the Declaration of Independence by less than a week . During the period of attempted negotiation , while scrupulously faithful to his instructions , he showed to his late fellow-countrymen all the courtesy and consideration that the most cordial esteem could extend . The incident of the official communication addressed by the Howes to Washington , in which they sought to evade giving him the title of " General , " is sufficiently familiar ; but it is more rarely recalled that , in verbal intercourse with Amencan officers , the admiral habitually styled him " General Washington , " and sent complimentary messages to him as such . He even spoke of the colonies as " states , " and at the same time dwelt with evident emotion upon the testimonials of respect and affection which had been shown to his brother 's memory by the colonists . To narrate Howe 's share in the operations by which New York in 1776 , and Philadelphia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be only to repeat well-known historical episodes , enlivened by few or no incidents personal to himself . In them the navy played a part at once subordinate and indispensable , as is the office of a foundation to its superstructure . The cause of the Americans was hopeless as long as their waters remained in the undisputed control of the enemy 's ships ; and it was the attempt of Great Britain to cast aside this essential support , and to rely upon the army alone in a wild and intricate country , that led to her first great disaster , - Bur // goyne 's surrender at Saratoga . Upon this , France at once recognized the independence of the colonies , and their alliance with that kingdom followed . A French fleet of twelve ships of the line left Toulon in the spring of 1778 for the American coast . This force far exceeded Howe 's ; and it was no thanks to the British government , but only to the admiral 's sleepless vigilance and activity , seconded , as such qualities are apt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of his antagonist , that his scanty squadron was not surprised and overpowered in Delaware Bay , when Sir Henry Clinton evacuated Philadelphia to retreat upon New York . Howe - who had the defects of his qualities , whose deliberate and almost stolid exterior betrayed a phlegmatic composure of spirit which required the spur of imminent emergency to rouse it into vehement action - never in his long career appeared to greater advantage , nor achieved military results more truly brilliant , than at this time , and up to the abandonment of the attack on Rhode Island by the Americans under Sullivan , three months later . Then only , if ever , did he rise above the level of an accomplished and resolute general officer , and establish a claim to genius , the latent fire of which , however , had to be elicited by circumstances too extreme , by pressure too obvious , to assure him a place in the front rank of great commanders , whose actions originate in the living impulse of their own creative energy . Steady as a rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only under blows that would have broken weaker men . D'Estaing was twelve weeks in coming from Toulon to Cape May , but Howe knew nothing of his sailing until three weeks after he had started . Then orders were received to abandon Philadelphia and concentrate upon New York . The naval forces were scattered , and had to be collected ; the supplies of the army , except those needed for the march across Jersey , were to be embarked , and the great train of transports and ships of war moved over a hundred miles down a difficult river , and thence to New York . Despite every effort , a loss of ten days was incurred , through calms , in the mere transit from Philadelphia to the sea but during this momentous crisis D'Estaing did not appear . Two days more sufficed to bring the fleet into New York Bay ; but yet the grave admiral , roused to the full tension of his great abilities* rested not . With a force little more than half that coming a ainst him , he knew that all depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position he had in mind . Still D'Estaing tarried , giving twelve more precious days to his untiring enemy . The army of Sir Henry Clinton , reaching Navesink the day after the fleet , was snatched by it from the hot pursuit of the disappointed Washington , and carried safely to New York . Then the ships of war were ranged inside Sandy Hook , carefully anchored and disposed to command the entrance with the fullest exertion of their own force , and to offer the least exposure to the enemy 's efforts . When D'Estaing at last came , all was ready ; the energy that had improved every fleeting moment then gave place to the steadfast resolve which was Howe 's greatest attribute , and against which , seconded by his careful preparation , success could be won only by a desperate and sanguinary struggle . The attempt was not made . Ten days after arriving , the French admiral put to sea , headino to the again southward . " The arrival of the French fleet , " wrote Washington a little later , " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been injured by a number of unforeseen and unfavorable circumstances , which have lessened the importance of its services to a great // degree . Tb e length of the passage , in the first instance , was a capital misfortune ; for , had even one of common length taken place , Lord Howe , with the British ships of war and all the transports in the river Delaware , must inevitably have fallen ; and Sir Henry Clinton must have bad better luck than is commonly dispensed to men of his profession under such circumstances , if he and his troops had not shared at least the Late of Burgoyne . " If this narration of events is so carefully worded as not to imply a censure upon D'Estaing , it none tbe less , bowever unintentionally , measures tbe great military merit of Lord Howe . Nor did this end his achievements . Two or three days after the French departed , a small reinforcement reached him , and in the course of a week Howe beard that the enemy 's fleet had been seen heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island . Tbis was in pursuance of a prearranged plan to support Sullivan , who had already begun bis advance . Though still much inferior , Howe hurried to the spot , arriving the day after D'Estaing had run the fire of the British works and entered the harbor . With correct strategic judgment , with a flash of insight which did not usually distinguish him when an enemy was not in view , he saw that the true position for his squadron was in face of the hostile fleet , ready to act as circumstances might dictate . His mere presence blocked this operation , also . D'Estaing , either fearing that the British admiral might take the offensive and gain some unexpected advantage , or tempted by the apparent opportunity of crushing a small hostile division , put to sea the next day . Howe , far superior as a seaman to his antagonist , man*uvred so skillfully as to avoid action . A tremendous gale came up , scattered both fleets , and dismasted several of the French . D'Estaing appeared again off Rhode Island only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the latter , deprived of an indispensable support , withdrew in confusion . The disappointment of the Americans showed itself by mobbing some French seamen in Boston , whither their fleet retired . " After the enterprise upon Rhode Island had been planned , " continues Washington , in the letter above quoted , " and was in the moment of execution , that Lord Howe with the British ships should interpose merely to create a diversion , and draw the French fleet from the island , was again unlucky , as the count had not returned on the 17th to the island , though drawn from it on the 10th ; by which the whole was subjected to a miscarriage . " What Washington politicly calls bad luck was French bad management , provoked and baffled by Howe 's accurate strategy , untiring energy , and consummate seamanship . Clinton 's army delivered , the forcing of New York frustrated , Rhode Island and its garrison saved , by a squadron never more than two thirds of that opposed to it , were achievements to illustrate any career ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific fencing , like some of Bonaparte 's greatest feats , with little loss of blood . They form Howe 's highest title to fame , and his only claim as a strategist . It is indicative of Howe 's personal feelings about the colonial quarrel , during the two years in which he thus ably discharged his official duties , that both he and his brother had determined to ask relief from their commands as soon as it appeared that all hopes of conciliation were over . The appointment of other commissioners hastened their decision , and the permission to return was already in the admiral 's bands when the news of D'Estaing 's coming was received . Fighting a traditional foreign foe was a different thing from shedding the blood of men // between whom and himself there was so much in common ; nor was Howe the man to dodge responsibility by turning over an inferior force , threatened by such heavy odds , to a junior officer before the new commander in chief came . His resolution to remain was as happy for his renown as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brief campaign just sketched , he found that the French fleet had taken refuge in Boston and was in need of extensive repairs , he resigned the command in New York to a rear-admiral , and departed to Newport to meet his successor . Upon the latter 's arrival he sailed for England , towards the end of September , 1778 . General Howe had preceded him by four months . The two brothers went home with feelings of great resentment against the ministry . The course of the war had so far been unfortunate . The loss of Boston , the surrender of Burgoyne , the evacuation of Philadelphia , and finally the entrance of France into the contest constituted a combination of mishaps which certainly implied fault somewhere . As usual , no one was willing to accept blame , and hot disputes , with injurious imputations , raged in Parliament . There is , happily , here no necessity for apportioning the responsibility , except in the case of Lord Howe ; and as to him , it is reasonably clear that all was done that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is incontestable that afterwards , with a force utterly inadequate , for which the government was answerable , he had , by most masterly management , averted imminent disaster . His words in the House of Commons were bitter . " He had been deceived into his command , and he was deceived while he retained it . Tired and disgusted , he desired permission to resign it ; and he would have returned as soon as he *-tamed leave , but he could not think of doing so while a superior enemy remained in American seas ; that , as soon as that impediment was removed , he gladly embraced the first opportunity of returning to Europe . Such , and the recollection of what he had suffered , were his motives for resigning the command , and such for declining any future service so long as the present ministry remained in office . " In terms like these could officers holding seats in Parliament speak concerning the government of the day . It was a period in which not only did party feeling run high , but corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy itself was split into factions by political bias and personal jealousies , and there was a saying that " if a naval officer were to be roasted , another officer could always be found to turn the spit . " The head of the Admiralty , Lord Sandwich , was a man of much ability , but also of profligate character , as well public as private . He doubtless wished the success of his department , - under the terrible chances of war no chief can do otherwise , for the responsibility of failure must fall upon his own head ; but through corrupt administration the strength of the navy , upon the outbreak of war , was unequal to the work it had to do . Some one must suffer for this remissness , and who more naturally than the commander of a distant station , who confessed himself " no politician " ? Hence , Howe certainly thought , the neglect with which he had been treated . " It would not be prudent to trust the little reputation he had earned by forty years ' service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the hands of men who have neither the ability to act on their own judgment , nor the integrity and good sense to follow the advice of others who might know more of the matter . " A year later , it was roundly charged that the Channel fleet had been brought home at a most critical moment , losing an exceptional opportunity for striking the enemy , in order // to affect the elections in a dockyard town . Admiral Keppel considered that he had been sacrificed to party feeling ; and a very distinguished officer , Barrington , refused to take a fleet , although willing to serve as second , even under a junior . " Who , " he wrote , " would trust himself in chief command with such a set of scoundrels as are now in office ? " Even a quarter of a century later , Earl St. Vincent gave to George III . himself the same reason for declining employment . After eliciting from him an unfavorable opinion as to the discipline and efficiency of the Channel fleet , the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Vincent feel justified in refusing his conspicuous ability to remedy them ? " " My life , " replied the old seaman , " is at your Majesty 's disposal , and at that of my country ; but my honor is in my own keeping , and I will not expose myself to the risk of losing it by the machinations of this ministry , under which I should hold command . " To such feelings it was due that Howe , Keppel , and Barrington did not go to sea during the anxious three years that followed . The illustrious Rodney , their only rival , but in himself a host , was the one distinguished naval chief who belonged heart and soul to Sandwich 's party . It was an odd coincidence , and a curious comment upon this partisan spirit , that , when the administration changed , Rodney was recalled as a pure party step , by orders issued after his great victory , but before the news reached England ; his successor being a man of no distinction . The same change of administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into service , to replace the mediocrities who for three campaigns had commanded the Channel fleet , the mainstay of Great Britain 's safety . Upon it depended not only the protection of the British Islands and of the trade routes converging upon them , but also the occasional revictualing of Gibraltar , now undergoing the third year of its famous siege . To relieve the rock fortress was the only great task that devolved upon Howe during this short term of duty . It had , in September , 1782 , successfully repelled a long-prepared and gigantic attack by both the land and sea forces of the French and Spaniards ; but , although thus impregnable to assault , it was now in the last extremity for provisions , and forty-nine ships of the line held it closely blockaded . To oppose these , and to introduce the needed succors , for carrying which a hundred and forty store-ships were employed , Great Britain could muster only thirtyfour ships of the line ; but to them was adjoined the superb professional ability of Lord Howe , never fully evoked except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must act , with Barrington for his second . The deliberate care with which the work was conducted may be inferred from the circumstance that thirty days were spent in the passage from England to Gibraltar ; its methodical skill , from the fact that no transport appears to have been dropped . On the 111th of October , the great body of one hundred and eighty sail entered the straits , the ships of war disposed to cover the movements of the supply vessels . The enemy went to sea in pursuit ; but , by the combined effects of its own awkwardness and Howe 's address , this far superior fleet did not succeed in capturing a single one of the convoy , during the six days occupied in passing it into the anchorage . On the 18th , taking advantage of the easterly wind then blowing , the British sailed out of the straits in full sight of the baffled allies , who , beiiig thus drawn down to attack them , left the sup* ) ly ships uiidisturbed to land their cargoes . A distant cannonade between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England , leaving Gibraltar safe . // Another long period of shore life now intervened , carrying the gallant admiral over the change-fraught years of declining life from fifty-seven to sixty-eight , at which age he was again called into service to perform the most celebrated , but , it may confidently be affirmed , not the most brilliant action of his career . At the outbreak of the French Revolution , he stood conspicuously at the head of the navy , distinguished at once for well-known professional accomplishments and for tried capacity in chief command . His rivals in renown among his contemporaries - Keppel , Barrington , and Rodney - had gone to their rest . Jervis , Nelson , Collingwood , and their compeers had yet to show what was in them as general officers . Lord Hood alone remained ; and he , although he had done deeds of great promise , had come to the front too late in the previous war for his reputation to rest upon sustained achievement as well as upon hopeful indication . The great commands were given to these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , Howe taking the Channel fleet of somewhat superior numbers . The solid , deliberate , methodical qualities of the veteran admiral were better adapted to the more purely defensive rOle forced upon Great Britain by the allied superiority in 1782 than to the continuous , vigilant , aggressive action demanded by the new conditions with which he now had to deal , when the great conflagration of the Revolution was to be hemmed in and stamped out by the unyielding pressure and massive blows of the British sea power . The days of regulated , routine hostilities between rulers had passed away with the uprising of a people ; the time foretold , when nation should rise agaiast nation , was suddenly come with the crash of an ancient kingdom and its social order . An admirable organizer and indefatigable driller of ships , though apparently a poor disciplinarian , Howe lacked the breadth of view , the clear intuitions , the alacrity of mind , brought to bear upon the problem by Jervis and Nelson , who , thus inspired , framed the sagacious plan to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due the exhaustion alike of the Revolutionary fury and of Napoleon 's imperial power . Keenly interested in the material efficiency of his ships , as well as in the precision with which they could perform necessary evolutions and maintain prescribed formations , he sought to attain these ends by long stays in port , varied by formal cruises devoted to secondary objects and to fleet tactics . Thus , he flattered himself , he should insure the perfection of the instrument which should be his weapon in the hour of battle . It may justly be urged on his behalf that this preparation should have been made , but was not , by the government in the long years of peace . This is true ; but yet the fact remains that Howe pursued his system by choice and conviction repeatedly affirmed ; that continuous instead of occasional cruising in the proper positions would better have reached the ends of drill ; and that to the material well being of his ships he sacrificed those correct military dispositions before the enemy 's ports afterwards instituted by Jervis , who at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased energy and careful prevision of their wants . The brilliant victory of the 1st of June has obscured the accompanying fact , that lamentable failure characterized the use of the Channel fleet under Howe and his immediate successor . Once in sight of the enemy , however , the old man regained the fire of youth , and showed the attainments which long study and careful thought had added to his natural talent for war . The battle of June 1 , 1794 , was brought about in the following manner . Political anarchy and a bad season had combined to ruin the French h'irvcsts // in 1793 , and actual famine threatened the land . To obviate this , at least partially , the governnient had bought in the United States a large quantity of breadstuffs , which were expected to arrive in May or June , borne by one hundred and eighty merchant vessels . To insure the safety of this valuable convoy , the Brest fleet was sent to meet it at a designated point ; five ships going first , and twenty-five following a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid battle , if possible , but at all hazards to secure the merchant fleet , or his head would answer for it . About the same time , Howe , who had kept his vessels in port during the winter , sailed from the Channel with thirty-two ships of the line . These he soon divided into two squadrons ; one of which , numbering six , after performing a specific service , was not ordered to rejoin the main body , but to cruise in a different spot . These ships were sadly missed on the day of battle , when they could have changed a brilliant into a crushing victory . Howe himself went to seek the French , instead of taking a position where they must pass ; and after some running to and fro , in which the British actually got to the westward of their foes , and might well have missed them altogether , he was lucky enough , on the 28th of May , to find the larger of their two detachments . This having been meanwhile joined by one ship from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French were to windward , a position which gives the power of refusing or delaying decisive action . The average speed of any fleet , however , must fall below the best of some of the force opposed to it ; and Howe , wishing to compel battle , sent out six of his fastest and handiest ships . These were directed to concentrate their fire upon the rear of the French column , the weakest part , because , to be helped , vessels ahead must turn round and change their formation , performing a regular evolution , whereas , if the van be assailed , the rear continually advances to its aid . If this partial attack crippled one or more of the French , the disabled ships would drift towards the British , where either they would be captured , or their comrades would be obliged to come to their rescue , hazarding the general engagement that Howe wanted . As it happened , the French had in the rear an immense ship of one hundred and ten guns , which beat off in detail the successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she received so much injury that , after nightfall , she left the fleet , passing the British unmolested , and went back to Brest . One of her assailants , also , had to return to England . It may be scored to Howe 's credit that he let this single enemy go , rather than scatter his fleet and lose ground in trying to take her . He had a more important object . The next morning , May 29 , the French , by poor seamanship , had got somewhat nearer , and Howe saw that his column could be directed in such wise as to threaten a cannonade by a great part of it upon the hostile rear ; that he possibly might even cut off three or four ships . The necessary movement was ordered ; and the French admiral , seeing things in the same light , was so alarmed , justly , for the result that he turned his head ships , and after them his whole column in succession , to run down to help the rear . Judicious , and indeed necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands , and was a tribute to his tactical skill ; for in doing it the French gave up much of their distance to windward , and so hastened the collision they wished to avoid . Though the attack upon the French rear was limited to a few desultory broadsides , the two fleets were now nearly within cannon shot , whereas the day before they had been // eight or ten miles apart . They were running in parallel lines , west . Towards noon , Howe saw that the morning 's opportunity of directing his whole column upon the enemy 's rear again offered , but with a far better chance ; that if his ships manouvred well half a dozen of the French must be cut off , unless their admiral , to save them , underwent a general action . The necessary signals were made , but most of the fleet were poorly handled ; and seeing that failure would follow , Howe took the lead , tacked his own ship , though her turn was not come , and , with two others , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut off two of the enemy , which were speedily surrounded by others of the British . The French admiral then repeated his former evolution , and nothing could have saved a general engagement except the disorder into which the British had fallen , and Howe 's methodical abhorrence of attacks made in such confusion as prevailed . Moreover , the total result of this last brush was that the French entirely lost the windward position , and the British admiral knew that he now had them where they could not escape ; he could afford to postpone the issue . Accordingly , fighting ceased for the day ; but the French had been so mauled that three more ships had to go into port , leaving them but twenty-two to the enemy 's twenty-five . The French admiral now saw that he must fight , and at a disadvantage ; consequently , he could not hope to protect the convoy . As to save this was his prime object , the next best thing was to entice the British out of its path . With this view he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense fog coming on both favored his desi* , n and prevented further encounter during the two ensuing days . In the evening of May 31 the weather cleared , and at daybreak the next morning the enemies were in position , ready for battle , two long columns of ships , heading west , the British twenty-five , the French again twenty-six ; for during the two days ' chase their small detachment of four had joined . Howe now had cause to regret his six absent vessels , and to ponder Nelson 's wise saying , " Numbers only cati annihilate . " The time for maiunuvring was past . Able tactician as he personally was , and admirable as had been the direction of his efforts in the two days ' fighting , Howe had been forced in them to realize two things , namely , that his captains were , singly , superior in seamanship , and their crews in gunnery , to the French ; and again , that in the ability to work together as a fleet the British were so deficient as to promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest formation . To such , therefore , he resorted , falling back upon the old , unskillful , sledge-hammer fashion of the English navy . Arranging his ships in one long line , three miles from the enemy , he made them all go down together , each to attack a specified opponent , coming into action as nearly as might be at the same instant . Thus , the French , from the individual inferiority of the units of their fleet , would be at all points overpowered . The issue justified the forecast ; but the manner of performance was curiously and happily marked by Howe 's own peculiar phlegm . There was a long summer day ahead for fighting , and no need for hurry . The order was first accurately formed , and canvas reduced to proper proportions . Then the crews went to breakfast . After breakfast , the ships all headed for the hostile line , under short sail , the admiral keeping them in hand during the approach , as an infantry officer dresses his company . Thus , if not absolutely simultaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to induce results unequaled in any engagement conducted on the same primitive plan . // Picturesque as well as sublime , animating as well as solemn , on that bright Sunday morning , was this prelude to the stern game of war about to be played the quiet summer sea stirred only by a breeze sufficient to cap with white the little waves that ruffled its surface ; the dark hulls gently rippling the water aside in their slow advance , a ridge of foam curling on either side of the furrow ploughed by them in their onward way ; their massive sides broken by two , or at times three , rows of ports , whence , the tompions drawn , yawned the sullen lines of guns , behind which , unseen , but easily realized by the instructed eye , clustered the groups of ready seamen who served each piece . Aloft swung leisurely to and fro the tall spars , which ordinarily , in so light a wind , would be clad in canvas from deck to truck , but whose naked trimness now proclaimed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poops , where floated the standard of either nation , gathered round each chief the little knot of officers through whom he issued or received commands , the nerves along which thrilled the impulses of the great organism , from its head , the admiral , through every member to the dark lowest decks , nearly awash , where , as farthest from the captain 's own oversight , the senior lieutenants controlled the action of the ships ' heaviest batteries . On board the Queen Charlotte , Lord Howe , whose burden of sixty-eight years had for four days found no rest save what he could snatch in an armchair , now , at the prospect of battle , " displayed an animation , " writes an eye-witness , " of which , at his age , and after such fatigue of body and mind , I bad not thought him capable . He seemed to contemplate the result as one of unbounded satisfaction . " By his side stood his fleet-captain , Curtis , of whose service among the floating batteries at the siege of Gibraltar the governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom the king is chiefly indebted for its security ; " and Codrington , then a lieutenant , who afterwards commanded the allied fleets at Navarino . Five ships to the left , Collingwood , in the Barfleur , was making to the admiral whose flag she bore the remark that so stirred Thackeray : " Our wives are now about going to church , but we will ring about these Frenchmen 's ears a peal which will drown theirs . " The French officers , both admirals and captains , were mainly unknown men , alike then and thereafter . The fierce flames of the Revolution had swept away the men of the old school , mostly aristocrats , and time had not yet brought forward the very few who during the Napoleonic period showed marked capacity . The commander in chief , Villaret-Joycuse , had three years before been a lieutenant . He had a high record for gallantry , but was without antecedents as a general officer . With him , on the poop of the Montagne , which took her name from Robespierre 5 political supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , the Revolutionary commissioner , about to learn by experience the practical working of the system he had advocated , to disregard all tests of ability save patriotism and courage , depreciating practice and skill as unnecessary to the valor of the true Frenchman . As the British line drew near the French , Howe said to Curti* , " Prepare the signal for close action . " " There is no such signal , " replied Curtis . " No , " said the admiral , " but there is one for closer action , and I only want that to be made in case of captains not doing their duty . " Then closing a little signal book he always carried , he continued to those around him , " Now , gentlemen , no more book , no more signals . I look to you to do the duty of the Queen Charlotte in engaging the French flagship . I do n't want // the ships to be bilge to bilge , but if you can lock the yardarms , so much the better ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose was to go through the French line , and fight the Montagne on the far side . Some doubted their succeeding , but Howe overbore them . " That s right , my lord ! " cried Bowen , the sailing-master , who looked to the ship 's steering . " The Charlotte will make room for herself . " She pushed close under the French ship 's stern , grazing her ensign , and raking her from stern to stem with a withering fire , beneath which fell three hundred men . A length or two beyond lay the French Jacobin . Howe ordered the Charlotte to luff , and place herself between the two . " If we do , " said Bowen , " we shall be on board one of them . " " What is that to you , sir ? " asked Howe quickly . " Oh ! " muttered the master , not inaudibly . " D-n my eyes if I care , if you do n't . I 11 go near enough to singe some of our whiskers . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going off , he brought the Charlotte sharp round , her jib boom grazing the second Frenchman as her side had grazed the flag of the first . From this moment the battle raged furiously from end to end of the field for nearly an hour , - a wild scene of smoke and confusion , under cover of which many a fierce ship duel was fought , while here and there men wandered , lost , in a maze of bewilderment that paralyzed their better judgment . An English naval captain tells a service tradition of one who was so busy watching the compass , to keep his position in the ranks , . that he lost sight of his antagonist , and never again found him . Many a quaint incident passed , recorded or unrecorded , under that sulphurous canopy . A British ship , wholly dismasted , lay between two enemies , her captain desperately wounded . A murmur of surrender was somewhere heard ; but as the first lieutenant checked it with firm *ithority , a cock flew upon the stump of a mast and crowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not given to despair , and a burst of merriment , accompanied with three cheers , replied to the bird 's triumphant scream . On board the Brunswick , in her struggle with the Vengeur , one of the longest and fiercest fights the sea has ever seen , the cocked hat was shot off the effigy of the Duke of Brunswick , which she bore as a figure-head . A deputation from the crew gravely requested the captain to allow the use of his spare chapeau , which was securely nailed on , and protected his grace 's wig during the rest of the action . After this battle with the ships of the new republic , the partisans of monarchy noted with satisf action that , among the many royal figures that surmounted the stems of the British fleet , not one lost his crown . Of a harum-scarum Irish captain are told two droll stories . After being hotly engaged for some time with a French ship , the fire of the latter slackened , and then ceased . He called to know if she had surrendered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " shoutedhe , " d-n you , why do n't youfire ? " Having disposed of his special antagonist without losing his own spars , the same man kept along in search of new adventures , until he came to a British ship totally dismasted and otherwise badly damaged . She was commanded by a captain of rigidly devout piety . " Well , Jemmy , " hailed the Irishman , " you are pretty well mauled ; but never mind , Jemmy , whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth . " The French have transmitted to us less of anecdote , nor is it easy to connect the thought of humor with those grimly earnest republicans and the days of the Terror . There is , indeed , something unintentionally funny in the remark of the commander of one of the captured ships to his captors . They had , it was true , dismasted half the French fleet , and had taken over a // fourth ; yet he assured them it could not be considered a victory , " but merely a butchery , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one story , noble and enduring , that will ever be associated with the French on the 1st of June is in full keeping with the temper of the times and the enthusiasm of the nation . The seventy - four - gun ship Vengeur , after a three hours ' fight , yardarm to yardarm , with the British Brunswick , was left in a sinking state by her antagonist , who was herself in no condition to help . In the confusion , the Vengeur 's peril was for some time not observed ; and when it was , the British ships that came to her aid had time only to remove part of her survivors . In their report of the event , the latter said : " Scarcely had the boats pulled clear of the sides , when the most frightful spectacle was offered to our gaze . Those of our comrades who remained on board the Vengeur du Peuple , with hands raised to heaven , implored , with lamentable cries , the help for which they could no longer hope . Soon disappeared the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the horror with which this scene inspired us all , we could not avoid a feeling of admiration mingled with our grief . As we drew away , we heard some of our comrades still offering prayers for the welfare of their country . The last cries of these unfortunates were , Vive la R6publique ! ' They died uttering them . " Over a hundred Frenchmen thus went down . Seven French ships were captured , including the sunk Vengeur . Five more were wholly dismasted , but escaped , - a good fortune mainly to be attributed to Howe 's utter physical prostration , due to his advanced years and the continuous strain of the past five days . He now went to bed , completely worn out . Had he been younger , there can be little doubt that the fruits of victory would have been gathered with a vigor which his assistant , Curtis , failed to show . Lord Howe 's career practically ended with this battle , and the honors that followed it . Infirmities then gained rapidly upon him , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted by the government . He remained in nominal command of the Channel fleet , though not going to sea , until the outbreak of the famous mutinies of 1797 . The suppression - or , more properly , the composing - of this ominous outbreak was devolved upon him by the ministry . He very wisely observed that " preventive measures rather than corrective are to be preferred for preserving discipline in fleets and armies ; " but it was in truth his own failure to use such timely remedies , owing to the lethargy of increasing years , acting upon a temperament naturally indulgent and apathetic , that was largely responsible for disorders of whose imminence he had warning . From the military standpoint , the process of settlement had much the air of op6ra bouffe , - a consummation probably inevitable when just grievances and undeniable hardships get no attention until the sufferers break through all rules , and seek redress by force . The mutinous seamen protested to Howe the bitterness of their sorrow at the sense of wrong doing , but in the same breath insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obnoxious officers must be removed from their ships . The demands were yielded , Howe gently explaining to the men how naughty they had been ; and that , as to the unpopular officers , they themselves asked relief from so unpleasant a situation . In his curiously involved style , he wrote : " This request has been complied with , under the pretext of an equal desire on the part of the officers not to be employed in ships where exception , without specification of facts , has been // taken to their conduct . However ineligible the concession , it was become indispensably necessary . " Under this thin veil , men persuaded themselves that appearances were saved , as a woman hides a smile behind her fan . Admiral Codrington , a firm admirer of Howe , justly said : " It was want of discipline which led to the discontent and mutiny in the Channel fleet . Lord Howe got rid of the mutiny by granting the men all they asked ; but discipline was not restored until the ships most remarkable for misconduct had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lord St. Vincent . " With the settlement of this mutiny Lord Howe 's long career of active service closed . Immediately afterwards he retired formally , as he some time before had actually , from the command of the Channel fleet , and on the 5th of August , 1799 , he died full of years and honors ; having lived just long enough to welcome the rising star of Nelson 's glory as it burst upon men 's sight at Cape St. Vincent and the Nile . Of the four British admirals whose careers have been sketched in The Atlantic , Howe alone inherited fortune and social rank ; but he also fought his way far beyond the modest position bequeathed to him by his brother . Eminent all , though in varying manner and degree , each illustrated a distinct type in the same noble profession . All were admirable officers , but they differed greatly in original endowments and consequent development . It was intuitive with St. Vincent to take wide and far-sighted views , and to embody them in sustained , relentless action . Endued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneously and easily along his difficult path . He approached , although he did not attain genius . In Howe is seen rather the result of conscientious painstaking acting upon excellent abilities , but struggling always against a native heaviness and a temper both indolent and indulgent . A man of talent , he educates himself to acquirements which in his rival have the character of perception ; and only under the spur of emergency does he rise to the height of greatness , to sink afterwards by his own weight . Both were great general officers , a claim which can scarcely be advanced for Saumarez and Exmouth , able , brilliant , and devoted as they were . Saumarez was the steadfast , skillful , accomplished master of his profession , but one whose aptitudes and tastes placed him in the great organization of the fleet as a principal subordinate rather than as head . Exmouth was the typical , innate seaman , intensely active , whose instincts are those of the partisan warrior , and who shines most in the freedom of detached service . All bore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with honor such that their names will be remembered as long as naval history endures.
