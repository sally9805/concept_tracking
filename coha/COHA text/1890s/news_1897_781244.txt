txt A vessel supposed to be the Dauntless came into Hill  --  borough Bay last night , and took on a cargo of arms and ammunition from a schooner lying at anchor off the mouth of the Alafia River and then sailed away . A report was sent out yesterday that the Dauntless had sailed from Key West with an expedition . It was circulated by those interested to throw the officers off their guard , and the Dauntless came in last night and got her cargo . The two boats were tied up until about 11 o'clock , and in the moonlight could be plainly seen from the river front . J. E. Cartava and Charles Silva are the only ones who are known to be aboard , and they came up from Key West . The schooner came into the bay and anchored Saturday afternoon . She was two masted and of about 130 tons . Her hull was black , and she was evidently well loaded . Quite a number of men went from West Tampa , striking across the country and proceeding to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where the Col. Calleros expedition . embarked . The expedition was well planned , and was gone fully twelve hours before the authorities or . Spanish Consul knew that anything was going on , so completely were they thrown off their guard by yesterday 's shrewd ruse . The Dauntless had an engagement to go on the ways here , and had a Government boat come upon her unexpectedly , she would have had a good excuse fvr being in Hillsborough Bay . The whole affair was worked very quietly . The mysterious schooner left about daylight this morning . No one seems to know what boat this is . Some assert that it is the Adams , which received her load from the Biscayne , and then ran up into this harbor to meet a steamer , which would take the munitions to Cuba or out to sea to the Dauntless . There is also a rumor to the effect that the schooner hails from the neighborhood of Carrabelle and received her load at a point where the railroad crosses the river . The presence of Capt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city for the past few days adds strength to the rumor . Since his arrival he has been in conference with parties formerly very active in the filibustering business .
