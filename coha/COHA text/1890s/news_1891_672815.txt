txt There is now living on the Baltimore a Dr. Stanley , a British subject , who has lived in Chile for some years . He was a witness to the attack upon Turnbull , the Baltimore sailor , who died of his injuries . Dr. Stanley defended the man as well as he was able , and afterward took him to a hospital and oared for him . It was known that his testimony would be damaging in this ease , and about a week after the affair occurred he was assaulted at Villa del Mar and arrested . Efforts were made to prevent his testimony being taken , but when he was released from prison he went aboard the Baltimore for protection and has remained there since . The members of the crew of the Baltimore have subscribed nearly $500 in gold and purchased a monument to place over the graves of Biggins and Turnbull , their two comrades who were killed last month . The monument has been suitably inscribed and will be placed in position in a few days . Another case of cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some attention .
