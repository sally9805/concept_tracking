txt There could be no better illustration of the endless perplexities of the system of taxing personal property than the differences of opinion that prevail among those who advocate it . Hardly any two of them agree as to what should be done to make it effective . Most of them , while ostensibly contending for equality , would violate some of the plainest principles of justice .. An ox-Assessor of the State who testified before the legislative committee yesterday favored taxing both real estate and mortgages and taxing personal property without deduction for debt . Both of these are propositions for double taxation , which is not equality or justice . if a piece of real estate has an assessable value of $100,000 and is mortgaged for $50,000 , the mortgagee has in a certain sense a half interest in it . It matters nothing to the Efate , except as a matter of convenience in collecting , whether the owner of the fee pays half the tax and the holder of the mortgage the other half , or whether the former pays the whole . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ad. justed in either case in the r : to of interest . But to tax the real estate for $100,000 and the mortgage as worth $50,000 besides would be to draw from a valuation of $150,000 on property worth only two-thirds the amount . So of debt deduction . A man buys personal property valued at $100,000 , pays half and gives his note for the rest . His creditor is taxed on the " debt duo , " or $50,000. and his own actual property in the goods is $50 , - 000 . If he can not deduct the debt a tax is paid upon one-half more than the value of the property . The subject is full of such confusions.
