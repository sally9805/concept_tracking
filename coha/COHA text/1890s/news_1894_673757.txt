txt The publication of the important decision by which the United States Circuit Court declares the Bell Telephone Company 's Berliner patent to be null and void will remind a good many persons of that other suit in which the Government asked the courts to annul one of the company 's original patents . This other suit is still pending . But it is more than eight years old . The suit against the Berliner patent was begun in February , 1893 . It has been tried , and a decision has been rendered . This result has been reached in less than two years . But in the . other case more than eight years have passed and still there is no decision . We are not aware that the arguments have been made . At last accounts the court was still taking testimony . This suit against one of the , two original or basic patents of the Bell Company was begun in 18S6 . What has been the cause of this extraordinary de-lay ? An absurd feature of these prolonged proceedings is shown by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court to annul is now dead . It has been annulled by the expiration of its lawful term of seventeen years . It has been dead for more than a year and a half . It expired on March 7 , 1893 . When this old suit was begun , the patent in question had seven years of life remaining . The Government held that the company was not entitled to the benefits derived from the use of it . Obviously , if the Government was right , a decision would be of no value to the public ( which the Government represented ) unless it should be reached in less than seven years . The suit against the I3erliner patent has been prosecuted to a conclusion in less than two years . Was it not practicable in two years after the beginning of the other suit to reach a decision ? Surely the work could have been done in three years . A decision at the end of three years , in favor of the Government , would have deprived the Company  --  so far as such a decision could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last four years of its allotted term . But the suit dragged along , in the testimony stage , throughout the entire remaining seven years of the patent 's life . The court was still taking testimony when the patent expired , in 1S93 ; it continued to take testimony after that date , although a decision as to the validity ' of the patent could no longer have any practical value . And during all those seven years the Bell Company was using that patent and relying upon it for the maintenance of its very profitable monopoly . What was the cause of this remarkable delay ? What was the influence that prevented a conclusion of these important proceedings before the expiration of the patent , seven years after the beginning of the suit ? We do not know . We are not aware that any explanation , ade , quate or otherwise , has ever been made by either party . We presume , however , I that the Bell Company did not complain of the prolonged postponement .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
