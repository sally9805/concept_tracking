Dimock , once one of the most prominent financiers of New-York City , who for some . time has been living at the Peakamoose Clubhouse , in the town of Denning , Ulster County , and J. Q. A. Ward , the sculptor , reached a very sensational cli-max a few days ago , when Mr. Ward and an officer , armed with a warrant of dispossession , forced Mr. Dimock and his family to vacate the premises . Mr. Dimock , who has been living quietly at the romantic clubhouse for several years , made application to Judge Clearwater of this city some months ago to be released from the payment of debts amounting to $4,000,000 . This man 's life has been beset with troubles for a long time , despite the fact that he has Mired in fine style at the Peakamoose Clubhouse . The club has but a few members , one of whom is Mr. Ward . Mr. Ward had an order served on Mr. Dimock last Spring , restraining him from moving into the house for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York Judge , and Mr. Dimock and his family moved into their Summer quarters . Since then Mr. Ward has been planning to get the occupants out of their comfortable abiding place . During the heavy rainstorm of Wednesday Mr. Ward went to the clubhouse with an officer , and upon Mr. Dimock 's refusal to admit him , broke open the doors . Nearly all the furniture was placed out of doors , and Mr. Dimock and his family were forced to seek shelter elsewhere . Now , Mr. Ward and Elmer Van Wagoner , the constable , are accused of having assaulted one of Mr. Dimock 's wslrkmen , and it is said the matter will be taken into the courts . Some of Mr. Dimock 's friends were in this city to-day and appeared before Judge Clearwater for the purpose of making an application in regard to the matter . Mr. Dimock is the receiver of the club , and on that ground claims he has a right to occupy the clubhouse . J. W.

Dimock from the Peakamoose Clubhouse , in the Catskills , brings into notice again a man whose career has been as remarkable as that of any speculator whose fortunes have been made or lost in that erratic canon which is overlooked by Trinity Church . For a man who at one time virtually controlled the gold market , this eviction from the clubhouse wherein he had taken . up his residence is a tawdry sort of incident . But Mr. DimoCk 's life has been one of loud pontrasts . He was three times a millionaire , and was three times wrecked by ill fortune . He - twice retrieved his fortunes , but the third disaster seems to have left him insolvent , although he has since made strong efforts to regain his old footing in the financial world . His first disaster was in the early sixties , when Pacific Mail stock , in which he had most of his money invested , and for which he was striving to secure the controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators had time to unload . Mr. Dimock stemmed the tide until one morning , when the Atlantic Mail fell from 87 to 35 . The company collapsed , and Dimock seemed to be hopelessly involved in the wreck . He retired from the Street , but shortly afterward reappeared with a capital which was estimated at $2,000,000 , and which rt as said to have been made by investments in New-Jersey real estate . Another financial crash came in 1872 and left him bankrupt . Dimock 's third essay was begun in a modest little office in Exchange Court . He formed a partnership with J. T. Howland , and the two , by conservative dealings , managed to get together enough money to start business in Wall Street . His third fortune went during the finart-cial disturbances of 1884 , when he failed for many millions . Mr. Dimock was then forty-one years old . After that crushing disaster he was not heard of for several years . Then he unexpectedly turned up in the Catskill Mountains . There he had filed an application with the County Judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debtor . In making his application , he filed releases from creditors to whom ' he was indebted to the amount of nearly $2,800,000 . No one knew how he had managed to pay such a sum , as he was supposed to have been wholly insolvent at the time of his last failure . Bernard Malone , six years old , of 329 West Fifty-ninth Street , was knocked down and run over in front of his home last evening by Car No. 138 of the Belt Line .
