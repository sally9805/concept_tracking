txt The financial outlook has so mu.ch improved that the down-town markets are no longer worried over unfavorable conditions . What little doubt in this line may have lingered over the national holiday was dispelled by the action of the Chamber of Commerce at Thursday 's meeting . It seems now to be taken for granted that the resolutions adopted at that meeting will furnish business men throughout the country with a text for similar utterances . At the various banks yesterday the resolutions were most heartily commended , not only because they reflected sound opinion , bat because they clothed that opinion in temperate language . Reports from various quarters indicated that other organizations would closely follow the Chamber of Commerce , and that within a few days business opinion in this section of the country would find formal expression and business organizations would take steps toward bringing all possible influence to bear upon Congress in favor of wholesome legislation . An echoing response to the Chamber of Commerce meeting came yesterday when Edward G. Burgess , William T. Wardwell , and Robert 0 . N. Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom was referred by the Board of Managers the question of the attitude that the Exchange should take with reference to the advisability of the repeal of the Sherman law , made a report declaring the law to have been one of the main causes of present commercial troubles and earnestly recommending its repeal The Board of Managers approved and adopted this report and directed that a copy of it be sent to each of the Senators and Representatives of this State in Congress . The report will be printed in the form of a petition and circulated for signature by members of the Exchange . The Stock Exchange , always quick to anticipate events , began yesterday to discount wholesome financial influence , and in spite of reports by no means favorable and of efforts to magnify rumors of little importance and turn them in the wrong direction , the market held steady and in many oases there were fair advances in securities . The small remnant of bear operators who still tried to do something in the market started a report in the afternoon that the President had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedient failed to have any effect , for of course no one believed it and every one suspected its origin . Just before the close of the market there was an attempt on the , part of the calamity hunters to bid up la " ) rates for money . It happened that plenty of money was on hand to loan at moderate rates , so that the movement in this direction also had no effect except to confound those who had engineered it . As against these negativeinfinences there Was some actual good news that everybody had to recognize . The Augusta Victoria , arriving in port yesterday afternoon , brought about $225,000 in gold from Europe . Although this shipment was not large , financiers recognized it as an indication that the tide of gold was really turning , and must shortly flow in force from Europe to this country . This import of gold made a total of $725,000 received here from the other side of the ocean within the last ten days . It is confidently expected that in spite of all efforts in England to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced by the demand of trade , and that having once started , it will be quite as difficult to stop their continuance as it was a while ago to stem the stream of gold going to Europe . While gold turned into the assay office does not count as an import , even though it may have come from abroad , the good news of the day always acquires something when it includes deposits of foreign gold with the Government Assayer . Deposits were made yesterday by one firm of about $425,000 in Spanish gold , and by another firm of $210,000 in Mexican gold . The firms making these deposits were paid for the coin at bullion value and took out greenbacks . The price of silver dropped yesterday a trifle because of the Government purchase at 72 cents ner ounce . As soon as news to this effect came from Washington the price of silver certificates , which had been 73 cents , fell also to 72 cents , and the price of commercial bar silver dropped to 71 cents per ounce . At these prices offerings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no bars to be had at less than 7218 cents per ounce . A piece of good news in connection with silver was that 395,000 ounces were bought yesterday for export , and would be shipped to Europe to-day . Banks took out $500,000 additional Clearing House certificates yesterday , making a total issue of $22.505,000 . As against this issue there were all kinds of favorable repurts with regard to the banks and the certificate &; One of the banks received word from a borrower that by Monday he would return $400,000 which he obtained a few days ago , and the bank gave notice that if this vioney was returned . it would retire Clearing House certificates to that amount . Uome of the banks receiving deposits of checks drawn upon the Sub-Treasury have availed themselves within a day or two of their right to present these checks at the Sub-Treasury for payment in currency rather than to collect them through the Veering House . Checks to the amount of about $450,000 irere cashed in this way by the Sub-Treasury Thursday . and to the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of business yesterday the Clearing House owed . the Sub-Treasury $283,986 . There were no exchanges of currency at the Sub-Treasury yesterday , and no demand for money came from any quarter . The Sub-Treasury released for circulation yesterday on account of interest on Government issues due July 1 ** The result of the determination of savings banks to return deposits that were withdrawn , already announced in THE NEw-YORK TIMES , will be that deposits in the various banks of deposit within the next few days will be increased from this source alone by from $20,000,000 to $25,000,000 . The savings ' kepi &; officers say that they withdrew heavily in anticipation of large drafts about July 1 . It seems to have been supposed that depositors wanted their money and would take it out at the first opportunity . It does not appear that depositors were as anxious to take out money as is usual with them at this time of year . An index of the improving conditions is furnished in the market for commercial paper , which is reported by dealers as very . much improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dealers who demanded and . obtained high rates for paper as recently as a week ago now find that merchants are able to borrow as much as they wish at low rates . The country banks are coming into the market for mercantile paper , and some of the city banks are also taking paper of this character . The change for the better in regard to this class of paper is a subject of general congratulation among bankers and business men .
