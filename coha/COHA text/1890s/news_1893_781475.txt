txt The annual reports of the trade journals for the year just closed contain some interesting figures concerning the steel rail trade . The Bulletin of the Iron and Steel Association publishes a table of the prices of certain products in each month of the last two years , from which we take the fol-lowing : deleted table Beginning with February , 1891 , there is no variation for twenty-three months in the price of rails , which is uniformly $30 per ton . But there is shown in the same period a steady decline in the price of 13essemer pig iron , the rail manufacturers ' raw material , from $10.25 to $13.90 . The price of gray forge pig iron fell from $14.50 to $12.50 , and that of No. 1 anthracite foundry pig iron from $17.50 to $15.12 . But the price of steel rails suffered no reduction , although it is admitted that the demand has fallen off in the last eight or ten months . Other tables published by the association furnish material for the following comparison : 1889. 1892 . Bessemer pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29.25 30.00 Difference . $11.25 $15.63 In 1889 , when the monthly average price of the raw material was $18 , the monthly average for rails was $29.25 . Last year , when the average cost of raw material was only $14.37. the price of rails was uniformly $30 . Te quote these figures because they throw so much light upon the purposes and the exactions of those who make illegal combinations designed to suppress competition . The professional and other defenders of such combinations assert that by means of them certain " economies of production " are attained which can not be reached while ordinary competition prevails , and that these " economies " reduce the cost of production as well as the selling prices . The official reports of the Iron and Steel Association show that the existing combination of ? the manufacturers of steel rails for the railways of this country has maintained a uniform ring price of $30 per ton throughout the period of twenty-three months in which there has been a steady decline in the cost of the raw material from $16.25 to $13.90 . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually lower in 1889 , when the average cost of the raw material was $18 , than in 1892 , when the cost of it was only $14.37 . These facts are worth more than the assertions of professional economists or other advocates who are retained by the year . If the combination of steel rail makers enjoys any " economies of production " that could not be attained while the manufacturers were engaged in ordinary competition , can the proof of this be found by the public in the maintenance of prices far above the normal competitive level and a contemptuous disregard for a notorious decline in the cost of raw material ? There is another aspect of this case . Without the assistance of a tariff duty of $13.44 per ton this ring price of $30 could not have been exacted . The greater part of that duty should be removed .
