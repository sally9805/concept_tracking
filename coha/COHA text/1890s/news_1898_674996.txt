txt That the Republicans of West Virginia are not confident that they have a " walk-over " in that State , which Senator ElkinS says is " permanently Republican , " has been indicated by the anxiety manifested to get all kinds of help there to keep it from becoming temporarily Democratic . The latest manifestation of concern is that revealed in a letter written by Fish Commissioner George M. Bowers to John R. Conaway , in the navy yard , asking him to go home and vote , and in-closing an excursion ticket to enable him to get home and back to Washington . The envelope In which this ticket and invitation were carried bore the penalty instruction and the designation of the office of the Fish Commission to show that it had come from a Government office , but no postage stamp , and as it was not Government business upon which the message was sent , the " penalty for private use " would appear to be $3 ( 10 . Commissioner Bowers admits that he has been encouraging West Virginians to go home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Bowers , " that I have been doing all I could to help carry my district , which is the Second West Virginia . I have bought and mailed 150 railroad tickets to addresses furnished me by the Congressional Committee of that district to men who are entitled to vote there . There is no question of my right to do so . The West Virginia Republican Association of this city , and several prominent citizens as well , furnished me with the names of a number of West Virginia Republicans who desired to go home and vote . Many of them did not feel able to buy railroad tickets , and I was personally asked if I could help them . I took the names of those who desired to go home , and went to Baltimore , where I purchased with cash the desired tickets . These I turned over to my secretary with instructions to send them . I furnished him with stamps to place on the envelopes . He tells me that he did this in every case . " There has been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voter , and on this point I court an investigation . " The names furnished me were understood to be those of Republicans only , and of the men who earnestly wished to go home and vote . It is likely that some one has stolen an unstamped envelope from my office before it had been stamped to be sent out to mail . It was then mailed without a stamp for the purpose of trying to cause trouble . "
