txt Judge COWING 'S answer to the criticisms of Dr. PARKHURST upon his judicial conduct will be accepted by most fair-minded men , we think , as entirely conclusive . Dr. PARKHURST was moved by zeal as a reformer , added to something of the partisanship of a prosecutor , to chagrin and resentment by what he regarded as the escape from justice of a guilty man . He attributed this to the precipitation with which Judge COWING had dismissed the jury , of which it afterward appeared that a decided majority was in favor of conviction . Dr. PARKHURST , if we understand him , does not charge that Judge COWING was actuated by sympathy either with this particular prisoner or with the crime of which he was accused . In that case it would perhaps have been wiser to refrain from public criticism . When a Judge 's motives are not aspersed , to attack his conduct of a case is to quarrel with the manner in which he has exercised his judicial discretion . Every disappointed prosecutor and every unsuccessful litigant is tempted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is prepared to maintain that the Judge is corrupt . Otherwise he is guilty , to the extent of his influence , in disturbing public confidence in the administration of justice , and to do this without grave cause is to do the reverse of a public service . Dr. PARKHURST , considering this case as a moralist , found it very strong . Judge COWING , considering it as a Judge , found it , as he now explains , " exceedingly weak . " If his judgment upon that point were not better than that of a layman , he would not deserve to be on the bench . The presumption is entirely in his favor . Zealous officials have made charges against the City Magistrates similar to that of Dr. PARKHURST against Judge COWING , and with as little support . Here , too , the presumption is with the Magistrates . When the Tammany rapscallions sate in the police courts , the presumption was entirely the other way , and they were reasonably to be suspected of sympathy with crime . But when men of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of good citizens to give them the benefit of every doubt , and of disappointed suitors to refrain from giving public expression to their disappointment .
