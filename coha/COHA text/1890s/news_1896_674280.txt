The appliances were not used , however , as the doctor finally succumbed to a sedative he had been prevailed upon to take from the hand of his niece . He fell into a sleep about 2 A. M. which lasted three or four hours and permitted Dr. A. W. Ferris to leave the hotel . After his light breakfast Dr. Gallagher again went to sleep for an hour . Dr. , who relinquished to Dr. Ferris the medical control of the man he brought from England , visited his former patient yesterday morning .

" John Curtin Kent , who served ten years in the same prison with Dr. Gallagher , called to see him , with the hope of being recognized . But his former fellow-prisoner was asleep , and the experiment could not be tried . A. meeting was held about noon yesterday , and it was decided that Dr. Gallagher 's deplorable state demanded his prompt removal to the asylum at Amityville . Gen. O'Beirne , therefore , took the application for the doctor 's commitment , which had been signed by Mrs. Connolly and her daughter , and , in company with the patient 's sister , started to find a Judge to sign the commitment . While the General was gone there was a wild time in Dr. Gallagher 's room .

" He can not : e-coverHe should be placed under restraint . " Dr. Manley said there was great danger to others in leaving Dr. Gallagher free . " The melancholia he first showed in prison , " said the doctor , " has passed the dementia stage , and he is now a confirmed idiot . " While Gen.

When Gen. O'Beirne 's search for a person authorized to commit the patient ended in failure , it was decided to take him to the Long Island Home , at Amityville , without the commitment papers , which will be sent to-day to secure his legal incarceration . Accordingly , an opiate was given the doctor , his coat was buttoned over his restraining jacket , and at 9 o'clock the start was made . The doctor made no objection to entering a carriage , in which were his sister , his niece , and a nurse . Preceded by a hansom containing Gen. O'Beirne and Capt . McChrystal , he was driven to the Long Island City Ferry . His watchful guardians did not leave him until they saw him safe in the asylum .
