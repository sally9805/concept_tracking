txt Although the Raines law amendments , as the police interpreted them , were very generally observed yesterday , there was no lack of drinkables in any section of the city The regular out-and-out saloons that made no pretense of being anything else were closed and closed tightly , but there was no precinct but afforded several places of refuge for the thirsty . The law that shut one house permitted another to operate more openly . Where " fake " hotels had closed clubs had opened , and where " fake " clubs had gone out of business " fake " hotels had reformed sufficiently to comply with the peculiarities of the law and to enable them to defy the police . Taken altogether , New Yorkers and their guests had little to complain of , and the man who did not look too much like a policeman in plain clothes had no need to go to Brooklyn or New Jersey to satisfy his appetite . In the Tenderloin precinct the " clubs " were amply sufficient to supply all demands . The three within a. stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver Dollar " Smith 's Young Men 's Cosmopolitan Club , the Franco-Belgian American Club , and the Gramercy Club , alias the Newmarket dance hall  --  did a rushing business , much to the chagrin of the Police Captain . The clubs have no waiting lists , and the requirements from intending members are few . At the Gramercy Club , to become a member , it was required that the applicant pay 23 cents for a hat check and give a name and address . He was thereupon promptly enrolled , and , receiving a membership ticket , was admitted to the caf ? , where he was able to obtain all the refreshments he could imbibe , no sandwiches or meals being essential . Capt . Chapman 's Lament . " The law . " said Capt . Chapman , sadly , " is being observed by all the hotels and saloons . There is not a saloon open in the precinct , but the clubs are beyond me .

" At some of the big hotels , the waiters v. ere instructed to ask visitors ordering drinks with their meals if they were guests of the house , but as they took no trouble to verify replies by examination of the registers , few , if any , orders were refused . At the Astor House one man was asked if he had registered , and when he said " No. " was advised to do so if he wanted beer with his meal . But the rule was not general , and no such precautions wee adopted at the Waldorf , Firth Avenue , or Hoffman House . Under instructions from Chief Conlin the precinct commanders had laid down the law to the saloon and hotel keepers , and the actual violators were few .

The Magistrates were all lenient in their treatment of the alleged offender taken to the police courts , and carried out the policy expressed by them a week ago that they expected the police to enforce the law without being unjust or technical . In the Yorkville Court , after puzzling over a section of the amended law for some time , Magistrate Cornell characterized it as " most extraordinary . " and discharged an accused hotelkeeper because he could not understand the charge . A Puzzling Sub-Section . It was on the case of Bernard J. Reilly , who , by virtue of having ten bedrooms over his saloon at 902 Second Avenue , conducts a hotel , and claims the privilege of serving his guests on Sunday with liquor at their meals . The police discovered the : the cook and chambermaid of the house occupied two of the rooms , and therefore there were not " ten rooms for guests . " The complaint against Reilly was made under Sub-section K of Section 31 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is incomprehensible . It is the most wonderful and extraordinary thing on earth , " He read from the sub-section the definition of a hotel as " a building regularly used and kept open as a hotel for the feeding and lodging of guests , where all who conduct themselves properly and are able to pay for their entertainment are received if there be accommodations for them " - " Who is to be the judge of those points ? " he asked . " What is a correct definition of proper conduct , and is the proprietor of the place to make a physical and moral examination of his would-be guests before he knows if he is keeping a hotel ? " Lawyer Fennel , who appeared for Reilly , said he did not know , and the Magistrate continued reading , " and who , without any stipulated engagement as to the duration of their stay or as to the rate of compensation , are , while there , supplied at a reasonable charge with their meals , lodgings , and refreshment , and such service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as a temporary home . " " Now , " said the Magistrate , " who can tell me what that means and how it applies to this ease ?

" Senator Platt 's Sunday Meals . " Very likely . " replied Magistrate Cornell . " I do n't know how Mr. T. C. Platt will manage . He , I believe , hires rooms at the Fifth Avenue by the year . " " If he does . " said counsel , " and he gets a drink with his meals on Sunday , the hotel violates that sect-on of the law .

Harry Graham of 1,319 Second Avenue was held for examination and instructed to bring proof that his bed rooms are of the size ordained by law , and Henry Sylvander of 498 Third Avenue was held for trial for compelling Policeman Purfield in plain clothes to pay for a sandwich before serving him with beer . At Other Police Courts . Only one of the four men arraigned in the Essex Market Court was held . He is Henry Sicker of 50 Avenue B.

Magistrate Matt acce their pleas of ignorance of the meaning of " obstruction " and paroled all of them until Wednesday that they might alter their saloons to conform with the statute .. Two of the five men accused of violating the law in the Centre Street Police Court were held for trial . One was selling without a tax certificate , and the other sold a policeman a sandwich and a drink during the prohibited hours . The Arrests in This City .

In Brooklyn the police were not particularly energetic in closing Raines hotel bars , except during the prohibited hours from 1 until 3 o'clock . During those hours all bars , at least those exposed , did no business , but at dawn , hotel proprietors and barkeepers alike were astir waiting ,  --  or the day promised well . They had evidently determined that Brooklyn ? should not go thirsty , and no drinking man suffered . It . was indeed what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were a few Raines law offenders arrested , six or eight , but these were rash saloon keepers who defied the law . Perhaps the chief reason why there was not stricter surveillance on the ? hotels lay in an understanding on the part of the proprietors that fifteen days of grace promised had not expired , and considerable leeway would be allowed them . The privilege was taken , whatever the understanding . Many of the Proprietors who kept tightly closed on the preceding Sunday , not knowing exactly how they stood , ventured to open , and the cheerfulness of their demeanor last night indicated that they harbored no hard feelings against the police . The hotel men particularly indorse Police Commissioner Welles 's interpretation that " a sandwich constitutes . a meal . " But there were scores of places in Brooklyn yesterday where there was no pretense of even serving a sandwich with a drink . In the First Precinct , Capt . Miles O'Reilly 's , the law was held in more respect than in other parts of the city . Bona tide sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known requirements of the statute generally respected . There were two rests for violation DRINKS AT CONEY ISLAND . Almost Anything That Could - ae Swallowed Constituted a . Meal . It ? vap the same old Coney Island yesterday , in spite of the Raines law . There was no need for the thirsty to suffer unless they happened to be in quest of iced water . That is as difficult to procure at the Island as in New York , unless furnished as an accessory to something else that is bought and paid for . The weather was no cooler at the Bowery by the Sea yesterday than it was in town , and the crowd that filled the place was a thirsty one . Capt . Collins was disposed to allow the usual latitude in obtaining a supply of spirits and beer . He was on patrol himself all day , assisted by fourteen policemen in plain clothes , but no one was arrested for violating the liquor laws up to 8 o'clock last night . A well-gowned young woman and two young men were taken in for intoxication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was obvious that they had laid a substantial foundation for their waywardness somewhere else and gone to the Island for finishing touches . " I am enforcing the law as well as I can , according to my interpretation of it , " said Capt . Collins . He said that he should not interfere with hotel keepers who sold drinks with a meal , and he should arrest only those who violated that provision of the law . The " measurement " and " partition " violations that came to his attention he should make note of , to be laid before the Grand Jury . There is a peculiarity cf construction about the Coney Island hotels that , it is claimed , would make it necessary to reconstruct almost the whole place if the tape-measure requirements ore Interpreted too strictly by the police . It was announced a week ago , however , that the Coney Island dealers were to be ** fifteen days of grace to shape up their establishments to conform with the law . A reporter for THE NEW YORK T:MES who made the rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling to customers inside the barrooms , but these premises were all day thronged with waiters who carried trays loaded with brimming glasses to people at the tables . The sandwiches sent along with them were certainly never intended to be eaten , and they were not eaten . Most of them had seen so much service that the bread was curled at the edges and from most of them the meat had gone a-wandering . Some of the cl'eaper concert halls have put in a frankfurter attachment and serve a sausage hot from the grill , with a schooner of froth , for five cents . There seemed to be no diminution in the number of drinking places . - ' few of the smaller ones were not open , hut they were placarded with announcements that they would be open in a few days . Closing at 12 o'clock Saturday night is the part of the amended law that will hit sConey Island the hardest . It will be felt more severely as the season advances . There was a good deal of grumbling among restaurant keepers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license stop selling . None of the  --  big West End hotels are open yet . This provision will hit them harder than it does the eastern end of the Island . It will doubtless close up the famous Gold Room at the Manhattan Beach Hotel , which for years has been the rendezvous of late drinkers . One man in a hotel near the Sea Beach Palace was so hungry that he made an attempt to eat the sandwich furnished with his glass of beer . This was at : 3 o'clock In the afternoon . " Do n't do that , Sir , " remonstrated the waiter . " I am not charging you for it . We did not expect such a rush , and the kitchen is shy . " The customer desisted , and the mutilated sandwich made the rounds of the other fables . Excise violations in Astoria . John Richterer , proprietor of the Astoria Hotel . near the Ninety-second Street ferry , in Astoria , was arrested yesterday afternoon charged with violating the excise law . The saloon , it is claimed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel across the street from where he was arrested , and there the doors were also found wide open and business going on . Martin Gans , the bartender , who was in charge there , was also arrested . The men were taken before Justice Ingram , who held them in $500 bail each . Plenty of Beer on Excursion Boats . The weather is still a little cold for excursion boats , but a few of them that went out yesterday did a big bar business , particularly the Iron steamboats to Coney Island . They were well patronized on every trip , and it was noticeable that a large proportion of the people remained on the lower deck where the bar is . The moment the gangplank was hauled in , waiters made their rounds , and they were kept busy nearly all the time . it took a good many glasses to quench an average thirst , bu there was no limit to the supply of beer without even the pretense of serving a SO-faticayinl ? pted           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
