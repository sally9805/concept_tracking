Italy is the one power upon whom the burden of armament has rested with the most crushing weight . Years ago Sir CHARLES DILKE showed that she had been brought to the verge of bankruptcy and exhaustion by her anxiety to rank as a firstclass military and naval power , and to remain in the Dreibund as an equal partner with Germany and Austria . A nation of thirty millions which maintains in peace an army of a quarter of a million , readily expansible to a million in case of war , and a great navy can not but be in straits .
