ATLANTIC MONTHLY : * 0*rn*apue of *Literature , **ience , art , and lboUtic0 . VOL . LXV - APRJL , 1890. - No . CCCXC. - 4 - -   SOME POPULAR OBJECTIONS TO CIVIL SERVICE REFORM . ' IN TWO PARTS . PART ONE . I. " You gentlemen never weary of telling us that we are fallen on degenerate days ; that during the first forty years of our government , before we lapsed from our sinless state , officials were removed only for cause , and incumbents held on good behavior ; in other words , that civil service reform prevailed in all its purity . Now , it is philosophical generalization , founded on broad experience , that revolutions do not go backwards . Heed it , gentlemen , heed it ! The revolution of 1820-29 is an accomplished fact . It is here to stay , for then did the people come into their own . The present status has endured for a half century ; civil service reform is ancient history . You are chasing moonbeams . " The fatalist entrenches himself in platitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is must forever be ; what has been and is not will never be . And thus is the controversy closed . He forgets that much that is done remains to be undone ; that political progress is mostly negative , consisting mainly in the repeal of bad laws or in the abolition of evil customs . In this sense history is reversed every day , and the process will continue so long as le1 Such of these objections as are taken from the records of Congress are indicated by marginal reference and are quoted literally . The gislation is experimental and legislators are supine . It is true that some things in political history may be regarded as settled . But this can be predicated only of those changes which are based upon the immutable principles of right . The introduction of the *joils system into the administrative branch of the American government is not of these . That system is at war with equality , freedom , justice , and a wise economy , and is already a doomed thing fighting extinction . Its establishment was in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-willed man of stubborn and tyrannical nature , who had enemies to punish and debts to pay . He overrode a vehement opposition , disregarding the protest and sage prediction of the great statesmen of his time . He wielded a power that was arbitrary ; his caprice was law , his rule was a reign . If he wished to do a thing , it was enough that it seemed good to hini to do it . His idea of government was a personal one solely . Every public official was a private servitor , who must take the oath of allegiance and do homage to his chief . In his view , no man could honestly disagree with him . He was always right ; his opponents were hopelessly and criminally wrong . Here was a fit man to establish the spoils system , to explore the others - which reflect current lay discussion of the newspaper and the street - are repeated substantially , but not formally . S // Constitution for latent executive powers , to attach to the person of the President the high prerogatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor , office , and privilege is the theory of the English state ; that the civil service of the United States is a perquisite of the presidency was the theory of General Jackson . It is needless to say that the American commonwealth was not founded upon any such doctrine . Jackson 's interpretation of the Constitution was a gross perversion of the intent and meaning of that instrument . This was to be a government of laws , not of men ; and so far as the prescience of its framers availed it was made so . The liberties of the people were not to be left to individual scruple , but were secured by specific inhibitions upon the governmental agencies . Three departments were organized severally to make , execute , and interpret the laws , and each was to act as a check upon the other . With the adoption of the first ten amendments to the Constitution , it was thought that every avenue of attack upon popular rights had been closed . But the power of construction is greater than that of legislation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , but by some other who construes the law ; and with that other interpretation , is purely a subjective matter . Madison held that " the wanton removal of meritorious officers " was an impeachable offense . But Jackson swore to defend and protect the Constitution as he understood it , and not as Madison , one of its framers , conceived it . Regarding the right of removal the instrument itself is wholly silent , except as it provides impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors . When , therefore , Jackson organized the civil service into a gigantic political machine , proscribing office-holders because of his personal enmity to them or because of their political affiliations , it can not be said that he violated any specific provision of the Constitution . That such action was an usurpation of authority and a wanton betrayal of trust needs no verbal emphasis . With equal propriety and *oral justification , he might have used those other coordinate branches of the executive departinent , the army and navy , to perpetuate himself and his party in power . This he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aid . At any rate , after securing his own redection and after naming his successor , his ambition rested , - fortunately for the country . But what he did , he did thorough ly . The system of political brigandage inaugurated by him has subsisted even unto this day . But it is now upon the verge of dissolution . Its end is written and sealed . This last is the work of those who are grown weary of the spoliation of office , - of those who are jealous of the encroachments of the Executive , and who would tie the hands of that functionary for all time to come . With them it is not a question whether a clerk holds his office for four years or for fifteen years . They are determined that the great army of the civil service shall not be used by any man or by any set of men for purposes of personal or partisan aggrandizement ; that the freedom of elections shall not be assailed by an intriguing , corrupt , and organized force ; that presidential contests shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no " prizes of victory , " no carnival of spoil . Place-holders will attend to the business for which they are paid to attend ; fitness will be the essential of appointment , not the accident and the incident . This is the popular revolution that is moving forward irresistibly , that is coming to stay . Already has a law been enacted which , though partial in its effects , is capable of large extension by the President alone , without further action on the part of Congress . This measure leaves the power of removal for all except partisan reasons S // untouched . By regulating the method of appointment , it takes away the temptation to the abuse of that discretion . It is not a revival of a faded statute , nor has it its counterpart in early legislation . It is a new ordering of things ; practically a reversal of procedure . Although , during the first forty years of the republic , there was no statutory restriction upon the manner of appointment and removal , nevertheless the power of removal was controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions . But this was a frail dyke with which to withstand the pressure of a hungry and infiowing sea , and it was only a question of time until it should be swept away . That Congress did not strengthen it by positive legislation is to be deplored . But the omission is explicable . At the time of the formation of our government no law was deemed necessary . The civil service numbered but a thousand persons ; today it numbers two hundred thousand , and not many decades hence it will increase to a half million . Again , Congress had absolute faith in the Executive . All Presidents would be Washingtons , patient and moderate , patriotic rather than partisan . So highly was the first President esteemed that that body waived its consent to the removal of those officers whose appointment required their approval . Of course they did not contemplate the capricious exercise of this power ; the causeless removal of an official being to them an unthinkable proposition . But events outran prevision , and in the course of years not only did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the service . Such legislative changes as were made subserved a private and not a public interest . The immense patronage which was controlled by the Chief Executive , either directly by commission , or indirectly through the heads of departments , came to be administered for the benefit , not of himself alone , but of the represen tative politicians as well . This step was gained partly through a recognition by the President of the eminent utility of sub-allotment for personal p*poses , and partly , in the failure of that persuasion , through the exercise of such coercive power as could be wielded by the Senate in confirmation , and by both houses in the passage of acts regulating the term and tenure of office . Gradually , out of the chaotic scramble for spoil , there was evolved a system of distribution which was founded upon hoary precedent , and which , in nice precision and in perfection of detail , lacked nothing of a scientific character . The whole country was staked out into districts , as many in number as there were Congressmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdings , and the victors took possession of the glebe . But the estates thus granted were made conditional upon the performing of certain services or upon the rendering of certain tribute . Each tenant held of some feudal superior , and all held , mediately or immediately , of the lord paramount , the President . The governmental offices scattered everywhere were so many baronial strongholds , and were filled with retainers who were chosen for their fighting qualities . The chief duty of these men was to check uprisings and to keep the people in subjection . Their places depended upon the faithful discharge of it . In other words , the civil service was a graded vassalage of a militant character . All offices were the private property of the head of the state , and were dispensed by royal favor . What is this but feudalism in new clothes , or , rather , the garbed skeleton thereof ? By some fantastic jugglery , this mocking semblance of a dead and buried past has become a stalking figure in a new and progressive civilization . Verily has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relegated to the glass case of antiquities , there to remaia as a curiosity for posterity to stare at . // The spoils system should have perished a quarter of a century ago , in the cataclysm which destroyed that other relic of feudalism , slavery . For they were twin evils , and were ever unfailing allies ; and when the time shall come to write the history of public opinion in America during the nineteenth century , they will be classed together ; John Morley suggestively says of the " peculiar institution , " " Nobody has yet traced out the full effect upon the national character of the Americans of all those years of conscious complicity in slavery , after the immorality and iniquity of slavery had become clear to the inner conscience of the very men who ignobly sanctioned the mobbing of the Abolitionists. " 1 Adherence to the letter of a contract which was " a covenant with death and an agreement with hell " was due partly to an unfaltering instinct of Union . But many were influenced by motives less worthy . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a degrading sycophancy . Eager and grateful for the crumbs . which fell from the Southern table , and despairing of obtaining those crumbs elsewhere , they suffered themselves to become the supple tools of the slave power . These " Swiss guards of slavery fighting for pay " were a race of place-hunters , with whom office was the end , not the means , and whose statesmanship , like that of the Augustan Senate , consisted in justifying personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude . They steadily prostituted principle to preferment , and came near involving this country in irretrievable ruin . But the age of compromise - the era of " bigotry with a doubt " and of " persecution without a creed " - was succeeded by the age of blood and iron . The war was an ethical education ; like a great storm , it purified the air . After it was 1 Critical Miscellanies , Harriet Martinean , page 268. over the people began to see more clearly and more truly ; they learned to view things " in the visual angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spoils system , a long-established practice claiming charter by prescription , has been called upon to justify itself . Until recently , the people of this country supposed that traffic in place , the unceasing clamor for office , the sack and pillage of the government by the dominant party , were a necessary part of democratic institutions . Many politicians , with selfish purposes to subserve , were interested in enforcing this view . To the principle that the majority must rul* they added the corollary that all the offices are essential to that rule . They further inculcated the idea that every national election is a battle of enemies , instead of an amicable contest of friends , whose interests are the same , and " who disagree not except in opinion . " It must be confessed that during the rebellion , when the North was divided between the war party and the peace party , there was some foundation for this doctrine . He who was not with you was against you . But the intense partisanism engendered by that strife is relaxing into an amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a test of patriotism . The government is not the property of faction , and the minority have rights which must be respected . " V*v victis " is no longer the slogan of the fight . If civil service reform has not made that progress which idealists expect , - conquering all on the instant , - let it be remembered that the growth of moral movements is necessarily slow , especially in a democracy , where , it is scarcely hyperbole to say , the last man must be convinced . It is none the less sure , however ; for " one man in the right becomes a majority , " and the American people mean to do right when they know where the right lies . // II . " I believe this commission to be undemocratic . I believe it favors certain voters in this country at the expense of other votQrs , and I know that if the rulings of ' the civil service commission were applied to the members of this House not seven eighths of the members would ever reach the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be undemocratic , and believi4ig that it is in violation of the fundamental principles of the government , I move to strike out the whole section , and hope that it will be agreed to . " * To apply the rules of the merit system to the members of Congress would be a cruelty indeed , and is altogether a harrowing suggestion . But it is beside the point . If civil service reform be undemocratic , and if it violate the fundamental principles of our government , the motion made in the House of Representatives to strike out the appropriation to the commission should have prevailed . As a matter of fact , it was overwhelmingly defeated by a vote of twenty-five to one hundred and thirtyeight . This would appear to be decisive . * It is evident , however , from the discussion that preceded the calling of the yeas and nays , that the scope and object of civil service reform are still profoundly misunderstood by some Congressmen , and inferentially by their constituencies . A restatement may therefore serve a useful purpose : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinate , clerical , or purely ministerial offices of the government is based upon the following self-evident propositions : that offices are created to fulfill certain necessary functions involved in the routine of government , and not to give some men a place ; that offices are supported by non-partisan 1 Mr. Cummings , Proceedings of the House of Representatives , December 19 , 1888. taxation ; that taxation is an evil , and therefore it is essential that the public service shall be as efficient and economical as possible ; that offices are public and not private property , awd administration is a trust , not an ownership ; that in a republic something less arbitrary than favoritism shall govern appointment and removal ; ' that men shall be appointed solely on the ground of merit , and not in payment of personal debt ; that an examination is the fairest means of ascertaining the qualifications of an appointee , because it insures that a clerk shall know how to write , a bookkeeper how to keep books , and a gauger how to gauge ; that such examination shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the members of any one political party ; that a class system is opposed to the spirit of our institutions , and therefore offices should not be the vested property of ward-workers and political henchmen , to the total and absolute exclusion of the great body of the common people ; that an office-holder is a citizen of the United States , and is entitled to all the rights and privileges attaching to such citizenship ; that neither the President nor any other executive officer has the right to proscribe such office-holder , remove him from place , or threaten his subsistence on account of his politics ; that such a brutal procedure is un-American ; that tenure of office should not be dependent upon the degradation of manhood and the prostitution of political opinion ; that the practice of the President and his cabinet in changing two hundred thousand office-holders at will , for causes unconnected with good administration , is dangerous and despotic , and should be restrained ; that under the present system these office-holders constitute a great standing army of paid servitors , ever ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public will , and are a menace to good government ; that political assessments , if paid unwillingly , are an extortion // and a direct theft from the office-holder , and , if paid willingly , are generally a brokerage commission for appointment , or a bribe to the appointing power for continuance in place ; that if salaries are so large that assessments can be endured without inconvenience , such salaries should be cut down to a saving of the people 's money ; that promises of appointment to office made , whether definitely or indefinitely , work a corruption of public opinion ; that the enormous bribe of two hundred thousand offices , offered as a reward for party work , tends to obscure the real issues of politics , encourages the sacrifice of principle to selfish personal gain , and induces a laxity of political morals ; that a " clean sweep " of the offices demoralizes the public service , and is the direct and indirect source of great financial loss ; that skill in the manipulation of a caucus and in the packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of official duties ; that the Constitution of the United States contemplates the election of a Congressman as a legislator , and not as a patronage-monger ; that such patronage is a burden to every honest , conscientious , and able Congressman , compels the neglect of his proper duties , creates petty factional disputes and wrangles among his constituents , and often defeats the reaction of a trustworthy servant of honorable record ; that the statesman is thus rapidly becoming an extinct species , being succeeded by the politician , and the consequent loss inflicted on the people through crude and unwise legislation is incalculable ; that the fear of losing the spoils of office is paralyzing the legislative branch of the government , makes cowards of political parties , and is the enemy of progress ; that the retention of the vast patronage of two hundred thousand offices is becoming of more concern than the triumph of principle ; that the mania for place-hunting is increasing ; that the clamor of spoilsmen compels the creation of sinecures , thereby increasing the taxes ; and finally , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplication of offices , and will ultimately , unless checked by a comprehensive and decisive enactment , undermine and overthrow the institutions of our country . Such is an imperfect outline of the doctrine of civil service reform and of the abuses it is designed to remedy . By this showing , is it not the spoils system which is " undemocratic , " and which " favors certain voters of this country at the expense of other voters " ? What , to repeat , can be less democratic , less American , than persecution for opinion 's sake ? Yet this is the very essence of the spoils system , its guiding spirit and its crowning infamy . If this assertion need further explication , it may be found in a recital of what takes place in this country when one party succeeds another in the control of the government . The newly elected President goes ( by deputy ) through all the departments , and may be supposed to interview each clerk in a conversation of which the following is typical. : - President . Whom did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not concern you . I am an American citizen , and have the right to vote for whomsoever I please , without being subjected afterwards to a governmental inquisition by you or any other man . President . I asked the question in conformity with a time-honored practice , and shall insist upon an answer . Clerk . Very well ; I will answer the question , not because of your menaces , but because I do not hold my political opinions covertly . I voted for your opponent . President . Then you must vacate this office . Clerk . If you ' can show that I have not performed my duties properly , or // that I have neglected them for politics or for any other reason , I am willing to go . President . I have not looked into that ; it is immaterial , any way . I want your place for some one else . Clerk . For one of your partisan " workers , " perhaps , whose qualifications you have also not looked into ? President . Possibly . Clerk . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are merely a trustee ; these offices do not belong to you . President . You are the victim of an illusion . These offices do belong to me . They are my personal patronage and plunder , to do with whatsoever I will . If you refuse to resign , I will remove you . Clerk . Very well ; I will yield the place as I would my purse to a highwayman who puts a pistol to my head . Nevertheless , I denounce your action as an outrage upon my rights as an American citizen . If this conversation does not often take place actually as reported , its substance is at least tacitly understood . Generally the clerk stifles his protest and resigns , quietly submitting to a system that is an heritage of barbarism . Proscription of minor office-holders on account of political opinion is as completely indefensible as proscription on account of religious belief . It has no proper place in the United States . It is an anachronism , and belongs to the age of the crusades against the Catholics and the Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon which , unfortunately , there is no tariff . We broke with England and with her monarchical institutions a century ago , and set up a government of our own , - a democratic government . It supplies our needs , and stands as an example to mankind . Ser vile imitation of foreign polities is unworthy of our pride of race or nation . " Anglophobia is in the American blood . A common law , language , literature , and religion do not of necessit* constitute the ties of sentiment . Although the American people are the heirs of all the ages , they do not like to be reminded of their obligations , nor to acknowledge an ancestry . They will not claim kinship even with Shakespeare . To them their history knows no perspective ; in the discovery of a new and virgin world was the beginning of things . England is the traditional enemy , and all the pretty speeches made over London dinner-tables do not alter this fact in the least . This prejudice seems to be enduring , and any appeal made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present case , the retort is complete . The spoils system , with the stamp of feudalism upon it , was imported into this country from England , where it had obtained in the modern form for one hundred and forty years . It pervaded all departments of the English state , the army , the navy , and the church , as well as the civil service , attaining a growth which it has never known here . Offices were openly bought and sold , the purchaser acquiring a proprietary interest therein . There , as here , patronage was the active coefficient of corrupt elections . Rotten boroughs were exposed for sale in the market , and members of Parliament were bribed to the support of the Crown by sinecures , pensions , and money . At the time our government was founded , the spoils system was flourishing luxuriantly in England , and George III . found it a most serviceable instrument in enforcing his policy of persecution against the thirteen colonies . It is a pity that those gentlemen who claim the spoils system as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrasses their argument . Per contra , the merit system is a democratic institution , and // Some Popular O4jections its practical application to our civil service was coeval with the beginning of our government . That England should have been before us in embodying it in the form of law proves nothing more than the immense progress which has been made in that country toward popular institutions . Iv- " The executive power of Great Britain is hereditary , and changes only at the death of the monarch . The administration , however , changes at will , and may change every week . Therefore , the idea of life tenure for executive officers is consistent with an executive for life . Therefore , an official class of lifelong tenure is consistent with monarchical and aristocratic government , which is peculiarly a government of classes . But it is not consistent with a democratic government and a short - lived executive where no class is recognized by law and all men are equal . " 1 It happens , unfortunately for the consistency of this argument , that in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration is the executive . The executive powers of the Crown are obsolete , having passed to the prime minister and his cabinet . But these officials " change at will ; " they " may change every week . " Consequently , tenure on good behavior - miscalled life tenure - is consistent with democratic g , overnment and a shortlived executive . If civil service reform is not adapted to the United States , where the President holds for four years , a fortiori , it is not adapted to England , where the tenure of the premier - the real executive - is the shortest and most precarious imaginable . Indeed , what we call civil service reform is the very life of parliamentary government . If , with every change of the ministry , a 1 Senator Vance , Cong . Rec. , vol. xvii . Part III . p. 2949. to Civil Service Reform . April , " clean sweep " of the offices should be made , the English civil service would soon be in a state of anarchy . Under such a system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery of the government , and would be a perpetual threat against the existence of the empire itself , - a thing of course not to be tolerated . The situation in England was logically reducible to this : either the spoils system must be abolished , or some one party must be continued in power indefinitely , which would mean the destruction of popular government . There could be no hesitation in choosing . The new democracy achieved a victory over feudalistic privilege that was complete and final . Even apart from any political principle , the reform has vindicated itself . When the administrative departments ceased to be asylums for decayed gentry , and were thrown open to public competition , there was an improvement in the morale and efficiency of the service . Reorganization upon the basis of the merit system was extended even to India , where the duties of officials are of a most delicate and complicated character , involving , as they do , tactful relations with and control over two hundred millions of aliens . But it has come to pass that civil service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is opposed in the United States as representing exactly the opposite tendencies . " Aristocracy , " " bureaucracy , " and " insolence of office " are expressions as familiar as they are misleading . They deserve a brief consideration . Aristocracy means the permanent exaltation of a few individual names . It implies great social dignity and distinction , and generally is based upon an hereditary succession of title and land . An aristocracy of department clerks and mail-carriers is an absurdity . However worthy such persons may be , they will // have no more social distinction than clerks in business houses , whose tenure is the same as theirs . They possess neither title nor wealth , and are condemned to a routine of labor . The effect of service in a great government machine is to sink individuality , not to exalt it . The tens of thousands of school-teachers who are in the pay of every State do not constitute an aristocracy . In fact , they are rarely in the public view , and this for the reason that they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been applied to our public schools . If , however , it were the practice to dismiss all the Republican school-teachers whenever a Democratic governor was elected , and vice versa , we should , without doubt , be feelingly assured that any other tenure would seriously imperil our institutions . Bureaucracy is another chimera . It can not exist where the heads of administration are constantly changing , where admission to the civil service is open to all , and where the removal of the unfit servant is expeditious and easy . Insolence of office is an a priori argument . It has been pertinently said , in answer to it , that , at the time tenure on good behavior was superseded by Crawford 's four-year law and by Jackson 's regime , it was never urged by the innovators as a reason for the change that the manners of office-holders were contemptuous and overbearing . The objection is an after-thought . Of the insolence of bureaucracy and of the arrogance of aristocracy the American people have had no experience under any official tenure , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the liberties of a people only when it seeks to perpetuate itself by interfering with elections . Inasmuch as this purpose ( to override the public will and to create a bureaucracy ) is the very vice of the American spoils system speculation as to what may be , under civil service reform , can be profitably postponed to an observation of what is . The countless minor offices of the United States are filled by a distinct class known as " professional p&amp;*iticians . " These men live by politics , * receiving place as reward for political work . Their control of public office is monopolistic . Mr. Bryce estimates their number at two hundred thousand , but this is probably an underestimate . They constitute a guild , although they are not organized under formal articles of association . With them office-getting ( or keeping in office ) is an industry , and the fees and emoluments are accepted as payment for partisan services rather than for the exercise of official functions . The influence which the officeholders wield is altogether out of proportion to their numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over all other classes , - they are unified and organized . They make the management of primaries and conventions the serious business of their lives , and acquire a skill and experience in wire-pulling " which ordinary citizens can not hope to cope with . The politics of the country is in the hands of these men . The people elect , but can not nominate , being reduced to a choice of candidates selected by the politicians of opposing parties . These politicians dictate nominations , high and low , and afterwards foreclose a lien upon public place which they claim to have earned . All others , those who can not show a certificate of this character , are excluded . The spoils system has been compared with a fairly conducted lottery , in which every one has an equal chance . But the analogy is loose . In all lotteries the prizes are limited to ticket-holders , and in the American political lottery the ticket-holders are few . The farmer , the shopkeeper , and the laborer generally have not the remotest chance of preferment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less technical or questionable . Of course the number who can offer such credentials is comparatively small . To begin with , all the members of the defeated political party ( who , under our electoral system , constitute , as often as not , more than one half of the people ) are rigidly debarred . Secondly , only that small contingent of the dominant party who have been of practical use to the candidates in convention and elsewhere , and who possess the advantage of a personal acquaintance with one or more of them , receive any consideration whatever . The idea , therefore , that the offices are in the hands of the people is the shallowest of delusions . They are sold to the few for a price which the many are unwilling and are unable to pay . It is needless to say that , in this barter and sale of public place , the proper transaction of government business is lost sight of . Competency does not appoint an applicant , and can not save an incumbent . Other motives of a mercenary or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shameless and conspicuous fact , as the newspapers and the congressional debates daily attest ; It is the great object of civil service reform to restore these offices to the people , and to overthrow the bastard aristocracy who have despoiled them . Those good citizens who are apprehensive of government by " official caste " need not strain their eyes to the future . They should look about them . V. " The political disqualification of office-holders is an invasion of their rights as American citizens . " Civil service reform , as embodied in the Pendleton Act of 1883 , does not deny to an office - holder any rights which properly belong to him as a citizen of the United States ; on the contrary , it restores to him those rights of which he has been deprived . It protects him against partisan discrimination by the appointing power ; it protects his salary from assessment by his official superiors ; it protects him against removal for refusing to reijiler any political service . It restores to him the right to think for himself , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espionage of the informer . In this wise the law protects him . But civil service reform , in its gross and scope , within the statute and without , looks to the protection of the people also . There are certain things which a citizen as a place-holder may not do . He may not use his official influence to coerce the political actions of his neighbor , to wit : he may not neglect the duties of his office to do a henchman 's work ; he may not pack primaries , manipulate conventions , collect and disburse election funds , corrupt the ballot-box , or tamper with the returns . Some of these things are forbidden by the federal and state criminal law ; others not . But whether or not , any and all of them are grave breaches of his duty , both as a citizen and as an officeholder . Yet these are the things which , in varying kind and degree , many officials notoriously are doing . Is it necessary to characterize such partisan activity as a monstrous evil in a country where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to justify the executive orders which have been issued to suppress it ? In England , more than a century ago , the interference of office-holders in elections assumed such proportions that the whole body of subordinates in the executive department were forbidden by law to vote for members of Parliament . In 1868 , after the introduction of the merit system , this law was repealed , as being an unnecessary restriction . If a man procures an appointment on his deserts , and not through political influence , the obligations of appointee to patron do not exist , and the temptation to indulge in corrupt election practices disappears . The American doctrine of the relation // of the office-holder to the body politic was set forth ( albeit little to the immediate purpose ) by President Cleveland in an executive order issued July 14 , 1886 . In it he said - " Individual interest and activity in political affairs are by no means condemned . Office-holders are neither disfranchised nor forbidden the exercise of political privileges , but their privileges are not enlarged , nor is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A just discrimination in this regard between the things a citizen may properly do and the purposes for which a public office should not be used is easy , in the light of a correct appreciation of the relation between the people and those entrusted with official place , and the consideration of the necessity , under our form of government , of political action free from official coercion . " VI . " Is a competitive examination the best or any test for official competency or efficiency ? May not a man be eminently competent for official preferment , and not at all competent for a competitive examination ? " 1 The system of competitive examination may not be perfectly adapted to ascertaining the comparative fitness of candidates for place ; but it is the best that has been suggested , and it is infinitely better than a system in which fitness is not considered at all . It accomplishes , within the sphere to which it has been limited , the chief object of civil *service reform , namely , the removal of the ministerial offices from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficiency and to decrease the cost of the civil service , - an important though secondary consideration . There are some kinds of officers 1 Senator Call , Cong . Rec. , vol. xiv . Part I. p. 498. who can not well be chosen by competition : the fourth-class postmasters , for instance , who live in sparsely settled districts , and who may be appointed by one of several feasible plans that rave been suggested , and the higher grade of officers , such as chiefs of bureaus , whose competency would be better assured if they obtained their positions by promotion , based upon worth , fidelity , and long experience . As to the intermediate offices , the system of competitive examination works satisfactorily . The official duties are clearly defined , and it is an easy matter to test the qualifications of applicants . If it be urged that business men do not select their employees by this method , it may be replied that they always make searching verbal inquiries into the capacity of applicants , and that , in some instances , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted . In fact , competition , in some form , is the unwritten law of the commercial world , it being a needful guarantee of the best service . It is , of course , possible that a man may be " eminently competent for official preferment , and riot at all competent for a competitive examination ; " but the chances are greatly against it , if the examination be " practical , " as the law says it shall be . The civil service commission have performed their duty in this matter judiciously . That part of the examination which is intended to test the general fitness of applicants will not greatly tax the mental resources of any one possessing a common school education , unless expert services are required . The standard set is low rather than high . Sir G. 0 . Trevelyan says that the opening of the English civil and military services to competition , in its influence upon national education , was equivalent to a hundred thousand scholarships and exhibitions of the most valuable kind . Whatever may be the influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // people , there can not be two opinions as to the effect of that system upon the national character . It is needless to point out that a public contest of merit , into which any one may enter without fear or solicitation , induces high endeavor , and conserves manhood . On the other hand , it is equally patent that where offices go by favor thrift follows fawning . Women seeking an honest career are reduced to importuning , mayhap subjected to insult ; young men are transformed into mendicants and sycophants ; and the position of all applicants does not differ materially from that of the Elizabethan courtier , whose ignominy Spenser , in travail of spirit , has described so vividly - " Full little knowest thou , that hast not tride , What hell it is in suing long to bide : To loose good days , that might be better spent ; To waste long nights in pensive discontent ; To speed to-day , to be put back to-morrow ; To feed on hope , to pine with feare and sor-row ; To fret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy heart through comfortlesse dis-paires ; To fawne , to crouche , to wait , to ride , to ronne , T@@189084400.txt TRIAL BY JURY OF THINGS SUPERNATURAL . THE law can deal with the supernatural - with such questions as the existence of God or the devil - in any way that it chooses . Two ways have been adopted . One is that of assuming their truth and reality , and then legislating upon that basis , in such a way as leaves open no question of fact about them ; directing certain conduct , forbidding certain other conduct . The volume of our oldest Anglo-Saxon laws begins with an assumption of the existence of God . It is providing a penalty for stealing , and opens thus : " The property of God and of the Church twelvefold . " This is the first sentence in the long annals of our recorded English legislation , now reaching back for nearly thirteen hundred years . The existence of God has always been assumed in English law ; and so the English Commonwealth punished capitally a denial that God exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his omnipresence , of the Trinity , of certain things about Christ , of the resurrection of the dead , etc . It is laid down by high authority in England to - day , although this is controverted , that it is punishable as blasphemy at common law to deny the truth of Christianity or the existence of God . In the opinion of Mr. Justice Stephen , it is , in point of strict law , criminal blasphemy in England to sell , or even lend , a copy of Strauss 's Life of Jesus , or Renan 's work of the same name , or certain works of Comte . Whatever may be the exact truth about that , yet in England always , and for the most part here , the plan has been pursued of asserting and sustaining by law the truth of certain opinions about the supernatural . Even now the phrase is familiar that " Christianity is part of the common law . " This is , indeed , a highly figurative expression , very likely to be misunderstood , the import of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said that the " almanac is part of the common law . " It is true in a sense , but by no means in a literal sense . Now , under any such laws as these which I have just referred to , or under our own laws against blasphemy , which rather deal with a certain objectionable method of handling given opinions than with the sober and decent denial of them , there is no chance left for any legal discussion as to the reality or truth , in point of fact , of these things ; that is , of the existence of God , the nature of Christ , and the like . But there is another way . Formerly , legislators did sometimes leave open a question of fact as to the existence and the operation of supernatural influence . When they tried people for witchcraft , it was a question , not indeed whether . there were a devil and evil spirits able to communicate with men and to operate among them , for the truth of this was // assumed , but whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been operating in league with the accused persons and in a certain way . That is a sort of question which our system of law has not and never had any suitable machinery for determining ; and so in recent times we do not take this course . But suppose we did , how should we deal with the question ? Precisely as they formerly dealt with it , precisely as we now deal with any other question of fact , - by calling witnesses , by expert testimony , and by a jury , or , it may be , a judge ; and this was the same machinery that our ancestors used in the witchcraft cases . When R.uskin was brought into court , some years ago , for libeling Whistler , the artist , by some highly flavored remarks about his pictures and his capacity , the artistic merit of these works was submitted to the decision of a jury : the pictures were hung up before them , and artists like Burne Jones and Rossetti were called in as expert witnesses to aid the jury by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , when the sculptor Belt brought a like inquiry before a London jury , who sat upon the question of his capacity to do work of any artistic worth , examined his busts , with a collection of which the court-room was furnished , and had to hear , digest , and pass judgment upon the expert opinions of the leading artists of England . The Londoners laughed at all this , and were reminded , they said , of the fable , - how the beasts of the field quarreled as to which should be greatest among them , and called in a passing crow to settle the question . They spoke also in jest of a judge who once proposed to end the everlasting controversy over fate and free will by making up what the lawyers call a " special case , " and arguing it out in bane . It was , to be sure , a sorry sight . The tribunal was not fit for the task , but it was the best that the law could furnish . And now , if the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be submitted to our courts for decision , it would be before just such a tribunal , either a jury or a judge , and upon just such *oofs that it would have to be determined . Legally speaking , the fundamental facts about religious truth as manifested upon any given occasion might be settled one way to-day and another way to-morrow , according as different juries should find . It is not impossible that we may yet see something of this sort done about Spiritualism ; that is to say , may see the question passed upon whether it is or is not true . But so far , in modern times , such things do not come up in this way . When Spiritualists get into court nowadays , it is on the charge of defrauding people and using undue influence , as in the case of Home in England , twenty years ago , who was compelled to return several hundred thousand dollars ' worth of property to a woman of seventyfive , a Mrs. Lyon , who had given it to him on the faith of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere question of undue influence , of the abuse of a relation of confidence . And so of the case of a Mrs. Fletcher , who , a few years ago , was found guilty , in London , of obtaining property by false pretenses and conspiracy . She has written a book about it , and insists that her spiritual communications were genuine , and so the pretenses were not false ; and that the court wrongly rejected an offer on her part to prove them true , and so condemned her wrongly . But it appeared to the tribunal like a pretty vulgar case of fraud . The court left to the jury fairly the question of her own belief in the manifestations , which was the main thing . In like manner , the Posses in Boston , not long ago , were arrested for defrauding ; and in England , a few years since , a Spiritualist was convicted , under an old statute , , as being a " rogue and vagabond " for using - these means to defraud. // But the indictment of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pretending " to exercise divers kinds of witchcraft , sorcery , enchantment , and conjuration . " That was under an existing statute in England , - a law that " every one who pretends to exercise . . . any kind of witchcraft , sorcery , enchantment , or conjuration . . . commits a misdemeanor , " and must , upon conviction , be imprisoned for a year , etc . This calls for no result , such as defrauding ; it is merely a pretending to exercise . That law was enacted in 1736 , at the same time that the former law of 1603 , which had been passed to please King James when he came to the throne , was repealed . The former law had made it a capital crime , without benefit of clergy , to " use , practice , or exercise any witchcraft , enchantment , charm , or sorcery , whereby any one shall be killed , ... pained or lamed in his body ; " and also " to consult , covenant with , entertain , employ , fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for any intent or purpose . " This law hardly supports Selden 's well-known remark about it : " The law ag*iinst witches does not prove there be any , but it punishes the malice of those people who use such means to take away men 's lives ; if one should profess that by turning his hat thrice and crying buz he could take away a man 's life , though in truth he could do no such thing , yet this were a just law made by the state that whosoever should turn his hat thrice and cry buz , with the intention to take away a man 's life , should be put to death . " The law does not , to be sure , prove that there be any witches , but certainly it assumes the reality and possibility of witchcraft and of comnierce with evil spirits . In the trial , then , of cases arising under this law , it became a mere question of fact whether in reality a particular person did practice witchThis case is found in the State Trials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jury of Things Supernatural . 467 craft and deal with spirits , or not . But the law of 1736 , which is the existing law , deals only with pretending to exercise , etc . An English judge , of our own day has raised the question*whether it would be a good defense , under the present law , to prove that the accused not only pretended to practice witchcraft , but actually did it . I suppose that it would not . But if it would , then we might see the question of the truth of witchcraft submitted to a jury to-day , as Mrs. Fletcher tried to leave the question of the reality of her communication with spirits . There was a period of nearly two hundred years during which such allegations had to be passed upon by courts of justice in England , in administering the ordinary laws of the land ; and especially during the period of one hundred and thirty years after the act of King James . In Scotland , also , they did it , and , as we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully two famous trials of this sort in the seventeenth century , one in England and one in Scotland , with a view , especially , to mark the way in which legal machinery worked , in performing so singular a task as that of passing on the truth and reality of witchcraft . I pass by the New England cases , because they are but poor illustrations of anything that can be called legal . There was , I believe , no lawyer engaged in the trial of the Salem witches , either on the bench or at the bar . I. The first of the cases I refer to was the famous one of the so-called " Suffolk Witches , " tried before Sir Matthew Hale at Bury St. Edmonds , in 1664 , for bewitching seven children . ' This case has a special interest because it was one of the authorities relied upon by the court that condemned so many unhappy persons at Salem , twenty-eight years afterwards . " They cpnsulted , " says Cotton in his History of the Criminal Law , i. 378 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mather ( Upham 's History of Witchcraft , ii . 361 ) , " the precedents of former times , and the precepts of learned writers about witchcraft , as Keble on the Coinmon Law , . .. also Sir Matthew Hale 's Trial of Witchcs , printed , Anno , 1682 . " The testimony included statements by the relatives of the children as to their remarkable behavior , which they themselves had seen ; of certain experiments upon three of the children who were in court ; and of the expert testimony of a person styled in the report " Dr. Brown of Norwich , a person of great knowledge . " This was no other than Sir Thomas Browne , then sixty years old , and a physician of much distinction . This expert was by no means uncommitted on the subject of witchcraft . " For my part , " he had said twenty years before , in the IReligio Medici , a book already famous and in its seventh edition , " I have ever believed and do now know that there are witches . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but spirits ; and are , obliquely and upon consequence , a sort , not of infidels , but atheists . " And in another treatise , published only two years later than the Religio Medici , in dealing with Satan as " the great promoter of false opinions , " he said , in that manner of his which carries pleasure to the marrow of a reader 's bones : " Lastly , to lead us further into darkness and quite to lose us in this maze of error , he would make men believe there is no such creature as himself , . . . wherein , besides that he annihilates the blessed angels and spirits in the rank of his creation , he begets a security of himself , and a careless eye unto the last remunerations . . . . And to this effect he maketh . men believe that apparitions and such as confirm his existence are either deceptions of sight or melancholy depravements of fancy . Thus he endeavors to propagate the unbelief of witches , whose concession infers his coexistency ; by this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggereth the immortality of the soul , " etc . We are not told in the report how it came about that " Dr. Brown " was in the court-room , whether casually or because he was summoned as a witness ; but being there , and having heard the evidence and seen the three children in court , he was asked by Sir Matthew Hale to give his opinion ; and , as we read in the report , " he was clearly of opinion that the persons were bewitched , " and said " that in Denmark there had been lately a great discovery of witches who used the very same way of afflicting persons , by conveying pins into them , and crooked , as these pins were , with needles and nails . And his opinion was , that the devil in such cases did work upon the bodies of men and women upon a natural foundation , ( that is ) to stir up and excite such huinours Snperabounding in their bodies to a great excess , whereby he did in an extraordinary manner afflict them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as particularly appeared in these children ; for he conceived that these swooning fits were natural , and nothing else but what they call the mother , but only heightened to a great excess by the subtilty of the devil , cot*perating with the malice of those which we term witches , at whose instance he doth these villanies . " This is the testimony of an " expert witness , " and it could not but have had a great effect . For although it was as true then as it is now that the opinions of an expert are not binding upon the jury , are only so much advice and instruction for them , educating them for their task of forming an independent opinion of their own ( as in the case of Whistler v. Ruskin ) , yet such opinions , in matters where the jury know so little and the expert knows so much , are often likely to be acted upon as if they were authoritative . It is highly probable that this opinion was so taken . A few // caref uliy put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions of his statement . How , for instance , did he know what had taken place in Denmark ? Personally , lie probably knew nothing about it , for the accounts of his life do not indicate that he had ever traveled there . And so , in a degree , as regards all the witnesses ; for it must be remembered that , at that time , on a trial for a capital offense , as this of witchcraft was , the accused person was allowed no counsel to assist him in trying his case . What did these old women , frightened out of their wits , know about cross - examination ? At that time , it may be added , their witnesses could not be sworn . Strange as it may seem , it was not for a generation yet that these privileges were allowed in England at any capital trial ; and it was far later than that before it was allowed in all of them . It is probable that many thousands of accused persons were unjustly hanged in England , while this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a moderately skillful cross-examination of the government witnesses . In other respects , what was the nature of the legal machinery which was to be applied to the solution of the strange and difficult questions that were brought up in these proceedings for witchcraft ? They were to be settled by the verdict of a jury , - instructed by evidence , to be sure , and advised by the court , but having at that time ( unlike the present ) the legal right to find a verdict on their own information and knowledge only , although they had not publicly stated this in court so that it might be sifted , and although it was contradicted by all the evidence in the case . While the jury had this great and unmanageable power , their verdict was practically uncontrollable : he whom they acquitted was finally acquitted , and he whom they found guilty was guilty once for all , saving only the judges ' power of delaying execution and the king 's pardoning power . Points of law might be taken , but there was then no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal case for an in finding the fact . The judges were then in the latter days of an experiment at fining and punishing jurors for acquitting improperly , but that soon got its deathblow , and the modern practice of granting new trials was just beginning . Who and what were the jury ? A body of plain , every-day men , having some little qualification of property , and challengeable for a few of the plainer disqualifications for fair dealing , as , for example , that they were in the employment of either party , - a good representation , no doubt , of the average fairly well-to-do citizen , filled full of all the ordinary prejudices , presuppositions , ignorance , superstition , of the times . The jury , as Sir Henry Maine has said , is but " a relic of the ancient popular justice , . . . the old adjudicating democracy , limited , modified , and improved in accordance with the principles suggested by the experience of centuries . " We can get a side-light on the jury of that period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this time , from Roger North 's life of his brother Francis , the Lord - Keeper Guilford . Francis North became chief justice of the Common Pleas in 1675 , while Sir Matthew Hale was yet sitting as chief justice of the King 's Bench . He was a good lawyer and a man of the world . " Sharp and shrewd , " says one of his biographers ( Lord Campbell , Lives of the Chancellors , iv . 333 ) , " but of no imagination , of no depth , of no grasp of intellect , - any more than generosity of sentiment . " But he did have a certain hard sense that kept him free from the delusions that affected that much greater but over-religious man , Sir Matthew Hale . Roger North , in the affectionate and most readable life of his brother to which I have referred , and which Tal // fourd has called " one of the most delightful books in the world , " says that his brother was extremely " scrutinous , " as he calls it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when they were capital cases ; " but never more puzzled , " he goes on , " than when a popular cry was at the heels of a business ; for then he had his jury to deal with , and if he did not tread upon eggs they would conclude sinistrously , and be apt to find against his opinion . And for this reason he dreaded tbe trying of a witch . It is seldom that a poor old wretch is brought to trial upon that account but there is , *t the heels of her , a popular rage that does little less than demand her to be put to death ; and if a judge is so clear and open as to declare against that impious , vulgar opinion that the devil himself has power to torment and kill innocent children , or that he is pleased to divert himself with the good people 's cheese , butter , pigs , and geese , and the like errors of the ignorant and foolish rabble , the countrymen ( the triers ) cry , this judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and so , to show they have some , hang the poor wretches . All which tendency to mistake requires a very prudent and moderate carriage in a judge , whereby to convince rather by detecting of the fraud than by denying authoritatively such power to be given to old women . " Francis North had been made the more thoughtful upon this subject on account of the conviction of two old women before one of his colleagues upon trivial evidence , reinforced by their confessions . " This judge , " says Roger North , " left the point upon the evidence fairly ( as they call it ) to the jury , but he made no nice distinctions , as how possible it was for old women in a sort of melancholy madness , by often thinking in pain and want of spirits , to contract an opinion of themselves that was false ; and that this confession ought not to be taken against themselves , without a plain evidence that it was rational and sensible , no more than that of a lunatic or distracted person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had *To try an old man for bewitching a girl of thirteen . The girl had shown the usual symptoms of strange fits when the man came near her , and of spitting out pins . But these pins , unlike the common case , were straight , and his lordship , we are told , " wondered at the straight pins , which could not be so well couched in the mouth as crooked ones ; for such only used to be spit out by the people bewitched . He examined the witnesses very tenderly and carefully , and so as none could collect what his opinion was ; for he was fearful of the jurymen 's precipitancy , if he gave them any offence . " The old man defended himself well ( without counsel , of course ) , and called his witnesses , who could not ( as I have said ) be sworn . " After this was done , " goes on the biographer , " the judge was not satisfied to direct the jury before the imposture was fully declared , but studied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then another , questions as he thought proper . At length he turned to the justice of the peace that committed the man and took the first examinations , and , Sir , ' said he , pray will you ingenuously declare your thoughts , if you have any , touching these straight pins which the girl spit ? for you saw her in her fit . ' Then , My lord , ' said he , I did not know that I might concern myself in the evidence , having taken the examination and committed the man . But since your lordship demands it , I must needs say I think the girl , doubling herself in her fit , as being convulsed , bent her head down close to her stomacher , and with her mouth took pins out of the edge of that , and then , righting herself a little , *pit them into some bystander 's hands . ' This , " adds th' biographer , " cast an universal satisfaction upon the minds of // the whole audience , and the man was acquitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave them no such quiet exhibition of his anxiety and his doubts ; he took a very different method , and one which is exactly indicated by Roger North 's slurring expression as to his brother 's colleague , Raymond , - " whose passive behavior , " as lie said , " should let those poor women die , " - namely , " he left the point . . . fairly ( as they call it ) to the jury . " Hale had done just this , and in a manner which indicated his own unwillingness to interfere with the natural movements of the jurors ' minds , whose tendencies on such a question , of course , he must well have known . " He would not , " he said , in charging the jury , " repeat the evidence to them , lest he should vary it one side or the other . They had two things to ask : Were the children bewitched ? Were the prisoners guilty of it ? That there were such creatures as witches he made no doubt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including England , showed that . And he desired them strictly to observe this evidence , and the great God of heaven to direct their hearts in this weighty thing . For to condemn the innocent and to let the guilty go free were both an abomination to the Lord . " Thereupon the jury went out , and in half an hour found the women guilty on thirteen charges . This was on Thursday afternoon , March 13 , 1664-5 . Now what was this evidence which Chief Baron Hale was content to leave to the jury with so little remark , and with no criticism whatever ? Our source of information for this is an account printed certainly as early as 1682 , and perhaps , as there is some reason for thinking , in Hale 's own lifetime , - an account prepared with care by one who was present at the trial . It bears plain marks of an effort to vindicate the justice of the proceeding . There were , as I said , seven children supposed to be bewitched : of these , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one actually testified in court ; three were reported as sick , and the other three who came to court *ire conveniently bewitched at this time and made dumb . But these three did go through many manifestations before the court , which must have strongly impressed any jury of plain men whose minds were preoccupied with a belief in witchcraft . One of the children was a girl of eleven , who lay on a table in the court-room , on her back , as one in a deep sleep , unable to move any part of her body , except ( a common symptom in witch cases ) that her stomach , " by the drawing of her breath , would arise to a great height . " Then she recovered herself and sat up , but could neither see nor speak , though able to understand what was said to her ; and then " she laid her head on the bar of the court with a cushion under it . " The judge directed one of the alleged witches to come near and touch the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , without so much as seeing her , for her eyes were closed all the while , suddenly leaped up and catched Amy Duny the old woman by the head and afterwards by the face , and with her nails scratched her till the blood came , and would by no means leave her till she was taken from her ; *and afterwards the child would still be pressing towards her and making signs of anger conceived against her . " Another girl of eighteen " fell into her fits " on being brought into court , and was carried out ; in half an hour she recovered , and came back and was sworn , but as she undertook to testify " she fell into her fits , shrieking out in a miserable manner , crying , burn her , burn her , which were all the words she could speak . " Repeated experiments were made in court of the touching of tho children , while appearing to be insensible , by the old ' women , and of their starting up into activity . Now , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who objected that there was here a great fallacy in this experiment , " for the children might be shamming . Whereupon the judge ( who was always fair ) had an experiment tried that well-nigh upset the whole business . Three persons of consideration , including Serjeant Keeling , were desired by the court to attend one of the children , in the further part of the hall , while she was in one of her fits , and then send for one of the old women . This was done . The girl 's apron was put over her eyes , and a person who was not one of the witches touched the girl 's hand , which produced the same effect as the touch of the old women themselves . " Whereupon , " goes on the report , " the gentlemen returned , openly protesting that they did believe the whole transaction of this business was a mere imposture . This put the court and all persons into a stand . " But at length Mr. Pacy , the father of the eleven-year-old girl , made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , namely , he " did declare that possibly the maid might be deceived by a suspicion that the witch touched her when she did not ; " and the reporter , with an amusing credulity , says this was afterwards found to be true , so that " by the opinions of some this experiment ( which others would have a fallacy ) was rather a confirmation that the parties were really bewitched than otherwise . " One readily guesses that these dramatic incidents must have told strongly on the feelings of any plain and ordinarily kind-hearted jury . Some of the 1As regards this experiment with the toad , it is singular how the human fancy holds on to such conceptions . A near relative of mine , who lived in Andover eighty years ago , has told me that she went to school there , as a very young child , to an old woman who was generally believed to be a witch . On a neighboring farm , one day , the churning did n't work right , and the failure of the butter to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The butter-makers resorted children were probably in a state of real hysteria ; and the scene was heightened by all the fear and sorrow which their distressed mothers and relatives felt in telling these things , and is telling how one child had been already killed by these torments , and others were now languishing at home , at the point of death , from the same cause . The other testimony , which a lawyer of the present day reads with amazeinent , was calculated to have much effect on the jury . It was , in substance , this : As to two of the children , their mother gave an account of a quarrel which she herself had had with one of the old women some years before . The woman had had the reputation of being a witch for several years . As soon as this quarrel came , the witness 's little nursing boy was very sick for several weeks . She consulted a doctor who was reckoned good at helping bewitched children , and was advised by him to hang up the child 's blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down at night to burn anything that she found in it . She did hang it up , and at night found in the blanket a great toad , which she caused to be held in the fire with the tongs ; then followed ( as the reader will anticipate ) " a great and horrible noise , " " a flashing in the fire like gunpowder , " " a noise like the discharge of a pistol , and thereupon the toad was no more seen nor heard . " The child recovered , but the old woman ( the witch ) was found , on the next day , to be herself terribly burned , and she charged this on the witness , and threatened her.1 About two years later , the witto the usual way of exorcising the evil influence by heating the spit and thrusting it redhot into the cream . It turned out that the old woman at once appeared with a burned hand ; and this was widely received as conclusive evidence that she was a witch . This was in the nineteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lynn , who was known to my friend , I was told that she . did not discourage this opinion , for it was worth something to her in the gainful occupation of fortune-telling. // ness s daughter , ten years old , was taken in much the same . way , and in her fits charged this old woman with afflicting her , and soon died ; and , moreover , the witness herself became lame , and ever since , for more than three years , had gone on crutches . As to two more of the children , eleven and nine years old , their father testified to a quarrel with one of the old women ; and that the younger daughter immediately fell into fits , had the pricking of pins in her stomach , and shrieked out like a whelp , and continued in this condition nearly a fortnight , charging the old woman with afflicting her . He caused the woman to be put in the stocks , whereupon the other daughter fell sick in the same way . Their aunt testified that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had at first no faith in the stories , and thought that the children were deceiving ; but they went on to throw up crooked pins and sometimes nails , although she took care that no pins were used in their clothes ; and a large quantity of these pins , and also nails from the same quarter , were produced to the jury . The doctor who attended one of the children testified to his inability to account for the cause of their disorder . Similar stories were told of the other children . And finally , by way of confirming the idea that all this sort of thing was traceable to the old women , a man testified to his wagon having once struck and injured the house of one of the women , whereupon the cart was afterwards upset , and also stuck unaccountably in a gate , and the like . Another man , having touched her house with his axle , had four horses die soon afterwards , and also cattle and pigs ; and himself grew lame in his legs and was troubled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old women , afterwards lost all her geese and had a new chimney fall , and also lost a firkin of fish which her brother had sent her from the " northern seas ; " as to the firkin , the unfortunate mariners who were to have delivered it to her told her " they could not keep it in the boat from falling into the sea , and they thought it was gone to the devfl , for they never saw the like before . " An examination of the persons of the alleged witches was also had by some women appointed by the court , and they reported certain appearances which were in those days considered marks of a witch . This , with the expert testimony of Sir Thomas Browne , was , so far as we can tell , all of the evidence . Think of Sir Matthew Hale leaving all that rubbish to the jury ! What is even worse , think of his doing it with nothing to mark any just appreciation of its character ! That Hale himself really believed the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he sentenced the women at once , on the next morning . He might have delayed , and have respited them ; that was very common with the English judges when there was any doubt . But here the conviction came in the afternoon ; and Hale , after having the three children and their parents at his lodgings the next morning , where he found , as the reporter tells us , that within half an hour after the conviction the children had all recovered , that they had slept well , that they now spoke perfectly and were in good health , proceeded forthwith to the final step . He must also have learned that morning of the alleged circumstance that the mother , who had been for more than three years on crutches , and had testified on them in court , was , upon the jury 's verdict , " restored to the use of her limbs , " and went for the first time without her crutches . Hale had two of the children come into court and confirm all that had been testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter , " not much contradicting them . " . And then " the judge and all the court , being fully satisfied with the verdict , gave judgment against the witches that // they should be hanged . " They were urged to confess , but would not ; and in three days they were executed . II . I pass at once to the Scotch case . This case is remarkable for preserving the principal arguments of the prosecuting counsel , both to the court and jury ; so that we may see just what the line of reasoning was by which a tribunal might be persuaded of these things . It brings strongly to light the way in which the security afforded by legal forms and solemnities for the accurate investigation of facts may wholly break down when the men who are to do the judging have their minds saturated with certain sorts of opinion . We should be very foolish if we supposed that we are wholly rid of this sort of difficulty at the present day . It is familiar to us in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own time is the outconic of the electoral commission for determining who had been chosen President in 1876 . On a set of questions which divided the commission , as they divided the*country , sharply on political lines , we tried to make the commission judges . Most of its members , no doubt , approached the questions with a patriotic purpose to be perfectly impartial , perfectly judicial . They listened to arguments on both sides , and deliberated and gave their opinions ; and they were divided , eight to seven , - precisely on party lines ; and this not merely on one or two of the questions , but on every question of importance . In the journal of the commission one may read thirtyfour divisions of eight to seven , almost every one that is recorded . Some persons blamed them . But whom would you blame ? I believe it is common for those who lost to blame all of those on the opposite side , as having been partisans . But of course it must not be overlooked that the minority showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human creature , do what he will , can not rid his mind of preconcep tions ; and I suppose that we ought to thank God that it is so , that we can not make ourselves into mere thinking machines . At any rate , so the fact is ; these judicial treasures we have in earthen vessels . The Scotch case came on thirty years or more after the trial of the Suffolk Witches , near Glasgow . It arose in 1696 , a few years after our Salem trials . It derives a certain interest from the fact that the bewitched person , a girl of eleven , Christian Shaw , afterwards , with her mother , began at Paisley that manufacture of thread which has since made the place famous the world over . Her father was the Laird of Bargarran , in Renfrewshire , a little way out of Paisley . Christian had caught a servant , Katherine Campbell , stealing some milk on a Monday in August , and received a vigorous cursing for it ; thrice the servant wished that the devil might " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , Agnes Naesmith , an old widow and a reputed witch , was in the laird 's courtyard ; the girl , Christian Shaw , gave her a saucy answer to some question , and the old woman appears to have shown resentment . On the next evening , Saturday , strange manifestations began with Christian Shaw , which continued for months . She flew over her bed , lay insensible for days , stood bent like a bow upon her feet and neck at once , " fell a-crying " that Katherine Campbell and Agnes Naesmith were hurting her , etc . She was taken to Glasgow to see a distinguished physician , Dr. Brisbane . Here her health grew better . She had an intermission of nearly a fortnight . She went home again , and her symptoms came back worse than ever ; her head was pulled down towards her breast , and her tongue violently thrown out and squeezed between her teeth , especially when she undertook to pray . They took her back to Dr. Brisbane at Glasgow ; and now , even on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // spitting out of hairs , curled and knotted , of coal cinders as big as chestuuts and almost too hot to handle , straw , pins , small bones , pieces of wood , feathers , gravel-stones , candle-grease , and eggshells . She was visited by great numbers of people in Glasgow , and by many of distinction . She sat up in bed , unable to see or hear , and called for a Bible and a candle , and preached to the invisible Katherine Campbell for two hours . And now she began to accuse others , and to see the devil himself . The clergy took it up ; she became the object of constant observation and labor with the credulous Presbytery of Paisley . She saw a good many witches , and was much beset by them and by the devil , particularly when any religious exercise was on . " Usually , " we are told in the naive story of all this , printed within a year or so , in 1698 , " when ministers began to pray she made great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and roaring ; and when she recovered she laid this off on the hellish crew about her . " Now people would hear sounds as of strokes , and she complained that various people were striking and tormenting her , and urging her to kill her young sister . She went on to name more people , and was tormented when they touched her , among them an old Highlander who had come along and asked a night 's lodging ; his touch tormented her , and he was arrested . The next day , a clergyman tried the experiment of covering her with his cloak , and bringing her in and letting the Highlander touch her . He did so , and she was at once tormented . Then she begged the Highlander to let her tell their secrets , upon which , says the simple narrative , " the old fellow looking at her with an angry countenance , " her mouth was stopped and her teeth set . Early in February , 1696-7 , came a meeting of a commission of distinguished persons appointed by the Privy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole case . Christian Shaw accused various persons , and was touched by them in public and duly tormented . Then canine confessions . One person charged by Christian was a beggar , described as " an ignorant , irreligious fellow who had always been of evil fame ; " another was his daughter of seventeen , who , after being , as the narrative says , " seriously importuned and dealt with by two gentlemen , " confessed and implicated her father and the old Highlander . A boy under twelve was arrested , and although at first he vigorously denied any guilt , he confessed and implicated his brother , aged fourteen , - now in jail at Glasgow , and about to be transported for something else . This boy also , at first , wholly Aenied the business , " yet , " says the narrative , " at length , through the endeavors of Mr. Patrick Simpson , a neighbor minister , ingeniously confessed his guilt . " On February 11 there was a public fast , and Christian was present in church all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work . That evening she had a sharp attack ; " and when the fit was over , " we read that she had to hear another discourse . " Mr. Simpson , going about family worship , did expound Psalm cx. , and speaking of the limited power of the adversaries of our Lord Jesus Christ , from the latter part of verse 1 , she wasp on a sudden seized with another grevious sic fit , in which she put out of her mouth some blood , which raised grounds of fear and jealousy in the minds of spectators that something in her mouth , hurting her , had been the occasion of it ; yet they could not get her mouth opened , though they used means to open the same , her teeth being close set . And in the interval of the fit , she being asked if she found anything in her mouth that had been the occasion of her putting out of blood , she replied she found nothing , nor knew the cause thereof ; but opening // her mouth , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but knew not what became of the tooth ; for though search was made for the same , it could not be found . After which , " we are told , " the minister proceeded with his discourse , but was again interrupted by her renewed fits , yet closed the exercise with prayer , after which , without more trouble , she was taken to her bed . " She went on in this way accusing more people , a midwife and others , up to a certain Sunday morning near the end of March , when it all stopped . It appears to have been about this time that the final report was made by the commissioners to the Privy Council of the doings of the witches . In eight days a new commission was appointed , " not merely to examine , but now actually to try the accused persons , and sentence the guilty to be burned or otherwise executed to death , as the commissioners should incline . " The commission met , heard a sermon by Mr. Hutchinson on the stimulating text , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and in a day or two adjourned for a month . Three confessions had been heretofore obtained , and it was desired that the clergy should try in this interval to get more of them . This seems to have been regarded as very important ; and they succeeded in getting two more on the morning that the commission met . It is strange that neither of these two " confessants " appears to have been put on trial . Twenty-four persons had been accused . Seven of them were tried before a jury , and all convicted . After conviction one confessed , and committed suicide in prison the same night . The other six , including Katherine Campbell and Agnes Naesmith , and at least two of the earlier " confessants , " were burned at Paisley on June 10 , 1697 . Now , although I have been drawn into this long narrative , my chief concern is with the arguments and the trial . We have no full report ; it appears , however , that they had the testimony of Dr. Brisbane , the Glasgow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored and in her right*mind , of the five surviving " confessants , " and of many others . The accused had an advocate , and in this they were more fortunate than a witch tried in England would have been at that time . Observe , then , that this Scotch case is very different from that of the Suffolk Witches , in that the person bewitched testified here , and that five of the alleged witches also testified . In this way there was brought into the case a body of what was called " spectral evidence , " which Sir Matthew Hale did not have to deal with . All of the " confessants " testified that they had personally seen the devil in one or another shape , and had been carried through the air in " flights ; " they had met with the devil and companies of witches , being all invisible , and had appeared to Christian Shaw while unseen to everybody else , and put pins and hair , cinders , and the like into her mouth , and had , while invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders . The testimony of the expert , Dr. Brisbane , was of course important . It was much cooler than that of Sir Thomas Browne in the case of the . Suffolk Witches . He adhered , at the trial , to a deposition which he had previously given , in which he had said that he found Christian Shaw , on her first coming , " brisk , " " florid in color , " " cheerful , " and " every way apparently healthful , " and that he saw nothing in what took place during her first visit to him - the convulsive motions and groans and talk against Campbell . and Naesmith - which was not " reducible to the freaks of hypochondriac melancholy ; " and at that time he treated her accordingly , with advantage . But what he could not explain was what happened afterwards . // He was often with her , he said , and " observed her narrowly , so that he was confident she had no visible correspondent to supply hair , straw , coal cinders , hay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw her put out of her mouth without being wet ; nay , rather as if artificially dried , and hotter than the natural warmth of her body . Were it not for the hays straw , etc. , he should not despair to reduce the other symptoms to their proper classes in the catalogue of human diseases . " At the trial , referring to these previous statements , the doctor declared that in his opinion these things " did not proceed from natural causes arising from the patient 's body . " Now as regards this testimony by Dr. Brisbane , one observes no statement at all that he had at any time had the girl searched . There is also no statement , like Sir Thomas Browne 's , that he himself believed in witchcraft or thought these strange occurrences traceable to that ; and none that he absolved the girl from cheating . It is , as we have it , only a guarded declaration that these things are not imputable , in his opinion , to any bodily disease . If this was all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so , - we can hardly excuse Dr. Brisbane from the charge of a cunning or cowardly unwillingness to intimate his whole mind ; one can easily guess how a more frank expression as regards imposture on the part of the Laird of Bargarran 's daughter , and as touching the folly and credulity of the Presbytery of Paisley , and generally of the learned and fashionable world of Glasgow and of all Scotland , might have affected the prosperity of a famous and successful physician ; but it was the part of a scholar and of a man , at such a time , to say what he thought . If be had done it , it looks very much as if he might have saved the lives of seven 1 We can not be quite sure ; but one suspects Dr. Brisbane grievously . This deposition and subsequent evidence are given at pages 129 , poor wretches who afterwards died for this , and might have checked the horrid superstition that had many a victim yet . In reality , this canny statement of the expert ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ) , 1 " that in his opinion the things mentioned in his attestation did not proceed from natural causes arising from the patient 's body , " was pressed upon the jury as saying that it came from no natural causes at all . These things , said the government 's advocate to the jury , were " deponed by Dr. Brisbane , in his opinion , not to proceed from a natural cause . " He did not say that ; he said something very different indeed from that , and yet something that might easily be taken for it . But not yet , as regards this Scotch case , am I speaking of what seems to me its most interesting feature , the illustration it furnishes of the use of legal machinery in ascertaining questions of fact touching the supernatural . This is found in the two arguments for the government to which I have referred , - one to the court , the other to the jury . There is something very ghastly in the application which they furnish of the formal precision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural science to a consideration of all this wretched compound of imposture and superstitious misconception which was laid before the jury . There came first a long argument to the court , on the question of receiving the " spectral evidence ; " that is , the testimony of the five " confessants " and of Christian Shaw to the supernatural sights and sounds and communications which they had had , - all of which was ultimately received and submitted to the jury . The line of argument was this : You have here , the counsel said to the court , a case , where the witchcraft is sufficiently // proved , and also the fact that these accused persons are the witches ; and the question is of admitting in such a case , necessarily involving , as it does , the existence and present exercise of supernatural influences , the testimony of six persons testifying to their own seeing and hearing of certain things , - things which are in their nature objects of sense . The crime of witchcraft is an occult and secret one ; witches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a part of the witches ' purchase from the devil that they can not be seen at some occasions ; so that the abominations committed then would remain unpunished if such witnesses were not admitted . " When these witnesses testify to going and coming from meetings , especially on foot ; falling down and worshiping the devil , then under a corporeal shape ( and he had such a shape when he tempted our Saviour ) ; the murdering of children by a cord and napkin ; the tormenting of others by pins , etc. , they speak of plain objects of sense and are to be believed . It is said to be dangerous to allow this , since Satan may have represented others by false shapes . But here other facts point the same way , and , besides , experience and the opinion of the wisest divines , lawyers , philosophers , physicians , statesmen , judges , and historians , at home and abroad , are that the apparitions of witches are commonly real , and we must go by what is generally true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport people in hurricanes , as in the case of Job , protecting their faces so that they are not choked with the rush of air , than it is to form the curious miniature of fictitious transactions on their brain . It is both a greater crime and pleasure to act in truth , and the devils and witches do so in fact ( unless the place be far . distant or the party indisposed ) , and this is supported by the writers and witches of all nations and ages . The extraordinary nature of these things is not to diminish the certainty of these proofs , for in law , as in nature , reality and not simulation is to be presumed . Our Saviour 's miracles were the subject of the testimony*of witnesses , his transfiguration , walking on the waters , standing in the midst of the disciples while the doors were shut , and " arguing assurance by their senses that a spirit had not flesh and bones . " And if it still be said that it is not conceivable how the girl or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides its being impossible that real bodies should enter at closed doors and windows and should not intercept the sight of what is behind them , the answer is : ( 1 ) that we are not to deny proved facts because philosophers have not certainly reached yet the invisible mannor of their existence , like the facts of nature that the loadstone draws iron and the compass turns always to the pole , and the facts of Scripture that an angel ( and the devil was an angel once , and retains as yet his old power ) smote the Sodoinites so that they could not see the door while they did see the house , and that Balaam 5 ass saw the angel when his master could not see him ; and ( 2 ) that where the fact , as here , is proved , it is enough for us to suggest a possible way in which it may come about ; such a way is this , namely : Satan is a personage whose knowledge and experience make him perfect in optics and limning , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and here I can not do justice to the passage without exact quotation ) " he may easily bewitch the eyes of others to whom he intends that his instruments should not be seen , in this manner as was formerly hinted , namely , he constricts the pores of the witches ' vehicle , which intercepts a part of the rays reflecting from her body ; he condenses the interjacent air with grosser meteors blown into it , or otherwise does violently agitate it , which drowns another part of the rays ; and lastly he obstructs the optic nerves with humors stirred towards them : all which // joined together may easily intercept the whole rays reflecting from their bodies , so as to make no impression upon the common sense ; and yet , at th' same time , by the refraction of the rays gliding along at the fitted sides of the volatile couch , wherein Satan transports them , and thereby meeting and coming to the eye , as if there were nothing interjacent , the wall or chair behind the same bodies may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight in a cup becomes visible how soon the medium is altered by pouring in some water on it . Several of your number do know that the girl declared that she saw and heard the door and windows open at the witches ' entry , when , no doubt , the devil had precondensed a soft postage on the eyes and ears of others to whom that was unperceived . So Apolonius escaped Domitian 's flight , and Giges became invisible by his magical ring . John of Sarisberrie tells us of a witch that could make anything not to be seen ; and Mejerus relates another that had the like power . Some Italian witches of greater than ordinary wit confessed to Grilandus the devil opening doors and windows for them , though the more ignorant witches by a fascination think themselves actors of this ; whence our lawyer concludes it ought not to be doubted by any reasQuable man what in all times and places is so incontestable fact . " There was much more in this singular argument , but surely enough has been quoted to mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal discussion may degenerate when it enters upon such questions as these . What the considerations were that prevailed with the court we do not know . But in fact , as I said , all this evidence was received ; some of it under a cum nota , that is a qualification that it must have corroboration , and the rest as that of persons not old enough to be sworn , and so to be taken with caution . The jury at the trial sat continuously for twenty-six hours . Such was the custom of that time even in England , - to go through a case without adjourning . One sees many examples of it in the State Trials . Twenty hours are taken up with the putting in of the evidence and incidental arguments ; and then came six hours for the final addresses and the final deliberation . The government advocate 's argument to the jury was brief . ( 1 . ) He drew their attention to the extraordinary nature of these occurrences , which on the one hand are true , as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strange , of a sort not explainable by the ordinary course of nature . He recited all that I have mentioned , and more : such as Christian Shaw 's talking once with her invisible tormentors , and asking them about their red sleeves , and then seizing these invisible people and pulling away two pieces of red cloth , unlike any in the house ; and again her glove being lifted from the floor by an invisible hand . It is , then ( so he argued ) , plainly to be concluded that there is witchcraft here . ( 2 . ) He enlarged upon a variety of circumstances tending to show that these accused persons were the witches : such as that all of them had " insensible marks " on their bodies , that is places which were not sensitive ; most of them had long been reputed to be witches ; none of them ever shed tears ; the touch of all of them set the girl into torments ; all were named by her , in her fits or out of them . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all nations recognize as the marks of a witch , and which are so many discoveries by Providence of a crime that would otherwise remain in the dark , all concur in these persons , and such a concurrence was never known to happen when they were incorrect . ( 3 . ) There are the positive depositions of the " confessants " to the actual sight of the devil and the witches at their work . As to these depositions // and Christian Shaw 's testimony , the " spectral evidence , " he drew attention to circumstances that confirmed the witnesses ; for example , their concurrence , and the fact that they accused their own relatives . Of one of them the advocate says , " She went on foot to the meeting of witches with her father , except only that the devil transported them over the water Clyde , which was easy to the prince of the air , who does far greater things by his hurricanes . " Such were these arguments , the feature which gives its peculiar interest to this Scotch case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they relied upon the same sort of thing that would be relied upon to-day , namely , the testimony under oath of persons speaking to what they say they have seen and heard , and the testimony of experts negativing ( for so this testimony was interpreted ) any known natural cause as competent to explain the facts thus proved . It is true that documents were laid before the jury that would not be received to-day , - for instance , a long narrative of events prepared by the Presbytery of Paisley ; but the purport of it was the same in kind as that of the testimony . The one radical difference between the trial as it was conducted then and as it would have been conducted later , while it was still possible to try for witchcraft ( that is , down to 1736 ) , lay in the different preconceptions , the different mental furniture and mental attitude , of the judge and jury at the trials . The " spirit of the age " appears in the things of which a tribunal will take judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable English judge , Chief Justice Holt , who came in at the English Revolution and sat till 1710 , tried eleven cases-of witchcraft , but there was never one conviction . As has been truly said , he went far to put an end to witchcraft trials by simply directing the prosecution , in 1702 , of one Richard Hathaway , who had declared himself bewitched , and had assaulted a woman as being the witch . At that trial Holt showed , as North had showed , what a shrewd and sensible judge might do and might always have done , even with all the danger from juries at that time : he himself questioned the witnesses narrowly and in a way to reveal imposture . For example , a witness had said that he saw Hathaway with his eyes open and yet unable to see . Holt . " And yet you say he was blind ; how could that be ? " Witness . - - - " I wagged the hair of his eyelids and put a candle to his eyes , and he took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that he did not see ? " Another witness , a woman , testified that she thought Hathaway bewitched . Holt . . . . " Did you ever see anybody bewitched ? " Witness . " Yes , I have been so myself . " Holt . " How do you know you were bewitched ? " The woman answered , among other things , that she " flew over the heads of them all . " Holt . " Woman , can you produce any of those women that saw you fly ? " Witness . " It was when I was a child . They are dead . " Hathaway pretended to have fasted a long time . One of the witnesses called by him was a doctor . When the counsel had done with him , Holt put him two questions . " Doctor , do you think it possible , in nature , for a man to fast a fortnight ? " Witness . " I think not , my lord . " Holt . " Can all the devils in hell help aman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my lord , I think not : and that made me to suspect him . " And then in charging the jury Holt put the question to them , not whether Hathaway was bewitched , but whether " he was under a delirium of his mind , and did fancy himself to be bewitched. " // Here we have a man whose mental outfit was of the modern style . This temper was not favorable to prosecutions for witchcraft . If it had been exhibited by Sir Matthew Hale or the Scotch judges , there would probably have been no convictions and certainly no executions .
