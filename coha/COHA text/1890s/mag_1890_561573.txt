txt THE approach of the first of October and the time when the law expires which has prevented all open discussion or writing on Socialistic subjects since 1878is causing some interesting discussion in Germany . Socialists begin to realize that they have a definite place in the politics of the empire , and that with the expiration of the law they will be able to proceed on a definite principle , publicly , in the Reichstag and among the people , with journalistic organs to express their views , and a strong party behind them . The events since 1878 have been a history that was predicted on all sides-a steady growth under the oppression ; a steady increase of membership when the penalty for belonging to such a sect was exile . Prince Bismarck , in his contest with the Ultramontane party , had joined himself with the Liberals and the laboring classes in the years preceding 1878 . He had encouraged the Social Democracy in many ways , and been their champion as far as his service to the Hohenzollerns would allow . He had even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Under this patronage , and with the general advance in ideas , the small sect grew to such magnitude that the Chancellor saw the necesssity of checking its growing influence . And it was in the midst of this that Germany was startled by the two attempts on the life of the old Emperor in the spring of 1878 . A cry at once arose from all quarters against the Socialists . It was in vain that Herr Bebel , the leader of the Social Democracy , stated at once that neither he nor his party had anything in common with Hddel or Nohiling . The almost successful attempts at regicide had been attributed to the Socialists , and the feeling against the party could not be changed . The chance was too good a one for Bismarck to miss , and almost immediately a bill was proposed in the Reichstag for the suppression of the Socialist movement . There were at the time 60,000 Socialists in Berlin , and about half a million in the empire . Their principles were being spread abroad by upwards of thirty five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reichstag six members , with Herr Bebel at their head , called themselves the representatives of the party . The first draft of the hill called forth not only the censure of the Liberals in Germany , but that of all the leading journals in England , France , and the United States . It proposed to suppress all . writing , reading , or lecturing on Socialist matters in the empire , and left the decision as to what " Socialist matters " were to the local authorities . The Liberals at once saw that much of their own writing might he suppressed under the act , and they separated from the Chancellor , At the third reading , however , a somewhat modified , hut still a stringent , law was passed on the 21st of October , to run three years , and on the next day the president of police in Berlin broke up four prominent organizations , and suppressed thirty-five periodicals and irregularly-issued pamI ) hlets . One of these , the Frejepresse , appeared again the next day under the name of the Tagespost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous treatment took place throughout the empire , and Socialism for the time was under cover , and " must now propagate itself , as slanders do , in whispers ; and , as usual , whispers will circulate more rapidly than any paper . " The history of the last twelve years has shown that this was a prophecy . The party was // 503 for the moment crushed . All those who had been of it for other reasons than a deep belief in the doctrines of Socialism fell away like leaves from the trees in autumn ; but the small nucleus grew stronger under oppression . The seats in the Reichstag remained about the same ; and time passed fill May 31 , 1881 . Then came a renewal under the same conditions , and the same thing was repeated in 1884 and 1887 . At the opening *f the session last October the government brought forward another bill to renew the old one as before . Again came the attempt to strike out the clause limiting it to a term of years . But the Kartet party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . During these years since 1881 the Social Democrats bad grown from something under half a million to over a million ; the six members in the Reichstag had increased to eleven ; not being able to publish pamphlets within the empire , publishing houses had been established in Zurich and Geneva and the papers circulated through Germany in a way that has been and still is astounding for its rapidity and efficacy . In fact , the few discoveries that have been made go far to show that a regular system for distributing pamphlets has been organized , which neither the local authorities nor the government have been able to bring to the light . So that with an increased standing and confidence , which these facts substantiate , the little party opened the session with a renewed opposition that succeeded eventually in carrying its point . The discussion continued through the short session , and with the division of the parties on the question of the permanency of the law the Socialists found frequent opportunity to gain the cur of the Chamber and to push forward their objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third rending the bill was lost , and in the last days of February the Socialists knew that on the first day of October they were going hack to the original status of 1878 , but with a party larger , stronger , and more systematized than they had supposed possible then . Preparations are now being made for the coming day , and the enormous meetings that have been held during the summer-one rising to the number of 7,000-have in the last month grown too strong for the authorities to check . The leaders have been laying down platforms to hold the party together in a consistent whole , and these comprise the principles as stated twelve years ago-public editcation , regulation of the hours of labor , selfgovernment , absolute freedom of the press , and the adjustment of the relations of labor and capital . Thus under the leadership of Bebel and Liebknecht , and in spite of some dissensions , they stand over a million strong , with thirty-six members in the Reichstag , and a better organization than any of the other parties . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William toward Socialism is one of the most remarkable of his many remarkable steps . He has distinctly recognized the party ; he has even invited one of them to drink beer with him at his castle ; and his speeches in regard to the movement have led him into a course from which there is no turning back . This , added to their own activity , has made the Socialists to-day a recognized party in German politics , with a definite policy before them . On the first of October  --  or the seventh , to be more exactmeetings are to he held in different districts to build up the party more strongly and arrangements seem to have been already made for the issue of party organs . The freedom will not be such as it is in America , but for the Germany of the last decade it is a great step toward absolute freedom of speech . The questions that will soon come before the country are How far is this to be allowed to go I and , Will the Socialist party run itself out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees fit to do , or will it grow stronger and gain an influential place in the Reichstag I-questions too difficult for any one to answer at present . The party has increased while under the vigorous law , not only in membership , but in moral strength . In these ten years labor troubles and the milder forms of Socialism have gained strength in Europe and America , until now half the writing in the more serious periodicals-whether daily , weekly , or monthly-is in connection with these subjects . These are the paramount questions of the last decade of the nineteenth century ; and , in spite of what may be said to the contrary , they are gaining strength in the minds of the people at large . // 504 In the midst of this the Emperor of the most " paternal " government in Europe - if we except Russia-is taking this huge , unformed subject into his own hands . He has ended the " blood-and-iron " rule ; he has said again and again that he " will make the man great who will aid him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , and will crush him who opposes him " ; and his government has found it wise to take off what restriction has been in the past put upon the discussion of the subject . There can be no doubt of the young Emperor 's earnestness ; and yet one of the greatest principles of the Social Democracy in Germany to-day is self-government . That is , a monarchy of the old style goes hand in hand with a party work ing for government by the people ! It is a peculiar situation , that must have some sort of settlement before many years have gone-that has no exit behind . Is it an attempt on the part of the imperial government to get control of the whole organization in order to regulate the movement by-and-by by seeming to favor it now ? or is it only to delay matters until a European crisis is tided over ? Time must answer . J. H. SEARS . " POLIcE OUTRAGES IN NEW YORK . THE police force of the city of New York has gained an enviable reputation for bravery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great emergencies , they have never failed to justify this reputation . At times there occur also individual proofs of devotion to duty in moments of great periL Perhaps it is all the more on this account that the exhibitions of cowsrdice and brutality which are too frequently made by individual members of the force shock the community so severely . Within the past six months several cases of extreme brutality and despicable cowardice have been brought to public attention , and in each instance the policeman has suffered no greater punishment than a trial on charges before the Police Board . Every one of these cases was a most heinous exhibition of cowardice , because the policeman in each instance relied upon his uniform , his shield , his club , and his personal influence with his superiors to protect him from the consequences of his brutality and cowardice - When an officer in uniform relies upon his badges of authority so that he feels safe in beating citizens or in wounding them with insulting language and brutal actions , such an officer is not only a coward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are accounted brave . A few cases illustrative of this unworthy conduct may be cited . A policeman in one of the uptown precincts was approached some weeks ago by a young woman who besought him to repair a great injury which he had done her . She came to him , not seeking a policeman to protect her , but a man to set right a wrong he had committed . He seized her violently and even used his club upon her arm , and then dragged her to a station-house and complained of her as one who had been guilty of disorderly conduct . The court discharged the woman , and charges were preferred against the policeman . A brief hearing was had , and that seems to have been the end of the case . Yet the honor of every citizen in this community was involved in these charges , and the Board of Police Commissioners should have left no stone unturned that they might discover whether it were possible that a woman pleading with a man to save her honor was liable to receive as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment on a charge of disorderly conduct . A policeman , spying two men in the early evening who were walking one of the streets and carrying a bundle between them , stopped them and seized the bundle , and when one of the men protested against the insolence of the officer 's manner , the policeman arrested both of them . They were committed to a cell for the night , dragged before a police court in the morning , and , after a brief examination and investigation , were shown beyond question to be honest men . They were discharged , and the officer was reprimanded by the court . These men were most cruelly outraged , and yet the officer who had done this has not even been called to account by the Police Board . // A passenger on one of the Staten Island ferry-boats was assaulted by a loafer . When the boat landed at the ferry slip the injured man called upon an officer to arrest his assailant . The man 's face was proof sufficient of the severity of the assault . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer to whom the injured man appealed first insulted the suffering man with brutal words , and then punched him in the back with his club . These witnesses , being indignant , expostalated with the officer , only to be insulted themselves . They went to a police station to complain of the officer , and a few moments later he himself appeared , dragging with him the poor fellow whose only crime was that he had appealed to the police for protection . The next day this unfortunate victim was discharged by the court , and the policeman was summoned before the commissioners , and that is all the punishment he has ever had . Some time ago a gentleman was entertaining two or three friends at his house , when a policeman suddenly appeared , seeking , he said , for a thief . The head of the house demanded the officer 's warrant , and as none was shown the policeman was instantly ordered out of the house . Instead of going , he went to the window , broke it open , and appealed to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way he secured aid enough to arrest the gentleman and his friends . They were locaed up and humiliated by being compelled to appear in a police court the next morning . The commissioners would not even entertain a complaint against the officer who made the arrest . An old gentleman , feeling giddy from a sudden attack of vertigo , appealed to an officer to get him a cab and send him to his home . He was a most reputable business man , and his appearance should have suggested that he was suffering from sudden illness . The officer , however , insulted him by declaring that he was drunk , dragged him with great violence to a police station , and left him in a cell . The next morning the invalid was found unconscious , and he died within a few hours . This officer was not even reprimanded . Two gentlemen walking on upper Broadway chanced to meet a friend whom they had not seen for a long time , and stopped to shake hands with him . A moment later an officer , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen violently along , saying : " Here , get a move on you . The gentlemen protested against this violence , when the officer raised his club and was about to arrest them . They were spared that ignominy , however , by the captain of the precinct , who had seen the whole occurrence . He said to the officer : " Go on your beat , sir ; I know these men , and it is impossible that they should have committed any disturbance . " The captain said that the officer was a good policeman in times of danger , but that he had no judgment . These examples are selected at random from a very long list of indignities . The records of the Police Commissioners show that within a few years hundreds of complaints have been made by reputable citizens , who have felt that their persons and self-respect have been most shamefully abused by policemen . So many of these cases appear that it is apparent that , in spite of some great excellences , the force must carry the odium of containing many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutality . What is the reason that such abuses are of frequent occurrence I Clearly because some fault exists in the system by which the policemen are governed . If there be such fault , it lies with the board which controls the force . This board has been nominally non-partisan for many years . When Thomas C. Acton was its president , nearly thirty years ago , he forbade , through a resolution adopted by the board , all persons connected with the department , from the commissioners down , from being members of any political club . Nominally this resolution was in force for some years . But the commissioners themselves were the first to break it through the oreation of personal organizations called by their names , which were said to be non-partisan , but which were not . The demoralization growing out of these organizations was very great . A man desiring to get upon the police force had only to become an active member of the organization and establish himself as a favorite with the commissioner who controlled it . Then , having secured appointment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a member of // the organization . In some districts a policeman 's influence with voters can be made very great , and that , of course , creates what in the colloquialism of the force is called a " pull " with the commissioners . It is the men who have " pulls " who are the most likely to be insolent , cowardly , and brutaL The fault , then , lies in the partisanship which controls the policemen , and which is all the more dangerous because the board is thought to be non-partisan . The remedy lies with the Police Board itself . There should be first an end put to any possible relations between the board and the members of the force except those of superior and subordinate . The board should then make every member of the force feel that any deviation from the right use of his power and responsibility is sure to be followed by swift and sufficient punishment . Next , any officer who has done that which justifies the infliction of severe punishment , such as suspension or dismissal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal tribunal , that he may be punished by the courts , as any other citizen would be , for misdemeanor . If the commissioners , having found a man guilty of misdemeanor , had the power not only to dismiss him , but to instruct the superintendent to make charges against him before a court of justice , that he might be punished penally , then some sufficient sense of restraint would be found to operate against the unlawful display of passion and malice by policemen . E. J. EDWARDS . II ' ARE WOMEN MANNERLESS I THE rapid generalizer is apt to rush to unsound conclusions . I think that a writer in the last number of THE REVIEW deduces his designation of women as " The Mannerless Sex " from a number of examples quite too limited . While recognizing the truth of much that he says as to the rudeness of women in public places . I attribute almost wholly to men the responsibility for such bad manners as he instances . If women are " pushing " in banks and post-offices and streetcars , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to prove this it is only necessary to mention the fact that it is exclusively American women that are under discussion ; against European women no such charges of rudeness are ever made . The question here arises whether American men can not learn some valuable lessons from their trans-Atlantic brethren . In no railroad car in Europe , and in no street-car or omnibus , do men ever get up to give their seats to women ; and the result is that every railroad company puts on cars enough to accomodate travellers , and then laws are passed providing that after all the seats are occupied no more passengers shall be admitted . So there are no standing passengers anywhere , and everybody who pays for a ride obtains a seat . It seems to me that this method is much better than ours . And our railroads can be compelled to put on rolling stock adequate to the demands of the travelling public only by a persistent and concurrent refusal of men to surrender their seats to women . Such a refusal would be plainly just . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a railroad car relinquish it to a woman any more than a man in the orchestra of a theatre should resign his $2 seat I Indeed , why should a man who has paid five cents for a street-car seat relinquish it to a woman merely because the company has sold her a seat for five cents and can not deliver the thing sold I And why should women accept such privileges as if a matter of right I No refined woman would accept a postage-stamp from a stranger without paying him for it ; why should she accept what has cost him more than twice as much I Plainly because men have set the fashion of surrendering their seats under the plea of gallantry . I might pause here to show that tho words " gallantry , " " politeness , " " courtesy , " etc. , are meant to apply only to acts of deference which involve no financial loss , and do not properly include the transfer of things which have been paid for ; but space will not permit such a digression . A surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women obviously ill would be bad enough ; but the American method has come to Include an indefinite extension of this habit which is pernicious in the extreme . If under the mercenary limitation of street-cars men continue to give seats to women who are ap // parently unable to stand , what shall be said in defence of the preposterous practice of yielding seats to young women ? Women are not responsible for it ; I have repeatedly seen them politely refuse to take the proffered seat , and have seen old men overcome their scruples by indecent importunity which no woman could resist without making a scene . The fashion which prevails in such cities as Washington , Baltimore , and Southern towns generally , commanding that no man shall sit while any woman is standing ,  --  without regard to the age of either partr ,  --  was born of the prurient egotism and vanity of men , and has no justification in either equity or courtesy . But foolish men have set the fashion , and if women are spoiled by it , the authors are responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth should a man remove his hat in an elevator-unless , indeed , it is a part of a hotel parlor ? The absurd habit prevails in Washington and Baltimore , and in provintial cities of the South and West ; but it has no existence in the older cities of the North , any more than it has among well-bred people in Paris , London , or Berlin . As to the alleged ( and conceded ) rudeness of women in business places ,  --  at post offices , at theatres , at banks . etc. ,  --  it may be said that it originated in the mistaken concessions of men , who did not pause to consider that the gratification of their own vanity was at the expense of others , involving the discomfort of the whole travelling and commercial race of man . It is not too late to correct it . W. A. CROFFUT . Iv . A55E55MENT LIFE INsURANcE . A ro*icv of life insurance is a contract agreeing to pay a certain sum upon the death of a specified person , provided death occur within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by aggregations of policy-holders called " companies , " and the guarantee of the sum assured rests upon the obligation of the mass of policy-holders to contribute for death-claims the equivalent of the aggregate amounts which the company is obligated to pay to the individual policyholders . In addition to this the policy-holders must pay the cost of transacting the business . These propositions are true of life insurance regardless of method , and unless there is equivalence between the risk assumed by the company and the liability assumed by the policy-holder , there can be no such thing as security . When one has to deal with the liquidation of the obligation of the individual to the company and the security for deferred payments from the former to the latter , difference of method is developed , and this , in common parlance , is dignified into difference in system , whereas in reality there is but one system , and that the system of life insurance . There have thus come to be recognized two " systems "  --  the " level-premium " and the assessment . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " company limits the liability of the policy-holder to a predetermined sum , the " assessment " company limits it only by his pro rafa of the actual claims . Each recognizes the standard mortality tables , but one uses them to determine in advance a maximum rate of premium for each age , * hue the other uses them as a standard for adjusting losses incurred among the policy'holders of different attained ages . The equation of liability in the case of the level-premium company is , therefore , between the presenE value of the amount of the insurance and the present value of the premiums which the policy-holder is obligated to pay , it being assumed , for the purpose of calculating these present values , that the deaths will occur in accordance wi*h a certain table of mortality and that invested funds will earn a certain rate of interest . As the payment of the sums insured depends wholly upon the realization of enough from the policy-holders to meet them as they fall due , and as the payments by the policy-holders are limited by contract , safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mortality and interest , less favorable than the future will show ; and as many of these contracts extend over a long term of years , allowance must be made for contingencies . Therefore one of two things is inevitable either the liability of the policy-holder to the company must be excessive , or the security less than absolute . // *OS The equation of liability in the case of the assessment company is between the cost which the risk will actually entail and the payment which the policy-holder must make , and is determinable as events develop and the payments are needed . This , however , does not imply that paym ents can be made by the policy-holder only as the money is needed for the liquidation of actual claims . On the contrary , there may be many variations in the method of making payments , provided the following essentials be kept in view : ( a ) That funds contributed for the payment of death-claims be held inviolate for that purpose . ( b ) That each policy-holder 's contribution to the current claims of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims and his attained age , whether that contribution be made by him by direct payment or partly by direct payment and partly by diminution of his interest in any reserved fund that the company may hold . ( c ) That each policy-holder receive the benefit of the payments actually made by him and the accretions thereon , and pay the cost or the entire benefits which he receives . Since the limit of each policy-holder 's liability in a given period is not a predetermined sum , the assesswent company may take cognizance of the fa&amp; that all men who insure do not die insured  --  a fact that the level-premium company can not take into account . In practice many assessment companies determine a payment which each policy-holder is to make at stated dates by discounting the sum assured by an assumed rate of interest and a table of the number that , from an initial number insured , will be living and insured at each succeeding age of life . This table is computed from the standard mortality tables , and from a table of discontinuances from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of other insurance companies . This last eloL*ent has a material effect in reducing the amount of the payment . A payment thus determined is not to be confounded with the level premium of the other plan . It is not a limit of liability and , consequently , of security , but a deposit with the company of a sum on account of future death-cost , which is always available for and sacred to the payment of claims . The different aspect which it must hold in the eyes of the law from that of the " reserve " accumulation of the level-premium company is an additional distinction between the two methods . As the liability of the policy-holder in the level-premium company is absolutely limited by contract , any payment that he may make over and above the current death-cost is a diminution of the present value of the future contributions which he can be called upon to make . The present value of these contributions is , at the outset , the equivalent of the present value of the insurance granted , and if only the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on , these two present values would advance by equal steps . Therefore when anything more than this current cost is paid , the result is that the present value of the policy-holder 's liability to the company is reduced below that of the company 's obligation to the policy-holder , and unless the company holds the difference in hand in invested assets , it is and must be insolvent . The amount of these overpayments , together with the accretions thereon . is , therefore , available only for the payment of the claim under the individual policy to which it belongs , and if the company uses it for other purposes , even though it be the payment of other death-claims , it is insolvent and its insurance-granting power is destroyed ; a receivership being the only alternative . It is because of this fact that failures have occurred in such numbers among companies operating on this plan . In the case of overpayments to the assessment company no such liability exists . The money is received as a trust deposit made for a specilic purpose  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its misuse renders the trustees criminally liable , but does not involve the destruction of the company 's insurance-granting power . Thus in the level-premium company the impairment of the reserve fund means the loss to the policy-holder of the future Insurance for which he has contracted . and this without returning to him the money that has been lost ; in the assessment company , his future insurance is still secure , on the payment by him of its // cost , so that the loss of the money is not supplemented by the loss of what may ho worth to him many times more . Two corollaries follow from the distinction noted between the two plans : ( a ) The cost of doing the business in an assessment company must be fixed by contract . This is the requirement of the law in all States that have legislated on the subject . Moneys that are collected for the purpose of paying death-claims must be held inviolate for that purpose , and though the policy that contributed them lapses and they are forfeited as a penalty , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were paid , and the persistent policy-holders must have the benefit of them in that direction . ( b ) Savings in death-losses , surrender-char ges on lapsed policies , gain in interest , and other profits in a level-premium company may be used for expenses or as the management determine . By the assumption on which the level premium is made up there is an excess over the requirements . The excess can be used for expenses . When the policy lapses , the liability under it is cancelled and the funds that were held to offset that liability are released , to be used as the management see fit . They are in no sense inviolate to the payment of claims or the benefit of the persistent policy-holders . A large portion of the resources of every active life-insurance company must consist of the obligations of the policy-holders for payments on account of future death-claims , and this must especially be the case with an assessment company , which proscutes its business without the accumulation of large sums of money . Upon the security of these resources rests the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under all plans , is the same-namely , such provision that the policy-holder who refuses to pay shall forfeit to the company more than the loss that he inflicts upon it . Theoretically , the lapse of a policy cancels an obligation to the company no greater than the obligation of the company to the policy-holder which is cancelled at the same time but practically the matter of lapse is wholly in the hands of the policy-holder , who has it in his power to say whether the company shall be required to continue the contract that it has entered into with him , while the company has no election in the matter . Common-sense points to what experience attests-that lapse will occur when it is to the advantage of the member that it should , and that when a lapse would he to the advantage of the company , the policy will be kept in force . The company must , therefore , as an offset to the privilege granted the policy-holder , exact of him , in event of his lapse , a penalty sufficient to protect the persistentpolicy-holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has always in hand the means of imposing this penalty , the security of that portion of the resourcee represented by the future payments of policy-holders is as secure under the one plan as under the other . This statement of the principles underlying assessment life insurance is confined to the merest outlines . The plan is one that deals with pure life insurance  --  the protection of the family or the dependent against the loss that would be caused by the death of the father , the husband , or the provider . It shapes itself to many modifications ; such . for instance , as creditor and partnership insurance . It furnishes , distinctively , insurance for the productive period of life , the period of the dependent family , the education of children , and the hazards of active business . It leaves the combination of insurance and investment , the seductive " tontine and endowment . to the other plan . That its chosen and appropriate field is broad beyond even the need of a great business , the record that it has made proves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has developed into a great business , recognized by the laws of almost every State as of equal legitimacy with its level-premium rival . it has formulated its methods , corrected its crudities , and to-day enrols in its list of policy-holders more than two and a half million citizens . During 1889 it paid over $42,000,000 in death-claims , swelling the total paid since organization , by the companies in active existence , to$300,000,000 . That it has become the recognized plan of life , as distinct from investment , insurance , is attested by the fact that it paid more in death-claims in each of the last two years than did the level-premium companies . Thirteen millions of people in this country are intere8ted. directly in its present and future , while the whole people // MO have a common interest in the lessons of thrift which it teaches . It is far from necessarily antagonistic to thelevel-premium plan . Its true rivalry is to accomplish better than that plan can the work of life insurance . There is abundant room for both . As compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the following propositions : ( a ) Equal or greater security , without resort to excessive charges . ( b ) Pure life insurance without the concomitant of vast accumulation , with the resultant dangers of poor investments and misuse of funds . ( c ) A limited , as against an unlimited , expense charge . ( d ) Funds paid for death-claim purposes held inviolate therefor . ( e ) Equal security for that portion of the resources of the c*'mpany which consists in the obligations of policy-holders to pay on account of future death-claims. ( f ) Reserve funds available at all times as a conservator of the insurancegranting power of the company , rather than as a menace to that function . ( g ) Equal accountability to the State for the proper conduct of affairs , and equal recognition under the law as life insurance . GEORGE D. ELDEIDGE . V. sALvATIONIsTs IN EETEFAT . IT IS now some ten or twelve years since the Salvation Army began operations in this country . The curiosity which at first followed the work has largely subsided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their exhortations , are no longer the object of ridicule or abuse . Public indifference seems to have overtaken these noisy , but in many instances earnest , people . The time is opportune , now that it is announced that a strenuous effort is to be made to excite renewed interest in the army 's doings , to inquire as to the actual results of its ten years ' campaign . How many converts can the army 's officers point to as the fruits of their labors How many outcasts have become respectable citizens , thanks to the army ? How many pastors of churches are willing to say that the army has done valuable work in a field not affected by the usual church machinery ? So far as I have been able to obtain answers to these questions , the results have been in inverse proportion to the noise made . I have found no pastor who says that he can count among his flock persons who might not have been there had the Salvation Army never existed . On the other hand , it will be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcast , male or female , who escapes from the bondage of vice , crime , or abject poverty , is apt to hide the past and everything connected with it . In 1883 , when my acquaintance with the Salvation Army began , there were sir " barracks , " as the meeting-places of the army were called , in New York city and as many in Brooklyn . The present meetings are in strong contrast with those of that day . One friend of the order told me recently that the army was dying of respectability . Mr. Ballington Booth , a son of the founder of the order , and the chief of the American forces , is a quiet man as compared to some of the former leaders ; there is less noise at the meetings , less laughter , less excitement , aol , perhaps in consequence , a diminished attendance . Between a present meeting of a corps of the Salvation Army and an old-time Methodist revival there is no marked difference , either in the character of the talk or in the expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the Methodists . Six or seven years ago it was another matter . For more than a year , when the army was beginning to work here , I f3llowed the doings of a corps which met in Christopher Street . I went there once or twice a month and found the meetings interesting . Invariably the place was crowded , and , under the direction of an Englishman named Inman , the meetings were certainly full of life and noise , if of nothing else . At eight o'clock every night the corps rushed up the narrow stairs of the little building , followed by the throng attracted by the parade through the streets which preceded every meeting . The band , consisting of a cornet , fife , and bass-drum , played while the crowd found seats . The women members of the corps kept time upon tambourines , which were also vigorously thumped during the singing . Around the hall were hung placards bearing quotations from Scripture , or words of warning such as " Beware of the Flames to Come , " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If You do not Repent To-Night , You will Probably Go to HelL " Upon wires running across the church from gallery to gallery were strung the trophies of the fight , such as gaudy ribbons , feathers , gewgaws. and even bonnets , which the women converts bad discarded as full of vanity . The bad boys in the galleries sometimes twitched these wires so that the array of trophies bobbed up and down in time with the music . Loud laughter was one of the features of the meetings . I remember that one night an announcement to the effect that a person known in army circles as " Salvation Johnny , " who played a cornet in the corps , had burst a blood-vessel on the previous evening and then lay in a precarious condition , was received with merriment . Such things are no longer tolerated in the meetings of to-day , so far as 1 could judge from one held recently in Jane Street . No remarkable or alarming mottoes are in view , and no string of trophies is to be seen . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women converts have follow , A a famous light , who , feeling that gay ribbons were dragging her down to hell , " took them off and gave them to her sister . " It was so quiet and decorous in the little hall into which 1 ventured upon seeing the sign " Salvation Army Meeting " upon a lamp at the door , that I could scarcely believe myself in a Salvation meeting . No wonder that worldly out siders found the proceedings dulL I was particularly struck with the sing-song style of the remarks made by the soldiers who were called upon to testify to the wonders that salvation had done for them . It sounded as if they were reciting pieces learned by rote and of which they were heartily tired . I find in The WarCry , the official organ of the order , which I bought at the door , so good a specimen of this testimony that I can not do better than quote it here . With the army 's usual fondness for alliteration , it is headed " Short Sermon by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " he was a well-known drunkard for nearly forty years . but now he beats a drum in the Salvation Army . " The sermon is as follows : " Dear Friends : It 's just the same old story-Jesus and His love . Thank God , the Book says Whosoever will may come . ' That means me and means you and every body el " e . If you want to be happy , be men and serve your proper master . Salvation pays , if it is only for this life . But I reckon it will be better still in the next . My workmates talk about me going back to the old style but no , that will never ha pp en while I trust Jesus to keep me . I tell them in spite of their jeers I 'm *ved.Iknow it and they know it too it 's a fact that they ca n't get over . Glory to God . I 've tried both sides . This is the best . God bless every body . Amen . " The women especially were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the captain of the meeting only rose to heights of earnestness when it came to the question of asking the audience to furnish money to go on with the work . Fully twenty minutes were given to pleading for pennies . An appeal for dollars was received with jeers . " Have you all lei*t your pocket-books at home I " he shouted . " Is there not a dollar bill left in this crowd I " A bill floated down from the gallery , and was caught by the captain . " It 's a counterfeit , " said a voice . The captain examined it closely before he shouted " Hallelujah ! " and went on with his begging . This mingling of business with religion is still as offensive a it used to be ; which is alsQ to be said of the frivolous manner in which ejaculations such as " Glory I " and " Hallelujah I " are shouted out on the slightest pretext . Young people will stop their personal gossip or quarrels to shout " Hallelujah 1 " without having the faintest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They shout because every one else shouts . So far as may be judged by a casual visit , the hymns now used at the army meetings are those in use from the beginning of the movement here . Most of them contain pictures of the woes awaiting the unrepentant . One begins as follows : " Oh , millions now in Hell are crying , All is lost ! Amid eternal flames they 're lying , All is lost I " Another of the same cheerful type : " Your sparkling eyes and blooming cheeks Must wither like the blasted rose ; The coffin , earth , and winding-sheet Will soon your active limbs enclose . " // 512 Of adaptations from well-known hymns there are a number , such as this parody upon Keble 's noble verse : " Hark ! Hark ! my soul , what warlike songs are swelling Through all tbe streets and on from door to door ; How grand the truths those burning strains are telling Of th at great war till sin shall be no more . Salvation Army , Army of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The pains of hell and the necessity of counteracting the devil 's wiles are harped upon ad nauseam , and this curious insistence upon the idea that the devil is wandering around , particularly among poor people , seeking whom he may devour , and that he is to be driven off chiefly by songs and shouting , the reckless use of sounding brass and tinkling cymbals , is still uppermost , apparently , in the theory upon which the leaders of the army work . My visit having convinced me that the days of the Salvation Army in New York were numbered , I took the trouble to ask an intelligent man who had once been an active officer of a corps , but has now abandoned the army , what , in his opinion , had brought about this singular falling-off . " The work , ' * said he , " is not a failure elsewhere . In some parts of the West and in Canada it is still fairly prosperous . Here in New York an attempt has been made to raise it to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergy ; and just so far as it has been made acceptable to conservative people it has failed to attract the rabble . Another thing which helps the army outside of New York is that in country towns there are few or no cheap shows . In New York people can go to the theatre for ten cents , and they prefer the theatre to the meetings of the army . Ten years ago there were no dime performances such as we now have all over the town . " In other words , the Salvation Army flourishes in places where its meetings are looked upon as circus performances to which no admission fee is charged . As might have been foreseen when the Salvation Army showed signs of disintegration , several other organizations , modelled upon the arn*y , have sprung up , officered by deserters from the original body . It is to be feared that these offshoots will be more extravagant in their doings than the Salvation Army . The few clergymen who are willing to say anything as to the moral effect upon the classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no backslider is so hard to help as one who has been a Salvation-Army light and has grown tired . If this may be said of the soldiers of the Salvation Army , it follows that the doings of the seceding bodies , such as the Salvation Crusaders , will be still more hurtfuL A clergyman to whom I suggested this possibility , remarked , however , that perhaps just in proportion to the extravagance ot the meetings and methods would be the loss of interest in the movement . It has taken ten years for the Salvation Army to run its course in this neighborhood : the Salvation Crusaders may exhaust public patience in half that time.
