ARTICLE VI. - MINISTERIAL TRAINING . THE training of men for the work of life is one of the most urgent practical problems of our time . There is increasing demand for trained men . What the world wants is skill . The synonym for work , in any best modern conception of the word , is skilled work , for it is not only the rational choice but the trained adaptation of intelligently selected means to the production of definite ends . No one will succeed well in his task , who is not fit to succeed , and no one is fit to succeed who is not trained to succeed . No strongest native aptitude will ever wholly supersede the drill of the school . It may be that " God does three-fourths of the work " in every most successful life and man does the rest . But if the one-fourth be undone the work of life is undone or ill done . A man of genius may invent his own methods but they must be rational or they are worthless . They must be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of the individual man alone , but of human nature itself , and with the methods that are normative for its development and that adjust men to the world in which they live . But most of the world 's work is done by men who have no dominating native aptitudes for their tasks . Upon the basis of only common gifts or a modicum of special gift , most men must be trained for and in their tasks , and in the hard , slow old way that has always been the fashion with this working world and was never a fashion more urgently demanded than to-day . We gather up our knowledge and experience of life 's ever increasing demands and embody them in our schools . The school is or should be the best exponent of the genius , the intelligence , and the enterprise of any given age . It is the best exponent of the modern democratic spirit , and the more closely it holds itself in relation with this broad and aggressive spirit , and the more thoroughly it represents its intelligent demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On all sides there is increasingly urgent call for better training schools . It is a // note of our advancing civilization . It is a token of its higher aspirations . Thus in common life and thus in the higher profes-. sions . The world is demanding a broader and closer professional training . The Philistinism of the professional empiric is thoroughly discredited among all men whose opinions are worthy of a moment 's consideration . And nowhere is the demand more urgent than in the ministerial profession . I say profession , for it is more than a divine , calling . Itisadivine calling unto a professional service . The disciple is called into the school of Christ , and here he is trained to be an apostle . The apostle is the trained disciple . The problem of ministerial training can be discussed only from the professional point of view . I do not venture upon the discussion of the old problem of ministerial training because there is any serious question as to the main elements of the problem . The battle for a trained ministry is fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight upon that hard won field . But there are always new questions or old ones in new form pushing themselves to the front . This is one of the problems that is never settled . No one ever has the last word upon it . It is a thoroughly practical problem . Our religion is a practical religion and claims allegiance largely upon the ground of its competency to meet the wants of men , wants that are as old as man , but as variant as the changes of time . The church is a fractical agency for adjusting and applying Christianity to the developing life of the world , and the Christian ministry is the most significent embodiment of that practical spirit that should ever dominate the true church of Christ . The needs of one age are not precisely those of another . Christianity wins its practical supremacy by adjusting itself to the needs of each age . Whether it gets itself lodged in the life of the world and unfolds itself in the changes of time or stands above the world and comes to it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust itself to the changing conditions of the world . This fact always keeps the problem of ministerial training before us . Moreover the genius of the churches which we represent and the somewhat free relation of these churches to our ministerial training schools , emphasizes its practical significance and im // portance . They are free moving and practically independent churches , committed to no stereotyped phase of i*eligious or ecclesiastical development , tied down to no inflexible methods of ecclesiastical procedure . They do not regard themselves as having come to the last anchorage ground where they must cast out all anchors and doggedly resist the current of time that sets them on . And there is a very free relation between these churches and their training schools . These schools have no distinctively ecclesiastical relations with the churches . They are not bound down to the churches by ecclesiastical shackles . They are free schools , established for the most part by the bounty of individual Christian men . They are not , thank God , held in servitude by any arbitrary human authority to changeless creeds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modestly claimed , a commanding position in the intellectual and spiritual leadership of the Christian churches . But it also lays upon them the greater burden of responsibility . With these schools and not directly with the authority of the churches rests the responsibility of adjusting this work to the demands of the age and the wants of the churches themselves . It is only indirectly by the power of a dominant intelligent Christian public opinion or by the influence of a broad-minded , well-trained ministry that the churches are to make themselves felt in their demands upon these schools . This keeps the question as a weighty and responsible question before us . The subject before us is a large one and we must fix a limit to the discussion . Let us hold to its main features . What then are some of the chief demands in the problem of ministerial training in our time ? 1 . And first I direct attention to the professional demand . I have said that the ministry is a profession . Of course it is more than that , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man or body of men can give , but God only . What God has put into a man through nature and grace ,  --  this constitutes his primal credentials . But the calling itself demands the training of the man and it admits of the very broadest training . The ultimate aim of ministerial service is in its broadest conception nothing less than the final purpose of the church itself for which the ministry stands , viz : the completion of God 's kingdom on earth . Whatever // is included within the broad scope of this final purpose is in some way directly or indirectly legitimate object of ministerial interest and activity , and to realize the largest and best results of that calling there is needed all that man as well as God can do for one , and all the best and the very utmost one can do for himself . We may not , as IRomanism does , set the church over against the world , as if there were a perpetual and irreconcilable conflict between them , and draw a hard and fast line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The church as such does not contain the final form of Gxl*s triumphant Kingdom nor monopolize all the agencies and forces that are pushing it on to its completion . There are forces at work in secular society itself that need to be utilized in the interest of the *ause which the church represents , and they can not be so utilized unless the minister 's training puts him in working relation with the world about him . No knowledge culture or training that is put into this broad service should ever be estimated as merely secular or as profane , and no largest interest which a minister may take iu the affairs of this world as related to the final purpose of the church , as well as of all human society and the goal of all human history , should ever be regarded as of itself inconsistent with the demands of his work . But the ministry is also a profession . It has its limitations and specialties like all other professions . Ministeriat training therefore must be professional . Its nature and demands as a profession must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly official functions , the legitimate objects and lines of its official endeavors , its professional points of view , its ethical and social codes , its normal methods of procedure . Upon the basis of ' general knowledge and culture one must shape and train himself for his professional specialties . Just what grounding a man should have for this professional superstructure , I shall not discuss . The broader the better . But upon that question no man may dogmatize . The chief thing is that one understand his profession and have the proper equipments for and in it . A minister should be trained in theology . Without this there is no thorough discharge of ministerial functions . Not // more urgent is the demand that a physician know his own science or a lawyer his than that a minister know theology . He may be ignorant of many things , must be and can afford to be , but to be totally ignorant of what lies at the basis of his profession , disqualifies him at the outset . It is a desirable thing to know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political and economic sciences , to be familiar with general literature . iNo profession , as a profession , demands for its highest efficiency so wide a range of knowledge and so much skill in its use . Our religion touches all domains of life . It is a universal interest . It is the religion of universal redemption , the religion of the redemptive kingdom of God . This profession therefore represents the interests of redeemed humanity , and all knowledge may be made tributary to the practical realization of that redemption . But whatever one 's general equipment of knowledge and skill , whether much or litde , theology he must know , and he must have some skill in its exposition and application . Without it he may do some good Christian work , but not professional work . The very word professional assumes that he professes some knowledge of the service and some skill in it . I grant that a man may be a very efficient minister and not a strong theologian . I am not pleading for the closest scientific training in theology as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor preacher and worse administrator and pastor . But I insist that in the broad and generous sense the minister must be a theologian . He is the leader of his church . This leadership is in the sphere of religion . But religion as represented by him professionally is something more than subjective , personal , spiritual experience . It emerges in the form of knowledge . Of course there is a valid distinction between religion and theology . But the notion that a minister can represent the domain of religion without touching the domain of theology is utterly absurd . Religion can never become an object of knowledge or the subject-matter of official or professional service without taking the form of theology in all or some of its branches . The demand for some measure of scientific knowledge of theology can not be evaded by undertaking to concentrate wholly upon what // is called Practical Theology . For practical theology itself is a branch of general theological science . To be trained in Practical Theology is in part to be trained in the knowledge of those principles that underlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Moreover this presupposes a knowledge of the subject-matter with which practical theory must deal . Practical Theology trains a man in the theory of his doing . But he must know the material which he uses in his doing . And that material is Christianity in some form of systematized knowledge . Every minister should know something about the different theological disciplines . In a word he needs a systematized knowledge of Christianity as related to its Biblical contents , to its historical development , to the content of rational thought and religious experience , and to its practical application by the church . No man has an adequate knowledge of Christianity unless he knows something of it in these four relations . Now it may seem a waste of time to discuss this . But the fact is that there is not only a good deal of loose theology abroad , but a profound distrust of all theology . Much of the criticism that is directed against the curriculum of the theological seminary comes from men-ministers too-who either as agnostics distrust all th.ological science , or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on scientific data and all philosophieal theology that undertakes to justify itself to human reason and to the profoundest convictions of Christian experience . Now since theology in its different branches is the proper subject matter and furnishes the proper sphere of ministerial training , it fixes the limits of the seminary curriculum . The seminary can not be a training school that deals with universal knowledge . It is utterly unreasonable to agitate for the introduction into the seminary curriculum of any of the branches of secular science . It is true that Christianity must adjust itself to modern thought and be applied to the interests of modern life . Enterprising men see this and insist that the seminary curriculum should recognize the demand . But to agitate for the introduction into the course of study of all the special branches of instruction that correspond to these interests is // thoroughly irrational . If every new interest of thought and life is to be represented in the seminary curriculum by a department of scientific instruction corresponding to it , the whole course would not only be hopelessly overloaded but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , all knowledge of its bearings , and all semblance of a proper ministerial training school . Such instruction would be a hopeless medley of shallow and fruitless pedagogics . All discussion of questions of public interest that touch upon the domain of the secular sciences must in the nature of the case be from the theological point of view . A minister must get his general training in the secular sciences outside the seminary course . He can not reasonably expect for example the establishment of a chair of philosophy in the theological seminary for his special advantage . The only philosophy he can expect to get here is the philosophy of religion or philosophy in its specific relation to theology . The only science he can reasonably expect here is science as related to religion . The only ethics , Christian ethics or ethics as a part of theology . The only discussion of social or political or economic questions to be expected here is a discussion of Christianity as related to some practical phases of those questions . Social and economic questions are agitating the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agitation . Ministers feel it , and those who are most enterprising and most sensitive to the influences and demands of their time feel it most strongly . They see that they must meet these questions in practical form in the parish . They feel the need of special knowledge and skill in order to meet them successfully . But it is to be borne in mind that it is not the function of the theological seminary to teach any branch of sociology . It can only discuss these questions from the Christian point of view . They are for it questions in Christian ethics , not in scientific sociology . Nor can the ethical teaching of the theological course limit itself to this particular branch of social ethics . It must cover a broader field . And it can only deal in broad general principles , not in minute details of procedure . The more a minister knows about philosophy and science and politics and sociology the better , if it do not encroach upon more distinctively professional studies // and if he makes a wise use of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to expect the theological seminary to put him in possession of such knowledge . The most he can reasonably expect is that it will furnish some knowledge of the ethical principles of Christianity as applied to social subjects . 2 . Let me attempt secondly to make emphatic the demand for thoroughness in ministerial training . I do not mean thoroughness in the denominational or sectarian sense . It is desirable indeed that one should understand what is distinctive in his denomination and should be trained to work in harmony with it , and endeavor to perpetuate whatever renders the denomination worth perpetuating . Our theological seminaries were founded in the interest of an evangelical congregationalism . The men who are trained there should bear those distinctive marks that give significance to their denomination , its intelligent regard for fundamental principles , and its spiritual , intellectual , and ecclesiastical freedom and catholicity . But we care relatively little in our day for denominational training . There is a tendency toward unity of ministerial type . It is not so easy as once to detect a man 's denominational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Preaching approaches toward a common type . Even in ecclesiastical administration the denominations are in many things drawing a little nearer dach other . It is easier than once for ministers to pass from one denomination to another . This is partly the result of agencies that are at work in all ministerial training . And all this , it is worthy of note , contributes to ministerial individuality . The larger the scope of a man 's training the larger the margin for the development of his personality . Nor do I mean by thoroughness that every man should be trained to do all things equally well . No man will or can discharge all ministerial duties equally well . Provision must be made for the training of men at points where they are strongest and may prove most effective . All the agencies of ministerial training are necessary up to a certain point . Within that limit a common curriculum is demanded . Beyond that men may well diverge and part company . The point of divergence is the point where one 's individual strength lies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum in all branches of ministerial education . It is a waste of time to push all men through the same inflexible , invariable course . There is increasing demand for a limited 6ptional provision in the seminary curriculum . Moreover it is unreasonable to insist that all men shall have the same amount of general training as condition of introduction to the ministry . Who can determine beforehand just what and how much each man needs as condition of such introduction ? Our churches have never insisted upon an inflexible standard , either in theological belief or in ministerial equipment as test for the admission of candidates to ministerial service . We wisely judge each case according to its own merits . There are men who without much preparatory theological training should be welcomed to the ministry . To reject a man who can not stand an examination in all courses of theology may involve the rejection of one whom God has chosen . The rigid tests that are applied by the State churches of Germany through the University Committee result no doubt in the introduction of well trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not always result in bringing in the best and most effective men . The demand for training is a relative matter , relative to what a man is , to his opportunities , to the work demanded , to the time in which one lives , to the exigencies of the churches . But it is not my purpose to discuss the limitations of these questions . What I am insisting upon is the general necessity for thorough training . Men differ , conditions differ , but every man needs to get the best he can get and all he can get and all he is capable of appropriating . The conviction is gaining ground that church life and ministerial training have had too exclusive reference to the intelligent and cultivated and prosperous portion of the community . It has been assumed that our churches must recruit from the upper or middle classes ; that they are our proper constituency . A training that would fit a minister to do successful work among the lower classes has not been desired . The average Congregational minister has disclosed but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A reaction , however , has come . Opinion upon this point has undergone a great change and the change marks a positive advance in true eccle // siastical life . And now what shall be said here ? In a newly awakened enthusiasm for the neglected and degraded it would be a great mistake to relax effort for those on whom the future welfare of the churches and of the nation must largely depend ,  --  the intelligent , educated , cultivated , prosperous men of the world . The American people are developing in intelligence and culture . The average American knows to some extent what is going on in the world of thought . His knowledge of vexed religions questions may be superficial and inaccurate , but his opinions are likely to be positive . The more important is it that his religious teacher win his confidence and intellectual respect . This enlargement of an intelligent public has weighty significance for the Christian ministry . The churches of some of the denominations that have in time past won their largest successes among the less intelligent classes see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the demand . And surely those churches that are historically committed to the work of educating a religions public can not now relax their effort . The theory of a thoroughly trained ministry is their birth-right . With due acknowledgment of what has been done for the less intelligent classes of the country by an imperfectly trained ministry , it should not be forgotten that the best and most permanent work for Christianity and the church has been done among the more intelligent classes by a well trained* ministry . It is not merely our home churches that demand a thoroughly trained ministry . Our foreign missionary work demands it . It is no time to lower the standard of preparation for missionary service . The standard of qualification should be advanced . The best men on the missionary field see the demand . There are needed men of intellectual independence and courage as well as of sobriety and reverence , men who are able to grapple with difficulties they are sure to meet in the subtle questionings of speculative oriental minds , and who are not at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any policy that would tend to exclude from missionary service our strongest and best equipped young men is an imbecile policy . Nor is it that only our strongest home churches demand well trained men . The weaker churches demand as welltrained // men as it is possible to furnish them . In many of those communities where our Home Missionary churches are established there are weighty and influential meft whose confidence in and respect for the intellectual leadership of the churches it is important to secure . They are not ignorant and insignificant people , who have no intellectual demands , and it is a great mistake to imagine that their wants can be met by men who are every way their intellectual inferiors . The destitute city population need trained men . The denial of such need is the heresy of our ecclesiastical economics . Why should a man 's training and culture unfit him for service among the lowly and degraded ? The defect , if there be such , is not in the training of men , but in their spirit . The man who has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and culture to the most needy is a stranger to the noblest impulse that can move a Christian minister . The only reason for not sending well trained men into those centers of degradation is that the men can not be had or that no provision is made for sending them . The problem of city evangelism will not be solved till Christian people resolve to send strong , intelligent , skillfully trained men into the very centers of such degradation and till they are willing themselves to tabernacle there as Christ came to tabernacle in fallen humanity , and to enter upon a work of systematic conquest . Nor is it*that the larger town churches only need the trained man . The country church needs him . The degradation of the country is proportionally as dangerous as the degradation of the city . Country people as well as town 's people are deserting the churches . Once the country was safe . The country church was a great power . Our best ministers were country pastors , and their ministry was one of most beneficent and wide reaching influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their influence lives to day in all this broad land . But the tide has turned , country and town are alike needy . What will become of us if we can not send out a virtuous and godly generation from our country homes ? There is a good deal of restlessness among ministers about this problem of country and town evangelization and a good many of them are inclined to criticise the theological seminary // as failing to train men to do the needed work . We hear a good deal of denunciation of the theological curriculum . Men say that it has taken them from three to five years to unlearn or to throw overboard or to recover from what they learned or failed to learn in the theological seminary . The lamentation comes in a variety of ways , but its import is the same . The responsibility for ministerial defects is charged upon the theological curriculum . It has become a fashion in fact to abuse the theological seminary . What does it all mean ? Is it that the theological teachers were incompetent ? If so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching was false or one-sided ? If so , it is valid . Is it that the whole method of training was wrong ? If so , it is valid . Is it that there was too much theoretic and too little practical teaching , that men were trained to get hold of principles rather than to get hold of people ? Possibly there may be some basis for such a charge . It is easily possible that the theoretic may dominate the practical tendency and that teaching may wholly displace observation and drill . But let us be reasonable . It should be remembered that the seminary is primarily a teaching school , and to say that teaching can be too thorough is nonsense . Men need constant drill in the sphere of teaching , but the seminary can be a drill school only in a limited degree . We must learn to do things in the drill school of life . We meet men in the open world and there we must learn to deal with them . It is not the function of the theological school to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fellow men . This wholesale , unreflecting criticism of the theological curriculum is sometimes the work of ignorant conceit and opinionatedness as well as ingratitude . The training of men is a complex problem . We need drill in practical work . One may get a little of it in his theological course . But he must get the most of it in the school of life . He will have time enough for that . It is the work of life . We need to watch other men at work and note their methods . We need to study the results of other men 's work as registered in concrete products and in historic records . But we also need to get back of all this . No man is an educated man in any worthy sense till he is trained to grapple vigorously and skillfully with principles . No man knows anything as an // educated man should know it till he knows it in its principles . The Congregational minister above all others , we may venture to say , should have a mastery of what lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum must give a man an insight into the subject matter with which his profession deals . It must enable him to grapple with its fundamental principles and to handle them with skill , and then it must give him an insight into the theory of its practical application . It may or may not do much else or more . It is indeed desirable that it should enlarge its scope . But this it must do , for this is its chief work . It is a teaching school . It opens up the whole broad field of Christian theology , puts one upon lines and methods of investigation and application , and then sends him out to train himself and to be trained by the great forccs of life in the open field of the world . 3 . It is not inconsistent with the discussion hitherto that attention should be directed thirdly to the demand for range and variety in ministerial training . The age has powerfully influenced the Christian ministry . It has affected our conception of the truths with which it deals . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological system has changed . We survey the whole field of Christian truth from a different point of view . Theological perspective has changed . The practical working truths of historic Christianity are brought into the foi*eground as of commanding importance , and some truths that have been overwrought are relegated into comparatively insignificant positions . The conception and statement of particular truths have been modified . The theological and practical significance of these changes it is not necessary here to discuss . Possibly too much importance is sometimes attached to them . It is certainly not wholly " new theology . " The germs of all this are hidden in the theology of the past . They are now emerging into prominence . But of the change there can be no doubt . It is in general the anthropological , the humanistic age . It tends to naturalistic and humanistic views of man and of life . The time spirit has not only affected our conception of truth , it has done its work in the production and development of men . No man wholly escapes the mark of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the influence of the prevailing spirit , who shares in any considerable degree the thoughts and feelings of the enterprising man of his time , will not only find his theological views affected thereby , but his whole estimate of the work of the Christian ministry . The official functions of the ministry have been greatly modified . New ministerial problems are before us . The questions we have to meet are very different from those our fathers dealt with . The field of service is broader . The scope of its interests is wider . The ministry has a more cosmopolitan character . It deals with the vast and varied and complicated interests of humanity . The whole world is at our door . The ministry of to-day must have a wide-reaching missionary quality . Time was and not so long ago when the missionary quality was almost wholly ignored . Three functions monopolized the entire ministerial activity , the teaching function including the homiletical and catechetical forms , the liturgical function or leadership of the public worship , including the administration of the sacraments , and the pastoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole field has broadened . Practical theology in our day discusses all the problems of modern church life and covers the whole vast field of its complex and multiform activities and is in fact almost a new branch of theology . Our ministerial fathers had more authority than we have and greater weight and significance with the people of their time *then we with those of our day . But their task was an easier one and the range of their professional activities was much more restricted . The missionary life of the church had not developed . The man who handles his church well in our day must be a leader in its missionary life . Christianity must be applied to conditions of society and to human wants that were not dreamed of by our fathers . Now it may be easy to exaggerate this modern demand . A wrong estimate of what a minister may wisely undertake to do in meeting this demand is easily possible . All this may result in the secularizing of ministerial activities and in such multiplication of ministerial tasks as may result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here is the fact and something approximating to a better division of labor seems necessary . There is something to be said in favor of training // men with reference to the discharge of particnlar ministerial fnnctions . The larger town church can not be snccessfully handled by one man . He who nndertakes the whole ronnd of pastoral duties is in danger of breaking down , or of dissipating his energies and doing his whole work indifferently , or if he concentrates upon one line of services , pulpit work for example , other wants of his parish are neglected . The demand therefore for assistant pastors is naturally increasing , and no better fortnne could befall a young man than the opportunity at the beginning of his ministry to strengthen himself in lines of study in which he feels himself deficient , and at the same time to develope his gifts of practical service under the helpful guidance of a mature and successful pastor . It is something like a reproduction under broader and more favorable conditions of the old method of pastoral training . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than were ever before brought to the service of the church . Preaching gifts , teaching gifts , pastoral gifts , administrative gifts , open up fields of usefulness such as were never opened up before . There is much to be said in favor of training schools like the one at Springfield , Mass. , and that of Mr. Moody at Chicago , in which comparatively uneducated men may be fitted for positions as pastoral assistants ,  --  men who , if they prove themselves competent , after years of practical training , may eVen be put into the pastorate . There are churches enough that need and may be well served by such men-which if they can not secure such men are likely to remain pastorless . But the point to be emphasized just here is that some of our ecclesiastical systems do not admit to any large extent of such division of labor . It is necessary that men should be trained so broadly and variously that they shall be able to combine all these ministerial functions either in direct personal activity or by judicious official direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unity of ministerial service . They combine all functions in the single pastorate . Congregational churches especially demand this comprehension . There is no hierarchy in our service , no superior and subordinate orders of clergy trained to different functions and placed in different official positions . Every pastor is bishop , unifying // in his bishopric all ministerial functions . Each church must have its own pastor , exercising all possible pastoral functions . Few can support associate pastors , and each demands a welf rounded and variously trained man . The demand upon the ministry of such churches , increasing in intelligence as they are with the development of our modern life , is in our day peculiarly exacting with respect to its scope and variety . 4 . In conclusion , note the practical demand . We hear a good deal about the practical character of the age . Men are not inclined to speculate in any domain of thought , we are told . They are becoming impatient of speculation and especially in theology . It is the fashion to say this , and like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age is not wholly non-speculative . Men cease to speculate only when they cease to think , or at least cease to push their thinking out into its natural issues . Men have not wholly ceased to think , and they have some intelligent outlook upon the issues of their thinking in the domain of theory . It is a necessity to speculate . Mental . life would stagnate without it . To admonish men not to speculate at all is to admonish them to stop thinking . Investigation , induction , hypothesis , theory , dogma-these words note the natural order and consummation of men 's thinking upon important questions in any domain of thought . If men do not inductively classify the results of their investigations and then develop provisionally hypotheses out of their inductions ,  --  and then theories that are relatively permanent out of their hypotheses ,  --  and even dogmas still more permanent out of their theories ,  --  it is because they do not carry their thinking out into its natural issues . It is to be conceded , however , that men are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogmatic results . They are inclined to suspend mental action . They hold the formulation of theories and dogmas in a certain suspicion . It is confessedly a critical age and non-speculative in the sense that men do not readily formulate the results of criticism in positive theories . If we formulate theories and dogmas we must speculate , for there are always lingering elements of speculation in all our theories and dogmas-even those best supported by alleged facts . It is an agnostic age . Men suspend // judgment . They do not allow themselves to speculate upon their subject matter sufficiently to arrive at positive , affirmative conclusions . The naturalistic tendency is str*ong . Men incline to hold hard by the domain of nature . It is not so easy as once to make incursions into the realm of the supernatural and bring back definite report . This is part of the non-speculative tendency . Moreover , the utilitarian tendency is strong . Men want working truths and practical , effective methods . There is , therefore , an unusual demand for a practical ministry . People want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching is , but that does not lessen the clamor for it , and the demand for a genuinely practical preaching is surely reasonable . iNot that men want empty preaching , for the intellectual exaction upon the pulpit is as strong as ever . But they want a subject matter in readily thinkable form , in form adapted to the production of tangible results , and in form corresponding to the concrete habit of their lives . There is demand for practical knowledge of men , for skill in the leadership of men , for enterprise and ability in organizing and administrating the affairs of the parish , for enthusiasm in missionary enterprise , for an eager outlook upon the on-going of things in public life , for readiness to lend a hand in all sorts of reform and in general philanthropic endeavor . Now this creates new demands upon ministerial training . low shall this demand be met ? To what extent can it be met in the seminary curriculum ? Not wholly , that is evident enough . The work of the school must be of necessity largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ministerial gymnasium . It must give men the theoretic basis of the ministry , not drill them in it . It is the experience of practical life that secures adjustment to its practical demands . And yet the school must be kept in working relation with the practical life of the people . In this country , as in no other , is there demand for this . We can not isolate men from the world and successfully train them for the work of the ministry . I have nothing that is very weighty or new to suggest on this point . The curriculum as we have it is in the main rational and eminently American . It may be bettered . But the basis of any best American method is given in what we have . There are only // a few somewhat general suggestions that I will make as bearing upon this phase of the question . In the Iirst place I suggest the need of a good working conception of Christianity itself as the basis for all best ministerial training . What we think of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , as well as of the character of the wants to be met , will inevitably affect our conception of the lines of service that are most urgently demanded and of the proper methods of procedure . What we want in our day is a good working conception of Christianity as a spiritual and social force , a revelation of God in Christ as a vitalizing power , not for the individual man alone , but for men in the common associate life . There has been a great but silent change in men 's conception of Christianity in this regard within the last hundred years . It is the change from an old to a new supernaturalism . Christianity is more than a doctrinal revelation . It is the personal revelation of God himself to man , in man , by man . This is so familiar now as to have become a commonplace . But if there is anything that can properly be called a new theology in our day , this is the root of it . This changed conception has wrought practical results . The missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely the outcome of this . This is the conception of which the training school should become ever more distinctly conscious , and it should work it out ever more definitely in its practical aims and methods . If we emphasize this spiritual , ethical , social power of our religion , we shall certainly train men with reference to a broader and more varied practical application of it to men in the mass . This is what we need in dealing with the social conditions of men in our day . In the second place , I suggest the need of a good working conception of the practical character of all branches of Christian theology . Theology is a science , the science of religion . Even practical theology is a branch of theologic science . But theology in any branch of it is not a science that can end with itself . Of course , as a science , it must be investigated scientifically , or it is not worthily investigated . But if it ends with itself it is no better than any other science , and loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theol // ogy , even those most distinctively theoretic , should never be lost sight of . Each branch of theology , therefore may well concern itself , to a considerable extent , with the investigation of questions that are of practical importance to the welfare of men in our day . Each may make its own contribution to our stock of practical knowledge on these important subjects . What , for example , has Biblical theology to contribute to questions touching industrial , social , or political life that are agitating the public mind ? What are the Biblical conceptions of the social organism ? What the Biblical conception of property , of property rights , of wages , of the use of wealth ? What are the limits of a Christian individualism ? What is Christian socialism ? What is the Biblical conception of the State ? What its conception of so-called secular society ? What its conception of the Kingdonm of God as related to secular society and what as related to the church ? In a word , the whole field of social ethics might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it beyond the proper scope of philosophical and historical theology to turn their attention towards some of these questions and to contribute their treasnres to the discussion of them . This is especially the direction in which practical theology needs to develop itself in our day . Finally I suggest briefly the need of practical drill and personal observation to supplement the work of theoretic and practical instruction . The school can do something in this line . Not very much as compared with all that is demanded , but something . And considering the vast and varied and urgent demands upon a minister in our day it should be done . How can a young man with his eyes wide open and with the demands of his profession fairly before him dare to enter upon his ministry in one of our larger town parishes without some preparatory drill , not only in the practical work of preaching , but of teaching as well , and of conducting public worship , and without some previous careful , comprehensive , realistic investigation by personal observation of methods of pastoral work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is only because his eyes are only half open and because he does not know what is before him that he will ever have the courage to do it . Every theological student before he leaves // the seminary should make a thorough study of the concrete methods of church administration upon as wide a field of observation as possible . The old method of ministerial training sought to supply this need to a limited extent . The range was narrow , but it met the need of the time . The German theological student finds some provision for supplementing the instruction in scientific theology of the University . He gets experience especially in teaching-for the teaching of religion not in the pulpit only but in the school is happily an important part of his ministerial service . The clergyman of the church of England finds similar provision . Associate pastorates are becoming somewhat common in the dissenting churches of England . We also are moving in the same general direction . The theological seminary is a relatively modern institution among Protestant churches . It originated as a scientific training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it endeavor to incorporate into its scientific training the supplementary methods of practical drill and personal observation . Some experience also previously to entering the theological school in practical life , in some handicraft , in business , in some form of organizing work , in teaching - some work that shall give a knowledge of men and of life ,  --  would prove of great value to every minister in this country . But this remains as a final word . Every man must train himself in the actual work of professional life . This is the great school . All that is done by whatever preparatory teaching or training , done by others or done by ourself , is simply tributary to the work of the great training school of life , after one shall have entered upon its weighty and responsible duties .
