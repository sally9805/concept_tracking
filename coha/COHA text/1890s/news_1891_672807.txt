txt This is the very striking title chosen by Lieut . ALLEN R. FOOTE for an article in the December Forum , embodying the " Protest of Loyal Volunteers ' ? against the present system , or rather the present-scheme , of pensions . Lieut . FooTE entered the Union Army as a volunteer in 1861 and . was under fire at a skirmish three days before the battle of Bull Run . He took part in the closing ceremony of the war , the memorable review in Washington in 1865 . He was thus with the colors steadily for the entire period of the war , with the exception of a short time when he was disabled by a wound received at Fair Oaks . He belongs therefore to what he very justly says is the only class of men who can discuss the present situation with perfect freedom . No one can impugn his motives or question his right to speak for the volunteer soldiers who fought and bled for the flag , who are entitled hot only in law , but by the most delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who must be believed when they say that the present expenditure , in its purpose , its distribution , the methods of solicitation , the conditions of grant , is to them a deep and lasting offense . Lieut . FOOTE holds , and declares that a very large proportion of the surviving veterans of the Union Army hold , that the idea of a pension as a reward is not merely a mistake , but an insult . It involves the notion that loyalty can be paid . for , and therefore that it can bo hired . It makes of those who freely and without question gave their service , their time , their strength to the country , and exposed their lives for its sake , mere mercenaries . Ho says that it is , moreover , an irreparable wrong to those who died in the cause of the Union . He protests particularly , in the name of the loyal volunteers , against the provision under the law of 1890 , by which any man who served three months and is incapable , or willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by manual labor , though the disability was not incurred in the service , can receive money from the public Treasury . He cites his own case as an instance of the way in which this law may work . He is incapable of earning his living by manual labor , and always must be , on account of the wound received at Fair Oaks .. yet ho is perfectly capable of supporting himself , and ho declares that in every essential regard he is more capable of doing so because of his service in the army than he would have been without it , the physical and moral benefit of those four years of active and disciplined life more than compensating for the advantages of education , &e,,; loot in civil life . What Lieut . FoorE insists upon as the essential condition of any honorable pension  --  that is , of any pension that can be granted and accepted without loss of self-respect on the part of the pensioner ? is that there shall be an incapacity incurred in the service to earn a living in any way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this incapacity . Where the incapacity is total he would make the pension not merely sufficient , but generous . Lieut . FOOTE is the originator of the " Society of Loyal Volunteers , " whose purpose is defined : " To teach that the duty of loyalty demands that each citizen should faithfully perform the duties of a volunteer soldier in times of war and the duties of a citizen in times of peace . " To secure the enactment of just laws , and their equitable administration , for the assistance , care . and maintenance of all loyal citizens who are in need , by reason of their loss of earning capacity incurred in theperformanoe of their duty during the war for the preservation of the Union . " It is a matter for congratulation that this society has been formed . It may not succeed in changing the laws , for there is an enormous corrupt interest in the pension agents to resist any reform , but it will at least relieve the mgn who fought from patriotism and from no other motive of the odium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
