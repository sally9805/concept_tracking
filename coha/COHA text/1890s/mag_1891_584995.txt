txt COME with thine unveiled worlds , 0 truth of night , Come with thy calm . Adown the shallow day , Whose splendors hid the vaster world away , I wandered on this little plot of light , A dreamer among dreamers . Veiled or bright , Whether the gold shower roofed me or the gray , I strove and fretted at life 's feverish play , And dreamed until the dream seemed infinite . But now the gateway of the all unbars ; The passions and the cares that beat so shrill , The giants of this petty world , disband ; On the great threshold of the night I stand , Once more a soul self-cognizant and still , Among the wheeling multitude of stars . THE STORY OF THE FRESH-AIR FUND . By Willard Parsons . the summer of 1877 , when pastor of a small church in Sherman , Pa. , I came to New York and gathered a little company of the poorest and most needy children I could find . They were taken out among my people , who were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midsummer heat . Others took the place of the first company ; and at the end of the season the good people had entertained sixty poor city children for a fortnight each ; and that , too , without any compensation save the consciousness of having done a sim ple Christ-like act of charity to one in need . This somewhat novel experiment of taking little ones from the wretched city tenements to comfortable country homes was a most gratifying success . The object first aimed at was the physical improvement of the poor . It was only after months of earnest thought and careful planning that the Fresh-Air project was launched , even in this small way . The work was started with the hope of proving that bodies diseased , enfeebled by poor and insufficient food and foul air , could be benefited by a two weeks ' stay in better surroundings . In the plan of carrying on this experiment , there were three main factors to be considered , viz. : 1 . To get the money . NIGHT . // 2 . To find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , as to raising the money : It was an easy matter after the success of the first season to induce the New York Evening Post to take up the enterprise , and raise the necessary fund to carry on and enlarge it , which it did successfully for four years . When the plan of continuing the enterprise was discussed in the spring of 1882 , the friends of the " Fund " most heartily welcomed the willingness of the New York Tribune to take it up ; and it was then transferred from the Evening Post to the Tribune . By the law of natural selection such a humane undertaking will best crystallize around a journal of the character of the Tribune . The large circulation of that newspaper and its well-known interest in philanthropic labors of like character , together with the high class of people the journal reaches , have given the best possible support to the " Fresh-Air Fund . " Money in abundance for all possible needs has always been forthcoming . The mere statement in the Tribune that $3.00 would give a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to fill the treasury . It is a most significant fact that more than two hundred thousand dollars have been sent as voluntary contributions , and it has never been necessary to employ any collectors . Every sort of entertainment has been given to swell the fund , from children selling pin-wheels and wild flowers by the wayside , netting , perhaps , a few coppers , to the more pretentious fair and festival , netting its hundreds of dollars ; from the boys ' circus in the barn to the finished entertainments in public halls . Children have pulled weeds in the garden and boys gone without their Fourth of July fire-crackers ; the small savings-bank of the dead child has often been sent to bring life and happiness to the poor sick one ; in fact , from Maine to California , from Canada to Florida , from South America , from the Old World , and even from Africa , have come voluntary contributions to carry on this most humane work among the poor of our overcrowded city . Beginning in a very unobtrusive way - at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I have said , with sixty for the entire season  --  the work has grown steadily and rapidly till it has greatly exceeded the wildest dreams of its manager . The growth of the scheme from its inception is best illustrated by the following table : Number of Number children Bent for Expendi- cost per for twoweeks. one day . tures. child . 18fl ... 60 .... $182 ' 62 $3 12 1878 ... 1,077 .... 2,980 29 2 77 ....... 2,400 6,511 54 2 71 ...... 2,540 600 8,519 71 3 35 1881 ... 3,203 1.000 8,217 64 2 54 1,2 ... 5,500 21,325 06 2 85 1883 ... 4,250 5,200 14.908 67 3 36 1884 ... 6,253 1,000 18,756 14 3 00 1 , ... 6,650 6,073 19,883 95 2 98 1886 ... 8,336 1,600 24,092 09 2 89 1882 ... 7,748 .... 22,783 85 2 94 1888 ... 10,920 . ... 25,636 64 2 35 1889 ... 10,352 24,978 29 2 42 1890 ... 11,193 18,029 23,804 11 2 12 Totals 80,482 34,002 $222,565 60 .... It is thus seen that during its fourteen years 80,482 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's va*tion , at a total cost of $222,565.60 , or at an average cost of only $2.75 per capita . The various transportation companies cheerfully make large reductions from the regular fare . No salaries or office expenses are ever paid from the fund , and mauy helpers voluntarily give their services . Who can instance a charity where $2.75 invested will do as much good ? The second question is most constantly asked : " How do you find the temporary homes for the children ? " I have never found any value in circulars andbut very little response even to personal letters . I have only found success by personal appeals . Among my own parishioners a practical interest was aroused as soon as I had shown them something of the condition of the poor children in the tenements , and the simple plan of relief was most heartily adopted . After the success of the experiment , other communities were more easily interested and were quite ready to offer hospitality . I begin early in April a systematic visitation from town to town . A call // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local paper , and , if  |p08-sible  , a few of the leading citizens . A brief explanation of the work-a few words to show the condition and needs of the tenement-house children and the great benefit of a fortnight 's trip are usually sufficient to awaken a practical interest . Then a local committee is appointed and the success or failure in that community is due , to a large extent , to the zeal and earnestness of this committee . The local committee finds out how many children can be provided for , and , when ready for their company , reports the result and arranges with the manager the various details for their coming . Every possible opportunity for getting a knowledge of the work before the people is seized upon . At any and every sort of public meeting that can be heard of , permission is asked to present the cause . Almost without exception , a few minutes are granted . Since the charity has grown to such proportions it is not possible for me to give much time to the country visitations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in whom I have perfect confidence , have been most successful in arousing an interest in the cause in the country . A railway ticket given is often the only expense necessary to send some of the city missionaries , physicians , or clergymen into their native regions , where ( with an extended acquaintance among the people ) it is easy to induce them to throw wide open their hospitable doors . In every case there is a great deal in personal solicitation . In answer to the third question , I may say that it is no easy matter to select the children for these trips . Everyone who has had the care of getting a band of children ready for the country will most readily testify to the truth of this statement . Last summer nearly two hundred workers among the poor aided in the selecting and preparing the children for the country . These workers are from the Church Missions , Bible Missions , Hospitals , Dispensaries , Industrial Schools , Day Nurseries , Model Tenement Houses , and kindred organizations . When the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is apportioned among those who have children to send . A record is kept of all organizations and individuals who apply for a share in the benefits , and the first one to apply is called upon for children for the first company to start . Before the season is over all have abundant opportunity to send their most needy ones . The children selected manifest all degrees of ignorance of the country-from those who imagine they know all about it , having played under the trees in a city square , to the boy who was shown a large herd of Alderneys by his farmerhost , and , after intently watching them chew the cud , asked , " Say , mister , do you have to buy gum for all them cows to chew ? " Those who apply for a chance to send their children to the country are instructed that they must be poor and needy , without any infectious disease , clean , and free from vermin . A physician then inspects each child . Dr. C. C. Vinton was the examining physician last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five thousand were sent into the country . Each day the Board of Health furnished a list of the houses where there was any contagious disease ; which was of immense help . With that list before him , it was easy for the examiner to stop any child who came from an infected house . The majority were refused on account of their hopeless condition as to vermin . It is a herculean task to get the average tenement-house child in a suitable condition to be received into country families . What is the effect of entertaining these poor children upon their country hosts ? Will they receive such guests a second time in their homes ? Is there no danger in bringing children directly out of their low surroundings into families where the children are so differently trained ? The danger is much less than would at first appear . Those who select the children are , for the most part , trained workers who have a personal knowledge of each child and its surrounding , and they send only such as are somewhat // fitted to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by no means infallible , yet the average result is remarkably good . The children are on their good behavior . Selfrespect is engendered . The entirely new and comfortable surroundings usually bring out the best in the child , and the fortnight vacation is over before the novelty has worn off . A clergyman in northern New York , after having entertained one hundred children , wrote as follows : " They have left a rich blessing behind them , and they actually gave more than they received . They have touched the hearts of the people and opened the fountains of love , sympathy , and charity . The people have read about the importance of benevolence , and have heard many sermons on the beauty of charity ; but these have been quickly forgotten . The children have been an object-lesson that will long live in theirhearts and minds . " " We want to thank you , " wrote another minister from Massachusetts , " for giving us this opportunity to do so much good . Any inconvenience to which we have been put during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these thirty glad faces and think of the purifying and strengthening influences that have come into their young lives during these two weeks ' stay with us . " These two letters are fair samples of hundreds of others I receive every year . Many people become strongly attached to the children , and follow them into their wretched homes with letters and substantial gifts . These country letters are highly prized and religiously guarded . Nearly two thousand of these letters were forwarded to me last year , containing invitations for the child to repeat the visit . I can now recall no community where hospitality has been given once , but that some children have been invited back the following years . The success of the charity turns upon the country friends ' willingness to receive the children into their homes , and as yet they have shown no signs of being weary in this service ; each year the number of free places has increased . To the hospitable country family the largest share of the work has fallen , both in practical care and personal touch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality and a rich personal service during the busiest days of the year . It is given too-not grudgingly , but with wonderful heartiness . Nothing has ever so strengthened my faith in humanity as the kind and loving way the country people have received these stranger gnests . Is there in the fortnight 's outing for the poor anything more than a merely pleasant holiday ? What good can accrue from taking a child out of its wretched home , and after two weeks of comfort and decent living , sending it back to its old surroundings ? One minister writes : " It will only make the child discontented with the surroundings where God placed him . " I contend that a great gain has been made , if you can only succeed in making the tenement-house child thoroughly discontented with his lot . There is some hope then of his getting out of it and rising to a higher plane . The new life he sees in the country , the contact with good people , not at arm 's length , but in their homes ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him while the giver stands by and looks down to see how he enjoys it , and remarks on his forlorn appearance ; but brought into the family and given a seat at the table , where , as one boy wrote home , " I can have two pieces of pie if I want , and nobody says nothing if I take three pieces of cake ; " or , as a little girl reported , where " We have lots to eat , and so much to eat that we could not tell you how much we get to eat . " This is quite a different kind of service , and has resulted in the complete transformation of many a child . It has gone back to its wretchedness , to be sure , but in hundreds of instances about which I have personally known it has returned with head and heart full of new ways , new ideas of decent living , and has successfully taught the shiftless parents the better way . One little girl talked so much of her trip last summer and described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to inquire where it was his child went , adding , " I should think it was Heaven , from the way she talks about it . " // Many a girl has begun , immediately on her return , to persuade her mother to adopt the ways of the country mother . In scores of instances that have come under my personal observation , children have become so delighted with the country life , with its possibilities for the poor , that they have persuaded the family to migrate , the country friends gladly helping them to a home , and giving work to make them independent . One of the most serious problems of country life is to get help for the necessary household work ; to be sure the few hundred people that have been helped by this charity to locate permanently in the country is but a drop in the bucket , and . does not go far toward solving the " help " question ; still it is a little aid in the right direction . Even supposing it was nothing but a bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and wholesome food , with pure air to breathe , the children were to go back to their old life - that is no small gain . We who do not live in tenements and , perhaps , are not obliged to work till the cheek grows pale , never think of objecting , when it comes our time for a fortnight 's rest , because after the holiday we must return to our toilsome place . The change is thought necessary for those who have everything to make it least necessary ; then certainly the holiday is none the less beneficial for those whose whole life has been simply an exhausting battle with fearful odds against them . A physician tells us we must take the loved one to a different climate if we would save his life , and we lose no time in obeying his orders . To thousands of the poor the same words have been spoken . The same change was the only hope ; and the only change possible was , perhaps , a ride on the ferryboat . To thousands of poor mothers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , with wholesome and nutritious food . " Perhaps delicacies to tempt the appetite have been ordered when only the plainest and coarsest necessaries are procurable . In thousands of such cases the Fresh-Air Fund has come to the rescue , and given both the pure air and the wholesome food , with results most happy . Let me give two or three instances where the moral influences exerted by the simple and kindly life ( sometimes with eccentric people ) , have resulted most happily on the child . In 1878 a Mrs. Y *who was noted far and wide for her penuriousness , wrote me : " Homes are ready with me for two boys and two girls , if your work is for the virtuous class of unfortunate children . Please be plain and frank in the matter , for I do n't wish to have anything to do with a work that is not all right . God give you wisdom . " The italics are not mine . Someone had frightened her by the statement that all the poor city children were illegitimate . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow from one of the most wretched homes that drink has caused . The boy had never before known kind treatment , and the pure , simple , and wholesome life , with the abundant food of the hillside farm , stirred his nature to the very depths and called out all his latent energies . A few months ago , while in a bank , a well-dressed fellow immediately behind me in the line , reached out his hand , saying : " I suppose you do n't know me ; but I am Henry C " Why , " said I , " you must be the boy that Mrs. Y- spanked and fitted out with a complete suit of homespun , with the jacket sleeves of a different color ! " " Yes , I am the identical boy . I ca n't tell whether it was due to the spanking or to the Joseph-like coat , but that two weeks changed my whole life . I went to work when I came back , and have been with the same firm ever since . See here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing several thousand dollars he was about to deposit for the firm , " do n't that look as though the firm had confidence in me ? I literally came up out of the very lowest slums , and my present prosperous condition is due to the interest that family in the country has always taken in me since my visit with them in 1878 . " In the earlier days of the work a bright boy of ten was one of a company invited to Schoharie County , N. Y. He endeared himself so thoroughly to his entertainers , who " live in a white house // with green blinds and Christmas-trees all around it , " that they asked and received permission to keep the lad permanently . The following is an exact copy of a part of the letter he wrote home after he had been for a few months in his new home : DEAR MOTHER am still to Mrs. D and i was so Busy that i Could not Write Sooner i drive the horses and put up the Cows and clean out the Cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apple tree 6 Feet High and i have got a pair of new pants and a new Coat and a pair of Suspenders and Mr. D- is getting a pair of New Boots made for me We killed one pig and one Cow i am going to plow a little piece of land and plant Some Corn . When Mr. D killed the Cow i helped and Mr. Dhad to take the Cow skin to be taned to make leather and Mr. D gave the man Cow skin for leather to make me Boots i am going to school to-morrow and i want to tell lizziepauline - Charlie - Christie-maggie-george and you to all write to me and if they all do when Christmas Comes i will send all of you something nice if my uncle frank comes to see yous you must tell him to write to me i Close my letter From your oldest son A A year after that time the mother died . Some time afterward an uncle began writing for the lad to come back to the city-he coveted his small earnings . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off where he was . Finally the uncle went after the boy , and told him his brother was dying in the hospital , and was calling constantly for him . Under such circumstances his foster parents readily gave him permission to return with the uncle for a visit . Before they reached the city , the uncle told him he should never go back . He sent him to work at Eleventh Avenue and Twenty-ninth Street , in a work-room situated in the cellar , and his bedroom , like those in most tenement houses , had no outside window . The third day he was sent upstairs on an errand , and as soon as he saw the open door he bolted . He remembered that a car that passed Fourth Street and Avenue C , would take him to the Peoples ' Line for Albany . He ran with all his might to Fourth Street , and then followed the car-tracks till he saw on the large flag " Peoples ' Line . " He told part of his story to the clerk , and finally added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys and I have got to go to Albany . " That settled the matter , and the clerk readily gave him a pass . A gentleman standing by gave him a quarter for his supper . He held on to his appetite as well as his quarter ; and in the morning laid his twenty-five cents before the ticket agent at Albany , and called for a ticket to H , a small place fifty miles distant . He got the ticket . After a few miles ' walk from H- he reached his new home safely , and there he proposed to stay . He said he would take to the woods if his uncle came after him again . This happened ten years ago . About a year ago , a letter came from the young fellow . He is now an active Christian , married , and worth property , and expects in a few years to have his farm all paid for . A few days since I was stopped on Broadway by a well-dressed and prosperous-looking young man . " I am one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . In 1878 he was one of a party taken to central New York . It had been a hot and very dusty ride , and at the end of the journey this Five Points boy looked so thoroughly disreputable , that the person who was to take him utterly refused to accept such a dirtyand ill-looking boy . The tears of the lad , when he found that no one wanted him , flowed in streams down his dirty face , while the two tearwashed streaks , the red and white and black spots about his eyes and mouth , gave him a most unpromising look . Before I reached the hotel with the sobbing and " left over " boy a man came out of a small butcher shop and so heartily and kindly invited the boy to stay with him that the tears ceased instantly . A thorough bath and a new suit made a wonderful transformation . The family took a great interest in and became strongly attached to him . The change from the wretched Cherry Street tenement , with its drunken and often brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butcher , where he was kindly treated , made a strong impression . The family kept track of the boy by corresponding with him , and have claimed a visit from him every year // since . He is now married , lives in a comfortable flat , and has a good position as a commercial traveller . Each child was chosen the first year on account of its physical needs . The late Dr. White , of Brooklyn , most carefully examined every child sent out , the entire sixty having passed through his hands . He kept a careful record , and the following extracts from a report which he submitted to a medical society will show the success of the undertaking on its physical side : All were taken from the very poor , though not from the class that usually beg from door to door . They were selected mainly with reference to their physical condition , and were suffering more or less with some chronic disease , born of neglect , privation , filth , and foul air . Prominent among the diseases represented were scrofula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spinal troubles . Among them were confirmed cripples , as well as those in the incipient stage of more or less incurable diseases ; while others were simply in bad health , delicate , or sickly , the result of impure air or insufficient and improper food . En . feebled by want and disease , bred in poverty and filth , no wonder their faces , for the most part , were thin , pale , and haggard , and even their smiles feeble and sickly . Of the effects of the trips he says generally : Appetites improved , coughs ceased to be troublesome , ulcers healed , growing deformities were arrested , cheeks filled out and grew ruddy , spirits became buoyant , the step elastic and childlike , while the sickly smile gave place to the hearty laugh of childhood ; or , as very happily expressed by a friend , " They went out men and women-they came back little children . " To the educated physicians to whom the report was addressed this general statement meant a good deal more than the words indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand as physicians do how important the general building up of the system is in the treatment of positive disease , and very few persons not trained in the medical schools would think of a hygienic vacation as an effective method of treating physical deformity . In such a case we should hope to make the unfortunate child happier , perhaps , by sending him to the coun try , but beyond that we should not venture to hope for good . Yet here is what the physician reported to his associates of such a case : Another marked case of improvement was a boy , five years of age , who had been suffering more than a year with disease of the upper dorsal vertebrie . The disease had been detected in its earliest stages , and as the mother , a widow with five young children , was very poor and unable to give proper care or suitable food to the little patient , I had him sent to a hospital established for treating such cases , expecting lie would receive such special treatment as his case required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finding that nothing was done for him excepting allowing him to live there , and that he was constantly growing worse , the mother clandestinely brought him away . I found him in constant pain , nights restless and sleepless , appetite gone , emaciation extreme , and deformity increasing . In that condition he went to the country with his little brother , seven years old , for nurse and guardian . A few weeks ' residence there produced a marvellous change . He came back hale and hearty , health completely established-his spinal trouble arrested - indeed , cured . That little fellow 's cure cost some contributor to the fund about three dollars , and a family in the country a fortnight 's hospitality . The following are additional extracts from Dr. White 's interesting report : The whole number selected under my own supervision was sixty . As to diseases , they were classified as follows : General debility 31 Deformities 7 Hip-joint disease 5 Spinal disease 2 Knee-joint disease 1 Consumption 5 Bronchitis 4 Chorea 3 Chronic ulcers 2 Total 60 All those whose health was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded and badly ventilated apartments , or from insufficient and improper food , as well as those enfeebled by a previous attack of some acute disease were classed under the head of General Debility , without reference to the cause of their physical condition . Nearly all of this class i*eturned home completely restored to health . All others were greatly benefited by the trip , and , if not cured , in many cases with disease arrested for the time being at least . All the cases of consumption improved . One // young woman , aged twenty-three , inheriting phthisis from her mother , and suffering for more than a year with hemorrhages , harassing cough , and profuse expectoration , was so exhausted by the trip on the Annex to the Erie Railroad depot that Mr. Parsons had misgivings about the propriety of her going on , fearing the result . She was carried through safely , though soon after arriving at her destination an attack of hemorrhage prostrated her still more . She returned , after an absence of six weeks , literally another being , resuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she still continues to work . I afterward learned that the family who had entertained this girl were straining every nerve to save enough to pay interest on borrowed moiey , and thus avert the sale of their farm . While writing this article I have heard that this girl is now living in a comfortable home of her own , apparently as well as any one ; and it was only last summer that the eldest of her four children enjoyed the farmer 's hospitality . It may be of interest to add , that a lady , who had been interested in this girl , when she heard of the farmer 's financial condition , made a most substantial gift to help him out of his difficulty . Dr. White also says in his report that " very marked improvement was observed in nearly all cases of joint and spinal diseases. ** I have given more space to this report of the first year of the work for the simple reason that when but few children were sent out , it was comparatively easy to watch the results closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , selected by about two hundred different workers , it is far more difficult and well-nigh impossible to have a personal knowledge of many of the children . Yet I am fully convinced that when the children are carefully chosen the same good results always obtain . The following brief reports from responsible people , thoroughly familiar with the work , surely support this conviction : The superintendent of one of the missions that has sent a large number of children into the country says : " In the fall I can tell by just looking in their faces , which of the children have been in the country . They are fatter , ruddier , and their whole expression is changed and improved . " The superintendent of another of the Church Missions , who is also a physician , told me that he selected the wealdy ones each year for the country trip , and he found the benefit so great that they were the stronger ones during the winter . He instanced several cases where particularly puny children , predisposed to nervous and lung difficulties , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses said to me recently : " There are about two hundred children sent to the country from our mission each year . These nearly all live in the crowded tenements where four families occupy each floor . I constantly visit among the sick in these poor families , and I notice that those children who had a fortnight in the country are much stronger physically , and the improved condition lasts during the winter . " The chairman of the local committee in one village community weighed every child in the party on arrival , and again after fourteen days in the country . The average age was ten years . The least gain was shown in a four-year-old boy , who added only one pound to his weight . The greatest by an eleven-yearold girl , who gained nine pounds . The average gain for the entire party was four and nine-tenths pounds . A missionary from one of the City Mission chapels says : " During the eight years I have been connected with this chapel , we have sent out through the Fresh-Air Fund many hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of incalculable benefit , both educationally and physically . In a number of instances the entire family of a beneficiary of the fund has been led to move to the country . No small part of the good accomplished is the building up of health , and instances come constantly to my notice where the two weeks in the country have , I believe , saved the life . " Dr. Vinton says : " In an experience of several years I have seen much benefit received physically by children sent into the country for two weeks . The first child I sent under the Tribune Fresh-Air Fund was Annie , whom I had been treating throughout the summer for St. Vitus 's dance , and for whom place was made in the last party // of the year . She came back after two weeks , rosy - cheeked instead of pale , heavier by a number of pounds , and without any trace of her nervous trouble . " " In August , 1889 , " he adds , " I accompanied a party of about one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again took charge of them on their return to the city two weeks later . The improvement in the physical condition of many of these children was very noticeable , eyes and faces which before had been wan and sunken , bearing the evidences of health . The same changes were noticed in a party I brought back from Waterville in the summer of 1888 , most of whom I had examined two weeks previously . " Dr. Daniel , who has long taken a professional interest in the work , writes to me : Last summer I sent 235 children on excursions of the Fresh-Air Fund . I shall comment upon them under the following classifica-tion : 1 . Thirty-five children re-invited by their hosts of former years . Of these not one had been ill during the preceding year , nor has been since . I have either seen or heard di . rectly from all of these , and for obvious reasons these are the children who show the most physical improvement . 2 . One hundFed and four delicate children , is e. , children who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can count thirty-five who were not at the time under treatment in the dispensary . These were sent either to care for younger children or because they were not very strong . All were benefited by the change , as far as I know . Of this class I can give the least positive evidence because I have seen possibly only one-half of them . 3- Forty - seven children recovering from acute illness . These included typhoid fever , measles , and acute pulmonary diseases , such as pneumonia and bronchitis . All were improved , except two , increased in weight and with better appetites . 4 . Twenty-five chronic invalids . These - included consumptives , those suffering from tuberculosis of the glands , chronic heart diseases and bone diseases . Of this class three were decidedly worse after the vacation , and the rest were slightly improved ; the greatest improvement being in the appetite . All of this class are continually under my observation . 5 . Twenty-four children of the striking cloak-makers . This class showed the most improvement , excepting only the first class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hungry and had been for several weeks . All returned very much improved in appearance and evidently in weight ; the pale face and the hungry appearance had disappeared . Doctor Brown took these children to the country and returned with them , and her testimony agrees with mine . I have seen at least one-half of these children since , and they still remain well . I should classify the children again into the very poor , that is , those continuously poor , and children of a class who are able to have the actual necessaries of life . About one-half of the children I sent last summer ( not including the cloak-makers ' children ) belong to the very poor class . These were not so much benefited as the better class , because , 1 , they are in a state of chronic hunger ; 2 , the time is not long enough to make much of an improvement , and 3 , the slight benefit derived is not permanent , because they return to the same mode of life . Of the two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Broadway , four in Hoboken , and the others lived east of the Bowery as far south as Chatham Square ; fifty-seven lived in rear tenements and twenty-eight in basements . I have sent children for six or seven years , but have not definite statistics , yet my impression is that at least one-half of the children sent are improved physically . The most marked improvement is in appetite and general appearance . I can say that I believe the Fresh-Air Fund is the best plaster we have for unjust social conditions of the people . One of the most gratifying results of this Fresh-Mr enterprise has been the readiness with which the idea has been taken up by others , till to-day there are vacation societies for about every class of the poor . A great many of the city churches now provide fresh air for the sick poor . Yarious societies and hospitals have their country summer homes . Missions have their cottages by the sea . Working girls ' vacation societies provide a fortnight in the country for working girls who need the change ; other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without young children . King 's Daughters ' circles open houses for a few weeks or for the season , and send into the city for the quota of inmates . The Bartholdi Cr*che has been organized to help women with small children who are unable to leave home except for a few hours at a time . New York L ? fe has started a summer village , where a deserted hamlet , containing a score of cottages beautifully shaded , is turned into a populous village , and where three hundred at one time can find ample accommodations. lJnoccupied houses in many a town have been 523 // temporarily fitted up for the little city sufferers . The best results are obtained where the children are received into the country families , for there the great moral influences are best exerted , yet all these other plans do a vast amount of good . There has also been a marked growth in the direction of day excursions . More than a score of times last summer invitations were sent from some of the suburban towns , for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come out as their guests for a day . Transportation and most abundant food were supplied . One gentleman , who only stipulated that his name should not be published , gave for the entire season the use of a grove on the Hudson . He also supplied all the money for barges , music , and milk . Though the generosity of this one man , more than eighteen thousand of the city poor had a day 's outing . Not only have various organizations in New York been quick to seize hold of this Fresh-Air idea and adopt some phase of it for their own poor , but the interest has been very marked in other cities . Committees have waited upon the writer , from Boston and Philadelphia , or have sent for instructions , to aid them in starting a Fresh-Air Fund for the poor-in each of these cities they now have a prosperous Country Week . Also from Hartford , Troy , Albany , Buffalo , Chicago , St. Louis , Louisville , Cincinnati , Baltimore , and San Francisco , have inquiries and committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance have also sent to ascertain how such a work can be started . Committees have also visited New York , to find out the modus operandi , from Toronto , Montreal , St. Johns , and London and Manchester . In London there is now a large work done for the poor , either in the way of day-trips or a week 's stay in the country . Germany and Italy , too , have sent for information on the subject . Dresden , Stuttgart , Vienna , and Berlin have each joined the movement , and there is now a prosperous Fresh-Mr work in each of these cities . Some time ago a lady from the Sandwich Islands wrote for full information concerning the work . She was to present the plans in detail at a large gathering in Honolulu . The latest call for reports and statistics came from Russia . This Fresh-Air movement all began in a small hamlet in northeastern Pennsylvania ; among a small flock , not one of whom was rich enough to purchase the most modest house in New York . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accommodate a single party . The little enterprise so simply started in 1877 , has made its influence felt from Canada to South America , from Boston to San Francisco . There has never been an organization or staff of officers . The constitution and by-laws are made and amended from day to day as required , and have yet to be written . Perhaps the time is near at hand when the work should be more systematically developed . I am quite certain that a large number of skilled and paid helpers could be employed with most satisfactory results.
