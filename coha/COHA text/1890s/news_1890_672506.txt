txt United States Senators Wade Hampton and M. C. Butler have returned to this State to assist in pouring oil on the troubled sea of politics . It is conceded now that very much depends on them in the work of steering the ship of state to a safe port . Senator Hampton this evening authorized the statement that he would support the ticket nominated by the September convention , but that he would , not speak at the mass meetings advertised to be held here and in Charleston , as in his judgment these would only prolong the existing excitement , intensify the bitter feeling now unfortunately prevailing , and tend to widen the present unhappy breach in the Democratic Party . Senator Butler also publicly stated to-day that he considered the action of the State Convention perfeotly regular and would support the ticket put forward by it . He takes the ground that Tillman has been nominated by a majority of his party associates " and that , " says he , " is enough for one . I am not better than my party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gen. Butler says that he will speak at the mass meetings , to do what he can to restore harmony and allay political excitement . He , however , does not believe that the meetings ought to be held and vigorously declared that the party had had " enough of mass meetings , vulgar personalities , vituperation , and ill-feeling for one year . Let 's cool off and go about electing a new State Government like sensible men . " Senator Butler declared that he did not believe Tillman ever used the expression attributed to him to the egect that the people of Edgefleld would not . low the negroes to vote for the Haskell ticket Asked as to what he thought would be the outcome of all this pontioal confusion , and how it would affect the State ; he said : " I think the regular ticket will be elected , and we shall all settle down again to peace and quiet , and by 1892 come together again . Do n't lose sight of the fact that the people of the State have charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They said they wanted a new deal and they got it ; rather more perhaps than they bargained for , but , to use an expressive if not very elegant phrase , I do n't think they have bit off more than they can ohaw . As to the effect upon the State , why , that will depend upon the new administration . The nominees have been enjoying the pastime of throwing brickbats at those in office . Very soon the brickbats will begin to fly at them . You know there is a groat deal of difference in the two situatioue , of biter and bitee , so to speak . They have been the biters , now they are the bitees . If they are prudent and conservative and wise , the State will go on as usual . If they are foolish and blatant and erratic the State will suffer , and at the next election  --  which is not very far off  --  the people will bury them out of sight . Some of them are untried in the administration of public affairs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gradually get a firm seat in the saddle . They deserve at least a fair trial , and that I have no doubt they will get .
