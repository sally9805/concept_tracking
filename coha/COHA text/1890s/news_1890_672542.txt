txt The Daily Telegraph says the indications at present are in favor of Parnell 's leading a strong party in Parliament , although he will probably not have a majority of the Irish party at his back . The Chronicle thinks that as Mr. Healy has discovered his error in leaving all the talk to the supporters of Mr. Parnell , the reaction in favor of Parnell may be checked , but it says that Parnell , at the head of a compact minority , will be a more powerful force in Parliament than McCarthy , aided by three jealous lieutenants . The Chronicle commends to the notice of the /Speaker of the House of Commons Mr. Parnell 's drastic treatment of his leading opponents . The Times says : " Mr. Parnell is likelier to gain recruits than to lose adherents . Many of the party are probably sorry now that they revolted against a master so imperious , implacable , and full of resource . He may stave off a final division for a long time , and will command a compact minority and remain President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to underrate his strength or its serious consequences . He will regain his old popularity with the extremists in Ireland and America , who have always supplied him with funds and will rejoice over his separation from Gladstone . Mr. Parnell knows how to play on these responsive strings . " The Staadard says : " The final vote , even when reached , will only be the beginning of the real et:millet . It is estimated that thirty-three of the Irish members are with Parnell and fiftythree against him , but against this defection of his colleagues he may set the support of the league in Dublin . He holds the trumps in the election game . It is not a question of a righteous cause , but of a winning one . "
