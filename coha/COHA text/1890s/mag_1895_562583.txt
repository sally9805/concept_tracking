txt SOCIALISM may still perhaps be identified in the minds of some with anarchy , atheism , dynamite and assassination ; but its reasonable and intelligent friends among us have stripped it of these and other ugly adjuncts . It is not now held to be the product of either dreaming lunatics on the one hand , or reckless desperadoes on the other ; it is allowed by friends and foes alike to have a reasonable basis , and to be capable of a friendly alliance with religion , family order and morality . It has ceased to be regarded as the culmination of democratic violence , bent on seizing all existing property , flinging it into a common reservoir , and doling it out to all and sundry in equal dividends ; it is no longer the synonym of anarchy or of communism . It is on this account that it is receiving much more attention than in former days and , according to its advocates , constant recruits . The distinctive term by which it now desires to be known is " collectivism , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quintessence of collectivism may be simply stated . Its object is to transfer the whole means of production-all that goes to produce the commodities needful for human beings , namely , land , machinery , workshops , warehoused , ships , railways , and all capital used in production-from the ownership of individuals to the ownership of the State . Its purpose is illustrated by the transaction which took place a few years ago when the ownership of all our British telegraphs was transferred from railway companies or other owners to the State . The transference , however , of the whole instruments of production would be of no avail unless followed up by a corporate organization of labor and a distribution of the proceeds in proportion to the value of the work done by each laborer . On these three things-nationalization of the instru // ments of production , unification of labor , and proportionate distribution of the fruits  --  the fabric of socialism rests , as it is usually presented by its more intelligent advocates in this closing decade of the nineteenth century . Nothing is allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not embrace these points . In this way modern English Socialism severs connection not only with revolution and anarchy , but also with certain elaborate systems , such as Fourier 's " Phalansteries , " or even Comte 's " polity , " by means of which society was to be constituted on an entirely new basis . It also differentiates itself from not a few movements to which the general name of Socialism , or social reform , is often given . The " Christian Socialism " of Kingsley , Maurice , and others , some forty years ago , does not come under the true category of Socialism , because it did not recognise these three points . Even the " Christian Social Union " of the present day is not in its constitution socialistic , although some of its members may have embraced the tenets of collectivism . T ) r . Westcott , Bishop of Durham , in his " Social Aspects of Christianity , shows warm sympathy with socialist objects , with the elevation and increased comfort of the working classes , but he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the somewhat enigmatical title of a series of addresses by members of the Christian Social Union , strives to correct many of the blemishes in the present economy of labor , but does not advocate the distinctive principles of collectivism . It may be a question whether the members of this Union are not as well entitled to the name of socialists as the advocates of the three points ; and it is only as a matter of convenience that in this paper we restrict its application to those who claim , as a sine qud non , the nationalization of the whole instruments of production . Unfortunately it is impossible to deny that under th' present system many serious social evils are found . Nothing can be more uncomfortable than the disputes between capital and labor ; nothing more tragical than the strikes and lock-outs to which they often lead . And as to the condition of the lowest class of our people in London and other large towns , it is simply heart-breaking . It is a disgrace to civilization . All these evils collectivists ascribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world of labor , the system of " individual // ism , " and the ruinous competition which it involves . Their view is , that under the present system , labor is exploited for the sole benefit of the capitalist ; it is his aim to produce as cheaply as possible ; in order to do this the workman is robbed of his fair share of profit and the capitalist fattens on the spoil . The tendency of the system is to make the poor poor**r and the rich richer . Small industries are swallowed up by large ; all indepeudent ways of making a livelihood are cut off from the worker ; he must depend on the capitalist for the very right to live . It is a system that affords no prospect of improvement ; the process of the fat kine swallowing up the lean ( for Pharaoh 's dream is reversed ) must go on as long as there are lean kine to be swallowed , and at the completion of the process , what you will have will be , a few men rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mass " hewers of wood and drawers of water . " There is some truth , and also some exaggeration here . As a whole , it is not true that the skilled artisan class has become poorer of late years ; on the contrary that class is much better off . Any statistical statement of wages and prices makes this plain . And as for the unskilled and unemployed mass , whose conditions of life are so miserable , it should be remembered that it is characteristic of the large towns where they live , that the feeble of the race are not absorbed or borne up by the rest , but sink to the bottom . Moreover , whether it be cause or effect , it is to be noted that much of the helplessness of this class and much of their misery are due to drink . Any explanation of the misery of the east end of London and all our large towns that overlooks the influence of drin*k , is on the very face of it miserably and palpably defective . Still , our modern industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our manufactures is not flattering to human nature . In the early part of the century , when the practice began of employing large numbers of men , women and children in single manufactories or other industries , the abuses that arose were frightful . It is shocking to read of children toiling for fourteen or fifteen hours a day , and only kept awake by the lash of the foreman ; of women , even in a state of pregnancy , carrying heavy loads in pits , or working deep in water , or of children on all fours with a chain round their waist dragging trucks of coal along dark and dirty passages ; of injured spines and twisted // limbs , of wounds and bruises , premature old age and early deaths , all caused by the greed of men who did not scruple to wring their wealth out of the life blood of their workers . This was the first result of the system of free competition , of supply and demand , of laissez-faire , of buying in the cheapest and selling in the dearest market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused the indignation of men like Mr. Ruskin , whose de . nunciations of it have served in no slight degree to bring it to the bar of public opinion , and to swell the chorus of social condemnation . But , thanks to Lord Shaftesbury and other good men , many of these abuses are now swept away and others have been greatly modified . And , in the judgment cf many wise and benevolent men , the right course for the English nation is to persevere on these lines of improvement , in the hope that if equal progress be made in years to come as in the past , the condition of the working class will become sufficiently civilized and comfortable . But in this view socialists will not concur . They maintain that under any system of capitalism , in the hands of individuals , the object of the employer will be to give as little as possible of the profits of their labor to his workmen , and keep as much as possible to himself . The value of any product , socialists* say , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . To whom does this value rightfully belong but to the worker ? Unless the worker gets the full value of his work , he is robbed . No amendment of the present system will ever give the workman all that he is entitled to . Such a result will never take place till the whole instruments of production are public property , and labor is so organized that , after necessary deductions , each laborer shall receive the share which corresponds to the amount and quality of his labor . The threshing out of the principle here assumed , that the value of products is measured by the labor bestowed on them , has not proved very favorable to socialism . It is denied that labor is the only element that goes to constitute value . IDr . Flint , in his recent elaborate book on socialism , has shown well that mere labor creates nothing , any more than the moving of our hands and feet in space would create anything . Labor must receive from nature the materials on Which it works ; it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the machinery , often complicated and elaborate , that has been designed . // for its purposes ; and it must be turned to account by the discovery of customers who desire to purchase its products . It is one thing to maintain that labor is an essential element of value , and also that in the distribution of profits labor has not hitherto received its due share ; but it is another thing to represent it as the one element of value , and to make this the standard by which the just demands of the workmen are to be tried . Even Dr. Schilifie , in spite of his strong leaning to socialism , strongly contends that , in addition to the lalwr value of products , we must take into account what he calls their use value , the value that arises from the amount of demand there is for them . I may write an elaborate book that costs me a world of labor , but , useful though it may be , the demand for it may be almost nil . Under a socialistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my book be determined ? If by the amount of my labor , it * ill stand high ; if by the sale of the book , extremely low . What Dr. Schilifie maintains is that socialism has not grappled with this question , which , under any practical scheme , would be an extremely important one . We are not , therefore , entitled to assume , as so many socialists do , especially of the working class , that labor is what constitutes the sole or nearly sole value of products , or to maintain that the workman is robbed aye and until he obtain the full value of the product which his hands have fashioned . Land holds a foremost place among the means of production that must become public property under a valid socialistic economy . Naturally , the question arises , How is the land to be acquired by the nation ? Happily the idea of seizing it without compensation has no advocates among reasonable men . There are those who mutter that as the land was originally the property of the nation , but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of the laborer , who , as producer , ought to have the greater part of them , all landlords should be treated as robbers and compelled to disgorge their unrighteous mammon . But any such proposal would give too great a shock to the conscience of the nation to be seriously entertained . The nation recognizes the right of private property under arrangements that have come down from time immemorial , even supposing that centuries ago the first private proprietors acquired the property unjustly . And some of the most intelligent advocates of socialism hold that a landlord or a capitalist who should // be converted to socialism would be under no obligation , moral or legal , to throw up his property , so long as the present system pre .. vailed . Compensation , therefore , in some form , would be due to the landlord if his land were transferred to the state . But any such arrangement would be a poor one for the people , seeing that even under the present system the profits derived from land are so small , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under public management . As we say , a money compensation in these circumstances would make the arrangement as broad as it is long-perhaps broader . But , under a thorough system of socialism money would be abolished . There could therefore be no compensation in money . The compensation , according to Dr. Schulifie , both for land , capital and other instruments of production , would be in the form of perishable goods-in what is called labor-money , that is to say , in the form of orders on the department of distribution for such goods as they distributed , consisting of the common necessaries and a few of the luxuries of life . But the compensation would not yield a permanent income , nor would it allow the recipients to carry on any productive work that would make them independent . As Dr. Schiiffie remarks , even the fortune of a Rothschild could not long resist the process of dissipation that would soon set in ! Another proposed way of dealing with landed property is to increase taxation on it to such an extent that ultimately its whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would no longer care to keep what brought them nothing . This is the course advocated by Mr. Henry George , and by Morris and Bax in their work on Socialism ( 1893 ) , as it is also by the Rev. Stewart D ileadlam , editor of the Church of England Reformer . It is indeed strange that so mean a proposal should find respectable advocates . But it is hardly less strange that it should be entertained as a practicable scheme . How should such a taxation obtain the sanction of Parliament ? Unless , indeed , we should come to have a Parliament of red-hot socialists , the thing is out of the question ; and that is a prospect that does not seem very near ! Even the 26 per cent . tax proposed by the Financial Reform Association may be regarded as quite Utopian . That all property acquired by and for the nation must be reasonably compensated for is , therefore , coming to be admitted // generally in England , although voices against compensation may be heard occasionally . Compensation would take the sting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question on a footing on which it might be calmly discussed by honest and reasonable men . Other important concessions , as we must call them , have also been made . For instance , the introduction of socialism is no longer advocated in the form of a revolutionary mechanical measure , to supersede the present system as suddenly and as completely as the railways superseded the stage coach , or as the electric light takes the place of gas . It is admitted that any change must be a gradual one , and that the new system , instead of a mechanical creation , must be a vital growth . The law of evolution must apply to it . All permanent institutions , it is seen , follow this law , and anything affecting society must obey it . And then the question arises , How long time may the process demand ? Various answers have been given , ranging between fifty and five hundred years : for , as evolution generally works slowly , it is seen that this process must be slow . By this concession , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed at the prospect of a change which is to work slowly and gradually , like the subsidence of a beach losing a foot or two in a hundred years . It was the idea that socialism was to be brought in like the French Revolution that terrified people , the idea of " after me the deluge ; " the thought of Europe converted into an innumerable rnultitude of volcanoes , causing confusion and desolation on every side . And then , too , we find that the more reasonable socialists are more concerned to sow the seed of their principles and leaven society with their spirit , than to attempt the practical execution of their projects . This is clearly seen in Mr. Sidney Webb 's Socialism in England ( Second Edition , 1893 ) , one of the most reasonable expositions of the system which have lately appeared . In common with most socialists , he sees a great tendency to the adoption of socialist views and operations in the public policy of the nation . That is to say , we are continually increasing the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , the navy , are old socialist institutions ; but in recent times the carriage of letters , books , and parcels , the telegraph system , public education , life insurance ( through the post office ) , // granting annuities , remitting money , etc. , etc. , are socialist operations . Municipal socialism is even more active than national . All that concerns the heating , lighting , cleansing and repairing of the streets ; in many cases gas-works , water-works , tramways , galleries , gardens and baths have become public concerns . And , outside the nation and the municipality , individual ownership is in the course of being exchanged for joint-stock companies , hundreds and thousands of proprietors taking the place of one . The very men that denounce socialism , as Mr. Sidney Webb puts it , are unconsciously practising it . " The individualist town councilbr will walk aloug the municipal pavement , lit by municipal gas , and cleaned by municipal broom with municipal water , and seeing by the municipal clock in the municipal market that he is too early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard by the county lunatic asylum and municipal hospital , will use the national telegraph system and tell them not to walk through the municipal park , but to come by the municipal tramway , to meet him in the municipal reading-room , by the municipal art gallery , museum , and library , where he intends to consult some of the national publications in order to prepare his next speech in the municipal town hall , in favor of the nationalization of the canals and the increase of the government control over the railway system . " And yet he will denounce socialism as a dream ! Socialists believe that in these and in other ways , the public mind is becoming familiarized with the great idea-collectivism versus individualism . As the process goes on , they think that it will become ripe for the last and crowning step  --  the conversion of the whole instruments of production into the property of the State . By the time that the public mind is thus prepared , another operation , also favorable to socialism , will have been completed-the absorption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of individuals working at their own hand , for their own benefit . When this comes to pass socialists think we may slide into socialism as easily as the railway train , at the end of its journey , slides into the rail that brings it to the platform . So long as socialists work mainly on these two lines-exposing the evils of the present system , and indicating the reality and the benefit of socialist principles , so far as they are currently in // operation among us-it is possible that it will become more popular ; it may gather new recruits , and it may avoid the rough handling that the older and bolder socialism encountered . But it seems to us a great mistake to suppose that the forms of national or municipal socialism now in operation will really prepare the way for the final gulp . Before the whole instruments of production are nationalized many important and difficult questions have to be settled . In the first place , how are we to find a substitute for the motives that under the present system impel men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , how is a man to be induced to work as hard for the welfare of the community as he does for himself and his family ? It is sometimes said in reply to this , that selfishness and other evil propensities will pass away when the present temptations to the exercise of them are removed ; men will become generous and amiable when nothing is to be gained by greed and passion . lit were amusing , if it were not too serious for amusement , to mark the simplicity of mind with which this transformation of human nature in expected from a change of circumstances ! As if in all circumstances and under all systems , monarchy , republicanism , democracy , oligarchy , and amid all conditions of life , riches or poverty , ease or struggle , success or failure , the great features and failings of human nature had not always been , and would not always be , the same ! Nothing in all the speculations , whether of the socialists or the philosophers of the present day , is so surprising as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altruism " sufficient for their purposes ! In this connection , the contention of Mr. Benjamin Kidd , in his Social Evolution , demands our serious consideration . He maintains that all the altruism that has hitherto been *t work among men has been generated by religion , and religion alone . We may be excused for refusing to believe in an altruism that comes from a mere belief in the greatest good of the greatest number . The demon of selfishness is not so easy to exorcise . " Leviathan is not so tamed . " True , there is no necessary antagonism between socialism and religion . But more is needed than the absence of antagonism . If the true altruistic spirit is necessary for the success of socialism , it must come from the fountain of religion , and socialism must enter into close alliance with religion . " Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ? " // Another great question needing to be settled is the scale on which labor is to be rewarded . Our present system settles that question by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unified labor could be worked , definite rules must be agreed to regarding it . What difference is to be made in the same occupation between the work of the active , steady worker , and that of the slow , idle , good-for-nothing one ? And how is the value of work in different occupations to be settled ? And what about mental work , and other work that is not strictly productive ? And what if the work of some particular individual , say an author , is in infinite demand , and that of another hardly in demand at all ? Then again , it is a principle of socialism that the State is bound to provide work for all . But what if the State can not give a man the work he likes ? What if that department be already full ? He must just take such work as the State , or rather the officials that manage the department , can give him . All will be under State officials . Will this conduce to liberty ? If I can only get work that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , shall I be much better than now ? We know how much men will sacrifice for liberty ; and both our working men and our thinking men will pause before committing themselves to a system that may practically land the worker in slavery . Then the enormous army of State officials that would he called into being is another serious consideration . The national bookkeeping which ( if money were abolished ) would have to embrace a record of every transaction of buying and selling in every man 's life , is too gigantic to think of . And how would international commerce be arranged ? What kinds of goods , scheduled as productive , would be forbidden , and what , being non-productive , would be allowed ? Might one possess a carriage but not a wheelbarrow ? an organ , but not a sewing-machine ? Mr. Webb did not meddle with those questions when he was in America , and they are not discussed in his published book . It is wise policy to keep them in the background , and to bring forward the non-contentious points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because the public readily accept what is non-contentious , we are nearer a final solution of the real question . We have considered the prospects of socialism in England as the subject is presented to us by the more educated and cultured champions of the cause ; it may be well , before concluding , // to say a word on the attitude and expectations of the working classes . It is quite natural for them to feel keenly on the subject . It is natural to believe that their labor is too hard and their remuneration too small , and to feel that there is something far wrong when so many idle men live in ease and luxury , and so many hard toiling men have hardly the means of bare subsistence . It is natural to chafe at a foreign sovereign drawing ? 10,000 a year , or an ex-Speaker ? 4,000 a year from what they consider the profits of their toil . No class can feel the evils of the present system more than they do . And unless they have something of the wisdom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others that we know not of , " it is natural for them to have strong leanings to socialism . But when the shrewdest and steadiest of them try to see through the social system , and to consider how society would get along under it , it is no wonder they find themselves in a maze . It is the labor question , as it is called , that more immediately interests the working class , and though that question is very closely related to socialism , yet several of its issues do not depend on it . The length of the labor day , the living wage , the protection of the workman , education , old-age pensions , comfortable houses , allotments , crofts and the like , are all apart from the leading positions of socialism , and it is with these questions mainly that the working class are at present concerned . True , the I. L. P. ( Independent Labor Party ) has a socialistic basis , believing that socialism would be the complete solution of all that it aims at . But meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Labor question . But certainly the recent election to Parliament has done little to comfort either the socialists or the I. L. P. Keir Hardie is out and his proteges are not in . The verdict of the country has been given against too many organic changes , and in favor of working out for the present admitted pr'inciples that tend to the general good . And thus the answer we give to the question , Is socialism advancing in England ? is substantially this : Not in its radical principles ; net in its demand for organic change ; not in its claim to nationalize the whole instruments of production . As a new system , it may be picking up adherents here and there , intelligent // and patriotic men of sanguine temperament , like the members of the Fabian Society , who hop* that the difficulties in the way of its practical working may one day be overcome , though they may not see how . But as a real force in the country , gathering power as it goes , and only needing time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not advancing . In many ways , however , it is doing useful work ; it is calling attention to the condition of the worker and the obligation of society to give him a more comfortable life ; it is constraining the Christian churches to address themselves more to the improvement of the condition of the people ; it is compelling the legislature to give its deserved prominence to this subject ; and it is drawing out many men and women to use their influence and their lives for the welfare of those who spend their lives in daily toil . Dr. Flint has pointed out its faults : so far as it allies itself to atheism and materialism ; so far as it assumes that man 's chief end is a happy life on earth ; so far as it attaches more importance to the condition of men than to their character ; andso far as it does injustice to the rights of individuals . With these faults amended , so far as they exist , it may do still greater service ; and should it find its goal inaccessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for humanity than if it had been crowned with victory@@189066601.txt TWELVE years ago " An act to Regulate and Improve the Civil Service of the United States " became law . Since then this law has continued unchanged-neither enlarged by amendment nor diminished by repeal . This freedom from alteration may rightly be counted a tribute to the discretion of those who framed the statute and an evidence of their sound judgment . Certainly such stable existence is conclusive proof of the desire of the people that the plan thus formulated should have opportunity to demonstrate its usefulness . The United States Civil Service Commission was the agency created by the law of 1883 to put the machinery for improving the civil service in motion , and to it was also committed the guidance of this machinery in the subsequent regulation of the service . The duties of the three Commissioners constituting the Board are primarily " to aid the President as he may request " in preparing suitable rules for carrying the act into effect . The essential improvements sought to be accomplished under the act were three . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . This fairness to applicants is secured by the provision for appointment in the public service after " open , competitive examinations , " which " shall be practical in their character , and so far as may be shall relate to those matters which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined to discharge the duties of the service into which they seek to be appointed . " Fairness to all sections of the country is secured by the requirement that " appointments to the public service aforesaid in the departments at Washington shall be apportioned // among the several states , territories and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained at the last preceding census . " Obstruction by any person in the public service of the right of examination , or false marking thereof , is made a penal offence . Second : Liberty of action in political matters . This liberty is embodied in the declaration " that no person in said service has the right to use his official authority or influence to coerce the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office is the penalty provided by the rules for such coercion . Third : Freedom from involuntary political servitude and from political assessments . These are embodied in declaring " that no person in the public service is for that reason under any obligations to contribute to any political fund , or to render any political service , " and by providing penalty of fine and imprisonment of specified public officers or employees who shall be convicted of soliciting or receiving political contributions " from any person receiving any salary or compensation from moneys derived from the Treasury of the United States . " It is also a penal offense for any person to solicit or receive such contributions in any United States building , navy yard , fort , or arsenal ; or for any person in the service of the United States to give to any other person in the service of the United States any money on account of or to be applied to the promotion of any political object whatever . The scheme devised to accomplish these results is no longer in its infancy . Its value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system necessarily condemns practices opposed , it is needless to dwell , to tiresome iteration , upon " spoils , " " spoilsmen , " and " spoils system . " These and other similar words have become the cant of the discussion ; they retard rather than advance a present understanding of the broader phases of the subject . The system in operation is abundantly justified when demonstration is made that it leads in the direction of good government , apart from every other consideration based upon sentiment or moral speculation . And every intelligent advocate of the improvement and regulation of the civil service will be firm in his insistence that the chief argument must be upon this line . To-day under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission are 56,000 positions , comprising what is properly known as the // classified civil service of the United States . While the number of these positions increases constantly and automatically by reason of the natural increase in the number of Government employees , yet the greater additions to the 14,000 originally classified by President Arthur have been made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24,000 positions thus specially added . The most recent notable inclusion is that of about 3,000 positions in the office of the Public Printer made by the President in August , 1895 . The magnitude of the classified civil service as above defined may perhaps be best realized in the light of the fact that there is an expenditure of $50,000,000 every year to pay the salaries of the places comprised therein . It is a great advance in the just administration of public affairs when a practical system has been devised by which substantially 55,000 government places are opened to all our people through the door of ascertained merit . It appears as a still greater advance when it is realized that this army of 55,000 intelligent citizens , most of them voters , can not be used in the future either to bolster up a waning political creed nor be made a barrier to any demanded reform . And , greatest advance of all , in its bearing upon the integrity of a representative government , is the fact that no part of this total compensation can be legitimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these salaries be used by unscrupulous men to secure personal political work from public servants , whose wages are paid by all the people . The accomplishment of these things indisputably tends in the direction of better government . The civil service law itself was the first efficient statutory movement in the improvement of the civil service ; but , this beginning having been made , the improvement is now proceeding upon even broader lines than those laid down in the law . Other steps have been taken outside the law of far-reaching and beneficial importance , and these deserve attentive consideration . It is of preliminary interest to note that under section 1753 of the Revised Statutes , passed March 3 , 1871 , a complete merit system of civil service could be carried out except in the matter of offences declared penal . This section provides as follows : " Sec. 1753 . The President is authorized to prescribe such regulations for the admission of persons into the civil service of the United S1*ates as // 605 may best promote the efficiency thereof , and ascertain the fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , knowledge and ability for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter ; and for this purpose he may employ suitable persons to conduct such inquiries , and may prescribe their duties , and establish regulations for the conduct of persons who may receive appointments in the civil service . " Acting presumably under the latter part of this section , the President , in July , 1886 , issued executive instructions addressed " To the heads of all Departments in the service of the General Government . " In the course of these instructions the President said : " Office-holders are the agents of the people , not their masters . Not only is their time and labor due to the Government , but they should scrupulously avoid in their political action , as well as in the discharge of their official duty , offending , by display of obtrusive partizanship , their neighbors who have relations with them as public officials . " They should also constantly remember that their party friends , from whom they have received preferment , have not invested them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no right as officeholders to dictate the political action of their party associates , or to throttle freedom of action within party lines by methods and practices which pervert every useful and justifiable purpose of party organization . " Individual interest and activity in political affairs are by no means condemned . Office-holders are neither disfranchised nor forbidden the exercise of political privileges ; but their privileges are not enlarged nor is their duty to party increased to pernicious activity by office-holding . " A just discrimination in this regard between the things a citizen may properly do and the purposes for which a public office should not be used is easy in the light of a correct appreciation of the relation between the people and those entrusted with official place , and a consideration of the necessity , under our form of government , of political action free from official coercion . The issue of this letter was the second important progression in the improvement and regulation of the civil service . These established regulations for the conduct of persons receiving appointments in the civil service have been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1883 . They were subsequently included in general terms in the Postal Laws and Regulations , as follows : " Officeholders must not use their official positions to control political movements . They should not offend by obtrusive partizanship , nor should they assume the active conduct of political campaigns . A postmaster is not forbidden to exercise any political privilege , but should make proper discrimination between what ought and what ought not to be done byn public officer . He serves all the people , who are entitled to attention , civility , and assistance . No postmaster in whom the Government has , by virtue of his // appointment , reposed trust and confidence should find difficulty in deciding as to the proper course to be pursued in the premises . This is in consonance with the order of President Cleveland of July 14 , 1886 . " This postal rule was confirmed by the succeeding administration in the February , 1893 , edition of Postal Rules and Regulations , and the letter of President Cleveland was specifically republished as an order of the Postmaster-General in May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Postmaster-General of the important rule that : " No carrier shall be removed except for cause , upon written charges filed with the Post Office Department , and of which the carrier shall have full notice and an opportunity to make defense . " This was a third admirable and far-reaching step beyond the requirements of the act of 1883 . In this relation the opinion of the present Postmaster-General , as expressed in an address delivered before the National Convention of Letter Carriers at Philadelphia in September last , is specially pertinent . He said : " No one rejoices more than I do , both on principle and on the lower plane of selfi9h convenience , that every free delivery post-office in the country is now under ci vil service rules ; that the gateway to employment therein is no longer partizan influence , but the free and open road of personal merit , and that the tenure of that employment no longer depends upon anything else than individual merit and individual fidelity . " A fourth step was one upon which highest commendation should be bestowed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal . This was the order by the Secretary of the Navy in April , 1891 , requiring that demonstrated capacity of the workmen , without regard to political belief or influence , should be the controlling factor in the employment of laborers in the navy yards . The system then established for navy yards has continued in successful operation ever since . A final advance , entering into an entirely new field , is the President 's recent order providing for the application of the merit principle , as ascertained by formulated examinations , to certain grades of our consular service . The uniform approval which the public press has accorded this latest progress is gratifying evidence of the widespread appreciation by the whole people of the benefits they are receiving from executive acts of this character . These things already have been done . Incidentally , something concerning the future is of interest . The time now ap // proaches when the inclusion of several thousand minor post-offices within some form of the merit system is seen to be a possibility . Public opinion would assuredly approve this inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as undoubtedly increasing the efficiency of an extremely important branch of government work . And the application of certain featnres of the merit system to laborers in navy yards having demonstrated its practicability , it is probable that some wide extension of the plan so as to include all government laborers will speedily be devised . The time also seems ripe for the general formulation and enforcement of rules to govern promotions . This regulation of promotions was an essential element of the scheme as originally conceived and enacted , and it is a feature which deserves more effective consideration than it has heretofore received . A new function which enables the Civil Service Commission to greatly increase its nsefulness has recently developed . This function is that of consultation by various State and city authorities . Municipal boards of New York and Chicago and the Commissioners of the District of Columbia have thus received from the Commission at Washington much valuable assistance in inaugnrating local merit systems . While it is assumed that the methods are well known by which the work of the United States Commission is accomplished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject now under consideration to recall some special features of their pro . cedure . The Commission consists of three persons appointed by the President , not more than two of whom can be adherents of the same political party . This Commission meets daily as a Board . By this Board all questions for examinations are passed upon , the places and dates of examinations throughout the United States are fixed , appeals from markings are adjudged , claims for preference on account of military service are determined , requests for reinstatement in the civil service are considered , and all allegations of political discrimination and charges of illegal political assessment are investigated . Upon the request of the President the Commission formulates rules for carrying the Civil Service law into effect , which rules , upon approval by the President , are filed with the Secretary of State , and have in many respects the effect of law . These rules , however , are subject to change at the will of the President . It is by this possi // bility of change in the scope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural automatic increment , have been made . This provision , by which the jurisdiction of the law is extended to new departments without amendment of the law being necessary , is one of several admirable fiexibilities of the act of 1883 . Regular examinations of applicants for appointment are held at least twice a year at convenient places in practically every State and Territory , and many times a year at Washington . Schedules of such examinations are widely distributed , bulletins are posted in various United States buildings throughout the country , and notice is published in the newspapers of each locality . Special supplementary examinations are held wh enever the needs of the public service require . The endeavor is to make the questions most practical , and all departments are continually invited to offer suggestions as to the character and scope of the questions . Recently the Commission has inaugurated the plan of also asking suggestions from merchants and other private employers of large clerical forces . It has always been recognized that no examination can be devised which will infallibly indicate the capacity to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an examination and has been selected for appointment , t is required that he should serve a probation period of six months before the appointment can become absolute . No matter how high an applicant may have stood in examination , if , at the end of six months , his conduct is not satisfactory and his capacity is not demonstrated to the appointing power , he shall be notified that he will not receive absolute appointment , and this notification discharges him from the service . He can not take another examination until one year has elapsed after such discharge . It is , however , excell*nt testimony to the character of the examinations that dismissals at the end of a probationary period are practically unknown . On the other hand , the authority and duty of removal for any delinquency or incapacity before or after the expiration of the probation period are left undisturbed by the civil service act and rules . Many local examinations are conducted by boards , the members of which are under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission for such purposes , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices throughout the country . All examination papers , however , are now marked at Washington , and the standing of the applicant is fixed by the Central Board of Examiners there . This board is made up from the permanent clerical force of the Commission . Until standing is determined , the applicant is known only by the number . appearing on his examination papers . His name , residence , and other information concerning him , are contained on a separate sheet , which does not come before those who mark the examination papers . The Commission is authorized , but not directed , to make investigations as to the execution of the civil service act . It has no power to administer oaths in such investigations ; and the limited authority conferred appears to have been with the wise purpose that the attention of the Commission should be chiefly concentrated in the direction of securing good material for positions rather than in exercising a supervisory power over the internal administration of public offices generally . The law does not declare or in any way intimate that the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same obligation as other citizens to bring to the attention of the proper prosecuting officer any violation of law of which it has evidence . Unfortunately , however , the impression seems to have been created in some directions that it is in the nature of a detective bureau organized to discover violations of the law and to ascertain why dismissals are made , having powers somewhat similar to the Secret Service of the Treasury or the inspectors of the Post-Office Department . The usefulness of the Commission in its proper sphere has been hampered by this impression . If it were generally felt that the responsibility rests not upon the Commission but upon the citizens in the several localities to inaugurate prosecutions for violations of the civil service law much greater good would be accomplished . The punishment imposed for vioiation of certain clvii service rules is dismissal from office , but this dismissal rests as a rule with the President , or the Cabinet officer , or other official who is the head of the department concerned . The Civil Service Commission is not in any sense a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reinstate any government employee except within its own force at Washington . The work actually committed to the Commission makes greatest progress in proceeding // 610 upon the assumption that leading public officials to-day are generally desirous of securing the best public service , and are endeavoring to administer their offices in exact accord with civil service , as well as all other , laws . Questions as to what political contributions are permitted , and as to what degree of political activity is allowed by the civil service act , naturally arise as elections approach . The condemnation of involuntary political service and involuntary political contributions has been previously discussed . Voluntary political service not partizan and not interfering with the public duties of persons in the service of the Government , is evidently contemplated by the act , and voluntary political contributions from public employees are countenanced . Section 13 of the act makes it a penal offence to discriminate , or promise or threaten to do so , against any employee because of his " giving any contribution of money or other valuable thing for any political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual so to contribute is needed , but it is of interest to note that this section of the civil service act clearly recognizes as allowable the making of such voluntary contributions for political purposes . As to political activity , the most recent utterances of the Commission indicating its opinion are as follows : " Those who enter the classified service upon the ground of ascertained merit as established by the civil service rules , and are protected therein , should be quick to recognize the reciprocal obligation thereby imposed , and avoid any action which now or at any future time could reasonably be subject to adverse political criticism . " In the case of charges of improper partizan activity made against an employee of the internal revenue service , who is a member of local Board of Civil Service Examiners , the Commission said : " While attendance at a political convention as a delegate is not in itself a violation of the civil service rules , the Commission holds that partizan activity sufficient to impair usefulness as a representative of the Civil Service Commission is sufficient cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiners . " In conclusion , the civil service law has shown in practice the openness of its methods , its fairness to all sections , and its adaptability to the public service . When selections were made through political pressure the work was done in a corner , the distribution of places was for the advantage of the few , and ap // pointments were without adequate consideration of the public need . Undoubtedly the civil service law has done many things in betterment of the public service . Undoubtedly it will do much more in the future . But just as undoubtedly it sometimes prevents the appointment of the person best qualified for the work that is to be done ; for under the rules the appointing power must make his selection from the three names certified to him by the Commission . Nevertheless , the competitive merit system is a vast and unmistakable improvement over the former method of selection by political or other influence , and the total results of the civil service act tend unquestionably and strongly toward better government . But there are advances yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits to which they are entitled . Therefore it is well at this time to give consideration to a principle of the law which is outside of and beyond the penal provisions heretofore discussed . This principle is the intimate relation of the President to the betterment of even the subordinate public service of the United States . Such relation is fully realized only when thoughtful analysis is made of the special act by virtue of which so much has been accomplished . The President appoints the Commissioners " by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , " and " the President may remove any Commissioner . " The President , " as he may request , " has the aid of the Commission " in preparing suitable rules for carrying this act into effect , " and the Commission regulates examinations " subject to the rules that may be made by the President . " In brief , the affirmation of the President is the strength of the system . Such analysis makes clear where honor largely lies for the past . And what of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the next President also shall be a man who will take no step backward , but will compel a continuous and aggressive advance in the application of the merit principle.
