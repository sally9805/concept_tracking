I found in them , in earlier years , rest from toil and drudgery and , later , relief from physical suffering . Broken by over-work and compelled to abandon the practice of my profession -- the law , I wrote Pauline after I had been given up to die by my physicians . It proved to be a better ' medicine ' for me than all the quackeries of the quacks . It diverted my mind from myself and , perhaps , saved my life . When published , its reception by the best journals of this country and England was so flattering and , at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been induced to carefully revise the poem and to publish my re-touched Pauline in this volume . I hope and believe I have greatly improved it . Several of the minor poems have been published heretofore in journals and magazines ; others of equal or greater age flap their wings herein for the first time ; a few peeped from the shell but yesterday . I am aware that this volume contains several poems that a certain class of critics will condemn , but they are my " chicks " and I will gather them under my wings . " None but an author knows an author 's cares , Or Fancy 's fondness for the child she bears . "  - -  Cowper . Much of my life has been spent in the Northwest -- on the frontier of civilization , and I became personally acquainted with many of the chiefs and braves of the Dakota and Ojibway ( Chippewa ) Indians . I have written of them largely from my own personal knowledge , and endeavored , above all things , to be accurate , and to present them true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to the study of the language , history , traditions , customs and superstitions of the Dakotas . These Indians are now commonly called the " Sioux "  - -  a name given them by the early French traders and voyageurs . " Dakota " signifies alliance or confederation . Many separate bands , all having a common origin and speaking a common tongue , were united under this name . See " Tah-Koo Wah-Kan , " or " The Gospel Among the Dakotas , " by Stephen R. Riggs , pp. 1 to 6 inc . They were but yesterday the occupants and owners of the fair forests and fertile prairies of Minnesota -- a brave , hospitable and generous people -- barbarians , indeed , but noble in their barbarism . They may be fitly called the Iroquois of the West . In form and features , in language and traditions , they are distinct from all other Indian tribes . When first visited by white men , and for many years afterwards , the Falls of St. Anthony ( by them called the Ha Ha ) was the center of their country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beaver and the bison . They were open-hearted , truthful and brave . In their wars with other tribes they seldom slew women or children , and rarely sacrificed the lives of their prisoners . For many years their chiefs and head men successfully resisted the attempts to introduce spirituous liquors among them . More than a century ago an English trader was killed at Mendota , near the present city of St. Paul , because he persisted , after repeated warnings by the chiefs , in dealing out mini wakan ( Devil-water ) to the Dakota braves . With open arms and generous hospitality they welcomed the first white men to their land , and were ever faithful in their friendship , till years of wrong and robbery , and want and insult , drove them to desperation and to war . They were barbarians , and their warfare was barbarous , but not more barbarous than the warfare of our Saxon , Celtic and Norman ancestors . They were ignorant and superstitious . Their condition closely resembled the condition of our British forefathers at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her inhabitants , when first they became known to the Tyrian mariners , were little superior to the natives of the Sandwich Islands . " And again : " While the German princes who reigned at Paris , Toledo , Aries and Ravenna listened with reverence to the instructions of bishops , adored the relics of martyrs , and took part eagerly in disputes touching the Nicene theology , the rulers of Wessex and Mercia were still performing savage rites in the temples of Thor and Woden . " The days of the Dakotas are done . The degenerate remnants of that once powerful and warlike people still linger around the forts and agencies of the Northwest , or chase the caribou and the elk on the banks of the Saskatchewan , but the Dakotas of old are no more . The brilliant defeat of Custer , by Sitting Bull and his braves , was their last grand rally against the resistless march of the sons of the Saxons . The plow-shares of a superior race are fast leveling the sacred mounds of their dead . But yesterday , the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teepees , their light canoes glided over our waters , and their hunters chased the deer and the buffalo on the sites of our cities . To-day , they are not . Let us do justice to their memory , for there was much that was noble in their natures . In the Dakota Legends , I have endeavored to faithfully present many of the customs and superstitions , and some of the traditions , of that people . I have taken very little ' poetic license ' with their traditions ; none , whatever , with their customs and superstitions . In my studies for these Legends I was greatly aided by the Rev. S.R. Riggs , author of the " Grammar and Dictionary of the Dakota Language " " Tah-Koo Wah-Kan , " &c.,; and for many years a missionary among the Dakotas . He patiently answered my numerous inquiries and gave me valuable information . I am also indebted to the late Gen. H.H. Sibley , one of the earliest American traders among them , and to Rev. S.W. Pond , of Shakopee , one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poetical versions of some of their principal legends ; to Mrs. Eastman 's " Dacotah , " and last , but not least , to the Rev. E.D. Neill , whose admirable " History of Minnesota " so fully and faithfully presents almost all that is known of the history , traditions , customs , manners and superstitions of the Dakotas . In Winona I have " tried my hand " on a new hexameter verse . With what success , I leave to those who are better able to judge than I. If I have failed , I have but added another failure to the numerous attempts to naturalize hexameter verse in the English language . It will be observed that I have slightly changed the length and the rhythm of the old hexameter line ; but it is still hexameter , and , I think , improved . I have not written for profit nor published for fame . Fame is a coy goddess that rarely bestows her favors on him who seeks her -- a phantom that many pursue and but few overtake . She delights to hover for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dead men who know not and care not : to the living she is a veritable Ignis Fatuus . But every man owes something to his fellowmen , and I owe much . If my friends find half the pleasure in reading these poems that I have found in writing them , I shall have paid my debt and achieved success . H.L. GORDON . Minneapolis , November 1 , 1891 . PRELUDE THE MISSISSIPPI The numerals refer to Notes in appendix . Onward rolls the Royal River , proudly sweeping to the sea , Dark and deep and grand , forever wrapt in myth and mystery . Lo he laughs along the highlands , leaping o'er the granite walls ; Lo he sleeps among the islands , where the loon her lover calls . Still like some huge monster winding downward through the prairied plains , Seeking rest but never finding , till the tropic gulf he gains . In his mighty arms he claspeth now an empire broad and grand ; In his left hand lo he graspeth leagues of fen and forest land ; In his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand foaming fountains singing seek the plains below . Fields of corn and feet of cities lo the mighty river laves , Where the Saxon sings his ditties o'er the swarthy warriors ' graves . Aye , before the birth of Moses -- ere the Pyramids were piled --  All his banks were red with roses from the sea to nor'lands wild , And from forest , fen and meadows , in the deserts of the north , Elk and bison stalked like shadows , and the tawny tribes came forth ; Deeds of death and deeds of daring on his leafy banks were done , Women loved and men went warring , ere the siege of Troy begun . Where his foaming waters thundered , roaring o'er the rocky walls , Dusky hunters sat and wondered , listening to the spirits ' calls . " Ha-ha ! " 76 cried the warrior greeting from afar the cataract 's roar ; " Ha-ha ! " rolled the answer beating down the rock-ribbed leagues of shore . Now , alas , the bow and quiver and the dusky braves have fled , And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the war-whoop rose , and after women wailed their warriors slain , List the Saxon 's silvery laughter , and his humming hives of gain . Swiftly sped the tawny runner o'er the pathless prairies then , Now the iron-reindeer sooner carries weal or woe to men . On thy bosom , Royal River , silent sped the birch canoe Bearing brave with bow and quiver on his way to war or woo ; Now with flaunting flags and streamers -- mighty monsters of the deep --  Lo the puffing , panting steamers through thy foaming waters sweep ; And behold the grain-fields golden , where the bison grazed of eld ; See the fanes of forests olden by the ruthless Saxon felled . Plumed pines that spread their shadows ere Columbus spread his sails , Firs that fringed the mossy meadows ere the Mayflower braved the gales , Iron oaks that nourished bruin while the Vikings roamed the main , Crashing fall in broken ruin for the greedy marts of gain . Still forever and forever rolls the restless river on , Slumbering oft but ceasing never while the circling centuries run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair the brooklets hide , Grasped within his thousand fingers lies a continent fair and wide --  Yea , a mighty empire swarming with its millions like the bees , Delving , drudging , striving , storming , all their lives , for golden ease . Still , methinks , the dusky shadows of the days that are no more , Stalk around the lakes and meadows , haunting oft the wonted shore : Hunters from the land of spirits seek the bison and the deer Where the Saxon now inherits golden field and silver mere ; And beside the mound where buried lies the dark-eyed maid he loves , Some tall warrior , wan and wearied , in the misty moonlight moves . See -- he stands erect and lingers -- stoic still , but loth to go --  Clutching in his tawny fingers feathered shaft and polished bow . Never wail or moan he utters and no tear is on his face , But a warrior 's curse he mutters on the crafty Saxon race . O thou dark , mysterious River , speak and tell thy tales to me ; Seal not up thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lowly listen at the phantom-haunted falls Where thy waters foam and glisten o'er the rugged , rocky walls , Till some spirit of the olden , mystic , weird , romantic days Shall emerge and pour her golden tales and legends through my lays . Then again the elk and bison on thy grassy banks shall feed , And along the low horizon shall the plumed hunter speed ; Then again on lake and river shall the silent birch canoe Bear the brave with bow and quiver on his way to war or woo : Then the beaver on the meadow shall rebuild his broken wall , And the wolf shall chase his shadow and his mate the panther call . From the prairies and the regions where the pine-plumed forest grows Shall arise the tawny legions with their lances and their bows ; And again the cries of battle shall resound along the plain , Bows shall twang and quivers rattle , women wail their warriors slain ; And by lodge-fire lowly burning shall the mother from afar List her warrior 's steps returning from the daring deeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE VIRGINS1 A LEGEND OF THE DAKOTAS In pronouncing Dakota words give " a " the sound of " ah " ,  --  " e " the sound of " a " ,  --  " i " the sound of " e " and " u " the sound of " oo ; " sound " ee " as in English . The numerals refer to Notes in appendix . THE GAME OF BALL2 Clear was the sky as a silver shield ; The bright sun blazed on the frozen field . On ice-bound river and white-robed prairie The diamonds gleamed in the flame of noon ; But cold and keen were the breezes airy Wa-zi-ya3 blew from his icy throne . On the solid ice of the silent river The bounds are marked , and a splendid prize , A robe of black-fox lined with beaver , Is hung in view of the eager eyes ; And fifty merry Dakota maidens , The fairest-molded of womankind Are gathered in groups on the level ice . They look on the robe and its beauty gladdens And maddens their hearts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair That floats at will on the wanton wind , And the round , brown arms to the breezes bare , And breasts like the mounds where the waters meet , 4 And feet as fleet as the red deer 's feet , And faces that glow like the full , round moon When she laughs in the luminous skies of June . The leaders are chosen and swiftly divide The opposing parties on either side . Wiwaste5 is chief of a nimble band , The star-eyed daughter of Little Crow ; 6 And the leader chosen to hold command Of the band adverse is a haughty foe --  The dusky , impetuous Harpstina , 7 The queenly cousin of Wapasa. 8 Kapoza 's chief and his tawny hunters Are gathered to witness the queenly game . The ball is thrown and a net encounters , And away it flies with a loud acclaim . Swift are the maidens that follow after , And swiftly it flies for the farther bound ; And long and loud are the peals of laughter , As some fair runner is flung to ground ; While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maidens contend on the trampled snow . With loud " Iho !  - -  Ito !  - -  Iho ! " 9 And waving the beautiful prize anon , The dusky warriors cheer them on . And often the limits are almost passed , As the swift ball flies and returns . At last It leaps the line at a single bound From the fair Wiwaste 's sturdy arm Like a fawn that flies from the baying hound . The wild cheers broke like a thunder storm On the beetling bluffs and the hills profound , An echoing , jubilant sea of sound . Wakawa , the chief , and the loud acclaim Announced the end of the hard-won game , And the fair Wiwaste was victor crowned . Dark was the visage of Harpstina When the robe was laid at her rival 's feet , And merry maidens and warriors saw Her flashing eyes and her look of hate , As she turned to Wakawa , the chief , and said : " The game was mine were it fairly played . I was stunned by a blow on my bended head , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fling from Wiwaste 's bound . The cheat -- behold her ! for there she stands With the prize that is mine in her treacherous hands . The fawn may fly , but the wolf is fleet ; The fox creeps sly on Maga's10 retreat , And a woman 's revenge -- it is swift and sweet . " She turned to her lodge , but a roar of laughter And merry mockery followed after . Little they heeded the words she said , Little they cared for her haughty tread , For maidens and warriors and chieftain knew That her lips were false and her charge untrue . Wiwaste , the fairest Dakota maiden , The sweet-faced daughter of Little Crow , To her teepee11 turned with her trophy laden , The black robe trailing the virgin snow . Beloved was she by her princely father , Beloved was she by the young and old , By merry maidens and many a mother , And many a warrior bronzed and bold . For her face was as fair as a beautiful dream , And her voice like the song of the mountain stream ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam Through the somber pines of the nor'land wold , When the winds of winter are keen and cold . Mah-pi-ya Du-ta12 , the tall Red Cloud , A hunter swift and a warrior proud , With many a scar and many a feather , Was a suitor bold and a lover fond . Long had he courted Wiwaste 's father , Long had he sued for the maiden 's hand . Aye , brave and proud was the tall Red Cloud , A peerless son of a giant race , And the eyes of the panther were set in his face : He strode like a stag , and he stood like a pine ; Ten feathers he wore of the great Wanmdee ; 13 With crimsoned quills of the porcupine His leggins were worked to his brawny knee . The bow he bent was a giant 's bow ; The swift , red elk could he overtake , And the necklace that girdled his brawny neck Was the polished claws of the great Mato14 He grappled and slew in the northern snow . Wiwaste looked on the warrior tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But the eyes of the panther she could but hate , And a brave Hohe15 loved she better than all . Loved was Mahpiya by Harpstina But the warrior she never could charm or draw ; And bitter indeed was her secret hate For the maiden she reckoned so fortunate . HEYOKA WACIPEE16 THE GIANT 'S DANCE . The night-sun17 sails in his gold canoe , The spirits18 walk in the realms of air With their glowing faces and flaming hair , And the shrill , chill winds o'er the prairies blow . In the Tee19 of the Council the Virgins light The Virgin-fire20 for the feast to-night ; For the Sons of Heyoka will celebrate The sacred dance to the giant great . The kettle boils on the blazing fire , And the flesh is done to the chief 's desire . With his stoic face to the sacred East , 21 He takes his seat at the Giant 's Feast . For the feast of Heyoka22 the braves are dressed With crowns from the bark of the white-birch trees , And new skin leggins that reach the knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And eagle-plumes in their coal-black hair , And marvelous rings in their tawny ears That were pierced with the points of their shining spears . To honor Heyoka Wakawa lifts His fuming pipe from the Red-stone Quarry. 23 The warriors follow . The white cloud drifts From the Council-lodge to the welkin starry , Like a fog at morn on the fir-clad hill , When the meadows are damp and the winds are still . They dance to the tune of their wild " Ha-ha " A warrior 's shout and a raven 's caw --  Circling the pot and the blazing fire To the tom-tom 's bray and the rude bassoon ; Round and round to their heart 's desire , And ever the same wild chant and tune --  A warrior 's shout and a raven 's caw --  " Ha-ha ,  - -  ha- ha ,  - -  ha- ha , ha ! " They crouch , they leap , and their burning eyes Flash fierce in the light of the flaming fire , As fiercer and fiercer and higher and higher The rude , wild notes of their chant arise . They cease , they sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes , And upward curls from their swarthy lips To the god whose favor their hearts invoke . Then tall Wakawa arose and said : " Brave warriors , listen , and give due heed . Great is Heyoka , the magical god ; He can walk on the air ; he can float on the flood . He 's a worker of magic and wonderful wise ; He cries when he laughs and he laughs when he cries ; He sweats when he 's cold , and he shivers when hot , And the water is cold in his boiling pot . He hides in the earth and he walks in disguise , But he loves the brave and their sacrifice . We are sons of Heyoka . The Giant commands In the boiling water to thrust our hands ; And the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire Heyoka will crown with his heart 's desire . " They thrust their hands in the boiling pot ; They swallow the bison-meat steaming hot ; Not a wince on their stoical faces bold , For the meat and the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heyoka and wonderful wise ; He floats on the flood and he walks on the skies , And ever appears in a strange disguise ; But he loves the brave and their sacrifice , And the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire Heyoka will crown with his heart 's desire . Proud was the chief of his warriors proud , The sinewy sons of the Giant 's race ; But the bravest of all was the tall Red Cloud ; The eyes of the panther were set in his face ; He strode like a stag and he stood like a pine ; Ten feathers he wore of the great Wanmdee , 13 With crimsoned quills of the porcupine His leggins were worked to his brawny knee . Blood-red were the stripes on his swarthy cheek , And the necklace that girdled his brawny neck Was the polished claws of the great Mato14 He grappled and slew in the northern snow . Proud Red Cloud turned to the braves and said , As he shook the plumes on his haughty head : " Ho ! the warrior that scorneth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire ! " He snatched from the embers a red-hot brand , And held it aloft in his naked hand . He stood like a statue in bronze or stone --  Not a muscle moved , and the braves looked on . He turned to the chieftain --  " I scorn the fire --  Ten feathers I wear of the great Wanmdee ; Then grant me , Wakawa , my heart 's desire ; Let the sunlight shine in my lonely tee. 19 I laugh at red death and I laugh at red fire ; Brave Red Cloud is only afraid of fear ; But Wiwaste is fair to his heart and dear ; Then grant him , Wakawa , his heart 's desire . " The warriors applauded with loud " Ho ! Ho ! " 24 And he flung the brand to the drifting snow . Three times Wakawa puffed forth the smoke From his silent lips ; then he slowly spoke : " Mahpiya is strong as the stout-armed oak That stands on the bluff by the windy plain , And laughs at the roar of the hurricane . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow and deadly stroke My heart is swift but my tongue is slow . Let the warrior come to my lodge and smoke ; He may bring the gifts ; 25 but the timid doe May fly from the hunter and say him no . " Wiwaste sat late in the lodge alone , Her dark eyes bent on the glowing fire : She heard not the wild winds shrill and moan ; She heard not the tall elms toss and groan ; Her face was lit like the harvest moon ; For her thoughts flew far to her heart 's desire . Far away in the land of the Hohe15 dwelt The warrior she held in her secret heart ; But little he dreamed of the pain she felt , For she hid her love with a maiden 's art . Not a tear she shed , not a word she said , When the brave young chief from the lodge departed ; But she sat on the mound when the day was dead , And gazed at the full moon mellow-hearted . Fair was the chief as the morning-star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But his heart was stouter than lance or bow ; And her young heart flew to her love afar O'er his trail long covered with drifted snow . She heard a warrior 's stealthy tread , And the tall Wakawa appeared , and said : " Is Wiwaste afraid of the spirit dread That fires the sky in the fatal north ? 26 Behold the mysterious lights . Come forth : Some evil threatens , some danger nears , For the skies are pierced by the burning spears . " The warriors rally beneath the moon ; They shoot their shafts at the evil spirit . The spirit is slain and the flame is gone , But his blood lies red on the snow-fields near it ; And again from the dead will the spirit rise , And flash his spears in the northern skies . Then the chief and the queenly Wiwaste stood Alone in the moon-lit solitude , And she was silent and he was grave . " And fears not my daughter the evil spirit ? The strongest warriors and bravest fear it . The burning spears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wicked woman , Or a treacherous foe ; but my warriors brave , When danger nears , or the foe appears , Are a cloud of arrows -- a grove of spears . " " My Father , " she said , and her words were low , " Why should I fear ? for I soon will go To the broad , blue lodge in the Spirit-land , Where my fond-eyed mother went long ago , And my dear twin-sisters walk hand in hand . My Father , listen -- my words are true , " And sad was her voice as the whippowil When she mourns her mate by the moon-lit rill , " Wiwaste lingers alone with you ; The rest are sleeping on yonder hill --  Save one -- and he an undutiful son --  And you , my Father , will sit alone When Sisoka27 sings and the snow is gone . I sat , when the maple leaves were red , By the foaming falls of the haunted river ; The night-sun was walking above my head , And the arrows shone in his burnished quiver ; And the winds were hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent dead . I heard the voice of the Water-Fairy ; 28 I saw her form in the moon-lit mist , As she sat on a stone with her burden weary , By the foaming eddies of amethyst . And robed in her mantle of mist the sprite Her low wail poured on the silent night . Then the spirit spake , and the floods were still --  They hushed and listened to what she said , And hushed was the plaint of the whippowil In the silver-birches above her head : ' Wiwaste , the prairies are green and fair When the robin sings and the whippowil ; But the land of the Spirits is fairer still , For the winds of winter blow never there ; And forever the songs of the whippowils And the robins are heard on the leafy hills . Thy mother looks from her lodge above --  Her fair face shines in the sky afar , And the eyes of thy sisters are bright with love , As they peep from the tee of the mother-star . To her happy lodge in the Spirit land She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , her words were true ; And the death of Wiwaste will rest on you . You have pledged me as wife to the tall Red Cloud ; You will take the gifts of the warrior proud ; But I , Wakawa ,  - -  I answer -- never ! I will stain your knife in my heart 's red blood , I will plunge and sink in the sullen river Ere I will be wife to the dark Red Cloud ! " " Wiwaste , " he said , and his voice was low , " Let it be as you will , for Wakawa 's tongue Has spoken no promise ; his lips are slow , And the love of a father is deep and strong . Be happy , Micunksee ; 29 the flames are gone --  They flash no more in the northern sky . See the smile on the face of the watching moon ; No more will the fatal , red arrows fly ; For the singing shafts of my warriors sped To the bad spirit 's bosom and laid him dead , And his blood on the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you won to-day , And dream of your hunter -- the brave Chaske . " Light was her heart as she turned away ; It sang like the lark in the skies of May . The round moon laughed , but a lone , red star , 30 As she turned to the teepee and entered in , Fell flashing and swift in the sky afar , Like the polished point of a javelin . Nor chief nor daughter the shadow saw Of the crouching listener , Harpstina . Wiwaste , wrapped in her robe and sleep , Heard not the storm-sprites wail and weep , As they rode on the winds in the frosty air ; But she heard the voice of her hunter fair ; For a fairy spirit with silent fingers The curtains drew from the land of dreams ; And lo in her teepee her lover lingers ; In his tender eyes all the love-light beams , And his voice is the music of mountain streams . And then with her round , brown arms she pressed His phantom form to her throbbing breast , And whispered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter so fair and far : And then she saw in her dreams the deep Where the spirit wailed , and a falling star ; Then stealthily crouching under the trees , By the light of the moon , the Kan-e-ti-dan , 31 The little , wizened , mysterious man , With his long locks tossed by the moaning breeze . Then a flap of wings , like a thunder-bird , 32 And a wailing spirit the sleeper heard ; And lo , through the mists of the moon , she saw The hateful visage of Harpstina . But waking she murmured --  " And what are these --  --  The flap of wings and the falling star , The wailing spirit that 's never at ease , The little man crouching under the trees , And the hateful visage of Harpstina ? My dreams are like feathers that float on the breeze , And none can tell what the omens are --  --  Save the beautiful dream of my love afar In the happy land of the tall Hohe --  --  My handsome hunter -- my brave Chaske . " Illustration : BUFFALO CHASE " Ta-tanka ! Ta-tanka ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the break of dawn And darkly lined on the white hill-side , A herd of bison went marching on Through the drifted snow like a caravan . Swift to their ponies the hunters sped , And dashed away on the hurried chase . The wild steeds scented the game ahead , And sprang like hounds to the eager race . But the brawny bulls in the swarthy van Turned their polished horns on the charging foes And reckless rider and fleet footman Were held at bay in the drifted snows , While the bellowing herd o'er the hilltops ran , Like the frightened beasts of a caravan On Sahara 's sands when the simoon blows . Sharp were the twangs of the hunters ' bows , And swift and humming the arrows sped , Till ten huge bulls on the bloody snows Lay pierced with arrows and dumb and dead . But the chief with the flankers had gained the rear , And flew on the trail of the flying herd . The shouts of the riders rang loud and clear , As their foaming steeds to the chase they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolls the bellowing wrath of the maddened bulls They charge on the riders and runners stanch , And a dying steed in the snow drift rolls , While the rider , flung to the frozen ground , Escapes the horns by a panther 's bound . But the raging monsters are held at bay , While the flankers dash on the swarthy rout : With lance and arrow they slay and slay ; And the welkin rings to the gladsome shout --  --  To the loud Ina 's and the wild Iho 's , 34 And dark and dead , on the bloody snows , Lie the swarthy heaps of the buffaloes . All snug in the teepee Wiwaste lay , All wrapped in her robe , at the dawn of day , All snug and warm from the wind and snow , While the hunters followed the buffalo . Her dreams and her slumber their wild shouts broke ; The chase was afoot when the maid awoke ; She heard the twangs of the hunters ' bows , And the bellowing bulls and the loud Iho 's , And she murmured --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall Hohe --  --  My handsome hunter , my brave Chaske ; But the robins will come and my warrior too , And Wiwaste will find her a way to woo . " And long she lay in a reverie , And dreamed , wide-awake , of the brave Chaske , Till a trampling of feet on the crispy snow She heard , and the murmur of voices low :  - -   - -   Then the warriors ' greeting -- Iho ! Iho ! And behold , in the blaze of the risen day , With the hunters that followed the buffalo --  --  Came her tall , young hunter -- her brave Chaske . Far south has he followed the bison-trail With his band of warriors so brave and true . Right glad is Wakawa his friend to hail , And Wiwaste will find her a way to woo . Tall and straight as the larch-tree stood The manly form of the brave young chief , And fair as the larch in its vernal leaf , When the red fawn bleats in the feathering wood . Mild was his face as the morning skies , And friendship shone in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted snow On the trail of the elk or the buffalo , And his heart was stouter than lance or bow , When he heard the whoop of his enemies . Five feathers he wore of the great Wanmdee And each for the scalp of a warrior slain , When down on his camp from the northern plain , With their murder-cries rode the bloody Cree. 35 But never the stain of an infant slain , Or the blood of a mother that plead in vain , Soiled the honored plumes of the brave Hohe . A mountain bear to his enemies , To his friends like the red fawn 's dappled form ; In peace , like the breeze from the summer seas --  --  In war , like the roar of the mountain storm . His fame in the voice of the winds went forth From his hunting grounds in the happy North , And far as the shores of the Great Mede 36 The nations spoke of the brave Chaske . Dark was the visage of grim Red Cloud , Fierce were the eyes of the warrior proud , When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Wiwaste smiled on the tall Chaske . Away he strode with a sullen frown , And alone in his teepee he sat him down . From the gladsome greeting of braves he stole , And wrapped himself in his gloomy soul . But the eagle eyes of the Harpstina The clouded face of the warrior saw . Softly she spoke to the sullen brave : " Mah-pi-ya Duta -- his face is sad ; And why is the warrior so glum and grave ? For the fair Wiwaste is gay and glad ; She will sit in the teepee the live-long day , And laugh with her lover -- the brave Hohe Does the tall Red Cloud for the false one sigh ? There are fairer maidens than she , and proud Were their hearts to be loved by the brave Red Cloud . And trust not the chief with the smiling eyes ; His tongue is swift , but his words are lies ; And the proud Mah-pi-ya will surely find That Wakawa 's promise is hollow wind . Last night I stood by his lodge , and lo I heard the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his words were low . But I heard her answer her father -- 'Never ! I will stain your knife in my heart 's red blood , I will plunge and sink in the sullen river , Ere I will be wife to the dark Red Cloud ! ' Then he spake again , and his voice was low , But I heard the answer of Little Crow : ' Let it be as you will , for Wakawa 's tongue Has spoken no promise -- his lips are slow , And the love of a father is deep and strong . ' " Mah-pi-ya Duta , they scorn your love , But the false chief covets the warrior 's gifts . False to his promise the fox will prove , And fickle as snow in Wo-ka-da-wee , 37 That slips into brooks when the gray cloud lifts , Or the red sun looks through the ragged rifts . Mah-pi-ya Duta will listen to me . There are fairer birds in the bush than she , And the fairest would gladly be Red Cloud 's wife . Will the warrior sit like a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That love Red Cloud as they love their life ? Mah-pi-ya Duta will listen to me . I love him well -- I have loved him long : A woman is weak , but a warrior is strong , And a love-lorn brave is a scorn to see . " Mah-pi-ya Duta , O listen to me ! Revenge is swift and revenge is strong , And sweet as the hive in the hollow tree ; The proud Red Cloud will avenge his wrong . Let the brave be patient , it is not long Till the leaves be green on the maple tree , And the Feast of the Virgins is then to be --  The Feast of the Virgins is then to be ! " Proudly she turned from the silent brave , And went her way ; but the warrior 's eyes --  They flashed with the flame of a sudden fire , Like the lights that gleam in the Sacred Cave38 , When the black night covers the autumn skies , And the stars from their welkin watch retire . Three nights he tarried -- the brave Chaske ; Winged were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wakandee39 they silently flew , For Wiwaste had found her a way to woo . Ah little he cared for the bison-chase , For the red lilies bloomed on the fair maid 's face ; Ah little he cared for the winds that blew , For Wiwaste had found her a way to woo . Brown-bosomed she sat on her fox-robe dark , Her ear to the tales of the brave inclined , Or tripped from the tee like the song of a lark , And gathered her hair from the wanton wind . Ah little he thought of the leagues of snow He trod on the trail of the buffalo ; And little he recked of the hurricanes That swept the snow from the frozen plains And piled the banks of the Bloody River. 40 His bow unstrung and forgotten hung With his beaver hood and his otter quiver ; He sat spell-bound by the artless grace Of her star-lit eyes and her moon-lit face . Ah little he cared for the storms that blew , For Wiwaste had found her a way to woo . When he spoke with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter-guise . Wakawa marked , and the lilies fair On her round cheeks spread to her raven hair . They feasted on rib of the bison fat , On the tongue of the Ta41 that the hunters prize , On the savory flesh of the red Hogan , 42 On sweet tipsanna43 and pemmican And the dun-brown cakes of the golden maize ; And hour after hour the young chief sat , And feasted his soul on her love-lit eyes . The sweeter the moments the swifter they fly ; Love takes no account of the fleeting hours ; He walks in a dream ' mid the blooming of flowers , And never awakes till the blossoms die . Ah lovers are lovers the wide world over --  In the hunter 's lodge and the royal palace . Sweet are the lips of his love to the lover --  Sweet as new wine in a golden chalice From the Tajo's44 slope or the hills beyond ; And blindly he sips from his loved one 's lips , In lodge or palace the wide world over , The maddening honey of Trebizond. 45 O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding drift of the hurricane , When it raves and roars o'er the frozen plain ! He would face the storm -- he would death encounter The darling prize of his heart to gain . But his hunters chafed at the long delay , For the swarthy bison were far away , And the brave young chief from the lodge departed . He promised to come with the robins in May With the bridal gifts for the bridal day ; And the fair Wiwaste was happy-hearted , For Wakawa promised the brave Chaske . Birds of a feather will flock together . The robin sings to his ruddy mate , And the chattering jays , in the winter weather , To prate and gossip will congregate ; And the cawing crows on the autumn heather , Like evil omens , will flock together , In common council for high debate ; And the lass will slip from a doting mother To hang with her lad on the garden gate . Birds of a feather will flock together --  ' T is an adage old -- it is nature 's law , And sure as the pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flaunting feather , Will follow the finger of Harpstina . The winter wanes and the south-wind blows From the Summer Islands legendary ; The skeskas46 fly and the melted snows In lakelets lie on the dimpled prairie . The frost-flowers47 peep from their winter sleep Under the snow-drifts cold and deep . To the April sun and the April showers , In field and forest , the baby flowers Lift their blushing faces and dewy eyes ; And wet with the tears of the winter-fairies , Soon bloom and blossom the emerald prairies , Like the fabled Garden of Paradise . The plum-trees , white with their bloom in May , Their sweet perfume on the vernal breeze Wide strew like the isles of the tropic seas Where the paroquet chatters the livelong day . But the May-days pass and the brave Chaske 17 O why does the lover so long delay ? Wiwaste waits in the lonely tee . Has her fair face fled from his memory ? For the robin cherups his mate to please , The blue-bird pipes in the poplar-trees , The meadow lark warbles his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welkin throbs to his melodies , And low is the hum of the humble-bees , And the Feast of the Virgins is now to be . THE FEAST OF THE VIRGINS The sun sails high in his azure realms ; Beneath the arch of the breezy elms The feast is spread by the murmuring river . With his battle-spear and his bow and quiver , And eagle-plumes in his ebon hair , The chief Wakawa himself is there ; And round the feast , in the Sacred Ring , 48 Sit his weaponed warriors witnessing . Not a morsel of food have the Virgins tasted For three long days ere the holy feast ; They sat in their teepee alone and fasted , Their faces turned to the Sacred East. 21 In the polished bowls lies the golden maize , And the flesh of fawn on the polished trays . For the Virgins the bloom of the prairies wide --  The blushing pink and the meek blue-bell , The purple plumes of the prairie 's pride , 49 The wild , uncultured asphodel , And the beautiful , blue-eyed violet That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festoons and garlands twine With the cedar sprigs50 and the wildwood vine . So gaily the Virgins are decked and dressed , And none but a virgin may enter there ; And clad is each in a scarlet vest , And a fawn-skin frock to the brown calves bare . Wild rose-buds peep from their flowing hair , And a rose half blown on the budding breast ; And bright with the quills of the porcupine The moccasined feet of the maidens shine . Hand in hand round the feast they dance , And sing to the notes of a rude bassoon , And never a pause or a dissonance In the merry dance or the merry tune . Brown-bosomed and fair as the rising moon , When she peeps o'er the hills of the dewy east , Wiwaste sings at the Virgins ' Feast ; And bright is the light in her luminous eyes ; They glow like the stars in the winter skies ; And the lilies that bloom in her virgin heart Their golden blush to her cheeks impart --  Her cheeks half-hid in her midnight hair . Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the flow of her raven hair ; It falls to her knees and it streams on the breeze Like the path of a storm on the swelling seas . Proud of their rites are the Virgins fair , For none but a virgin may enter there . ' T is a custom of old and a sacred thing ; Nor rank nor beauty the warriors spare , If a tarnished maiden should enter there . And her that enters the Sacred Ring With a blot that is known or a secret stain The warrior who knows is bound to expose , And lead her forth from the ring again . And the word of a brave is the fiat of law ; For the Virgins ' Feast is a sacred thing . Aside with the mothers sat Harpstina ; She durst not enter the Virgins ' ring . Round and round to the merry song The maidens dance in their gay attire , While the loud Ho-Ho 's of the tawny throng Their flying feet and their song inspire . They have finished the song and the sacred dance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished bowls of the golden maize , And the sweet fawn-meat in the polished trays . Then up from his seat in the silent crowd Rose the frowning , fierce-eyed , tall Red Cloud ; Swift was his stride as the panther 's spring , When he leaps on the fawn from his cavern lair ; Wiwaste he caught by her flowing hair , And dragged her forth from the Sacred Ring . She turned on the warrior , her eyes flashed fire ; Her proud lips quivered with queenly ire ; And her sun-browned cheeks were aflame with red . Her hand to the spirits she raised and said : " I am pure !  - -  I am pure as the falling snow ! Great Taku-skan-skan51 will testify ! And dares the tall coward to say me no ? " But the sullen warrior made no reply . She turned to the chief with her frantic cries : " Wakawa ,  - -  my Father ! he lies ,  - -  he lies ! Wiwaste is pure as the fawn unborn ; Lead me back to the feast or Wiwaste dies ! " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face from her pleading eyes . Then the sullen warrior , the tall Red Cloud , Looked up and spoke and his voice was loud ; But he held his wrath and he spoke with care : " Wiwaste is young ; she is proud and fair , But she may not boast of the virgin snows . The Virgins ' Feast is a sacred thing ; How durst she enter the Virgins ' ring ? The warrior would fain , but he dares not spare ; She is tarnished and only the Red Cloud knows . " She clutched her hair in her clinched hand ; She stood like a statue bronzed and grand ; Wakan-dee39 flashed in her fiery eyes ; Then swift as the meteor cleaves the skies --  Nay , swift as the fiery Wakinyan's32 dart , She snatched the knife from the warrior 's belt , And plunged it clean to the polished hilt --  With a deadly cry -- in the villain 's heart . Staggering he clutched the air and fell ; His life-blood smoked on the trampled sand , And dripped from the knife in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yell . Swift as the doe 's Wiwaste 's feet Fled away to the forest . The hunters fleet In vain pursue , and in vain they prowl And lurk in the forest till dawn of day . They hear the hoot of the mottled owl ; They hear the were-wolf's52 winding howl ; But the swift Wiwaste is far away . They found no trace in the forest land ; They found no trail in the dew-damp grass ; They found no track in the river sand , Where they thought Wiwaste would surely pass . The braves returned to the troubled chief ; In his lodge he sat in his silent grief . " Surely , " they said , " she has turned a spirit . No trail she left with her flying feet ; No pathway leads to her far retreat . She flew in the air , and her wail -- we could hear it , As she upward rose to the shining stars ; And we heard on the river , as we stood near it , The falling drops of Wiwaste 's tears . " Wakawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the piping birds --  " My Father , listen -- my words are true , " And sad was her voice as the whippowil When she mourns her mate by the moon-lit rill , " Wiwaste lingers alone with you ; The rest are sleeping on yonder hill --  Save one -- and he an undutiful son --  And you , my Father , will sit alone When Sisoka53 sings and the snow is gone . " His broad breast heaved on his troubled soul , The shadow of grief o'er his visage stole Like a cloud on the face of the setting sun . Illustration " She has followed the years that are gone , " he said ; " The spirits the words of the witch fulfill ; For I saw the ghost of my father dead , By the moon 's dim light on the misty hill . He shook the plumes on his withered head , And the wind through his pale form whistled shrill . And a low , sad voice on the hill I heard , Like the mournful wail of a widowed bird . " Then lo , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Evening-star ; " And yonder , " he said , " is Wiwaste 's face ; She looks from her lodge on our fading race , Devoured by famine , and fraud , and war , And chased and hounded by fate and woe , As the white wolves follow the buffalo ; " And he named the planet the Virgin Star. 54 " Wakawa , " he muttered , " the guilt is thine ! She was pure -- she was pure as the fawn unborn . O why did I hark to the cry of scorn , Or the words of the lying libertine ? Wakawa , Wakawa , the guilt is thine ! The springs will return with the voice of birds , But the voice of my daughter will come no more . She wakened the woods with her musical words , And the sky-lark , ashamed of his voice , forbore . She called back the years that had passed , and long I heard their voice in her happy song . O why did the chief of the tall Hohe His feet from Kapoza6 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feast , And he at Wakawa's -- an honored guest . He is dead !  - -  he is slain on the Bloody Plain , By the hand of the treacherous Chippeway ; And the face shall I never behold again Of my brave young brother -- the chief Chaske . Death walks like a shadow among my kin ; And swift are the feet of the flying years That cover Wakawa with frost and tears , And leave their tracks on his wrinkled skin . Wakawa , the voice of the years that are gone Will follow thy feet like the shadow of death , Till the paths of the forest and desert lone Shall forget thy footsteps . O living breath , Whence are thou , and whither so soon to fly ? And whence are the years ? Shall I overtake Their flying feet in the star-lit sky ? From his last long sleep will the warrior wake ? Will the morning break in Wakawa 's tomb , As it breaks and glows in the eastern skies ? Is it true ?  - -  will the spirits of kinsmen come And bid the bones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years Are red with blood and bitter with tears . Gone -- brothers , and daughters , and wife -- all gone That are kin to Wakawa -- but one -- but one --  Wakinyan Tanka -- undutiful son ! And he estranged from his father 's tee , Will never return till the chief shall die . And what cares he for his father 's grief ? He will smile at my death -- it will make him chief . Woe burns in my bosom . Ho , warriors -- Ho ! Raise the song of red war ; for your chief must go To drown his grief in the blood of the foe ! I shall fall . Raise my mound on the sacred hill . Let my warriors the wish of their chief fulfill ; For my fathers sleep in the sacred ground . The Autumn blasts o'er Wakawa 's mound Will chase the hair of the thistles ' head , And the bare-armed oak o'er the silent dead , When the whirling snows from the north descend , Will wail and moan in the midnight wind . In the famine of winter the wolf will prowl , And scratch the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering storm and howl , On the frozen mound , for Wakawa 's bones . But the years that are gone shall return again , As the robin returns and the whippowil , When my warriors stand on the sacred hill And remember the deeds of their brave chief slain . " Beneath the glow of the Virgin Star They raised the song of the red war-dance . At the break of dawn with the bow and lance They followed the chief on the path of war . To the north -- to the forests of fir and pine --  Led their stealthy steps on the winding trail , Till they saw the Lake of the Spirit55 shine Through somber pines of the dusky dale . Then they heard the hoot of the mottled owl ; 56 They heard the gray wolf 's dismal howl ; Then shrill and sudden the war-whoop rose From an hundred throats of their swarthy foes , In ambush crouched in the tangled wood . Death shrieked in the twang of their deadly bows , And their hissing arrows drank brave men 's blood . From rock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning eyes of the " forest-snakes. " 57 From brake , and thicket , and brush , and stone , The bow-string hummed and the arrow hissed , And the lance of a crouching Ojibway shone , Or the scalp-knife gleamed in a swarthy fist . Undaunted the braves of Wakawa 's band Leaped into the thicket with lance and knife , And grappled the Chippeways hand to hand ; And foe with foe , in the deadly strife , Lay clutching the scalp of his foe and dead , With a tomahawk sunk in his ghastly head , Or his still heart sheathing a bloody blade . Like a bear in the battle Wakawa raves , And cheers the hearts of his falling braves . But a panther crouches along his track --  He springs with a yell on Wakawa 's back ! The tall chief , stabbed to the heart , lies low ; But his left hand clutches his deadly foe , And his red right clinches the bloody hilt Of his knife in the heart of the slayer dyed . And thus was the life of Wakawa spilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unscalped corpse of their honored chief His warriors snatched from the yelling pack , And homeward fled on their forest track With their bloody burden and load of grief . The spirits the words of the brave fulfill --  Wakawa sleeps on the sacred hill , And Wakinyan Tanka , his son , is chief . Ah soon shall the lips of men forget Wakawa 's name , and the mound of stone Will speak of the dead to the winds alone , And the winds will whistle their mock regret . The speckled cones of the scarlet berries58 Lie red and ripe in the prairie grass . The Si-yo59 clucks on the emerald prairies To her infant brood . From the wild morass , On the sapphire lakelet set within it , Maga sails forth with her wee ones daily . They ride on the dimpling waters gaily , Like a fleet of yachts and a man-of-war . The piping plover , the light-winged linnet , And the swallow sail in the sunset skies . The whippowil from her cover hies , And trills her song on the amber air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flip , O Will !  - -  trip , O Will !  - -  skip , O Will ! " And her merry mate from afar replies : " Flip I will -- skip I will -- trip I will ; " And away on the wings of the wind he flies . And bright from her lodge in the skies afar Peeps the glowing face of the Virgin Star . The fox-pups60 creep from their mother 's lair , And leap in the light of the rising moon ; And loud on the luminous , moonlit lake Shrill the bugle-notes of the lover loon ; And woods and waters and welkin break Into jubilant song -- it is joyful June . But where is Wiwaste ? O where is she --  The virgin avenged -- the queenly queen --  The womanly woman -- the heroine ? Has she gone to the spirits ? and can it be That her beautiful face is the Virgin Star Peeping out from the door of her lodge afar , Or upward sailing the silver sea , Star-beaconed and lit like an avenue , In the shining stern of her gold canoe ? No tidings came -- nor the brave Chaske : O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come with the robins in May With the bridal gifts for the bridal day ; But the fair May-mornings have slipped away , And where is the lover -- the brave Chaske ? But what of the venomous Harpstina --  The serpent that tempted the proud Red Cloud , And kindled revenge in his savage soul ? He paid for his crime with his own heart 's blood , But his angry spirit has brought her dole ; 61 It has entered her breast and her burning head , And she raves and burns on her fevered bed . " He is dead ! He is dead ! " is her wailing cry , " And the blame is mine -- it was I -- it was I ! I hated Wiwaste , for she was fair , And my brave was caught in her net of hair . I turned his love to a bitter hate ; I nourished revenge , and I pricked his pride ; Till the Feast of the Virgins I bade him wait . He had his revenge , but he died -- he died ! And the blame is mine -- it was I -- it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ! " Thus , alone in her lodge and her agonies , She wails to the winds of the night , and dies . But where is Wiwaste ? Her swift feet flew To the somber shades of the tangled thicket . She hid in the copse like a wary cricket , And the fleetest hunters in vain pursue . Seeing unseen from her hiding place , She sees them fly on the hurried chase ; She sees their dark eyes glance and dart , As they pass and peer for a track or trace , And she trembles with fear in the copse apart , Lest her nest be betrayed by her throbbing heart . Weary the hours ; but the sun at last Went down to his lodge in the west , and fast The wings of the spirits of night were spread O'er the darkling woods and Wiwaste 's head . Then slyly she slipped from her snug retreat , And guiding her course by Waziya 's star , 62 That shone through the shadowy forms afar , She northward hurried with silent feet ; And long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leagues from the spot of the fatal feast . ' T was the hoot of the owl that the hunters heard , And the scattering drops of the threat'ning shower , And the far wolf 's cry to the moon preferred . Their ears were their fancies -- the scene was weird , And the witches63 dance at the midnight hour . She leaped the brook and she swam the river ; Her course through the forest Wiwaste wist By the star that gleamed through the glimmering mist That fell from the dim moon 's downy quiver . In her heart she spoke to her spirit-mother : " Look down from your teepee , O starry spirit . The cry of Wiwaste . O mother , hear it ; And touch the heart of my cruel father . He hearkened not to a virgin 's words ; He listened not to a daughter 's wail . O give me the wings of the thunder-birds , For his were wolves52 follow Wiwaste 's trail ; And guide my flight to the far Hohe --  To the sheltering lodge of my brave Chaske . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the kindling morn increased . The pale-faced stars fled one by one , And hid in the vast from the rising sun . From woods and waters and welkin soon Fled the hovering mists of the vanished moon . The young robins chirped in their feathery beds , The loon 's song shrilled like a winding horn , And the green hills lifted their dewy heads To greet the god of the rising morn . She reached the rim of the rolling prairie --  The boundless ocean of solitude ; She hid in the feathery hazel-wood , For her heart was sick and her feet were weary ; She fain would rest , and she needed food . Alone by the billowy , boundless prairies , She plucked the cones of the scarlet berries ; In feathering copse and the grassy field She found the bulbs of the young Tipsanna , 43 And the sweet medo 64 that the meadows yield . With the precious gift of his priceless manna God fed his fainting and famished child . At night again to the northward far She followed the torch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , On the billowy vast , may a man be seen , When the sun is high and the stars are low ; And the sable breast of the strutting crow Looms up like the form of the buffalo . The Bloody River 40 she reached at last , And boldly walked in the light of day , On the level plain of the valley vast ; Nor thought of the terrible Chippeway . She was safe from the wolves of her father 's band , But she trod on the treacherous " Bloody Land . " Illustration And lo -- from afar o'er the level plain --  As far as the sails of a ship at sea May be seen as they lift from the rolling main --  A band of warriors rode rapidly . She shadowed her eyes with her sun-browned hand ; All backward streamed on the wind her hair , And terror spread o'er her visage fair , As she bent her brow to the far-off band . For she thought of the terrible Chippeway --  The fiends that the babe and the mother slay ; And yonder they came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow-grass , And moaned --  " I am lost !  - -  I am lost ! alas , And why did I fly from my native land To die by the cruel Ojibway 's hand ? " And on rode the braves . She could hear the steeds Come galloping on o'er the level meads ; And lowly she crouched in the waving grass , And hoped against hope that the braves would pass . They have passed ; she is safe -- she is safe ! Ah no ! They have struck her trail and the hunters halt . Like wolves on the track of the bleeding doe , That grappled breaks from the dread assault , Dash the warriors wild on Wiwaste 's trail . She flies -- but what can her flight avail ? Her feet are fleet , but the flying feet Of the steeds of the prairies are fleeter still ; And where can she fly for a safe retreat ? But hark to the shouting --  " Iho !  - -  Iho ! " 22 Rings over the wide plain sharp and shrill . She halts , and the hunters come riding on ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not the shout of the dreaded foe ; ' T is the welcome shout of her native land ! Up galloped the chief of the band , and lo --  The clutched knife dropped from her trembling hand ; She uttered a cry and she swooned away ; For there , on his steed in the blaze of day , On the boundless prairie so far away , With his polished bow and his feathers gay , Sat the manly form of her own Chaske ! There 's a mote in my eye or a blot on the page , And I can not tell of the joyful greeting ; You may take it for granted , and I will engage , There were kisses and tears at the strange , glad meeting ; For aye since the birth of the swift-winged years , In the desert drear , in the field of clover , In the cot , in the palace , and all the world over --  Yea , away on the stars to the ultimate spheres , The greeting of love to the long-sought lover --  Is tears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover so long delay ? And whitherward rideth the chief to-day ? As he followed the trail of the buffalo , From the tees of Kapoza a maiden , lo , Came running in haste o'er the drifted snow . She spoke to the chief of the tall Hohe : " Wiwaste requests that the brave Chaske Will abide with his band and his coming delay Till the moon when the strawberries are ripe and red , And then will the chief and Wiwaste wed --  When the Feast of the Virgins is past , " she said . Wiwaste 's wish was her lover 's law ; And so his coming the chief delayed Till the mid May blossoms should bloom and fade --  But the lying runner was Harpstina . And now with the gifts for the bridal day And his chosen warriors he took his way , And followed his heart to his moon-faced maid . And thus was the lover so long delayed ; And so as he rode with his warriors gay , On that bright and beautiful summer day , His bride he met on the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the desert vast , in the wilderness , On the bellowing sea , in the lion 's lair , In the mist of battle , and everywhere . In his hand he holds with a father 's care The tender hearts of the motherless ; The maid and the mother in sore distress He shields with his love and his tenderness ; He comforts the widowed -- the comfortless --  And sweetens her chalice of bitterness ; He clothes the naked -- the numberless --  His charity covers their nakedness --  And he feeds the famished and fatherless With the hand that feedeth the birds of air . Let the myriad tongues of the earth confess His infinite love and his holiness ; For his pity pities the pitiless , His mercy flows to the merciless ; And the countless worlds in the realms above , Revolve in the light of his boundless love . And what of the lovers ? you ask , I trow . She told him all ere the sun was low --  Why she fled from the Feast to a safe retreat . She laid her heart at her lover 's feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she sadly related the bitter tale His face was aflame and anon grew pale , And his dark eyes flashed with a brave desire , Like the midnight gleam of the sacred fire . 65 " Mitawin , " 66 he said , and his voice was low , " Thy father no more is the false Little Crow ; But the fairest plume shall Wiwaste wear Of the great Wanmdee in her midnight hair . In my lodge , in the land of the tall Hohe , The robins will sing all the long summer day To the happy bride of the brave Chaske . ' " Aye , love is tested by stress and trial Since the finger of time on the endless dial Began its rounds , and the orbs to move In the boundless vast , and the sunbeams clove The chaos ; but only by fate 's denial Are fathomed the fathomless depths of love .

The silken threads of the happy years They wove into beautiful robes of love That the spirits wear in the lodge above ; And time from the reel of the rolling spheres His silver threads with the raven wove ; But never the stain of a mother 's tears Soiled the shining web of their happy years . When the wrinkled mask of the years they wore , And the raven hair of their youth was gray , Their love grew deeper , and more and more ; For he was a lover for aye and aye , And ever her beautiful , brave Chaske .

There , ever ripe in the groves and prairies , Hang the purple plums and the luscious berries , And the swarthy herds of the bison feed On the sun-lit slope and the waving mead ; The dappled fawns from their coverts peep , And countless flocks on the waters sleep ; And the silent years with their fingers trace No furrows for aye on the hunter 's face .

The silent ships slept in the silent bay ; One broad blue bent of ether domed the heavens , One broad blue distance lay the shadowy land , One broad blue vast of silence slept the sea . Now from the dewy groves the joyful birds In carol-concert sang their matin songs Softly and sweetly -- full of prayer and praise . Then silver-chiming , solemn-voiced bells Rung out their music on the morning air , And Lisbon gathered to the festival In chapel and cathedral . Choral hymns And psalms of sea-toned organs mingling rose With sweetest incense floating up to heaven , Bearing the praises of the multitudes ; And all was holy peace and holy happiness . A rumbling of deep thunders in the deep ; The vast sea shuddered and the mountains groaned ; Up-heaved the solid earth -- the nether rocks Burst -- and the sea -- the earth -- the echoing heavens Thundered infernal ruin . On their knees The trembling multitudes received the shock , And dumb with sudden terror bowed their heads To toppling spire and plunging wall and dome . So shook the mighty North the sudden roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jarred the granite hills And westward rolled against th ' eternal walls Rock-built Titanic -- for a moment shook : Uprose a giant and with iron hands Grasped his huge hammer , claspt his belt of steel , And o'er the Midgard-monster mighty Thor Loomed for the combat . Peace -- O blessed Peace ! The war-worn veterans hailed thee with a shout Of Alleluias ;  - -  homeward wound the trains , And homeward marched the bayonet-bristling columns To " Hail Columbia " from a thousand horns --  Marched to the jubilee of chiming bells , Marched to the joyful peals of cannon , marched With blazing banners and victorious songs Into the outstretched arms of love and home . But there be columns -- columns of the dead That slumber on an hundred battle-fields --  No bugle-blast shall waken till the trump Of the Archangel . O the loved and lost ! For them no jubilee of chiming bells ; For them no cannon-peal of victory ; For them no outstretched arms of love and home . God 's peace be with them . Heroes who went down , Wearing their stars , live in the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unnumbered nameless graves Erst bleached unburied on the fields of fame Won by their valor . Who will sing of these --  Sing of the patriot-deeds on field and flood --  Of these -- the truer heroes -- all unsung ? Where sleeps the modest bard in Quaker gray Who blew the pibroch ere the battle lowered , Then pitched his tent upon the balmy beach ? " Snow-bound , " I ween , among his native hills . And where the master hand that swept the lyre Till wrinkled critics cried " Excelsior " ? Gathering the " Aftermath " in frosted fields . Then , timid Muse , no longer shake thy wings For airy realms and fold again in fear ; A broken flight is better than no flight ; Be thine the task , as best you may , to sing The deeds of one who sleeps at Gettysburg Among the thousands in a common grave . The story of his life I bid you tell As it was told one windy winter night To veterans gathered around the festal board , Fighting old battles over where the field Ran red with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merry songs --  Told when the songs were sung by him who heard The pith of it from the dying soldier 's lips --  His Captain -- tell it as the Captain told . THE CAPTAIN 'S STORY " Well , comrades , let us fight one battle more ; Let the cock crow -- we 'll guard the camp till morn . And -- since the singers and the merry ones Are hors de combat -- fill the cups again ; Nod if you must , but listen to a tale Romantic -- but the warp thereof is truth . When the old Flag on Sumter 's sea-girt walls From its proud perch a fluttering ruin fell , I swore an oath as big as Bunker Hill ; For I was younger then , nor battle-scarred , And full of patriot-faith and patriot-fire . " I raised a company of riflemen , Marched to the front , and proud of my command , Nor seeking higher , led them till the day Of triumph and the nation 's jubilee . Among the first that answered to my call The hero came whose story you shall hear . ' T is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty -- neither short nor tall --  A slender student , and his tapering hands Had better graced a maiden than a man : Sad , thoughtful face -- a wealth of raven hair Brushed back in waves from forehead prominent ; A classic nose -- half Roman and half Greek ; Dark , lustrous eyes beneath dark , jutting brows , Wearing a shade of sorrow , yet so keen , And in the storm of battle flashing fire . " ' Well , boy , ' I said , ' I doubt if you will do ; I need stout men for picket-line and march --  Men that have bone and muscle -- men inured To toil and hardships -- men , in short , my boy , To march and fight and march and fight again . ' A queer expression lit his earnest face --  Half frown -- half smile . " ' Well try me . ' That was all He answered , and I put him on the roll --  Paul Douglas , private -- and he donned the blue . Paul proved himself the best in my command ; I found him first at reveille , and first In all the varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boisterous ways , Jeered at the slender youth with maiden hands , Nicknamed him ' Nel , ' and for a month or more Kept up a fusillade of jokes and jeers . Their jokes and jeers he heard but heeded not , Or heeding did a kindly act for him That jeered him loudest ; so the hardy men Came to look up to Paul as one above The level of their rough and roistering ways . He never joined the jolly soldier-sports , But ever was the first at bugle-call , Mastered the drill and often drilled the men . Fatigued with duty , weary with the march Under the blaze of the midsummer sun , He murmured not -- alike in sun or rain His utmost duty eager to perform , And ever ready -- always just the same Patient and earnest , sad and silent Paul . " The day of battle came -- that Sabbath day , Midsummer . A Hot and blistering as the flames Of prairie-fires wind-driven , the burning sun Blazed down upon us and the blinding dust Wheeled in dense clouds and covered all our ranks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of batteries broke upon us . Glad indeed That music to my soldiers , and they cheered And cheered again and boasted -- all but Paul --  And shouted ' On to Richmond ! '  - -  He alone Was silent -- but his eyes were full of fire . A The first battle of Bull Run , July 21 , 1861 . " Then came the order -- 'Forward , double quick ! ' And we rushed into battle -- formed our line Facing the foe -- the ambushed , deadly foe , Hid in the thicket , with the Union flag --  A cheat -- hung out before it -- luring us Into a blazing hell . The battle broke With wildest fury on us -- crashed and roared The rolling thunder of continuous fire . We broke and rallied -- charged and broke again , And rallied still -- broke counter-charge and charged Loud-yelling , furious , on the hidden foe ;  --  Met thrice our numbers and came flying back Disordered and disheartened . Yet again I strove to rally my discouraged men , But hell was fairly howling ;  - -  only Paul --  Eager , but bleeding from a bullet-wound In the left arm -- came bounding to my side . But at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swooning sense of death Came on me , and I saw and heard no more Of battle on that Sabbath . " I awoke , Confined and jolted in an ambulance Piled with the wounded -- driven recklessly By one who chiefly cared to save himself . Dizzy and faint I raised my head : my wound Was not as dangerous as it might have been --  A scalp-wound on the temple ; there , you see --  " He put his finger on the ugly scar --  " Half an inch deeper and some soldier friend , Among the veterans gathered here to-night , Perchance had told a briefer tale than mine . " In front and rear I saw the reckless rout --  A broken army flying panic-struck --  Our proud brigades of undulating steel That marched at sunrise under blazoned flags , Singing the victory ere the cannon roared , And eager for the honors of the day --  Like bison Indian-chased on windy plains , Now broken and commingled fled the field . Words of command were only wasted breath ; Colonels and brigadiers , on foot and soiled , Were pushed and jostled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavalry ! ' arose , And army-teams came dashing down the road And plunged into the panic . All the way Was strewn with broken wagons , battery-guns , Tents , muskets , knapsacks and exhausted men . My men were mingled with the lawless crowd , And in the swarm behind us , there was Paul --  Silent and soldier-like , with knapsack on And rifle on his shoulder , guarding me And marching on behind the ambulance . So all that dark and dreadful night we marched , Each man a captain -- captain of himself --  Nor cared for orders on that wild retreat To safety from disaster . All that night , Silent and soldier-like my wounded Paul Marched close behind and kept his faithful watch . For ever and anon the jaded men , Clamorous and threat'ning , sought to clamber in ; Whom Paul drove off at point of bayonet , Wielding his musket with his good right arm . But when the night was waning to the morn I saw that he was weary and I made A place for Paul and begged him to get in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  'I will walk --  I 'm making bone and muscle -- learning how To march and fight and march and fight again . ' That silenced me , and we went rumbling on . Till morning found us safe at Arlington . " A month off duty and a faithful nurse Worked wonders and my head was whole again --  Nay -- to be candid -- cracked a little yet . My nurse was Paul . Albeit his left arm , Flesh-wounded , pained him sorely for a time , With filial care he dressed my battered head , And wrote for me to anxious friends at home --  But never wrote a letter for himself . Thinking of this one day , I spoke of it :  --  A cloud came o'er his face . " ' My friends , ' he said , ' Are here among my comrades in the camp . ' That made a mystery and I questioned him : He gave no answer -- or evasive ones --  Seeming to shrink from question , and to wrap Himself within himself and live within . " Again we joined our regiment and marched ; Over the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . On picket-duty at the frequent fords For weary , laggard months were we employed Guarding the broad Potomac , while our foes , Stealthily watching for their human game , Lurked like Apaches on the wooded shores . Bands of enemy 's cavalry by night Along the line of river prowled , and sought To dash across and raid in Maryland . Three regiments guarded miles of river-bank , And drilled alternately , and one was ours . Off picket duty , alike in fair or foul , With knapsacks on and bearing forty rounds , From morn till night we **26;2329;TOOLONG Often at double-quick for weary hours --  Bearing our burdens in the blazing sun , Till strong men staggered from the ranks and fell . Aye , many a hardy man in those hard days Was drilled and disciplined into his grave . Arose Murmurs of discontent , and loud complaints Fell on dull ears till patience was worn out And mutiny was hinted . As for Paul I never heard a murmur from his lips ; Nor did he ask a reason for the things Unreasonable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as if The nation 's fate hung on it . I pitied Paul ; Slender of form and delicate , he bore The toils and duties of the hardiest . Ill from exposure , or fatigued and worn , On picket hungered , shivering in the rain , Or sweltering in full dress , with knapsack on , Beneath the blaze of the mid-summer sun , He held his spirit -- always still the same Patient and earnest , sad and silent Paul . " We posted pickets two by two . At night , By turns each comrade slept and took the watch . Once in September , in a drenching storm , Three days and nights with neither tent nor fire Paul and a comrade held a picket-post . The equinox raged madly . Chilling winds In angry gusts roared from the northern hills , Dashing the dismal rain-clouds into showers That fell in torrents over all the land . In camp the soldiers crouched in dripping tents , Or shivered by the camp-fires . I was ill And gladly sought the shelter of a hut . Orders were strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picket-posts --  Cold rations and a canopy of storms . I pitied Paul and would have called him in , But that I had no man to take his place ; Nor did I know he took upon himself A double task . His comrade on the post Was ill , and so he made a shelter for him With his own blankets and a bed within ; And took the watch of both upon himself . And on the third night near the dawn of day , In rubber cloak stole in upon the post A pompous major , on the nightly round , Unchallenged . All fatigued and drenched with rain , Still on his post with rifle in his hand --  Against a sheltering elm Paul stood and slept . Muttering of death the brutal major stormed , Then pitiless pricked the comrade with his sword , And from his shelter drove him to the watch , Burning with fever . There Paul interposed And said : " ' I ask no mercy at your hands ; I shall not whimper , but my comrade here Is ill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a human heart beats in your breast , Send him to camp , or he will surely die . ' " The pompous brute -- vaingloriously great In straps and buttons -- haughtily silenced Paul , Hand-bound and sent him guarded to the camp , And the poor comrade shivering stood the watch Till dawn of day and I was made aware . Among the true were some vainglorious fools Called by the fife and drum from native mire To lord and strut in shoulder-straps and buttons . Scrubs , born to brush the boots of gentlemen , By sudden freak of fortune found themselves Masters of better men , and lorded it As only base and brutish natures can --  Braves on parade and cowards under fire . " I interceded in my Paul 's behalf , Else he had suffered graver punishment , But as himself for mercy would not beg --  ' A stubborn boy , ' our bluff old colonel said --  To extra duty for a month he went Unmurmuring , storm or shine . When the cold rain Poured down most pitiless Paul , drenched and wan , Guarded the baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-day blazed and burned , Like the red flame on Mauna Loa 's top , Withering the grass and parching earth and air , I often saw him knapsacked and full-dressed , Drilling the raw recruits at double-quick ; And yet he wore a patient countenance , And went about his duty earnestly As if it were a pleasure to obey . " The month wore off and mad disaster came --  Gorging the blood of heroes at Ball 's Bluff . ' T was there the brave , unfaltering Baker fell Fighting despair between the jaws of death . Quenched was the flame that fired a thousand hearts ; Hushed was the voice that shook the senate-walls , And rang defiance like a bugle-blast . Broad o'er the rugged mountains to the north Fell the incessant rain till , like a sea , Him and the deadly ambush of the foe The swollen river rolled and roared between . Brave Baker saw the peril , but not his The soul to shrink or falter , though he saw His death-warrant in his orders . Forth he led His proud brigade across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . From morn till mid-day in a single boat Unfit , by companies , the fearless band Passed over the raging river ; then advanced Upon the ambushed foe . We heard the roll Of volleys in the forest , and uprose , From out the wood , a cloud of battle-smoke . Then came the yell of foemen charging down Rank upon rank and furious . Hand to hand , The little band of heroes , flanked and pressed , Fought thrice their numbers ; fearless Baker led In prodigies of valor ; front and flank Volleyed the deadly rifles ; in the rear The rapid , raging river rolled and roared . Along the Maryland shore a mile below , Eager to cross and reinforce our friends , Ten thousand soldiers lay upon their arms ; And we had boats to spare . In all our ranks There was not one who did not comprehend The peril and the instant need of aid . Chafing we waited orders . We could see That Baker 's men were fighting in retreat ; For ever nearer o'er the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And up along the shore our regiment ran , Eager to aid our comrades , but too late ! Baker had fallen in the battle-front ; He fought like Spartan and like Spartan fell Defiant , clutching at the throat of fate . Their leader lost , confusion followed fast ; Wild panic and red slaughter swept the field . Powerless to saves we saw the farther shore Covered with wounded and wild fugitives --  Our own defeated and defenseless friends . Shattered and piled with wounded men the boat Pushed off to brave the river , while the foe Pressed on the charge with fury , and refused Mercy to the vanquished . Officers and men , Cheating the savage foemen of their spoils , Their flags and arms into the gurgling depths Despairing hurled , and following plunged amain . As numerous as the wild aquatic flocks That float in autumn on Lake Nepigon , The heads of swimmers moved upon the flood . And still upon the shore a Spartan few --  Shoulder to shoulder -- back to back , as one --  Amid the din and clang of clashing steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pre-historic centuries --  Unnumbered ages ere the Pyramids --  Whereof we read on pre-diluvian bones And fretted flints in excavated caves , When savage men abode in rocky dens , And wrought their weapons from the fiery flint , And clothed their tawny thighs in lion-skins --  Before the mouth of some well-guarded cave , Where smoked the savory flesh of mammoth , came The great cave-bear unbidden to the feast . Around the monster swarm the brawny men , Wielding with sinewy arms and savage cries Their flinty spears and tomahawks of stone . Erect old bruin growls upon his foes , And swings with mighty power his ponderous paws --  Woe unto him who feels the crushing blow --  Till , bleeding from an hundred wounds and blind , With sudden plunge he falls at last , and dies Amid the shouts of his wild enemies . So fought the Spartan few , till one by one , They fell surrounded by a wall of foes . The river boiled beneath the storm of lead ; Weighed down with wounded comrades many sunk , But more went down with bullets in their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of men that erst had faced the battle-storm Unshaken , grasping now in wild despair , Wrung cries of pity from us . Vain our fire --  The range too long -- it fell upon our friends ; At which the foemen yelled their mad delight . A storm of bullets poured upon the boat , Mangling the mangled on her , till at last , Shattered and over-laden , suddenly She made a lurch to leeward and went down . " A shallow boat lay moored upon the shore ; Our gallant Colonel called for volunteers In mercy 's name to man it and push out . But all could see the peril . Stout the heart Would dare to face the raging flood and fire , And to his call responded not a man --  Save Paul and one who perished at the helm . They went as if at bugle-call to drill ; Their comrades said , ' They never will return . ' Stoutly and steadily Paul rowed the boat Athwart the turbid river 's sullen tide , And reached the wounded struggling in the flood . Bravely they worked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more ; Others they helped to holds upon the rails , Then pulled away the over-laden craft . We cheered them from the shore . The maddened foe With furious volleys answered -- hitting oft The little craft of mercy -- hands anon Let go their holds and sunk into the deep . And in that storm Paul 's gallant comrade fell . Trimming his craft with caution Paul could make But little headway with a single oar --  Clutched in despair and madly wrenched away By drowning souls the other . Firm and cool Paul stood unscathed ; then fell a sudden shower That broke his bended oar-stem at the blade . Down to the brink we crept and stretched our hands , And shouted , ' Overboard , Paul ! and save yourself . ' " He stood a moment as if all were lost , Then caught the rope , and stretching forth his hand , Waved to the foe and plunged into the flood . Slowly he towed the clumsy craft and swam , Down-drifting with the rapid , rolling stream . Cheering him on adown the shore we ran ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and beyond the range at last Of foemen 's fire he safely came to land , Mooring his boat amid a storm of cheers . " Confined in hospital three days he lay Fatigued and feverous , but tender hands Nursed and restored him . Our old Colonel came And thanked him -- patting Paul paternally --  And praised his daring . ' My brave boy , ' he said , ' Had I a regiment of such men , by Jove ! I 'd hew a path to Richmond and to fame . ' Paul made reply , and in his smile and tone Mingled a touch of sarcasm : " ' Thank you , sir ; But let me add -- I fear the wary foe Would nab your regiment napping on the field . You have forgotten , Colonel -- not so fast --  I am the man that slept upon his post . ' Our bluff old Colonel laughed and turned away ; Ten minutes later came his kind reply --  A basketful of luxuries from his mess . " Paul marched and fought and marched and fought again , Patient and earnest through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the Peninsula . ' T was fitly called ' Campaign of Battles . ' Aye , it sorely pierced The scarred and bleeding nation , and drew blood Deep from her vitals till she shook and reeled , Like some huge giant staggering to his fall --  Blinded with blood , yet struggling with his soul , And stretching forth his ponderous , brawny arms , Like Samson in the Temple , to o'erwhelm And crush his mocking enemies in his fall . " Ah , Malvern ! you remember Malvern Hill --  That night of dreadful butchery ! Round the top Of the entrenched summit , parked and aimed , Blazed like Vesuvius when he bellows fire And molten lava into the midnight heavens , An hundred crashing cannon , and the hill Shook to the thunder of the mighty guns , As ocean trembles to the bursting throes Of submarine volcanoes ; and the shells From the embattled gun-boats -- fiery fiends --  Shrieked on the night and through the ether hissed Like hell 's infernals . Line supporting line , From base to summit round the blazing hill , Our infantry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burning , blazing belt From head to foot , and belching sulphurous flames , The embattled hill appeared a raging fiend --  The Lucifer of hell let loose to reign Over a world wrapt in the final fires . " In solid columns massed our frenzied foes Beat out their life against the blazing hill --  Broke and re-formed and madly charged again , And thundered like the storm-lashed , furious sea Beating in vain against the solid cliffs . Foremost in from our veteran regiment Breasted the brunt of battle , but we bent Beneath the onsets as the red-hot bar Bends to the sledge , until our furious foes --  Mown as the withered prairie-grass is mown By wild October fires -- fell back and left A field of bloody agony and death About the base , and victory on the hill . " I lost a score of riflemen that night ; My first lieutenant -- his last battle over --  Lay cut in twain upon the battle-line . With lantern dim wide o'er the slaughter-field I searched at midnight for my wounded men , But chiefly searched for Paul . An hour or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the dim light turning up The ghastly faces , till at last I found Him whom I sought , and on the outer line --  Feet to the foe and silent face to heaven --  Death pale and bleeding from a ragged wound Pleading with feeble voice to let him be And die upon the field , we bore him thence ; And tenderly his comrades carried him , Sheltered with blankets , on the weary march At dead of night in dismal storm begun . We made a stand at Harrison 's , and there With careful hands we laid him on a cot . Now I had learned to prize the noble boy ; My heart was touched with pity . Patiently I watched o'er Paul and bathed his fevered brow , And pressed the cooling sponge upon his lips , And washed his wound and gave him nourishment . ' T was all in vain , the surgeon said . I felt That I could save him and I kept my watch . A rib was crushed -- beneath it one could see The throbbing vitals -- torn as we supposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaned and muttered mysteries , And , dreaming , spoke in low and tender tones As if some loved one sat beside his cot . I questioned him and sought the secret key To solve his mystery , but all in vain . A month of careful nursing turned the scale , And he began to gain upon his wound . Propt in his cot one evening as he sat And I sat by him , thus I questioned him : ' There is a mystery about your life That I would gladly fathom . Paul , I think You well may trust me , and I fain would hear The story of your life ; right well I know There is a secret sorrow in your heart . ' Illustration : STOOPING AND TO THE DIM LIGHT TURNING UP THE GHASTLY FACES , TILL I AT LAST I FOUND HIM WHOM I SOUGHT . " He turned his face and fixed his lustrous eyes Upon mine own inquiringly , and held His gaze upon me till his vacant stare Told me full well his thoughts had wandered back Into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and sadly smiled and said : " ' Captain , I have no history -- not one page ; My book of life is but a blotted blank . Let it be sealed ; I would not open it , Even to one who saved a worthless life , Only to add a few more leaves in blank To the blank volume . All that I now am I offer to my country . If I live And from this cot walk forth , ' twill only be To march and fight and march and fight again , ' Until a surer aim shall bring me down Where care and kindness can no more avail . Under our country 's flag a soldier 's death I hope to die and leave no name behind . My only wish is this -- for what I am , Or have been , or have hoped to be , is now A blank misfortune . I will say no more . ' " I questioned Paul and pressed him further still To tell his story , but he only shook His head in silence sadly and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That night he muttered often in his sleep ; I could not catch the sense of what he said ; I caught a name that he repeated oft --  Pauline -- so softly whispered that I knew She was the blissful burden of his dreams . " Two moons had waxed and waned , and Paul arose , Came to the camp and shared my tent and bed . While in the hospital he helpless lay --  To him unknown , and as the choice of all --  Came his promotion to the vacant rank Of him who fell at Malvern . But , alas , Say what we would he would not take the place . To us who importuned him , he replied : ' Comrades and friends , I did not join your ranks For honor or for profit . All I am --  A wreck perhaps of what I might have been --  I freely offer in our country 's cause ; And in her cause it is my wish to serve A private soldier ; I aspire to naught But victory -- and there be better men --  Braver and hardier -- such should have the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methought , was sad . One evening as he sat upon his couch , Communing with himself as he was wont , I stood before him ; looking in his face , I said , ' Pauline -- her name is then , Pauline . ' All of a sudden up he rose amazed , And looked upon me with such startled eyes That I was pained and feared that I had done A wrong to him whom I had learned to love . Then he sat down upon his couch and groaned , Pressing his hand upon his wound , and said : ' Captain , I pray you , tell me truthfully , Wherefore you speak that name . ' " I told him all That I had heard him mutter in his dreams . He listened calmly to the close and said : ' My friend , if you have any kind regard For me who suffer more than you may know , I pray you utter not that name again . ' And thereupon he turned and hid his face . " There was a mystery I might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Nor could I further press that saddened heart To pour its secret sorrow in my ears . Thereafter Paul was tenant of my tent --  Sat at my mess and slept upon my couch , Save when his duty called him from my side , And not a word escaped his lips or mine About his secret -- yet how oft I found My eyes upon him and my bridled tongue Prone to a question ; but that solemn face Forbade me and he wore his mystery . " At that stern battle on Antietam 's banks , Where gallant Hooker led the fierce attack , Paul bore a glorious part . Our starry flag , Before a whirlwind of terrific fire , Advancing proudly on the foe , went down . Grim death and pale-faced panic seized the ranks . Paul caught the flag and waving it aloft Rallied our regiment . He came out unscathed . " At Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville he fought : Grim in disaster -- bravest in defeat , He leaped not into danger without cause , Nor shrunk he from it though a gulf of fire , When duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victory ; applause and praise He almost hated ; grimly he endured The fulsome flattery of his comrades nerved By his calm courage up to manlier deeds . " I saw him angered once -- if one might call His sullen silence anger -- as by night Across the Rappahannock , from the field Where brave and gallant ' Stonewall ' Jackson fell , With hopeless hearts and heavy steps we marched . Such sullen wrath on other human face I never saw in all those bloody years . One evening after , as he read to me The fulsome General Order of our Chief --  Congratulating officers and men On their achievements in the late defeat --  His handsome face grew rigid as he read , And as he closed , down like a thunder-clap Upon the mess-chest fell his clinched fist : ' Fit pap for fools ! ' he said -- 'an Iron Duke Had ground the Southern legions into dust , Or , by the gods !  - -  the field of Chancellorsville Had furnished graves for ninety thousand men ! ' B " That dark disaster sickened many a soul ; Stout hearts were sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard by the eagle 's crag , Loud cawed his fellows from afar to feast . Ill-omened bird -- his carrion-cries were vain ! Again our veteran eagles plumed their wings , And forth he fled from Montezuma 's shores --  A dastard flight -- betraying unto death Him whom he dazzled with a bauble crown . Just retribution followed swift and sure --  Germania 's eagles plucked him at Sedan . A gloomy month wore off , and then the news That Lee , emboldened by his late success , Had poured his legions upon Northern soil , Rung through the camps , and thrilled the mighty heart Of the Grand Army . Louder than the roar Of brazen cannon on the battle-field . Then rose and rolled our thunder-rounds of cheers . B Hooker had 90,000 men at Chancellorsville . We saw the dawn of victory -- we should meet Our wary foe upon familiar soil . We cheered the news , we cheered the marching-orders , We cheered our brave commander till the tears Ran down his cheeks . Up from its sullen gloom Leaped the Grand Army , as if God had writ With fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of swift victory . " We marched . As rolls the deep , resistless flood Of Mississippi , when the rains of June Have swelled his thousand northern fountain-lakes Above their barriers -- rolls with restless roar , Anon through rock-built gorges , and anon Down through the prairied valley to the sea , Gleaming and glittering in the summer sun , By field and forest on his winding way , So stretched and rolled the mighty column forth , Winding among the hills and pouring out Along the vernal valleys ; so the sheen Of moving bayonets glittered in the sun . And as we marched there rolled upon the air , Up from the vanguard-corps , a choral chant , Feeble at first and far and far away , But gathering volume as it rolled along And regiment after regiment joined the choir , Until an hundred thousand voices swelled The surging chorus , and the solid hills Shook to the thunder of the mighty song . And ere it died away along the line , The hill-tops caught the chorus -- rolled away From peak to peak the pealing thunder-chant , Clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' John Brown 's body lies moldering in the grave ; John Brown 's body lies moldering in the grave ; John Brown 's body lies moldering in the grave ; But his soul is marching on . Glory , Glory , Halleluia ! Glory , Glory , Halleluia ! Glory , Glory , Halleluia ! His soul is marching on ! ' " And far away The mountains echoed and re-echoed still --  " ' Glory , Glory , Halleluia ! Glory , Glory , Halleluia ! Glory , Glory , Halleluia ! His soul is marching on ! ' " Until the winds Bore the retreating echoes southward far , And the dull distance murmured in our ears . " Fast by the field where gallant Baker fell , We crossed the famous river and advanced To Frederick . There a transitory cloud Gloomed the Grand Army -- Hooker was relieved : Fell from command at victory 's open gate The dashing , daring , soul-inspiring chief , The idol of his soldiers , and they mourned . He had his faults -- they were not faults of heart --  His gravest -- fiery valor . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laurel plucked on rugged Kenesaw . Envy it was that wrought the hero 's fall , Envy , with hydra-heads and serpent-tongues , Hissed on the wolfish clamors of the Press . O fickle Fortune , how thy favors fall --  Like rain upon the just and the unjust ! Throughout the army , as the soldiers read The farewell-order , gloomy murmurs ran ; But our new chieftain cheered our drooping hearts . " That Meade would choose his battle-ground we knew , And if not his the gallant dash and dare That on Antietam 's bloody battle-field Snatched victory from defeat , our faith was firm That he would fight to win , and hold the reins Firmly in hand , nor sacrifice our lives In wild assaults and fruitless daring deeds . " From Taneytown , at mid-day , on the hills Of Gettysburg we heard the cannon boom . Our gallant Hancock rode full speed away ; We under Gibbon swiftly following him At midnight camped on Cemetery Hill . Sharp the initial combat of the grand On-coming battle , and the sulphurous smoke Hung in blue wreaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far Than met upon the field of Marathon . Or where the proud Carthago bowed to Rome . Hope of the North and Liberty -- the one ; Pride of the South -- the other . On the hills --  A rolling range of rugged , broken hills , Stretching from Round-Top northward , bending off And butting down upon a silver stream --  In open field our veteran regiments lay . Facing our battle-line and parallel --  Beyond the golden valley to the west --  Lay Seminary Ridge -- a crest of hills Covered with emerald groves and fields of gold Ripe for the harvest : on this rolling range , As numerous as the swarming ocean-fowl That perch in squadrons on some barren isle Far in the Arctic sea when summer 's sun With slanting spears invades the icy realm , The Southern legions lay upon their arms . As countless as the winter-evening stars That glint and glow above the frosted fields Twinkled and blazed upon that crest of hills The camp-fires of the foe . Two mighty hosts , Ready and panoplied for deadliest war , And eager for the combat where the prize Of victory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of toiling slaves in millions -- but for us , An empire grounded on the rights of man --  Lay on their arms awaiting innocent morn To light the field for slaughter to begin . " Silent above us spread the dusky heavens , Silent below us lay the smoky vale , Silent beyond , the dreadful crest of hills . Anon the neigh of horse , a sentry 's call , Or rapid hoof-beats of a flying steed Bearing an aid and orders , broke the dread , Portentous silence . I was worn and slept . " The call of bugles wakened me . The dawn Was stealing softly o'er the shadowy land , And morning grew apace . Broad in the east Uprose above the crest of hazy hills Like some broad shield by fabled giant borne , The golden sun , and flashed upon the field . Ripe for the harvest stood the golden grain , Nodding on gentle slopes and dewy hills . Ready for the harvest death 's grim reapers stood Waiting the signal with impatient steel ; And morning passed , and mid-day . Here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solitary cannon broke The myriad-voiced and dreadful monotone . So fled the anxious hours until the hills Sent forth their silent shadows to the east --  And then their batteries opened on our left Advanced into the valley . All along The rolling crest of Seminary Ridge Rolled up the smoke of cannon . Answered then The grim artillery on our chain of hills ' And heaven was hideous with the bellowing boom , The whiz of shot , the infernal shrieks of shells . Down from the hills their charging columns came A glittering mass of steel . As when the snow Piled by an hundred winters on the peak Of cloud-robed Bernard thunders down the cliffs , Nor rocks nor forests stay the mighty mass , And men and flocks in terror fly the death , So thundering fell the columns of the foe , Crushing through Sickles ' corps in front and flank ; And , roaring onward like a mighty wind , They rushed for Little Round-Top -- rugged hill , Key to our left and center -- all exposed --  Manned by a broken battery half unmanned . But Hancock saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panting like a hound , That stalwart soldier -- Spartan to the soles --  Came dashing down where , prone along the ridge Upon the right , our sheltered regiment lay . ' By the left flank , forward -- double-quick ! '  - -  We sprang And dashed for Little Round-Top ; formed our line Flanking the broken battery . Up the slope , Like frightened sheep when howling wolves pursue , Fled Sickles ' men in panic : hard behind On came the Rebel columns . Hat in hand Waving and shouting to his eager corps --  Rode gallant Longstreet leading on the foe . " Where yonder field-wall bounds the trampled wheat By grove and meadow , see -- among the trees --  Their bayonets gleam advancing . Line on line , Column on column , in the field beyond , Their hurrying ranks crowd glittering on and on . High at the head their flaunting colors fly ; High o'er the roar their wild , triumphant yell Shrills like the scream of panthers .

Even as a cyclone , growling thunder , roars Down through a dusky forest , and its path Is strown with broken and uprooted pines Promiscuous piled in broad and broken swaths , So crashed our volleys through their serried ranks , Mowing great swaths of death ; yet on and on , Closing the gaps and yelling like the fiends That Dante heard along the gulf of hell , Still came our furious foes . A cloud of smoke --  Dense , sulphurous , stifling -- covered all our ranks . Our steady , deadly rifles crackled still , And still their crashing volleys rolled and roared . Our rifles blazed upon the blaze below ; The blaze below upon the blaze above , And in the blaze the buzz of myriad bees Whose stings were deadlier than the Libyan asp . Five times our colors fell -- five times arose Defiant , flapping on the broken wall . C These are the very words used by General Hancock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either hand Our foes out-flank us , leap the sheltering wall And pour their deadly , enfilading fire .

Cannon-roar down on the left !  - -  Our batteries are there --  Hurling hot hell-fire '  - -  See !  - -  like sickled corn The close-ranked foemen fall in toppling swaths : But still with hurried steps and steady steel They close the gaps -- like madmen they press on ! With one wild yell they rush upon the wall ! Lo from our lines a sheet of crackling fire Scorches their grimy faces -- back they reel And tumble -- down and down -- a writhing mass Of slaughter and defeat ! " Leaped on the wall A thousand Blues and swung their caps in air , Thundering their wild Hurra ! above the roar And crash of cannon ;  - -  victory was ours . Back to his crest of hills the baffled foe Reluctant turned and fled the storm of death . " The smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodside piled with slaughter-heaps ! And lo the meadow dotted with the slain ! And lo the ranks of dead and dying men That fighting fell behind the broken wall ! " Only a handful of my men remained ; The rest lay dead or wounded on the field ; Nor skulked their captain , but by grace was spared . Behold the miracle !  - -  This Bible holds , Embedded in its leaves , the Rebel lead Aimed at my heart . But here a scratch and there --  Not worth the mention where so many fell . Paul , foremost ever in the deadly hail , As if protected by a shield unseen , Escaped unscathed . " We camped upon the hill . Night hovered o'er us on her dusky wings ; Then all along our lines upon the hills Blazed up the evening camp-fires . Facing us Beyond the smoke-robed valley sparkled up A chain of fires on Seminary Ridge . A hum of mingled voices filled the air . As when upon the vast , hoarse-moaning sea And all along the rock-built somber shore Murmurs the menace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The plash and seethe of surf upon the sand , The roll of distant thunder in the heavens , Unite and blend in one prevailing voice --  So rose the mingled murmurs of our camps , So rose the groans and moans of wounded men Along the slope and valley , and so rolled From yonder frowning parallel of hills The muttered menace of our baffled foes ; And so from camp to camp and hill to hill Rolled the deep mutter and the dreadful moan Of an hundred thousand voices blent in one . " That night a multitude of friends and foes Slept soundly -- but they slept to wake no more . But few indeed among the living slept ; We lay upon our arms and courted sleep With open eyes and ears : the fears and hopes That centered in the half-fought battle held The balm of slumber from our weary limbs . Anon the rattle of the random fire Broke on our drowsy ears and startled us , As one is startled by some horrid dream ; Whereat old veterans muttered in their sleep . " Midnight had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose and sat upon the sward . He said : ' I can not sleep ; unbidden thoughts That will not down crowd on my restless brain . Captain , I know not how , but still I know That I shall see but one more sunrise . Morn Will bring the clash of arms -- to-morrow 's sun Will look upon unnumbered ghastly heaps And gory ranks of dead and dying men , And ere it sink beyond the western hills Up from this field will roll a mighty shout Victorious , echoed over all the land , Proclaiming joy to freemen everywhere . And I shall fall . I can not tell you how I know it -- but I feel it in my soul . I pray that death may spare me till I hear Our shout of " Victory ! " rolling o'er these hills : Then will I lay me down and die in peace . ' " I lightly said -- 'Sheer superstition , Paul ; I 'll wager a month 's pay you 'll live to fight A dozen battles yet .

Death has no terror for a heart like mine : Say what you may and call it what you will --  I know that I shall fall to rise no more Before the sunset of the coming day . If this be superstition -- still I know ; If this be fear it will not hold me back . ' I answered : " ' Friend , I hope this prophecy Will prove you a false prophet ; but , my Paul , Have you no farewells for your friends at home ? No message for a nearer , dearer one ? ' " ' None ; there is none I knew in other days Knows where or what I am . So let it be . If there be those -- not many -- who may care For one who cares so little for himself , Surely my soldier-name in the gazette Among the killed will bring no pang to them . And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , for fatigue O'ercame me and I slept . " The picket guns At random firing wakened me . The morn Came stealing softly o'er the somber hills ; Dark clouds of smoke hung hovering o'er the field . Blood-red as risen from a sea of blood , The tardy sun as if in dread arose , And hid his face in the uprising smoke . As when the pale moon , envious of the glow And gleam and glory of the god of day , Creeps in by stealth between the earth and him , Eclipsing all his glory , and the green Of hills and dales is changed to yellowish dun , So fell the strange and lurid light of morn . And as I gazed I heard the hunger-cries Of vultures circling on their dusky wings Above the smoke-hid valley ; then they plunged To gorge themselves upon the slaughter-heaps , As at the Buddhist temples in Siam Whereto the hideous vultures flock to feast With famished dogs upon the pauper dead . " The day wore on . Two mighty armies stood **27;2357;TOOLONG to assault ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against its glittering steel . As in the jungles of the Chambeze --  Glaring defiance with their fiery eyes --  Two tawny lions -- rival monarchs -- meet And fright the forest with their horrid roar ; But ere they close in bloody combat crouch And wait and watch for vantage in attack ; So on their bannered hills the opposing hosts , Eager to grapple in the tug of death , Waited and watched for vantage in the fight . Noon came . The fire of pickets died away . All eyes were turned to Seminary Ridge , For lo our sullen foemen -- park on park --  Had massed their grim artillery on our corps . Hoarse voices sunk to whispers or were hushed ; The rugged hills stood listening in awe ; So dread the ominous silence that I heard The hearts of soldiers throbbing along the line . " Up from yon battery curled a cloud of smoke , Shrieked o'er our heads a solitary shell ,  --  Then instantly in horrid concert roared Two hundred cannon on the Rebel hills --  Hurling their hissing thunderbolts -- and then An hundred bellowing cannon from our lines Thundered their iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From hill to hill the reverberating roar , As if the earth were bursting with the throes Of some vast pent volcano ; rocked and reeled , As in an earthquake-shock , the solid hills ; Anon huge fragments of the hillside rocks , And limbs and splinters of shot-shattered trees Danced in the smoke like demons ; hissed and howled The crashing shell-storm bursting over us . Prone on the earth awaiting the grand charge , To which we knew the heavy cannonade Was but a prelude , for two hours we lay --  Two hours that tried the very souls of men --  And many a brave man never rose again . Then ceased our guns to swell the infernal roar ; The roll and crash of cannon in our front Lulled , and we heard the foeman 's bugle-calls . Then from the slopes of Seminary Ridge Poured down the storming columns of the foe . As when the rain-clouds from the rim of heaven Are gathered by the four contending winds , And madly whirled until they meet and clash Above the hills and burst -- down pours a sea And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surging columns of our foes Adown the slopes and spread along the vale In glittering ranks of battle -- line on line --  Mile-long . Above the roar of cannon rose In one wild yell the Rebel battle-cry . Flash in the sun their serried ranks of steel ; Before them swarm a cloud of skirmishers . That eager host the gallant Pickett leads ; He right and left his fiery charger wheels ; Steadies the lines with clarion voice ; anon His outstretched saber gleaming points the way . As mid the myriad twinkling stars of heaven Flashes the blazing comet , and a column Of fiery fury follows it , so flashed The dauntless chief , so followed his wild host . " We waited grim and silent till they crossed The center and began the dread ascent . Then brazen bugles rang the clarion call ; Arose as one twice twenty thousand men , And all our hillsides blazed with crackling fire . With sudden crash and simultaneous roar An hundred cannon opened instantly , And all the vast hills shuddered under us . Yelling their mad defiance to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As when upon the wooded mountain-side The unchained LokiD riots and the winds Of an autumnal tempest lash the flames , Whirling the burning fragments through the air --  Huge blazing limbs and tops of blasted pines --  Mowing wide swaths with circling scythes of fire , So fell our fire upon the advancing host , And lashed their ranks and mowed them into heaps , Cleaving broad avenues of death . Still on And up they come undaunted , closing up The ghastly gaps and firing as they come . As if protected by the hand of heaven , Rides at their head their gallant leader still ; The tempest drowns his voice -- his naming sword Gleams in the flash of rifles . One wild yell -- Like the mad hunger-howl of famished wolves Midwinter on the flying cabris ' E trail , Swelled by ten thousand hideous voices , shrills , And through the battle-smoke the bravest burst . Flutters their tattered banner on our wall ! Thunders their shout of victory ! Appalled Our serried ranks are broken -- but in vain ! On either hand our cannon enfilade , Crushing great gaps along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mowing the toppling swaths of daring men . Behold -- they falter !  - -  Ho !  - -  they break !  - -  they fly ! With one wild cheer that shakes the solid hills Spring to the charge our eager infantry . Headlong we press them down the bloody slope , Headlong they fall before our leveled steel And break in wild disorder , cast away Their arms and fly in panic . All the vale Is spread with slaughter and wild fugitives . Wide o'er the field the scattered foemen fly ; Dread havoc and mad terror swift pursue Till battle is but slaughter . Thousands fall --  Thousands surrender , and the Southern flag Is trailed upon the field . D Norse fire-fiend E Cabri -- the small , fleet antelope of the northern plains , so called by the Crees and half-breeds . " The day was ours , And well we knew the worth of victory . Loud rolled the rounds of cheers from corps to corps ; Comrades embraced each other ; iron men Shed tears of joy like women ; men profane Fell on their knees and thanked Almighty God . Then ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill-tops shouted unto heaven ; The welkin shouted to the shouting hills -- And heavens and hill-tops shouted ' Victory ! ' " Night with her pall had wrapped the bloody field . The little remnants of our regiment Were gathered and encamped upon the hill . Paul was not with them , and they could not tell Aught of him . I had seen him in the fight Bravest of all the brave . I saw him last When first the foremost foemen reached our wall , Thrusting them off with bloody bayonet , And shouting to his comrades , ' Steady , men ! ' Sadly I wandered back where we had met The onset of the foe . The rounds of cheers Repeated oft still swept from corps to corps , And as I passed along the line I saw Our dying comrades raise their weary heads , And cheer with feeble voices . Even in death The cry of victory warmed their hearts again . Paul lay upon the ground where he had fought , Fast by the flag that floated on the line . He slept -- or seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly pallor that I feared My Paul would never march and fight again . I raised his head -- he woke as from a dream ; I said , ' Be quiet -- you are badly hurt ; I 'll call a surgeon ; we will dress your wound . ' He gravely said : " ' T is vain ; for I have done With camp and march and battle . Ere the dawn Shall I be mustered out of your command , And mustered into the Grand Host of heaven . ' " I sought a surgeon on the field and found ; With me he came and opened the bloody blouse , Felt the dull pulse and sagely shook his head . A musket ball had done its deadly work ; There was no hope , he said , the man might live A day perchance -- but had no need of him . I called his comrades and we carried him , Stretched on his blankets , gently to our camp , And laid him by the camp-fire . As the light Fell on Paul 's face he took my hand and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear the cheers . My soul is glad . My days are numbered , but this glorious day --  Like some far beacon on a shadowy cape That cheers at night the storm-belabored ships --  Will light the misty ages from afar . This field shall be the Mecca . Here shall rise A holier than the Caaba where men kiss The sacred stone that flaming fell from heaven . But O how many sad and aching hearts Will mourn the loved ones never to return ! Thank God -- no heart will hope for my return ! Thank God -- no heart will mourn because I die ! Captain , at life 's mid-summer flush and glow , For him to die who leaves his golden hopes , His mourning friends and idol-love behind , It must be hard and seem a cruel thing . After the victory -- upon this field -- For me to die hath more of peace than pain ; For I shall leave no golden hopes behind , No idol-love to pine because I die , No friends to wait my coming or to mourn . They wait my coming in the world beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . ' T is but a gasp , and I shall pass the bound ' Twixt life and death -- through death to life again --  Where sorrow cometh never . Pangs and pains Of flesh or spirit will not pierce me there ; And two will greet me from the jasper walls --  God 's angels -- with a song of holy peace , And haste to meet me at the pearly gate , And kiss the death-damp from my silent lips , And lead me through the golden avenues --  Singing Hosanna -- to the Great White Throne . " So there he paused and calmly closed his eyes , And silently I sat and held his hand . After a time , when we were left alone , He spoke again with calmer voice and said : " Captain , you oft have asked my history , And I as oft refused . There is no cause Why I should longer hold it from my friend Who reads the closing chapter . It may teach One soul to lean upon the arm of Christ --  That hope and happiness find anchorage Only in heaven . While my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My lips were sealed to the unhappy tale ; Under my pride I hid a heavy heart . " I was ambitious in my boyhood days , And dreamed of fame and honors -- misty fogs That climb at morn the ragged cliffs of life , Veiling the ragged rocks and gloomy chasms , And shaping airy castles on the top With bristling battlements and looming towers ; But melt away into ethereal air Beneath the blaze of the mid-summer sun , Till cliffs and chasms and all the ragged rocks Are bare , and all the castles crumbled away . " There winds a river ' twixt two chains of hills --  Fir-capped and rugged monuments of time ; A level vale of rich alluvial land , Washed from the slopes through circling centuries , And sweet with clover and the hum of bees , Lies broad between the rugged , somber hills . Beneath a shade of willows and of elms The river slumbers in this meadowy lap . Down from the right there winds a babbling branch , Cleaving a narrower valley through the hills . A grand bald-headed hill-cone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch There towers another . I have seen the day When those bald heads were plumed with lofty pines . Below the branch and near the river bank , Hidden among the elms and butternuts , The dear old cottage stands where I was born . An English ivy clambers to the eaves ; An English willow planted by my hand Now spreads its golden branches o'er the roof Not far below the cottage thrives a town , A busy town of mills and merchandise --  Belle Meadows , fairest village of the vale . Behind it looms the hill-cone , and in front The peaceful river winds its silent way . Beyond the river spreads a level plain --  Once hid with somber firs -- a tangled marsh --  Now beautiful with fields and cottages , And sweet in spring-time with the blooming plum , And white with apple-blossoms blown like snow . Beyond the plain a lower chain of hills , In summer gemmed with fields of golden grain Set in the emerald of the beechen woods . In other days the village school-house stood Below our cottage on a grassy mound That sloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope a cluster of tall pines Crowning a copse of beech and evergreen . There in my boyhood days I went to school ; A maiden mistress ruled the little realm ; She taught the rudiments to rompish rogues , And walked a queen with magic wand of birch . My years were hardly ten when father died . Sole tenants of our humble cottage home My sorrowing mother and myself remained ; But she was all economy , and kept With my poor aid a comfortable house . I was her idol and she wrought at night To keep me at my books , and used to boast That I should rise above our humble lot . How oft I listened to her hopeful words --  Poured from the fountain of a mother 's heart Until I longed to wing the sluggard years That bore me on to what I hoped to be . " We had a garden-plat behind the house --  Beyond , an orchard and a pasture-lot ; In front a narrow meadow -- here and there Shaded with elms and branching butternuts . In spring and summer in the garden-plat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself at school -- no idle boy . " One bright May morning when the robins sang There came to school a stranger queenly fair , With eyes that shamed the ethereal blue of heaven , And golden hair in ringlets -- cheeks as soft , As fresh and rosy as the velvet blush Of summer sunrise on the dew-damp hills . Hers was the name I muttered in my dreams . For days my bashful heart held me aloof Although her senior by a single year ; But we were brought together oft in class , And when she learned my name she spoke to me , And then my tongue was loosed and we were friends . Before the advent of the steeds of steel Her sire -- a shrewd and calculating man --  Had lately come and purchased timbered-lands And idle mills , and made the town his home . And he was well-to-do and growing rich , And she her father 's pet and only child . In mind and stature for two happy years We grew together at the village school . We grew together !  - -  aye , our tender hearts There grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , and mine alike were hers ; We often stole away among the pines --  That stately cluster on the sloping hill --  And conned our lessons from the selfsame book , And learned to love each other o'er our tasks , While in the pine-tops piped the oriole , And from his branch the chattering squirrel chid Our guileless love and artless innocence . ' T was childish love perhaps , but day by day It grew into our souls as we grew up . Then there was opened in the prospering town A grammar school , and thither went Pauline . I missed her and was sad for many a day , Till mother gave me leave to follow her . In autumn -- in vacation -- she would come With girlish pretext to our cottage home . She often brought my mother little gifts , And cheered her with sweet songs and happy words ; And I would pluck the fairest meadow-flowers To grace a garland for her golden hair , And fill her basket from the butternuts That flourished in our little meadow field . I found in her all I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chanting the mellow music of our hopes , The silver-sandaled Autumn-hours tripped by . And mother learned to love her ; but she feared , Knowing her heart and mine , that one rude hand Might break our hopes asunder . Like a thief I often crept about her father 's house , Under the evening shadows , eager-eyed , Peering for one dear face , and lingered late To catch the silver music of one voice That from her chamber nightly rose to heaven . Her father 's face I feared -- a silent man , Cold-faced , imperative , by nature prone To set his will against the beating world ; Warm-hearted but heart-crusted .

A shadow fell across my sunny path ;  --  A hectic flush burned on my mother 's cheeks ; She daily failed and nearer drew to death . Pauline would often come with sun-lit face , Cheating the day of half its languid hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales and wizard minstrelsy : And mother loved her all the better for it . With feeble hands upon our sad-bowed heads , And in a voice all tremulous with tears , She said to us : ' Dear children , love each other --  Bear and forbear , and come to me in heaven ; ' And praying for us daily -- drooped and died . Illustration : " ' DEAR CHILDREN ? LOVE EACH OTHER ,  - -  BEAR AND FORBEAR , AND COME TO ME IN HEAVEN ' " " After the sad and solemn funeral , Alone and weeping and disconsolate , I sat at evening by the cottage door . I felt as if a dark and bitter fate Had fallen on me in my tender years . I seemed an aimless wanderer doomed to grope In vain among the darkling years and die . One only star shone through the shadowy mists . The moon that wandered in the gloomy heavens Was robed in shrouds ; the rugged , looming hills Looked desolate ;  - -  the silent river seemed A somber chasm , while my own pet lamb , Mourning disconsolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantom-form , Bleated in vain and would not heed my call . On weary hands I bent my weary head ; In gloomy sadness fell my silent tears . " An angel 's hand was laid upon my head --  There in the moonlight stood my own Pauline --  Angel of love and hope and holy faith --  She flashed upon me bowed in bitter grief , As falls the meteor down the night-clad heavens --  In silence . Then about my neck she clasped Her loving arms and on my shoulder drooped Her golden tresses , while her silent tears Fell warm upon my cheek like summer rain . Heart clasped to heart and cheek to cheek we sat ; The moon no longer gloomed -- her face was cheer ; The rugged hills were old-time friends again ; The peaceful river slept beneath the moon , And my pet lamb came bounding to our side And kissed her hand and mine as he was wont . Then I awoke as from a dream and said : ' Tell me , beloved , why you come to me In this dark hour -- so late -- so desolate ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rest While you are full of sorrow ? In my ear A spirit seemed to whisper --  " Arise and go To comfort him disconsolate . " Tell me , Paul , Why should you mourn your tender life away ? I will be mother to you ; nay , dear boy , I will be more . Come , brush away these tears . ' " My heart was full ; I kissed her pleading eyes : ' You are an angel sent by one in heaven , ' I said , ' to heal my heart , but I have lost More than you know . The cruel hand of death Hath left me orphan , friendless -- poor indeed , Saving the precious jewel of your love . And what to do ? I know not what to do , I feel so broken by a heavy hand . My mother hoped that I would work my way To competence and honor at the bar . But shall I toil in poverty for years To learn a science that so seldom yields Or wealth or honor save to silvered heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through thorns and brambles over ragged rocks ; But can I follow in the common path Trod by the millions , never to lift my head Above the busy hordes that delve and drudge For bare existence in this bitter world --  And be a mite , a midge , a worthless worm , No more distinguished from the common mass Than one poor polyp in the coral isle Is marked amid the myriads teeming there ? Yet ' t is not for myself . For you , Pauline , Far up the slippery heights of wealth and fame Would I climb bravely ; but if I would climb By any art or science , I must train Unto the task my feet for many years , Else I should slip and fall from rugged ways , Too badly bruised to ever mount again .

' I said : " ' Pauline , your prayers had rolled away The ponderous stone that closed the tomb of Christ ; And while they rise to heaven for my success I can not doubt , or I should doubt my God . I think I see a pathway through this gloom ; I have a kinsman '  - -  and I told her where --  ' A lawyer ; I have heard my mother say --  A self-made man with charitable heart ; And I might go and study under him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she sighed : ' Paul , can you leave me ? You may study here And here you are among your boyhood friends , And here I should be near to cheer you on . ' " I promised her that I would think of it --  Would see what prospect offered in the town ; And then we walked together half-embraced , But when we neared her vine-arched garden gate , She bade me stay and kissed me a good-night And bounded through the moonlight like a fawn . I watched her till she flitted from my sight , Then slowly homeward turned my lingering steps . I wrote my kinsman on the morrow morn , And broached my project to a worthy man Who kept an office and a case of books --  An honest lawyer . People called him learn 'd , But wanting tact and ready speech he failed . The rest were pettifoggers -- scurrilous rogues Who plied the village justice with their lies , And garbled law to suit the case in hand --  Mean , querulous , small-brained delvers in the mire Of men 's misfortunes -- crafty , cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the evil passions of weak men In petty wars , and plied their tongues profane With cunning words to argue honest fools Into their spider-meshes to be fleeced . I laid my case before him ; took advice --  Well-meant advice -- to leave my native town , And study with my kinsman whom he knew . A week rolled round and brought me a reply --  A frank and kindly letter -- giving me That which I needed most -- encouragement . But hard it was to fix my mind to go ; For in my heart an angel whispered ' Stay . ' It might be better for my after years , And yet perhaps , ' t were better to remain . I balanced betwixt my reason and my heart , And hesitated . Her I had not seen Since that sad night , and so I made resolve That we should meet , and at her father 's house . So whispering courage to my timid heart I went . With happy greeting at the door She met me , but her face was wan and pale --  So pale and wan I feared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she sighed , And sat in silence for a little time , Then said : " ' God bless you , Paul , may be ' t is best --  I sometimes feel it is not for the best , But I am selfish -- thinking of myself .

Remember , Paul , how I shall watch and wait ; So write me often : like the dew of heaven To withering grass will come your cheering words . To know that you are well and happy , Paul , And good and true , will wing the weary months . And let me beg you as a sister would --  Not that I doubt you but because I love --  Beware of wine -- touch not the treacherous cup , And guard your honor as you guard your life .

' " We sat in silence for a little time , And she was weeping , so I raised her face And kissed away her tears . She softly said : ' Paul , there is something I must say to you --  Something I have no time to tell you now ; But we must meet again before you go --  Under the pines where we so oft have met . Be this the sign , '  - -  She waved her graceful hand , ' Come when the shadows gather on the pines , And silent stars stand sentinel in heaven ; Now Paul , forgive me -- I must say -- good-bye . ' " I read her fear upon her anxious brow . Lingering and clasped within her loving arms I , through her dewy , deep , blue eyes , beheld Her inmost soul , and knew that love was there . Ah , then and there her father blustered in , And caught us blushing in each other 's arms ! He stood a moment silent and amazed : Then kindling wrath distorted all his face , He showered his anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stung my boyish pride ! O dagger words that stabbed my very soul ! I strove , but fury mastered -- up I sprang , And felt a giant as I stood before him . My breath was hot with anger ;  - -  impious boy --  Frenzied -- forgetful of his silvered hairs --  Forgetful of her presence , too , I raved , And poured a madman 's curses on his head . A moan of anguish brought me to myself ; I turned and saw her sad , imploring face , And tears that quenched the wild fire in my heart . I pressed her hand and passed into the hall , While she stood sobbing in a flood of tears , And he stood choked with anger and amazed . But as I passed the ivied porch he came With bated breath and muttered in my ear --  ' Beggar ! '  - -  It stung me like a serpent 's fang . Pride-pricked and muttering like a maniac , I almost flew the street and hurried home To vent my anger to the silent elms . ' Beggar ! ' an hundred times that long , mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paced the walk with hurried tread , and raved ; I threw myself beneath the willow-tree , And muttered like the muttering of a storm . My little lamb came bleating mournfully ; Angered I struck him ; out among the trees I wandered mumbling ' beggar ' as I went , And beating in through all my burning soul The bitter thoughts it conjured , till my brain Reeled and I sunk upon the dew-damp grass , And -- utterly exhausted -- slept till morn . " I dreamed a dream -- all mist and mystery . I saw a sunlit valley beautiful With purple vineyards and with garden-plats ; And in the vineyards and the garden-plats Were happy-hearted youths and merry girls Toiling and singing . Grandsires too were there , Sitting contented under their own vines And fig-trees , while about them merrily played Their children 's children like the sportive lambs That frolicked on the foot-hills . Low of kine , Full-uddered , homeward-wending from the meads , Fell on the ear as soft as Hulder 's loor Tuned on the Norse-land mountains . Like a nest Hid in a hawthorn-hedge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy bees . Illustration : PAUL 'S DREAM " On either hand Rose steep and barren mountains -- mighty cliffs Cragged and chasm 'd and over-grown with thorns ; And on the topmost peak a golden throne Blazoned with burning characters that read --  ' Climb ' it is yours . ' Not far above the vale I saw a youth , fair-browed and raven-haired , Clambering among the thorns and ragged rocks ; And from his brow with torn and bleeding hand He wiped great drops of sweat . Down through the vale I saw a rapid river , broad and deep , Winding in solemn silence to the sea --  The sea all mist and fog . Lo as I stood Viewing the river and the moaning sea , A sail -- and then another -- flitted down And plunged into the mist . A moment more , Like shapeless shadows of the by-gone years , I saw them in the mist and they were gone --  Gone !  - -  and the sea moaned on and seemed to say --  ' Gone -- and forever ! '  - -  So I gladly turned To look upon the throne -- the blazoned throne That sat upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had stood , A bed of ashes and a gray-haired man Sitting upon it bowed and broken down . And so the vision passed . " The rising sun Beamed full upon my face and wakened me , And there beside me lay my pet -- the lamb --  Gazing upon me with his wondering eyes , And all the fields were bright and beautiful , And brighter seemed the world . I rose resolved . I let the cottage and disposed of all ; The lamb went bleating to a neighbor 's field ; And oft my heart ached , but I mastered it . This was the constant burden of my brain --  ' Beggar ! '  - -  I 'll teach him that I am a man ; I 'll speak and he shall listen ; I will rise , And he shall see my course as I go up Round after round the ladder of success . Even as the pine upon the mountain-top Towers o'er the maple on the mountain-side , I 'll tower above him . Then will I look down And call him Father :  - -  He shall call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day drew nigh Of parting , and the promised sign was given . The night was dismal darkness -- not one star Twinkled in heaven ; the sad , low-moaning wind Played like a mournful harp among the pines . I groped and listened through the darkling grove , Peering with eager eyes among the trees , And calling as I peered with anxious voice One darling name . No answer but the moan Of the wind-shaken pines . I sat me down Under the dusky shadows waiting for her , And lost myself in gloomy reverie . Dim in the darksome shadows of the night , While thus I dreamed , my darling came and crept Beneath the boughs as softly as a hare , And whispered ' Paul '  - -  and I was at her side . We sat upon a mound moss-carpeted --  No eyes but God 's upon us , and no voice Spake to us save the moaning of the pines . Few were the words we spoke ; her silent tears , Our clasping , trembling , lingering embrace , Were more than words . Into one solemn hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two tender hearts that only dared to hope There swelled and throbbed to the electric touch Of love as holy as the love of Christ . She gave her picture and I gave a ring --  My mother's -- almost with her latest breath She gave it me and breathed my darling 's name . I girt her finger , and she kissed the ring In solemn pledge , and said : " ' I bring a gift --  The priceless gift of God unto his own : O may it prove a precious gift to you , As it has proved a precious gift to me ; And promise me to read it day by day --  Beginning on the morrow -- every day A chapter -- and I too will read the same . ' " I took the gift -- a precious gift indeed --  And you may see how I have treasured it . Here , Captain , put your hand upon my breast --  An inner pocket -- you will find it there . " I opened the bloody blouse and thence drew forth The Book of Christ all stained with Christian blood . He laid his hand upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent prayer . I held his weary head and bade him rest . He lay a moment silent and resumed : " Let me go on if you would hear the tale ; I soon shall sleep the sleep that wakes no more . O there were promises and vows as solemn As Christ 's own promises ; but as we sat The pattering rain-drops fell among the pines , And in the branches the foreboding owl With dismal hooting hailed the coming storm . So in that dreary hour and desolate We parted in the silence of our tears . " And on the morrow morn I bade adieu To the old cottage home I loved so well --  The dear old cottage home where I was born . Then from my mother 's grave I plucked a rose Bursting in bloom -- Pauline had planted it --  And left my little hill-girt boyhood world . I journeyed eastward to my journey 's end ; At first by rail for many a flying mile , By mail-coach thence from where the hurrying train Leaps a swift river that goes tumbling on Between a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seethes and foams The restless river round the roaring rocks , And then flows on a little way and pours Its laughing waters into a bridal lap . Its flood is fountain-fed among the hills ; Far up the mossy brooks the timid trout Lie in the shadow of vine-tangled elms . Out from the village-green the roadway leads Along the river up between the hills , Then climbs a wooded mountain to its top , And gently winds adown the farther side Unto a valley where the bridal stream Flows rippling , **32;2386;TOOLONG , And dancing onward with a merry song , Hastes to the nuptials . From the mountain-top --  A thousand feet above the meadowy vale --  She seems a chain of fretted silver wound With artless art among the emerald hills . Thence up a winding valley of grand views --  Hill-guarded -- firs and rocks upon the hills , And here and there a solitary pine Majestic -- silent -- mourns its slaughtered kin , Like the last warrior of some tawny tribe Returned from sunset mountains to behold Once more the spot where his brave fathers sleep . The farms along the valley stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . Tall elms and willow-trees Huge-trunked and ivy-hung stand sentinel Along the roadway walls -- storm-wrinkled trees Planted by men who slumber on the hills . Amid such scenes all day we rolled along , And as the shadows of the western hills Across the valley crept and climbed the slopes , The sunset blazed their hazy tops and fell Upon the emerald like a mist of gold . And at that hour I reached my journey 's end . The village is a gem among the hills --  Tall , towering hills that reach into the blue . One grand old mountain-cone looms on the left Far up toward heaven , and all around are hills . The river winds among the leafy hills Adown the meadowy dale ; a shade of elms And willows fringe it . In this lap of hills Cluster the happy homes of men content To let the great world worry as it will . The court-house park , the broad , bloom-bordered streets , Are avenues of maples and of elms --  Grander than Tadmor 's pillared avenue --  Fair as the fabled garden of the gods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offices and shops , All nestle in a dreamy wealth of woods . " Kind hearts received me . All that wealth could bring --  Refinement , luxury and ease -- was theirs ; But I was proud and felt my poverty , And gladly mured myself among the books To master ' the lawless science of the law . ' I plodded through the ponderous commentaries --  Some musty with the mildew of old age ; And these I found the better for their years , Like olden wine in cobweb-covered flasks . The blush of sunrise found me at my books ; The midnight cock-crow caught me reading still ; And oft my worthy master censured me : ' A time for work , ' he said , ' a time for play ; Unbend the bow or else the bow will break . ' But when I wearied -- needing sleep and rest --  A single word seemed whispered in my ear --  ' Beggar , ' it stung me to redoubled toil . I trod the ofttimes mazy labyrinths Of legal logic -- mined the mountain-mass Of precedents conflicting -- found the rule , Then branched into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallels --  Traced from a ' leading case ' through many tomes Back to the first decision on the ' point , ' And often found a pyramid of law Built with bad logic on a broken base Of careless ' dicta ; '  - -  saw how narrow minds Spun out the web of technicalities Till common sense and common equity Were strangled in its meshes . Here and there I came upon a broad , unfettered mind Like Murray's -- cleaving through the spider-webs Of shallower brains , and bravely pushing out Upon the open sea of common sense . But such were rare . The olden precedents --  Oft stepping-stones of tyranny and wrong --  Marked easy paths to follow , and they ruled The course of reason as the iron rails Rule the swift wheels of the down-thundering train . " I rose at dawn . First in this holy book I read my chapter . How the happy thought That my Pauline would read -- the self-same morn The self-same chapter -- gave the sacred text , Though I had heard my mother read it oft , New light and import never seen before . For I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was reading it , And when I came upon dear promises Of Christ to man , I read them o'er and o'er , Till in a holy and mysterious way They seemed the whisperings of Pauline to me . Later I learned to lay up for myself ' Treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust Corrupteth , and where thieves do not break through , Nor steal '  - -  and where my treasures all are laid My heart is , and my spirit longs to go . O friend , if Jesus was but man of man --  And if indeed his wondrous miracles Were mythic tales of priestly followers To chain the brute till Reason came from heaven --  Yet was his mission unto man divine . Man 's pity wounds , but Jesus ' pity heals : He gave us balm beyond all earthly balm ; He gave us strength beyond all human strength ; He taught us love above the low desires ; He taught us hope beyond all earthly hope ; He taught us charity wherewith to build From out the broken walls of barbarism , The holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote Pauline . Page after page was burdened with my love , My glowing hopes of golden days to come , And frequent boast of rapid progress made . With hungry heart and eager I devoured Her letters ; I re-read them twenty times . At morning when I laid the Gospel down I read her latest answer , and again At midnight by my lamp I read it over , And murmuring ' God bless her , ' fell asleep To dream that I was with her under the pines . " Thus fled four years -- four years of patient toil Sweetened with love and hope , and I had made Swift progress in my studies . Master said Another year would bring me to the bar --  No fledgeling but full-feathered for the field . And then her letters ceased . I wrote and wrote Again , but still no answer . Day after day The tardy mail-coach lagged a mortal hour , While I sat listening for its welcome horn ; And when it came I hastened from my books With hope and fear contending in my soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weary sigh . It wore upon me and I could not rest ; It gnawed me to the marrow of my bones . The heavy tomes grew dull and wearisome , And sometimes hateful ;  - -  then I broke away As from a prison and rushed wildly out Among the elms along the river-bank --  Baring my burning temples to the breeze --  And drank the air of heaven like sparkling wine --  Conjuring excuses for her ;  - -  was she ill ? Perhaps forbidden . Had another heart Come in between us ?  - -  No , that could not be ; She was all constancy and promise-bound . A month , which seemed to me a laggard year , Thus wore away . At last a letter came . O with what springing step I hurried back --  Back to my private chamber and my desk ! With what delight -- what eager , trembling hand --  The well-known seal that held my hopes I broke ! Thus ran the letter : " ' Paul , the time has come When we must both forgive while we forget . Mine was a girlish fancy . We outgrow Such childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and made an end . I can not wed myself to want , and curse My life life-long , because a girlish freak Of folly made a promise . So -- farewell . ' " My eyes were blind with passion as I read . I tore the letter into bits and stamped Upon them , ground my teeth and cursed the day I met her , to be jilted . All that night My thoughts ran riot . Round the room I strode A raving madman -- savage as a Sioux ; Then flung myself upon my couch in tears , And wept in silence , and then stormed again . ' Beggar ! ' it raised the serpent in my breast --  Mad pride -- bat-blind . I seized her pictured face And ground it under my heel . With impious hand I caught the book -- the precious gift she gave , And would have burned it , but that still small voice Spake in my heart and bade me spare the book . " Then with this Gospel clutched in both my hands , I swore a solemn oath that I would rise , If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And learn what she had lost.  - -  Yes , I would mount Merely to be revenged . I would not cringe Down like a spaniel underneath the lash , But like a man would teach my proud Pauline And her hard father to repent the day They called me ' beggar . ' Thus I raved and stormed That mad night out ;  - -  forgot at dawn of morn This holy book , but fell to a huge tome And read two hundred pages in a day . I could not keep the thread of argument ; I could not hold my mind upon the book ; I could not break the silent under-tow That swept all else from out my throbbing brain But false Pauline . I read from morn till night , But having closed the book I could not tell Aught of its contents . Then I cursed myself , And muttered -- 'Fool -- can you not shake it off --  This nightmare of your boyhood ?  - -  Brave , indeed --  Crushed like a spaniel by this false Pauline ! Crushed am I ?  - -  By the gods , I 'll make an end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So passed the weary days . My cheeks grew thin ; I needed rest , I said , and quit my books To range the fields and hills with fowling-piece And ' mal prepense ' toward the feathery flocks . The pigeons flew from tree-tops o'er my head ; I heard the flap of wings -- and they were gone ; The pheasant whizzed from bushes at my feet Unseen until its sudden whir of wings Startled and broke my wandering reverie ; And then I whistled and relapsed to dreams , Wandering I cared not whither -- wheresoe'er My silent gun still bore its primal charge . So gameless , but with cheeks and forehead tinged By breeze and sunshine , I returned to books . But still a phantom haunted all my dreams --  Awake or sleeping , for awake I dreamed --  A spectre that I could not chase away --  The phantom-form of my own false Pauline . " Six months wore off -- six long and weary months ; Then came a letter from a school-boy friend --  In answer to the queries I had made --  Filled with the gossip of my native town . Unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years at least --  Dame Rumor said Pauline had pledged her hand . I knew him well -- a sly and cunning man --  A honey-tongued , false-hearted flatterer . And he my rival -- carrying off my prize ? But what cared I ? ' t was all the same to me --  Yea , better for the sweet revenge to come . So whispered pride , but in my secret heart I cared , and hoped whatever came to pass She might be happy all her days on earth , And find a happy haven at the end . " My thoughtful master bade me quit my books A month at least , for I was wearing out . ' Unbend the bow , ' he said . His watchful eye Saw toil and care at work upon my cheeks ; He could not see the canker at my heart , But he had seen pale students wear away With overwork the vigor of their lives ; And so he gave me means and bade me go To romp a month among my native hills . I went , but not as I had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But clothed and mannered like a gentleman . " My school-boy friend gave me a cordial greeting ; That honest lawyer bade me welcome , too , And doted on my progress and the advice He gave me ere I left my native town . Since first the iron-horse had coursed the vale Five years had fled -- five prosperous , magic years , And well nigh five since I had left my home . These prosperous years had wrought upon the place Their wonders till I hardly knew the town . The broad and stately blocks of brick that shamed The weather-beaten wooden shops I knew Seemed the creation of some magic hand . Adown the river bank the town had stretched , Sweeping away the quiet grove of pines Where I had loved to ramble when a boy And see the squirrels leap from tree to tree With reckless venture , hazarding a fall To dodge the ill-aimed arrows from my bow . The dear old school-house on the hill was gone : A costly church , tall-spired and built of stone Stood in its stead -- a monument to man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope was bare and desolate . Old faces had grown older ; some were gone , And many unfamiliar ones had come . Boys in their teens had grown to bearded men , And girls to womanhood , and all was changed , Save the old cottage-home where I was born . The elms and butternuts in the meadow-field Still wore the features of familiar friends ; The English ivy clambered to the roof , The English willow spread its branches still , And as I stood before the cottage-door My heart-pulse quickened , for methought I heard My mother 's footsteps on the ashen floor . " The rumor I had heard was verified ; The wedding-day was named and near at hand . I met my rival : gracious were his smiles : Glad as a boy that robs the robin 's nest He grasped the hands of half the men he met . Pauline , I heard , but seldom ventured forth , Save when her doting father took her out On Sabbath morns to breathe the balmy air , And grace with her sweet face his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Made daily visits to her father 's house , And played the boy at forty years or more , While she had held him off to draw him on . Illustration " I would not fawn upon the hand that smote ; I would not cringe beneath its cruel blow , Nor even let her know I cared for it . I kept aloof -- as proud as Lucifer . But when the church-bells chimed on Sabbath morn To that proud monument of stone I went --  Her father 's pride , since he had led the list Of wealthy patrons who had builded it --  To hear the sermon -- for methought Pauline Would hear it too . Might I not see her face , And she not know I cared to look upon it ? She came not , and the psalms and sermon fell Upon me like an autumn-mist of rain . I met her once by chance upon the street --  The day before the appointed wedding-day --  Her and her father -- she upon his arm . ' Paul -- O Paul ! ' she said and gave her hand . I took it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Yes , I remembered ; five long years ago --  And I had made so many later friends , And she had lost so much of maiden bloom ! ' Then turning met her father face to face , Bowed with cold grace and haughtily passed on . ' This is revenge , ' I muttered . Even then My heart ached as I thought of her pale face , Her pleading eyes , her trembling , clasping hand ! And then and there I would have turned about To beg her pardon and an interview , But pride -- that serpent ever in my heart --  Hissed ' beggar , ' and I cursed her with the lips That oft had poured my love into her ears . ' She marries gold to-morrow -- let her wed ! She will not wed a beggar , but I think She 'll wed a life-long sorrow -- let her wed ! Aye -- aye -- I hope she 'll live to curse the day Whereon she broke her sacred promises . And I forgive her ? yea , but not forget . I 'll take good care that she shall not forget ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her future . Let her marry gold ! ' Thus ran my muttered words , but in my heart There ran a counter-current ; ere I slept Its silent under-tow had mastered all --  ' Forgive and be forgiven . ' I resolved That on the morning of her wedding-day Would I go kindly and forgive Pauline , And send her to the altar with my blessing . That night I read a chapter in this book --  The first for many months , and fell asleep Beseeching God to bless her . Then I dreamed That we were kneeling at my mother 's bed --  Her death-bed , and the feeble , trembling hands Of her who loved us rested on our heads , And in a voice all tremulous with tears My mother said : ' Dear children , love each other ; Bear and forbear , and come to me in heaven . ' " I wakened once -- at midnight -- a wild cry --  ' Paul , O Paul ! ' rang through my dreams and broke My slumber . I arose , but all was still , And then I , slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dear , sweet face appeared --  Now radiant as a star , and now all pale --  Now glad with smiles and now all wet with tears . Then came a dream that agonized my soul , While every limb was bound as if in chains . Methought I saw her in the silent night Leaning o'er misty waters dark and deep : A moan -- a plash of waters -- and , O Christ !  --  Her agonized face upturned -- imploring hands Stretched out toward me , and a wailing cry --  ' Paul , O Paul ! ' Then face and hands went down , And o'er her closed the deep and dismal flood Forever -- but it could not drown the cry : ' Paul , O Paul ! ' was ringing in my ears ; ' Paul , O Paul ! ' was throbbing in my heart ; And moaning , sobbing in my shuddering soul Trembled the wail of anguish --  ' Paul , O Paul ! ' " Then o'er the waters stole the silver dawn , And lo a fairy boat with silken sail ! And in the boat an angel at the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved . The white mists parted as the boat sped on In silence , lessening far and far away . And then the sunrise glimmered on the sail A moment , and the angel turned her face : My mother !  - -  and I gave a joyful cry , And stretched my hands , but lo the hovering mists Closed in around them and the vision passed . " The morning sun stole through the window-blinds And fell upon my face and wakened me , And I lay musing -- thinking of Pauline . Yes , she should know the depths of all my heart --  The love I bore her all those lonely years ; The hope that held me steadfast to my toil , And feel the higher and the holier love Her precious gift had wakened in my soul . Yea , I would bless her for that precious gift --  I had not known its treasures but for her , And O for that would I forgive her all , And bless the hand that smote me to the soul . That would be comfort to me all my days , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T would pain her less to know that I forgave . " A hasty rapping at my chamber-door ; In came my school-boy friend whose guest I was , And said : ' Come , Paul , the town is all ablaze ! A sad -- a strange -- a marvelous suicide ! Pauline , who was to be a bride to-day , Was missed at dawn and after sunrise found --  Traced by her robe and bonnet on the bridge , Whence she had thrown herself and made an end --  ' " And he went on , but I could hear no more ; It fell upon me like a flash from heaven . As one with sudden terror dumb , I turned And in my pillow buried up my face . Tears came at last , and then my friend passed out In silence . O the agony of that hour ! O doubts and fears and half-read mysteries That tore my heart and tortured all my soul ! " I arose . About the town the wildest tales And rumors ran ; dame Gossip was agog . Some said she had been ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others shook their heads But none could fathom the marvelous mystery . Bearing a bitter anguish in my heart , Half-crazed with dread and doubt and boding fears , Hour after hour alone , disconsolate , Among the scenes where we had wandered oft I wandered , sat where once the stately pines Domed the fair temple where we learned to love . O spot of sacred memories -- how changed ! Yet chiefly wanting one dear , blushing face That , in those happy days , made every place Wherever we might wander -- hill or dale --  Garden of love and peace and happiness . So heavy-hearted I returned . My friend Had brought for me a letter with his mail . I knew the hand upon the envelope --  With throbbing heart I hastened to my room ; With trembling hands I broke the seal and read . One sheet inclosed another -- one was writ At midnight by my loved and lost Pauline . Inclosed within , a letter false and forged , Signed with my name -- such perfect counterfeit , At sight I would have sworn it was my own . And thus her letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as my heart forgives . Even as a vine that winds about an oak , Rot-struck and hollow-hearted , for support , Clasping the sapless branches as it climbs With tender tendrils and undoubting faith , I leaned upon your troth ; nay , all my hopes --  My love , my life , my very hope of heaven --  I staked upon your solemn promises . I learned to love you better than my God ; My God hath sent me bitter punishment . O broken pledges ! what have I to live And suffer for ? Half mad in my distress , Yielding at last to father 's oft request , I pledged my hand to one whose very love Would be a curse upon me all my days . To-morrow is the promised wedding day ; To morrow !  - -  but to-morrow shall not come ! Come gladlier , death , and make an end of all ! How many weary days and patiently I waited for a letter , and at last It came -- a message crueler than death . O take it back !  - -  and if you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Read it -- and think of those dear promises --  O sacred as the Savior 's promises --  You whispered in my ear that solemn night Beneath the pines , and kissed away my tears . And know that I forgive , beloved Paul : Meet me in heaven . God will not frown upon The sin that saves me from a greater sin , And sends my soul to Him . Farewell -- Farewell . ' " Here he broke down . Unto his pallid lips I held a flask of wine . He sipped the wine And closed his eyes in silence for a time , Resuming thus : " You see the wicked plot . We both were victims of a crafty scheme To break our hearts asunder . Forgery Had done its work and pride had aided it . The spurious letter was a cruel one --  Casting her off with utter heartlessness , And boasting of a later , dearer love , And begging her to burn the billets-doux A moon-struck boy had sent her ere he found That pretty girls were plenty in the world . " Think you my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand was on my head . A keen remorse Gnawed at my heart . O false and fatal pride That blinded me , else I had seen the plot Ere all was lost -- else I had saved a life To me most precious of all lives on earth --  Yea , dearer then than any soul in heaven ! False pride -- the ruin of unnumbered souls --  Thou art the serpent ever tempting me ; God , chastening me , has bruised thy serpent head . O faithful heart in silence suffering --  True unto death to one she could but count A perjured villain , cheated as she was ! Captain , I prayed -- 'twas all that I could do . God heard my prayer , and with a solemn heart , Bearing the letters in my hand , I went To ask a favor of the man who crushed And cursed my life -- to look upon her face --  Only to look on her dear face once more . " I rung the bell -- a servant bade me in . I waited long . At last the father came --  All pale and suffering . I could see remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled like a culprit on the drop . ' O , sir , ' he said , ' whatever be your quest , I pray you leave me with my dead to-day ; I can not look on any living face Till her dead face is gone forevermore . ' " ' And who hath done this cruel thing ? ' I said . ' Explain , ' he faltered . ' Pray you , sir , explain ! ' I said , and thrust the letters in his hand . And as he sat in silence reading hers , I saw the pangs of conscience on his face ; I saw him tremble like a stricken soul ; And then a tear-drop fell upon his hand ; And there we sat in silence . Then he groaned And fell upon his knees and hid his face , And stretched his hand toward me wailing out --  ' I can not bear this burden on my soul ; O Paul !  - -  O God ! forgive me or I die . ' " His anguish touched my heart . I took his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , forgive him , for he knew not what He did who broke the bond that bound us twain . O may her spirit whisper in his ear Forever -- God is love and all is well . " The iron man -- all bowed and broken down --  Sobbed like a child . He laid his trembling hand With many a fervent blessing on my head , And , with the crust all crumbled from his heart , Arose and led me to her silent couch ; And I looked in upon my darling dead . Mine -- O mine in heaven forevermore ! God 's angel sweetly smiling in her sleep ; How beautiful -- how radiant of heaven ! The ring I gave begirt her finger still ; Her golden hair was wreathed with immortelles ; The lips half-parted seemed to move in psalm Or holy blessing . As I kissed her brow , It seemed as if her dead cheeks flushed again As in those happy days beneath the pines ; And as my warm tears fell upon her face , Methought I heard that dear familiar voice So full of love and faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away , So mortal , yet so spiritual -- like an air Of softest music on the slumbering bay Wafted on midnight wings to silent shores , When myriad stars are twinkling in the sea : Illustration : ' AND I LOOKED IN UPON MY DARLING DEAD . ' " ' Paul , O Paul , forgive and be forgiven ; Earth is all trial ;  - -  there is peace in heaven . ' " Aye , Captain , in that sad and solemn hour I laid my hand upon the arm of Christ , And he hath led me all the weary way To this last battle . I shall win through Him ; And ere you hear the reveille again Paul and Pauline , amid the psalms of heaven , Embraced will kneel and at the feet of God Receive His benediction . Let me sleep . You know the rest ;  - -  I 'm weary and must sleep . An angel 's bugle-blast will waken me , But not to pain , for there is peace in heaven .

" Anon he clutched with eager , nervous hand , And in hoarse whisper shouted --  " Steady , men ! " Then sunk again . Thus passed an hour or more And he woke , half-raised himself and said With feeble voice and eyes strange luster-lit : " Captain , my boat is swiftly sailing out Into the misty and eternal sea From out whose waste no mortal craft returns . The fog is closing round me and the mist Is damp and cold upon my hands and face . Why should I fear ?  - -  the loved have gone before : I seem to hear the plash of coming oars ; The mists are lifting and the boat is near . ' T is well . To die as I am dying now --  A soldier 's death amid the gladsome shouts Of victory for which my puny hands Did their full share , albeit it was small , Was all my late ambition . Bring the Flag , And hold it over my head . Let me die thus Under the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words became inaudible , As in the mazes of the Mammoth Cave , Fainter and fainter on the listening ear , The low , retreating voices die away . His eyes were closed ; a gentle smile of peace Sat on his face .

" As I arose The gray dawn paled the shadows in the east . THE SEA-GULL. 1 THE LEGEND OF THE PICTURED ROCKS OF LAKE SUPERIOR . OJIBWAY In the measure of Hiawatha . The numerals refer to Notes to The Sea-Gull , in Appendix . On the shore of Gitchee Gumee2 --  Deep , mysterious , mighty waters --  Where the manitoes -- the spirits --  Ride the storms and speak in thunder , In the days of Neme-Shomis , 3 In the days that are forgotten , Dwelt a tall and tawny hunter --  Gitchee Pez-ze-u the Panther , Son of Waub-Ojeeg , 4 the warrior , Famous Waub-Ojeeg , the warrior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and very stealthy ; On the deer crept like a panther ; Grappled with Makwa , 5 the monster , Grappled with the bear and conquered ; Took his black claws for a necklet , Took his black hide for a blanket . When the Panther wed the Sea-Gull , Young was he and very gladsome ; Fair was she and full of laughter ; Like the robin in the spring-time , Sang from sunrise till the sunset ; For she loved the handsome hunter . Deep as Gitchee Gumee 's waters Was her love -- as broad and boundless ; And the wedded twain were happy --  Happy as the mated robins . When their first-born saw the sunlight Joyful was the heart of Panther , Proud and joyful was the mother . All the days were full of sunshine , All the nights were full of starlight . Nightly from the land of spirits On them smiled the starry faces --  Faces of their friends departed . Little moccasins she made him , Feathered cap and belt of wampum ; From the hide of fawn a blanket , Fringed with feathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By her side the tekenagun , 6 And the little hunter in it , Oft the Panther smiled and fondled , Smiled upon the babe and mother , Frolicked with the boy and fondled , Tall he grew and like his father , And they called the boy the Raven --  Called him Kak-kah-ge -- the Raven . Happy hunter was the Panther . From the woods he brought the pheasant , Brought the red deer and the rabbit , Brought the trout from Gitchee Gumee --  Brought the mallard from the marshes --  Royal feast for boy and mother : Brought the hides of fox and beaver , Brought the skins of mink and otter , Lured the loon and took his blanket , Took his blanket for the Raven . Winter swiftly followed winter , And again the tekenagun Held a babe -- a tawny daughter , Held a dark-eyed , dimpled daughter ; And they called her Waub-omee-mee Thus they named her -- the White-Pigeon . But as winter followed winter Cold and sullen grew the Panther ; Sat and smoked his pipe in silence ; When he spoke he spoke in anger ; In the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no game unto his wigwam ; Only brought his empty quiver , Brought his dark and sullen visage . Sad at heart and very lonely Sat the Sea-Gull in the wigwam ; Sat and swung the tekenagun Sat and sang to Waub-omee-mee : Thus she sang to Waub-omee-mee , Thus the lullaby she chanted : Wa-wa , wa-wa , wa-we-yea ; Kah-ween , nee-zheka ke-diaus-ai , Ke-gah nau-wai , ne-me-go s'ween , Ne-baun , ne-baun , ne-daun-is ais , Wa-wa , wa-wa , wa-we-yea ; Ne-baun , ne-baun , ne-daun-is-ais , E-we wa-wa , wa-we-yea , E-we wa-wa , wa-we-yea . TRANSLATION Swing , swing , little one , lullaby ; Thou'rt not left alone to weep ; Mother cares for you -- she is nigh ; Sleep , my little one , sweetly sleep ; Swing , swing , little one , lullaby ; Mother watches you -- she is nigh ; Gently , gently , wee one , swing ; Gently , gently , while I sing E-we wa-wa -- lullaby , E-we wa-wa -- lullaby . Homeward to his lodge returning Kindly greeting found the hunter , Fire to warm and food to nourish , Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a snare he caught the rabbit --  Caught Wabose , 7 the furry-footed , Caught Penay , 7 the forest-drummer ; Sometimes with his bow and arrows , Shot the red deer in the forest , Shot the squirrel in the pine-top , Shot Ne-ka , the wild-goose , flying . Proud as Waub-Ojeeg , the warrior , To the lodge he bore his trophies . So when homeward turned the Panther , Ever found he food provided , Found the lodge-fire brightly burning , Found the faithful Sea-Gull waiting . " You are cold , " she said , " and famished ; Here are fire and food , my husband . " Not by word or look he answered ; Only ate the food provided , Filled his pipe and pensive puffed it , Sat and smoked in sullen silence . Once -- her dark eyes full of hunger --  Thus she spoke and thus besought him : " Tell me , O my silent Panther , Tell me , O beloved husband , What has made you sad and sullen ? Have you met some evil spirit --  Met some goblin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filled your heart with bitter waters , That you sit so sad and sullen , Sit and smoke , but never answer , Only when the storm is on you ? " Gruffly then the Panther answered : " Brave among the brave is Panther Son of Waub-Ojeeg , the warrior , And the brave are ever silent ; But a whining dog is woman , Whining ever like a coward . " Forth into the tangled forest , Threading through the thorny thickets , Treading trails on marsh and meadow , Sullen strode the moody hunter . Saw he not the bear or beaver , Saw he not the elk or roebuck ; From his path the red fawn scampered , But no arrow followed after ; From his den the sly wolf listened , But no twang of bow-string heard he . Like one walking in his slumber , Listless , dreaming , walked the Panther ; Surely had some witch bewitched him , Some bad spirit of the forest . When the Sea-Gull wed the Panther , Fair was she and full of laughter ; Like the robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; But the storms of many winters Sifted frost upon her tresses , Seamed her tawny face with wrinkles . Not alone the storms of winters Seamed her tawny face with wrinkles . Twenty winters for the Panther Had she ruled the humble wigwam ; For her haughty lord and master Borne the burdens on the journey , Gathered fagots for the lodge-fire , Tanned the skins of bear and beaver , Tanned the hides of moose and red-deer ; Made him moccasins and leggins , Decked his hood with quills and feathers --  Colored quills of Kaug , 8 the thorny , Feathers from Kenew , 8 the eagle . For a warrior brave was Panther ; Often had he met the foemen , Met the bold and fierce Dakotas , Westward on the war-path met them ; And the scalps he won were numbered , Numbered seven by Kenew-feathers . Sad at heart was Sea-Gull waiting , Watching , waiting in the wigwam ; Not alone the storms of winters Sifted frost upon her tresses . Ka-be-bon-ik-ka , the mighty , 9 He that sends the cruel winter , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunder-mountain , Far across broad Gitchee Gumee , Sent his warning of the winter , Sent the white frost and Kewaydin , 10 Sent the swift and hungry North-wind . Homeward to the South the Summer Turned and fled the naked forests . With the Summer flew the robin , Flew the bobolink and blue-bird . Flock-wise following chosen leaders , Like the shaftless heads of arrows Southward cleaving through the ether , Soon the wild-geese followed after . One long moon the Sea-Gull waited , Watched and waited for her husband , Till at last she heard his footsteps , Heard him coming through the thicket . Forth she went to met her husband , Joyful went to greet her husband . Lo behind the haughty hunter , Closely following in his footsteps , Walked a young and handsome woman , Walked the Red Fox from the island --  Gitchee Menis the Grand Island --  Followed him into the wigwam , Proudly took her seat beside him . On the Red Fox smiled the hunter , On the hunter smiled the woman . Old and wrinkled was the Sea-Gull , Good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Panther Had she ruled the humble wigwam , Borne the burdens on the journey , Gathered fagots for the lodge-fire , Tanned the skins of bear and beaver , Tanned the hides of moose and red-deer , Made him moccasins and leggins , Decked his hood with quills and feathers , Colored quills of Kaug , the thorny , Feathers from the great war-eagle ; Ever diligent and faithful , Ever patient , ne'er complaining . But like all brave men the Panther Loved a young and handsome woman ; So he dallied with the danger , Dallied with the fair Algonkin , 11 Till a magic mead she gave him , Brewed of buds of birch and cedar. 12 Madly then he loved the woman ; Then she ruled him , then she held him Tangled in her raven tresses , Tied and tangled in her tresses . Ah , the tall and tawny Panther ! Ah , the brave and brawny Panther ! Son of Waub-Ojeeg , the warrior ! With a slender hair she led him , With a slender hair she drew him , Drew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there she held him Tangled in her raven tresses , Tied and tangled in her tresses . Ah , the best of men are tangled --  Sometimes tangled in the tresses Of a fair and crafty woman . So the Panther wed the Red Fox , And she followed to his wigwam . Young again he seemed and gladsome , Glad as Raven when the father Made his first bow from the elm-tree , From the ash-tree made his arrows , Taught him how to aim his arrows , How to shoot Wabose -- the rabbit . Then again the brawny hunter Brought the black bear and the beaver , Brought the haunch of elk and red-deer , Brought the rabbit and the pheasant --  Choicest bits of all for Red Fox . For her robes he brought the sable , Brought the otter and the ermine , Brought the black-fox tipped with silver . But the Sea-Gull murmured never , Not a word she spoke in anger , Went about her work as ever , Tanned the skins of bear and beaver , Tanned the hides of moose and red-deer , Gathered fagots for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into mats she wove them ; Kept the lodge as bright as ever . Only to herself she murmured , All alone with Waub-omee-mee , On the tall and toppling highland , O'er the wilderness of waters ; Murmured to the murmuring waters , Murmured to the Nebe-naw-baigs --  To the spirits of the waters ; On the wild waves poured her sorrow . Save the infant on her bosom With her dark eyes wide with wonder , None to hear her but the spirits , And the murmuring pines above her . Thus she cast away her burdens , Cast her burdens on the waters ; Thus unto the good Great Spirit , Made her lowly lamentation : " Wahonowin !  - -  showiness ! 13 Gitchee Manito , bena-nin ! Nah , Ba-ba , showain nemeshin ! Wahonowin !  - -  Wahonowin ! " Ka-be-bon-ik-ka , 9 the mighty , He that sends the cruel winter , From the distant Thunder-mountain On the shore of Gitchee Gumee , On the rugged northern border , Sent his solemn , final warning , Sent the white wolves of the Nor'land. 14 Like the dust of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the sparkling dust of diamonds , Fell the frost upon the forest , On the mountains and the meadows , On the wilderness of woodland , On the wilderness of waters . All the lingering fowls departed --  All that seek the South in winter , All but Shingebis , the diver ; 16 He defies the Winter-maker , Sits and laughs at Winter-maker . Ka-be-bon-ik-ka , the mighty , From his wigwam called Kewaydin --  From his home among the icebergs , From the sea of frozen waters , Called the swift and hungry North-wind . Then he spread his mighty pinions Over all the land and shook them . Like the white down of Waubese17 Fell the feathery snow and covered All the marshes and the meadows , All the hill-tops and the highlands . Then old Peboean18 -- the winter --  Laughed along the stormy waters , Danced upon the windy headlands , On the storm his white hair streaming , And his steaming breath , ascending , On the pine-tops and the cedars Fell in frosty mists of silver , Sprinkling spruce and fir with silver , Sprinkling all the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sea-Gull and the Red Fox , Sat and kindly spoke and chatted , Till the twain seemed friends together . Friends they seemed in word and action , But within the breast of either Smoldered still the baneful embers --  Fires of jealousy and hatred --  Like a camp-fire in the forest Left by hunters and deserted ; Only seems a bed of ashes , But the East wind , Wabun-noodin , Scatters through the woods the ashes , Fans to flame the sleeping embers , And the wild-fire roars and rages , Roars and rages through the forest . So the baneful embers smoldered , Smoldered in the breast of either . From the far-off Sunny Islands , From the pleasant land of Summer , Where the spirits of the blessed Feel no more the fangs of hunger , Or the cold breath of Kewaydin , Came a stately youth and handsome , Came Segun , 19 the foe of Winter . Like the rising sun his face was , Like the shining stars his eyes were , Light his footsteps as the Morning 's , In his hand were buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straightway to the icy wigwam Of old Peboean , the Winter , Strode Segun and quickly entered . There old Peboean sat and shivered , Shivered o'er his dying lodge-fire . " Ah , my son , I bid you welcome ; Sit and tell me your adventures ; I will tell you of my power ; We will pass the night together . " Thus spake Peboean -- the Winter ; Then he filled his pipe and lighted ; Then by sacred custom raised it To the spirits in the ether ; To the spirits in the caverns Of the hollow earth he lowered it . Thus he passed it to the spirits , And the unseen spirits puffed it . Next himself old Peboean honored ; Thrice he puffed his pipe and passed it , Passed it to the handsome stranger . " Lo I blow my breath , " said Winter , " And the laughing brooks are silent . Hard as flint become the waters , And the rabbit runs upon them . " Then Segun , the fair youth , answered : " Lo I breathe upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold as if by magic --  By the magic of the spirits , Spring the flowers and tender grasses . " Then old Peboean replying : " Nah ! 20 I breathe upon the forests , And the leaves fall sere and yellow ; Then I shake my locks and snow falls , Covering all the naked landscape . " Then Segun arose and answered : " Nashke ! 20 -- see !  - -  I shake my ringlets ; On the earth the warm rain falleth , And the flowers look up like children Glad-eyed from their mother 's bosom . Lo my voice recalls the robin , Brings the bobolink and bluebird , And the woods are full of music . With my breath I melt their fetters , And the brooks leap laughing onward . " Then old Peboean looked upon him , Looked and knew Segun , the Summer . From his eyes the big tears started And his boastful tongue was silent . Now Keezis -- the great life-giver , From his wigwam in Waubu-nong21 Rose and wrapped his shining blanket Round his giant form and started , Westward started on his journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed the ether --  On the Bridge of Stars22 he traveled , Westward traveled on his journey To the far-off Sunset Mountains --  To the gloomy land of shadows . On the lodge-poles sang the robin --  And the brooks began to murmur . On the South-wind floated fragrance Of the early buds and blossoms . From old Peboean 's eyes the tear-drops Down his pale face ran in streamlets ; Less and less he grew in stature Till he melted down to nothing ; And behold , from out the ashes , From the ashes of his lodge-fire , Sprang the Miscodeed23 and , blushing , Welcomed Segun to the North-land . So from Sunny Isles returning , From the Summer-Land of spirits , On the poles of Panther 's wigwam Sang Opee-chee -- sang the robin . In the maples cooed the pigeons --  Cooed and wooed like silly lovers . " Hah !  - -  hah ! " laughed the crow derisive , In the pine-top , at their folly --  Laughed and jeered the silly lovers . Blind with love were they , and saw not ; Deaf to all but love , and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray hawk pounced upon them , And the old crow shook with laughter . Illustration : SEGUN AND PEBOAN On the tall cliff by the sea-shore Red Fox made a swing . She fastened Thongs of moose-hide to the pine-tree , To the strong arm of the pine-tree . Like a hawk , above the waters , There she swung herself and fluttered , Laughing at the thought of danger , Swung and fluttered o'er the waters . Then she bantered Sea-Gull , saying , " See !  - -  I swing above the billows ! Dare you swing above the billows --  Swing like me above the billows ? " To herself said Sea-Gull --  " Surely I will dare whatever danger Dares the Red Fox -- dares my rival ; She shall never call me coward . " So she swung above the waters --  Dizzy height above the waters , Pushed and aided by her rival , To and fro with reckless daring , Till the strong tree rocked and trembled , Rocked and trembled with its burden . As above the yawning billows Flew the Sea-Gull like a whirlwind , Red Fox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong downward , Like an osprey from the ether , Like a wild-goose pierced with arrows , Fluttering fell the frantic woman , Fluttering fell into the waters --  Plunged and sunk beneath the waters ! Hark !  - -  the wailing of the West-wind ! Hark !  - -  the wailing of the waters , And the beating of the billows ! But no more the voice of Sea-Gull . Illustration : FLUTTERING FELL THE FRANTIC WOMAN In the wigwam sat the Red Fox , Hushed the wail of Waub-omee-mee , Weeping for her absent mother . With the twinkling stars the hunter From the forest came and Raven . " Sea-Gull wanders late , " said Red Fox , " Late she wanders by the sea-shore , And some evil may befall her . " In the misty morning twilight Forth went Panther and the Raven , Searched the forest and the marshes , Searched for leagues along the lake-shore , Searched the islands and the highlands ; But they found no trace or tidings , Found no track in marsh or meadow , Found no trail in fen or forest , On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found not . Then to Panther spoke the Raven : " She is in the Land of Spirits --  Surely in the Land of Spirits . High at midnight I beheld her --  Like a flying star beheld her --  To the waves of Gitchee Gumee Downward flashing through the ether . Thus she flashed that I might see her , See and know my mother 's spirit ; Thus she pointed to the waters , And beneath them lies her body , In the wigwam of the spirits --  In the lodge of Nebe-naw-baigs. " 24 Then spoke Panther to the Raven : " On the tall cliff by the waters Wait and watch with Waub-omee-mee . If the Sea-Gull hear the wailing Of her infant she will answer . " On the tall cliff by the waters So the Raven watched and waited ; All the day he watched and waited , But the hungry infant slumbered , Slumbered by the side of Raven , Till the pines ' gigantic shadows Stretched and pointed to Waubu-nong21 --  To the far-off land of Sunrise ; Then the wee one woke and , famished , Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waters Meet in misty haze and mingle , Straight toward the rocky highland , Straight as flies the feathered arrow , Straight to Raven and the infant , Swiftly flew a snow-white sea-gull --  Flew and touched the earth a woman . And behold , the long-lost mother Caught her wailing child and nursed her , Sang a lullaby and nursed her . Thrice was wound a chain of silver Round her waist and strongly fastened . Far away into the waters --  To the wigwam of the spirits --  To the lodge of Nebe-naw-baigs --  Stretched the magic chain of silver . Spoke the mother to the Raven : " O my son -- my brave young hunter , Feed my tender little orphan ; Be a father to my orphan ; Be a mother to my orphan --  For the crafty Red Fox robbed us --  Robbed the Sea-Gull of her husband , Robbed the infant of her mother . From this cliff the treacherous woman Headlong into Gitchee Gumee Plunged the mother of my orphan . Then a Nebe-naw-baig caught me --  Chief of all the Nebe-naw-baigs --  Took me to his shining wigwam , In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All below is burnished copper , All above is burnished silver Gemmed with amethyst and agates . As his wife the Spirit holds me ; By this silver chain he holds me . " When my little one is famished , When with long and piteous wailing Cries the orphan for her mother , Hither bring her , O my Raven ; I will hear her -- I will answer . Now the Nebe-naw-baig calls me --  Pulls the chain -- I must obey him . " Thus she spoke , and in the twinkling Of a star the spirit-woman Changed into a snow-white sea-gull , Spread her wings and o'er the waters Swiftly flew and swiftly vanished . Then in secret to the Panther Raven told his tale of wonder . Sad and sullen was the hunter ; Sorrow gnawed his heart like hunger ; All the old love came upon him , And the new love was a hatred . Hateful to his heart was Red Fox , But he kept from her the secret --  Kept his knowledge of the murder . Vain was she and very haughty --  Oge-ma-kwa25 of the wigwam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lavished ; When she smiled his face was sullen , When she laughed he frowned upon her ; In her net of raven tresses Now no more she held him tangled . Now through all her fair disguises Panther saw an evil spirit , Saw the false heart of the woman . On the tall cliff o'er the waters Raven sat with Waub-omee-mee , Sat and watched again and waited , Till the wee one , faint and famished , Made a long and piteous wailing . Then again the snow-white Sea-Gull , From afar where sky and waters Meet in misty haze and mingle , Straight toward the rocky highland , Straight as flies the feathered arrow , Straight to Raven and the infant , With the silver chain around her , Flew and touched the earth a woman . In her arms she caught her infant --  Caught the wailing Waub-omee-mee , Sang a lullaby and nursed her . Sprang the Panther from the thicket --  Sprang and broke the chain of silver ! With his tomahawk he broke it . Thus he freed the willing Sea-Gull --  From the Water-Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry was the Spirit ; When he drew the chain of silver , Drew and found that it was broken , Found that he had lost the woman , Very angry was the Spirit . Then he raged beneath the waters , Raged and smote the mighty waters , Till the big sea boiled and bubbled , Till the white-haired , bounding billows Roared around the rocky headlands , Rolled and roared upon the shingle . To the wigwam happy Panther , As when first he wooed and won her Led his wife -- as young and handsome . For the waves of Gitchee Gumee Washed away the frost and wrinkles , And the spirits by their magic Made her young and fair forever . In the wigwam sat the Red Fox , Sat and sang a song of triumph , For she little dreamed of danger , Till the haughty hunter entered , Followed by the happy mother , Holding in her arms her infant . When the Red Fox saw the Sea-Gull --  Saw the dead a living woman , One wild cry she gave despairing , One wild cry as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the tall cliff flew in terror ; Frantic sprang upon the margin , Frantic plunged into the waters , Headlong plunged into the waters . Dead she tossed upon the billows ; For the Nebe-naw-baigs knew her , Knew the crafty , wicked woman , And they cast her from the waters , Spurned her from their shining wigwams ; Far away upon the shingle With the roaring waves they cast her . There upon her bloated body Fed the cawing crows and ravens , Fed the hungry wolves and foxes . On the shore of Gitchee Gumee , Ever young and ever handsome , Long and happy lived the Sea-Gull , Long and happy with the Panther . Evermore the happy hunter Loved the mother of his children . Like a red star many winters Blazed their lodge-fire on the sea-shore . O'er the Bridge of Souls26 together Walked the Sea-Gull and the Panther . To the far-off Sunny Islands --  To the Summer-Land of Spirits , Sea-Gull journeyed with her husband --  Where no more the happy hunter Feels the fangs of frost or famine , Or the keen blasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And no crafty , wicked woman . There she rules his lodge forever , And the twain are very happy , On the far-off Sunny Islands , In the Summer-Land of Spirits . On the rocks of Gitchee Gumee --  On the Pictured Rocks -- the legend Long ago was traced and written , Pictured by the Water-Spirits ; But the storms of many winters Have bedimmed the pictured story , So that none can read the legend But the Jossakeeds , 27 the prophets . POETRY . I had rather write one word upon the rock Of ages than ten thousand in the sand . The rock of ages ! lo I can not reach Its lofty shoulders with my puny hand : I can but touch the sands about its feet . Yea , I have painted pictures for the blind , And sung my sweetest songs to ears of stone . What matter if the dust of ages drift Five fathoms deep above my grave unknown , For I have sung and loved the songs I sung . Who sings for fame the Muses may disown ; Who sings for gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because sweet music springs Unbidden from his heart and warbles long , May haply touch another heart unknown . There is sweeter poetry in the hearts of men Than ever poet wrote or minstrel sung ; For words are clumsy wings for burning thought . The full heart falters on the stammering tongue , And silence is more eloquent than song When tender souls are wrung by grief or shameful wrong . The grandest poem is God 's Universe : In measured rhythm the planets whirl their course : Rhythm swells and throbs in every sun and star , In mighty ocean 's organ-peals and roar , In billows bounding on the harbor-bar , In the blue surf that rolls upon the shore , In the low zephyr 's sigh , the tempest 's sob , In the rain 's patter and the thunder 's roar ; Aye , in the awful earthquake 's shuddering throb , When old Earth cracks her bones and trembles to her core . I hear a piper piping on a reed To listening flocks of sheep and bearded goats ; I hear the larks shrill-warbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And in my boyhood 's clover-fields I hear The twittering swallows and the hum of bees . Ah , sweeter to my heart and to my ear Than any idyl poet ever sung , The low , sweet music of their melodies ; Because I listened when my soul was young , In those dear meadows under maple trees . My heart they molded when its clay was moist , And all my life the hum of honey-bees Hath waked in me a spirit that rejoiced , And touched the trembling chords of tenderest memories . I hear loud voices and a clamorous throng With braying bugles and with bragging drums --  Bards and bardies laboring at a song . One lifts his locks , above the rest preferred , And to the buzzing flies of fashion thrums A banjo . Lo him follow all the herd .

Rare blue-eyed pansies peeping pearled with dew , And lilies lifting up their heads of gold , Among the gaudy cockscombs I behold , And here and there a lotus in the shade ; And under English oaks a rose that ne'er will fade .

Rear monuments of fame or flattery --  Think ye their sleeping souls are made aware ? Heap o'er their heads sweet praise or calumny --  Think ye their moldering ashes hear or care ? Nay , praise and fame are by the living sought ; But he is wise who scorns their flattery , And who escapes the tongue of calumny May count himself an angel or a naught : Lo over Byron 's grave a maggot writhes distraught .

But he will read and range and rhyme in vain Who hath no dust of diamonds in his brain ; And untaught genius is a gem undressed . The life of man is short , but Art is long , And labor is the lot of mortal man , Ordained by God since human time began : Day follows day and brings its toil and song . Behind the western mountains sinks the moon , The silver dawn steals in upon the dark , Up from the dewy meadow wheels the lark And trills his welcome to the rising sun , And lo another day of labor is begun . Poets are born , not made , some scribbler said , And every rhymester thinks the saying true : Better unborn than wanting labor 's aid : Aye , all great poets -- all great men -- are made Between the hammer and the anvil .

The poet 's brain with spirit-vision teems ; The voice of nature warbles in his heart ; A sage , a seer , he moves from men apart , And walks among the shadows of his dreams ; He sees God 's light that in all nature beams ; And when he touches with the hand of art The song of nature welling from his heart , And guides it forth in pure and limpid streams , Truth sparkles in the song and like a diamond gleams . Time and patience change the mulberry-leaf To shining silk ; the lapidary 's skill Makes the rough diamond sparkle at his will , And cuts a gem from quartz or coral-reef .

Truth is the touchstone of all genius Art , In poet , painter , sculptor , is the same : What cometh from the heart goes to the heart , What comes from effort only is but tame . Nature the only perfect artist is : Who studies Nature may approach her skill ; Perfection hers , but never can be his , Though her sweet voice his very marrow thrill ; The finest works of art are Nature 's shadows still .

BETZKO A HUNGARIAN LEGEND Stibor had led in many a fight , And broken a score of swords In furious frays and bloody raids Against the Turkish hordes . And Sigismund , the Polish king , Who joined the Magyar bands , Bestowed upon the valiant knight A broad estate of lands . Once when the wars were o'er , the knight Was holding wassail high , And the valiant men that followed him Were at the revelry . Betzko , his Jester , pleased him so He vowed it his the task To do whatever in human power His witty Fool might ask . " Build on yon cliff , " the Jester cried , In drunken jollity , " A mighty castle high and wide , And name it after me . " " Ah , verily a Jester 's prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a noble lord What you know he can not do . " " Who says I can not , " Stibor cried , " Do whatsoe'er I will ? Within one year a castle shall stand On yonder rocky hill --  " A castle built of ponderous stones , To give me future fame ; In honor of my witty Fool , Betzko shall be its name . " Now the cliff was high three hundred feet , And perpendicular ; And the skill that could build a castle there Must come from lands afar . And craftsmen came from foreign lands , Italian , German and Jew --  Apprentices and fellow-craftsmen , And master-masons , too . And every traveler journeying Along the mountain-ways Was held to pay his toll of toil On the castle for seven days . Slowly they raised the massive towers Upon the steep ascent , And all around a thousand hands Built up the battlement . Three hundred feet above the glen --  ( By the steps five hundred feet )  --  The castle stood upon the cliff At the end of the year -- complete . Now throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , So massive built , so strong and grand ;  --  It reaches the very sky . But from that same high battlement ( Say tales by gypsies told ) The valiant Stibor met his death When he was cross and old . I 'll tell you the tale as they told it to me , And I doubt not it is true , For ' t was handed down from the middle ages From the lips of knights who knew . One day when the knight was old and cross , And a little the worse for grog , Betzko , the Jester , thoughtlessly Struck Stibor 's favorite dog . Now the dog was a hound and Stibor 's pet , And as white as Carpathian snow , And Stibor hurled old Betzko down From the walls to the rocks below . And as the Jester headlong fell From the dizzy , dreadful height , He muttered a curse with his latest breath On the head of the cruel knight . One year from that day old Stibor held His drunken wassail long , And spent the hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . Then he sought his garden on the cliff , And lay down under a vine To sleep away the lethargy Of a wassail-bowl of wine . While sleeping soundly under the shade , And dreaming of revelries , An adder crawled upon his breast , And bit him in both his eyes . Blinded and mad with pain he ran Toward the precipice , Unheeding till he headlong fell Adown the dread abyss . Just where old Betzko 's blood had dyed With red the old rocks gray , Quivering and bleeding and dumb and dead Old Stibor 's body lay . WESSELENYI A HUNGARIAN TALE When madly raged religious war O'er all the Magyar land And royal archer and hussar Met foemen hand to hand , A princess fair in castle strong The royal troops defied And bravely held her fortress long Though help was all denied . Princess Maria was her name --  Brave daughter nobly sired ; She caught her father 's trusty sword When bleeding he expired , And bravely rallied warders all To meet the storming foe , And hurled them from the rampart-wall Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide ; It sat among the mountain cliffs --  The Magyars ' boast and pride . Bold Wesselenyi -- stalwart knight , Young , famed and wondrous fair , With a thousand men besieged the height , And led the bravest there . And long he tried the arts of war To take that castle-hold , Till many a proud and plumed hussar Was lying stiff and cold ; And still the frowning castle stood A grim , unbroken wall , Like some lone rock in stormy seas That braves the billows all . Bold Wesselenyi 's cheeks grew thin ; A solemn oath he sware That if he failed the prize to win His bones should molder there . Two toilsome months had worn away , Two hundred men were slain , His bold assaults were baffled still , And all his arts were vain . But love is mightier than the sword , He clad him in disguise --  In the dress of an inferior lord --  To win the noble prize . He bade his armed men to wait , To cease the battle-blare And sought alone the castle-gate To hold a parley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her warders bade him pass ; Within he met the princess fair All clad in steel and brass . Her bright , black eyes and queenly art , Sweet lips and raven hair , Smote bold young Wesselenyi 's heart While he held parley there . Cunning he talked of great reward And royal favor , too , If she would yield her father 's sword ; She sternly answered " No . " But even while they parleyed there Maria 's lustrous eyes Looked tenderly and lovingly On the chieftain in disguise . " Go tell your gallant chief , " she said , " To keep his paltry pelf ; The knight who would my castle win , Must dare to come himself . " And forth she sternly bade him go , But followed with her eyes . I ween she knew the brave knight well Through all his fair disguise . But when had dawned another morn , He bade his bugleman To sound again the parley-horn Ere yet the fray began . And forth he sent a trusty knight To seek the castle-gate And to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was who in disguise Her warders bade to pass , And while he parleyed there her eyes Had pierced his plates of brass . His heart he offered and his hand , And pledged a signet-ring If she would yield her brave command Unto his gracious king . " Go tell your chief , " Maria cried --  " Audacious as he is --  If he be worthy such a bride My castle and hand are his . But he should know that lady fair By faint heart ne'er was won ; So let your gallant chieftain , sir , Come undisguised alone . " And he may see in the northern tower , Over yonder precipice , A lone , dim light at the midnight hour Shine down the dark abyss . And over the chasm 's dungeon-gloom Shall a slender ladder hang ; And if alone he dare to come ,  --  Unarmed -- without a clang , " More of his suit your chief shall hear Perhaps may win the prize ; Tell him the way is hedged with fear ,  --  One misstep and he dies . Nor will I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My watchful warders all to cheat May be beyond my power . " At midnight 's dark and silent hour The tall and gallant knight Sought on the cliff the northern tower , And saw the promised light . With toil he climbed the cragged cliff , And there the ladder found ; And o'er the yawning gulf he clomb The ladder round by round . And as he climbed the ladder bent Above the yawning deep , But bravely to the port he went And entered at a leap Full twenty warders thronged the hall Each with his blade in hand ; They caught the brave knight like a thrall And bound him foot and hand . They tied him fast to an iron ring , At Maria 's stern command , And then they jeered --  " God save the king And all his knightly band ! " They bound a bandage o'er his eyes , Then the haughty princess said : " Audacious knight , I hold a prize ,  --  My castle or your head ! " Now , mark !  - -  desert the king 's command , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart and hand , This castle shall be thine . I grant one hour for thee to choose , My bold and gallant lord ; And if my offer you refuse You perish by the sword ! " He spoke not a word , but his face was pale And he prayed a silent prayer ; But his heart was oak and it could not quail , And a secret oath he sware . And grim stood the warders armed all , In the torches ' flicker and flare , As they watch for an hour in the gloomy hall The brave knight pinioned there . The short -- the flying hour is past , The warders have bared his breast ; The bugler bugles a doleful blast ; Will the pale knight stand the test ? He has made his choice -- he will do his part , He has sworn and he can not lie , And he cries with the sword at his beating heart ,  --  " Betray ?  - -  nay - -  better to die ! " Suddenly fell from his blue eyes The silken , blinding bands , And while he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I give thee my castle , " Maria cried , " And I give thee my heart and hand , And Maria will be the proudest bride In all this Magyar land . " Grant heaven that thou be true to me As thou art to the king , And I 'll bless the day I gave to thee My castle for a ring . " The red blood flushed to the brave knight 's face As he looked on the lady fair ; He sprang to her arms in a fond embrace , And he married her then and there . So the little blind elf with his feathered shaft Did more than the sword could do , For he conquered and took with his magical craft Her heart and her castle , too .

Unsteady his steps were and slow , and he walked with a staff in his right hand , And white as the first-falling snow were the thin locks that lay on his shoulders . Like rime-covered moss hung his beard , flowing down from his face to his girdle ; And wan was his aspect and weird , and often he chanted and mumbled In a strange and mysterious tongue , as he bent o'er his book in devotion , Or lifted his dim eyes and sung , in a low voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hebrew , or Greek --  all the same were his words to the warriors ,  --  All the same to the maids and the meek , wide-wondering-eyed , hazel-brown children .

Oft she came to the teepee and spoke ; she brought him the tongue of the bison , Sweet nuts from the hazel and oak , and flesh of the fawn and the mallard . Soft hanpaP she made for his feet and leggins of velvety fawn-skin , A blanket of beaver complete , and a hood of the hide of the otter . And oft at his feet on the mat , deftly braiding the flags and the rushes , Till the sun sought his teepee she sat , enchanted with what he related Of the white-winged ships on the sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sweet charity of the Christ and the beautiful Virgin . O A lodge set apart for guests of the village . P Moccasins . She listened like one in a trance when he spoke of the brave , bearded Frenchmen , From the green , sun-lit valleys of France to the wild HochelagaQ transplanted , Oft trailing the deserts of snow in the heart of the dense Huron forests , Or steering the dauntless canoe through the waves of the fresh-water ocean . " Yea , stronger and braver are they , " said the aged Menard to Winona , " Than the head-chief , tall Wazi-kute , 74 but their words are as soft as a maiden 's , Their eyes are the eyes of the swan , but their hearts are the hearts of the eagles ; And the terrible Masa WakanR ever walks by their side like a spirit ; Like a Thunder-bird , roaring in wrath , flinging fire from his terrible talons , He sends to their enemies death in the flash of the fatal Wakandee .

The Autumn was past and the snow lay drifted and deep on the prairies ; From his teepee of ice came the foe --  came the storm-breathing god of the winter . Then roared in the groves , on the plains , on the ice-covered lakes and the river , The blasts of the fierce hurricanes blown abroad from the breast of Waziya. 3 The bear cuddled down in his den , and the elk fled away to the forest ; The pheasant and gray prairie-hen made their beds in the heart of the snow-drift ; The bison herds huddled and stood in the hollows and under the hill-sides , Or rooted the snow for their food in the lee of the bluffs and the timber ; And the mad winds that howled from the north , from the ice-covered seas of Waziya , Chased the gray wolf and silver-fox forth to their dens in the hills of the forest . Poor Father Menard -- he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever ; All in vain was the magical skill of Wicasta Wakan 61 with his rattle ; Into soft , child-like slumber he fell , and awoke in the land of the blessed --  To the holy applause of " Well-done ! " and the harps in the hands of the angels . Long he carried the cross and he won the coveted crown of a martyr . In the land of the heathen he died , meekly following the voice of his Master , One mourner alone by his side --  Ta-te-psin 's compassionate daughter . She wailed the dead father with tears , and his bones by her kindred she buried . Then winter followed winter . The years sprinkled frost on the head of her father ; And three weary winters she dreamed of the fearless and fair , bearded Frenchmen ; At midnight their swift paddles gleamed on the breast of the broad Mississippi , And the eyes of the brave strangers beamed on the maid in the midst of her slumber . She lacked not admirers ; the light of the lover oft burned in her teepee --  At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she never extinguished the flambeau . The son of Chief Wazi-kute --  a fearless and eagle-plumed warrior --  Long sighed for Winona , and he was the pride of the band of Isantees . Three times , in the night at her bed , had the brave held the torch of the lover , 75 And thrice had she covered her head and rejected the handsome Tamdoka . T T Tah-mdo-kah , literally , the buck-deer . ' T was Summer . The merry-voiced birds trilled and warbled in woodland and meadow ; And abroad on the prairies the herds cropped the grass in the land of the lilies ,  --  And sweet was the odor of rose wide-wafted from hillside and heather ; In the leaf-shaded lap of repose lay the bright , blue-eyed babes of the summer ; And low was the murmur of brooks , and low was the laugh of the Ha-Ha ; 76 And asleep in the eddies and nooks lay the broods of maga 60and the mallard . ' T was the moon of Wasunpa. 71 The band lay at rest in the tees at Ka-tha-ga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peace and of Plenty --  Twin sisters , with bountiful hand wide scattering wild-rice and the lilies . An-pe-tu-wee70 walked in the west --  to his lodge in the far-away mountains , And the war-eagle flew to her nest in the oak on the Isle of the Spirit . U And now at the end of the day , by the shore of the Beautiful Island , V A score of fair maidens and gay made joy in the midst of the waters . Half-robed in their dark , flowing hair , and limbed like the fair Aphrodite , They played in the waters , and there they dived and they swam like the beavers , Loud-laughing like loons on the lake when the moon is a round shield of silver , And the songs of the whippowils wake on the shore in the midst of the maples . But hark !  - -  on the river a song ,  --  strange voices commingled in chorus ; On the current a boat swept along with DuLuth and his hardy companions ; To the stroke of their paddles they sung , and this the refrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deux cavaliers bien montes .

Illustration : ARRIVAL OF DULUTH AT KATHAGA Like the red , dappled deer in the glade alarmed by the footsteps of hunters , Discovered , disordered , dismayed , the nude nymphs fled forth from the waters , And scampered away to the shade , and peered from the screen of the lindens . A bold and adventuresome man was DuLuth , and a dauntless in danger , And straight to Kathaga he ran , and boldly advanced to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gazing amazed on the strangers ; And straightway he offered his hand unto Wazi-kute , the Itancan .

X Head-chief There was dancing and feasting at night , and joy at the presents he lavished . All the maidens were wild with delight with the flaming red robes and the ribbons , With the beads and the trinkets untold , and the fair , bearded face of the giver ; And glad were they all to behold the friends from the Land of the Sunrise . But one stood apart from the rest --  the queenly and silent Winona , Intently regarding the guest --  hardly heeding the robes and the ribbons , Whom the White Chief beholding admired , and straightway he spread on her shoulders A lily-red robe and attired with necklet and ribbons the maiden . The red lilies bloomed in her face , and her glad eyes gave thanks to the giver , And forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the missal Of the father -- poor Rene Menard ; and related the tale of the " Black Robe . " She spoke of the sacred regard he inspired in the hearts of Dakotas ; That she buried his bones with her kin , in the mound by the Cave of the Council ; That she treasured and wrapt in the skin of the red-deer his robe and his prayer book --  " Till his brothers should come from the East --  from the land of the far Hochelaga , To smoke with the braves at the feast , on the shores of the Loud-laughing Waters . 16 For the ' Black Robe ' spake much of his youth and his friends in the Land of the Sunrise ; It was then as a dream ; now in truth I behold them , and not in a vision . " But more spake her blushes , I ween , and her eyes full of language unspoken , As she turned with the grace of a queen and carried her gifts to the teepee . Far away from his beautiful France --  from his home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a Norman heart big with adventure , In the new world a wanderer , by chance DuLuth sought the wild Huron forests . But afar by the vale of the Rhone , the winding and musical river , And the vine-covered hills of the Saone , the heart of the wanderer lingered ,  --  ' Mid the vineyards and mulberry trees , and the fair fields of corn and of clover That rippled and waved in the breeze , while the honey-bees hummed in the blossoms . For there , where th ' impetuous Rhone , leaping down from the Switzerland mountains , And the silver-lipped , soft-flowing Saone , meeting , kiss and commingle together , Down winding by vineyards and leas , by the orchards of fig-trees and olives , To the island-gemmed , sapphire-blue seas of the glorious Greeks and the Romans ; Aye , there , on the vine-covered shore , ' mid the mulberry-trees and the olives , Dwelt his blue-eyed and beautiful Flore , with her hair like a wheat-field at harvest , All rippled and tossed by the breeze , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'er the emerald seas , as the sun lifts his brow from the billows , Or the red-clover fields when the bees , singing sip the sweet cups of the blossoms . Wherever he wandered --  alone in the heart of the wild Huron forests , Or cruising the rivers unknown to the land of the Crees or Dakotas --  His heart lingered still on the Rhone , ' mid the mulberry trees and the vineyards , Fast-fettered and bound by the zone that girdled the robes of his darling . Till the red Harvest Moon71 he remained in the vale of the swift Mississippi . The esteem of the warriors he gained , and the love of the dark-eyed Winona . He joined in the sports and the chase ; with the hunters he followed the bison , And swift were his feet in the race when the red elk they ran on the prairies . At the Game of the Plum-stones77 he played , and he won from the skillfulest players ; A feast to Wa'tanka78 he made , and he danced at the feast of Heyoka. 16 With the flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakotas ; They called it the " Maza Wakan "  --  the mighty , mysterious metal . " ' T is a brother , " they said , " of the fire in the talons of dreadful Wakinyan , ' 32 When he flaps his huge wings in his ire , and shoots his red shafts at Unktehee. " 69 The Itancan , 74 tall Wazi-kute , appointed a day for the races . From the red stake that stood by his tee , on the southerly side of the Ha-ha , O'er the crest of the hills and the dunes and the billowy breadth of the prairie , To a stake at the Lake of the Loons79 --  a league and return -- was the distance . They gathered from near and afar , to the races and dancing and feasting ; Five hundred tall warriors were there from Kapoza6 and far-off Keoza ; 8 RemnicaY too , furnished a share of the legions that thronged to the races , And a bountiful feast was prepared by the diligent hands of the women , And gaily the multitudes fared in the generous tees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feast to Unktehee --  The mystic " Wacipee Wakan " Z --  at the end of the day and the races . A band of sworn brothers are they , and the secrets of each one are sacred , And death to the lips that betray is the doom of the swarthy avengers , And the son of tall Wazi-kute was the chief of the mystical order . Y Pronounced Ray-mne-chah -- The village of the Mountains , situate where Red Wing now stands . Z Sacred Dance -- The Medicine-dance -- See description infra . THE FOOT RACES . On an arm of an oak hangs the prize for the swiftest and strongest of runners --  A blanket as red as the skies , when the flames sweep the plains in October . And beside it a strong , polished bow , and a quiver of iron-tipped arrows , Which Kapoza 's tall chief will bestow on the fleet-footed second that follows . A score of swift runners are there from the several bands of the nation , And now for the race they prepare , and among them fleet-footed Tamdoka . With the oil of the buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet are the feet of the deer and strong are the limbs of the bruin . Hark !  - -  the shouts and the braying of drums , and the Babel of tongues and confusion ! From his teepee the tall chieftain comes , and DuLuth brings a prize for the runners --  A keen hunting-knife from the Seine , horn-handled and mounted with silver . The runners are ranged on the plain , and the Chief waves a flag as a signal , And away like the gray wolves they fly --  like the wolves on the trail of the red-deer ; O'er the hills and the prairie they vie , and strain their strong limbs to the utmost , While high on the hills hangs a cloud of warriors and maidens and mothers , To see the swift-runners , and loud are the cheers and the shouts of the warriors . Now swift from the lake they return o'er the emerald hills of the prairies ; Like grey-hounds they pant and they yearn , and the leader of all is Tamdoka . At his heels flies Hu-pa-hu , AA the fleet -- the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , but his prize is the bow and the quiver . Tamdoka first reaches the post , and his are the knife and the blanket , By the mighty acclaim of the host and award of the chief and the judges . Then proud was the tall warrior 's stride , and haughty his look and demeanor ; He boasted aloud in his pride , and he scoffed at the rest of the runners . " Behold me , for I am a man ! AB my feet are as swift as the West-wind . With the coons and the beavers I ran ; but where is the elk or the cabri ? 80 Come !  - -  where is the hunter will dare match his feet with the feet of Tamdoka ? Let him think of TateAC and beware , ere he stake his last robe on the trial . " " Oho ! Ho ! Ho-heca !

AC The wind . AD About equivalent to Oho !  - -  Aha !  - -  fudge ! Then forth from the side of the chief stepped DuLuth and he looked on the boaster ; " The words of a warrior are brief ,  --  I will run with the brave , " said the Frenchman ; " But the feet of Tamdoka are tired ; abide till the cool of the sunset . " All the hunters and maidens admired , for strong were the limbs of the stranger . " Hiwo Ho ! " AE they shouted and loud rose the cheers of the multitude mingled ; And there in the midst of the crowd stood the glad-eyed and blushing Winona . AE Hurra there ! Now afar o'er the plains of the west walked the sun at the end of his journey , And forth came the brave and the guest , at the tap of the drum , for the trial . Like a forest of larches the hordes were gathered to witness the contest ; As loud as the drums were their words and they roared like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend , and some for the fair , bearded stranger , And the betting runs high to the end , with the skins of the bison and beaver . A wife of tall Wazi-kute --  the mother of boastful Tamdoka --  Brought her handsomest robe from the tee with a vaunting and loud proclamation : She would stake her last robe on her son who , she boasted , was fleet as the cabri , And the tall , tawny chieftain looked on , approving the boast of the mother . Then fleet as the feet of a fawn to her lodge ran the dark-eyed Winona , She brought and she spread on the lawn , by the side of the robe of the boaster , The lily-red mantel DuLuth , with his own hands , had laid on her shoulders . " Tamdoka is swift , but forsooth , the tongue of his mother is swifter , " She said , and her face was aflame with the red of the rose and the lily , And loud was the roar of acclaim ; but dark was the face of Tamdoka . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his breeches and leggins ; And the brown , curling locks of his hair down droop to his bare , brawny shoulders , And his face wears a smile debonair , as he tightens his red sash around him ; But stripped to the moccasins bare , save the belt and the breech-clout of buckskin , Stands the haughty Tamdoka aware that the eyes of the warriors admire him ; For his arms are the arms of a bear and his legs are the legs of a panther . The drum beats ,  - -  the chief waves the flag , and away on the course speed the runners , And away leads the brave like a stag ,  --  like a bound on his track flies the Frenchman ; And away haste the hunters once more to the hills , for a view to the lakeside , And the dark-swarming hill-tops , they roar with the storm of loud voices commingled . Far away o'er the prairie they fly , and still in the lead is Tamdoka , But the feet of his rival are nigh , and slowly he gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lake ,  --  now they run full abreast on the home-stretch : Side by side they contend for the stake for a long mile or more on the prairie They strain like a stag and a hound , when the swift river gleams through the thicket , And the horns of the riders resound , winding shrill through the depths of the forest . But behold !  - -  at full length on the ground falls the fleet-footed Frenchman abruptly , And away with a whoop and a bound springs the eager , exulting Tamdoka Long and loud on the hills is the shout of his swarthy admirers and backers , " But the race is not won till it 's out , " said DuLuth , to himself as he gathered , With a frown on his face , for the foot of the wily Tamdoka had tripped him . Far ahead ran the brave on the route , and turning he boasted exultant . Like spurs to the steed to DuLuth were the jeers and the taunts of the boaster ; Indignant was he and red wroth at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlwind he speeds --  like a hurricane mad from the mountains ; He gains on Tamdoka ,  - -  he leads !  --  and behold , with the spring of a panther , He leaps to the goal and succeeds , ' mid the roar of the mad acclamation . Then glad as the robin in May was the voice of Winona exulting ; Tamdoka turned sullen away , and sulking he walked by the river ; He glowered as he went and the fire of revenge in his bosom was kindled : Dark was his visage with ire and his eyes were the eyes of a panther . THE WAKAN-WACEPEE , OR SACRED DANCE . 81 Lo the lights in the " Teepee-Wakan ! " ' t is the night of the Wakan Wacepee . Round and round walks the chief of the clan , as he rattles the sacred Ta-sha-kay ; 81 Long and loud on the Chan-che-ga 81 beat the drummers with magical drumsticks , And the notes of the Cho-tanka 81 greet like the murmur of winds on the waters . By the friction of white-cedar wood for the feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm brotherhood first must fast and be cleansed by E-nee-pee ; 81 And from foot-sole to crown of the head must they paint with the favorite colors ; For Unktehee likes bands of blood-red , with the stripings of blue intermingled . In the hollow earth , dark and profound , Unktehee and fiery Wakinyan Long fought , and the terrible sound of the battle was louder than thunder ; The mountains were heaved and around were scattered the hills and the boulders , And the vast solid plains of the ground rose and fell like the waves of the ocean . But the god of the waters prevailed . Wakin-yan escaped from the cavern , And long on the mountains he wailed , and his hatred endureth forever . When Unktehee had finished the earth , and the beasts and the birds and the fishes , And men at his bidding came forth from the heart of the huge hollow mountains , 69 A band chose the god from the hordes , and he said : " Ye are the sons of Unktehee : Ye are lords of the beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters . But hearken ye now to my words ,  --  let them sound in your bosoms forever : Ye shall honor Unktehee and hate Wakinyan , the Spirit of Thunder , For the power of Unktehee is great , and he laughs at the darts of Wakinyan .

All the night in the teepee they sang , and they danced to the mighty Unktehee , While the loud-braying Chan-che-ga rang and the shrill-piping flute and the rattle , Till Anpetuwee 70 rose in the east --  from the couch of the blushing Han-nan-na , And thus at the dance and the feast sang the sons of Unktehee in chorus : " Wa-du-ta o-hna mi-ka-ge !

Admiring he gazed -- she was fair as his own blooming Flore in her orchards , With her golden locks loose on the air , like the gleam of the sun through the olives , Far away on the vine-covered shore , in the sun-favored land of his fathers .

From the brow of the Beautiful Isle , AV half hid in the midst of the maples , The sad-faced Winona , the while , watched the boat growing less in the distance , Till away in the bend of the stream , where it turned and was lost in the lindens , She saw the last dip and the gleam of the oars ere they vanished forever . AU " Burnt woods "  - -  half- breeds . AV Wita Waste --  " Beautiful Island " ; the Dakota name for Nicollet Island . Still afar on the waters the song , like bridal bells distantly chiming , The stout , jolly boatmen prolong , beating time with the stroke of their paddles ; And Winona 's ear , turned to the breeze , lists the air falling fainter and fainter , Till it dies like the murmur of bees when the sun is aslant on the meadows . Blow , breezes ,  - -  blow softly and sing in the dark , flowing hair of the maiden ; But never again shall you bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RACE . Now a light rustling wind from the South shakes his wings o'er the wide , wimpling waters : Up the dark-winding river DuLuth follows fast in the wake of Tamdoka . On the slopes of the emerald shores leafy woodlands and prairies alternate ; On the vine-tangled islands the flowers peep timidly out at the white men ; In the dark-winding eddy the loon sits warily watching and voiceless , And the wild-goose , in reedy lagoon , stills the prattle and play of her children . The does and their sleek , dappled fawns prick their ears and peer out from the thickets , And the bison-calves play on the lawns , and gambol like colts in the clover . Up the still-flowing Wakpa Wakan 's winding path through the groves and the meadows , Now DuLuth 's brawny boatmen pursue the swift-gliding bark of Tamdoka ; And hardly the red braves out-do the stout , steady oars of the white men . Now they bend to their oars in the race --  the ten tawny braves of Tamdoka ; And hard on their heels in the chase ply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern of his boat sits DuLuth ; in the stern of his boat sits Tamdoka , And warily , cheerily , both urge the oars of their men to the utmost . Far-stretching away to the eyes , winding blue in the midst of the meadows , As a necklet of sapphires that lies unclaspt in the lap of a virgin , Here asleep in the lap of the plain lies the reed-bordered , beautiful river . Like two flying coursers that strain , on the track , neck and neck on the home-stretch , With nostrils distended and mane froth-flecked , and the neck and the shoulders , Each urged to his best by the cry and the whip and the rein of his rider , Now they skim o'er the waters and fly , side by side , neck and neck , through the meadows , The blue heron flaps from the reeds , and away wings her course up the river : Straight and swift is her flight o'er the meads , but she hardly outstrips the canoemen . See ! the voyageurs bend to their oars till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweat from their brawny breasts pours ; but in vain their Herculean labor ; For the oars of Tamdoka are ten , and but six are the oars of the Frenchman , And the red warriors ' burden of men is matched by the voyageurs ' luggage . Side by side , neck and neck , for a mile , still they strain their strong arms to the utmost , Till rounding a willowy isle , now ahead creeps the boat of Tamdoka , And the neighboring forests profound , and the far-stretching plain of the meadows To the whoop of the victors resound , while the panting French rest on their paddles . IN CAMP . With sable wings wide o'er the land night sprinkles the dew of the heavens ; And hard by the dark river 's strand , in the midst of a tall , somber forest , Two camp fires are lighted and beam on the trunks and the arms of the pine trees . In the fitful light darkle and gleam the swarthy-hued faces around them . And one is the camp of DuLuth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the jests and uncouth of the voyageurs over their supper , While moody and silent the braves round their fire in a circle sit crouching ; And low is the whisper of leaves and the sough of the wind in the branches ; And low is the long-winding howl of the lone wolf afar in the forest ; But shrill is the hoot of the owl , like a bugle-blast blown in the pine-tops , And the half-startled voyageurs scowl at the sudden and saucy intruder . Like the eyes of the wolves are the eyes of the watchful and silent Dakotas ; Like the face of the moon in the skies , when the clouds chase each other across it , Is Tamdoka 's dark face in the light of the flickering flames of the camp-fire . They have plotted red murder by night , and securely contemplate their victims . But wary and armed to the teeth are the resolute Frenchmen , and ready , If need be , to grapple with death , and to die hand to hand in the forest . Yet skilled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They cover their hearts with their smiles , and hide their suspicions of evil . Round their low , smouldering fire , feigning sleep , lie the watchful and wily Dakotas ; But DuLuth and his voyageurs heap their fire that shall blaze till the morning , Ere they lay themselves snugly to rest , with their guns by their sides on the blankets , As if there were none to molest but the gray , skulking wolves of the forest . AW Ojibways . ' T is midnight . The rising moon gleams , weird and still , o'er the dusky horizon ; Through the hushed , somber forest she beams , and fitfully gloams on the meadows ; And a dim , glimmering pathway she paves , at times , on the dark stretch of river . The winds are asleep in the caves --  in the heart of the far-away mountains ; And here on the meadows and there , the lazy mists gather and hover ; And the lights of the Fen-Spirits72 flare and dance on the low-lying marshes , As still as the footsteps of death by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hushed are the pines , and beneath lie the weary-limbed boatmen in slumber . Walk softly ,  - -  walk softly , O Moon , through the gray , broken clouds in thy pathway , For the earth lies asleep and the boon of repose is bestowed on the weary . Toiling hands have forgotten their care ; e'en the brooks have forgotten to murmur ; But hark !  - -  there 's a sound on the air !  --  ' t is the light-rustling robes of the Spirits , Like the breath of the night in the leaves or the murmur of reeds on the river , In the cool of the mid-summer eyes , when the blaze of the day has descended . Low-crouching and shadowy forms , as still as the gray morning 's footsteps , Creep sly as the serpent that charms , on her nest in the meadow , the plover ; In the shadows of pine-trunks they creep , but their panther-eyes gleam in the fire-light , As they peer on the white-men asleep , in the glow of the fire , on their blankets . Lo in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow and the arrows ! Brave Frenchmen , awake to the strife !  --  or you sleep in the forest forever . Nay , nearer and nearer they glide , like ghosts on the field of their battles , Till close on the sleepers , they bide but the signal of death from Tamdoka . Still the sleepers sleep on . Not a breath stirs the leaves of the awe-stricken forest ; The hushed air is heavy with death ; like the footsteps of death are the moments . " Arise ! "  - -  At the word , with a bound , to their feet spring the vigilant Frenchmen ; And the depths of the forest resound to the crack and the roar of their rifles ; And seven writhing forms on the ground clutch the earth . From the pine-tops the screech-owl Screams and flaps his wide wings in affright , and plunges away through the shadows ; And swift on the wings of the night flee the dim , phantom-forms through the darkness . Like cabris80 when white wolves pursue , fled the four yet remaining Dakotas ; Through forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their footsteps . And one was Tamdoka . DuLuth through the night sent his voice like a trumpet : " Ye are Sons of Unktehee , forsooth ! Return to your mothers , ye cowards ! " His shrill voice they heard as they fled , but only the echoes made answer . At the feet of the brave Frenchmen , dead , lay seven swarthy Sons of whitehead ; And there , in the midst of the slain , they found , as it gleamed in the fire-light , The horn-handled knife from the Seine , where it fell from the hand of Tamdoka .

" Brave Wazi-kute is a man , and his heart is as clear as the sunlight ; But the head of a treacherous clan and a snake-in-the-grass , is Tamdoka , " Said the chief ; and he promised DuLuth , on the word of a friend and a warrior , To carry the pipe and the truth to his cousin , the chief at Kathaga ; For thrice at the Tanka Mede he smoked in the lodge of the Frenchman ; And thrice had he carried away the bountiful gifts of the trader .

And often in fancy she heard the dip of his oars on the river . On the dark waters glimmered the moon , but she saw not the boat of the Frenchman . On the somber night bugled the loon , but she heard not the song of the boatmen . The moon waxed and waned , but the star of her hope never waned to the setting ; Through her tears she beheld it afar , like a torch on the eastern horizon . " He will come ,  - -  he is coming , " she said ; " he will come , for my White Eagle promised , " And low to the bare earth the maid bent her ear for the sound of his footsteps , " He is gone , but his voice in my ear still remains like the voice of the robin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is coming ; my White Chief is coming ! " But the moon waxed and waned . Nevermore will the eyes of Winona behold him . Far away on the dark , rugged shore of the blue Gitchee Gumee he lingers . No tidings the rising sun brings ; no tidings the star of the evening ; But morning and evening she sings , like a turtle-dove widowed and waiting : Ake u , ake u , ake u ; Ma cante maseeca . Ake u , ake u , ake u ; Ma cante maseca . Come again , come again , come again ; For my heart is sad . Come again , come again , come again ; For my heart is sad . DEATH OF WINONA . Down the broad Ha-Ha Wak-paBS the band took their way to the Games at Keoza8 While the swift-footed hunters by land ran the shores for the elk and the bison .

With the band went Winona . The oar plied the maid with the skill of a hunter . They tarried a time on the shore of Remnica --  the Lake of the Mountains . BU There the fleet hunters followed the deer , and the thorny pahinBV for the women From the tees rose the smoke of good cheer , curling blue through the tops of the maples , Near the foot of a cliff that arose , like the battle-scarred walls of a castle , Up-towering , in rugged repose , to a dizzy height over the waters .

Alas for her waiting ! the wings of the East-wind have brought her no tidings ; On the meadow the meadow-lark sings , but sad is her song to Winona , For the glad warbler 's melody brings but the memory of voices departed .

Shall I sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hateful couch shall Winona lie ? Shall she kindle his fire like a coward slave ? No !  - -  a warrior 's daughter can bravely die .

" Ye winds that over the billows roam With a low and sullen moan , O swiftly come to waft me home ; O bear me back to my own . For long have I been on the billowy deep , On the boundless waste of sea ; And while I sleep there are two who weep , And watch and pray for me . When the mad storm roars till the stoutest fear And the thunders roll over the sea , I think of you , Mary and mother dear , For I know you are thinking of me . Then blow , ye winds , for my swift return ; Let the tempest roar o'er the main ; Let the billows yearn and the lightning burn ; They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my feverish dreams I heard A voice like the moan of an autumn sea , Or the low , sad wail of a widowed bird , And it said --  " My darling , come home to me .

Wiser than seer or scientist -- content To tread no paths beyond these bleating hills , Here let me lie beneath this dear old elm , Among the blossoms of the clover-fields , And listen to the humming of the bees . Here in those far-off , happy , boyhood years , When all my world was bounded by these hills , I dreamed my first dreams underneath this elm . Dreamed ? Aye , and builded castles in the clouds ; Dreamed , and made glad a fond , proud mother 's heart , Now moldering into clay on yonder hill ; Dreamed till my day-dreams paved the world with gold ; Dreamed till my mad dreams made one desolate ; Dreamed -- O my soul , and was it all a dream ? As I lay dreaming under this old elm , Building my castles in the sunny clouds , Her soft eyes peeping from the copse of pine , Looked tenderly on me and my glad heart leaped Following her footsteps . O the dream -- the dream ! O fawn-eyed , lotus-lipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your golden hair : Thou wilt not heed the dew-drops on my beard ; Thou wilt not heed the wrinkles on my brow ; Thou wilt not chide me for my long delay . Here we stood heart to heart and eye to eye , And I looked down into her inmost soul , The while she drank my promise like sweet wine O let me dream the dreams of long ago ! Soft are the tender eyes of maiden love ; Sweet are the dew-drops of a dear girl 's lips When love 's red roses blush in sudden bloom : O let me dream the dreams of long ago ! Hum soft and low , O bee-bent clover-fields ; Blink , blue-eyed violets , from the dewy grass ; Break into bloom , my golden dandelions ; Break into bloom , my dear old apple-trees . I hear the robins cherup on the hedge , I hear the warbling of the meadow-larks ; I hear the silver-fluted whippowil ; I hear the harps that moan among the pines Touched by the ghostly fingers of the dead . Hush ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherefore left I these fair , flowery fields , Where her fond eyes and ever gladsome voice Made all the year one joyous , warbling June , To chase my castles in the passing clouds --  False as the mirage of some Indian isle To shipwrecked sailors famished on the brine ? Wherefore ?  - -  Look out upon the babbling world --  Fools clamoring at the heels of clamorous fools ! I hungered for the sapless husks of fame . Dreaming I saw , beyond my native hills , The sunshine shimmer on the laurel trees . Ah tenderly plead her fond eyes brimmed with tears ; But lightly laughing at her fears I turned , Eager to clutch my crown of laurel leaves , Strong-souled and bold to front all winds of heaven --  A lamb and lion molded into one --  And burst away to tread the hollow world . Ah nut-brown boys that tend the lowing kine , Ah blithesome plowmen whistling on the glebe , Ah merry mowers singing in the swaths , Sweet , simple souls , contented not to know , Wiser are ye and ye may teach the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still my Ignis Fatuus flew before ; On thorny paths my eager feet pursued , Till she whose fond heart doted on my dreams Passed painless to the pure eternal peace . Years trode upon the heels of flying years And touched my brown beard with their silver wands , And still my Ignis Fatuus flew before ; Through thorns and mire my torn feet followed still , Till she , my darling , unforgotten Flore , Nursing her one hope all those weary years Waiting my tardy coming , drooped and died . I hear her low , sweet voice among the pines : O let me dream the dreams of long ago : I see her fond eyes peeping from the pines : O let me dream the dreams of long ago And hide my bronzed face in her golden hair . Is this the Indian summer of my days --  Wealth without care and love without desire ? O misty , cheerless moon of falling leaves ! Is this the fruitage promised by the spring ? O blighted clusters withering on the vine ! O promised lips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow air ! Let me dream on lest , dead unto my dead , False to the true and true unto the false , Maddened by thoughts of that which might have been , And weary of the chains of that which is , I slake my heart-thirst at forbidden springs . I hear the voices of the moaning pines ; I hear the low , hushed whispers of the dead , And one wan face looks in upon my dreams And wounds me with her sad , imploring eyes . The dead sun sinks beyond the misty hills ; The chill winds whistle in the leafless elms ; The cold rain patters on the fallen leaves . Where pipes the silver-fluted whippowil ? I hear no hum of bees among the bloom ; I hear no robin cherup on the hedge : One dumb , lone lark sits shivering in the rain . I hear the voices of the Autumn wind ; I hear the cold rain dripping on the leaves ; I hear the moaning of the mournful pines ; I hear the hollow voices of the dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming pass into the dreamless sleep --  Beyond the voices of the autumn winds , Beyond the patter of the dreary rain , Beyond compassion and all vain regret Beyond all waking and all weariness : O let me dream the dreams of long ago . THE PIONEER MINNESOTA -- 1860-1875 When Mollie and I were married from the dear old cottage-home , In the vale between the hills of fir and pine , I parted with a sigh in a stranger-land to roam , And to seek a western home for me and mine . By a grove-encircled lake in the wild and prairied West , As the sun was sinking down one summer day , I laid my knapsack down and my weary limbs to rest , And resolved to build a cottage-home and stay . I staked and marked my " corners , " and I " filed " upon my claim , And I built a cottage-home of " logs and shakes ; " And then I wrote a letter , and Mollie and baby came Out to bless me and to bake my johnny-cakes . When Mollie saw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bached " , She smiled , but I could see that she was " blue ; " Then she found my " Sunday-clothes " all soiled and torn and patched , And she hid her face and shed a tear or two . But she went to work in earnest and the cabin fairly shone , And her dinners were so savory and so nice That I felt it was " not good that the man should be alone "  --  Even in this lovely land of Paradise . Well , the neighbors they were few and were many miles apart , And you could n't hear the locomotive scream ; But I was young and hardy , and my Mollie gave me heart , And my " steers " they made a fast and fancy team . And the way I broke the sod was a marvel , you can bet , For I fed my " steers " before the dawn of day ; And when the sun went under I was plowing prairie yet , Till my Mollie blew the old tin horn for tea . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , And a-begging for a bone or bit of bread ; And the sneaking thieves would steal whatever they could take --  From the very house where they were kindly fed . O the eastern preachers preach , and the long-haired poets sing Of the " noble braves " and " dusky maidens fair ; " But if they had pioneered ' t would have been another thing When the " Injuns " got a-hankering for their " hair . " Often when we lay in bed in the middle of the night , How the prairie-wolves would howl their jubilee ! Then Mollie she would waken in a shiver and a fright , Clasp our baby-pet and snuggle up to me . There were hardships you may guess , and enough of weary toil For the first few years , but then it was so grand To see the corn and wheat waving o'er the virgin soil , And two stout and loving hearts went hand in hand . But Mollie took the fever when our second babe was born , And she lay upon the bed as white as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corn ; And the doctor said poor Mollie she must go . Now I never prayed before , but I fell upon my knees , And I prayed as never any preacher prayed ; And Mollie always said that it broke the fell disease ; And I truly think the Lord He sent us aid : For the fever it was broken , and she took a bit of food , And O then I went upon my knees again ; And I never cried before ,  - -  and I never thought I could ,  --  But my tears they fell upon her hand like rain . And I think the Lord has blessed us ever since I prayed the prayer , For my crops have never wanted rain or dew : And Mollie often said in the days of debt and care , " Do n't you worry , John , the Lord will help us through . " For the " pesky , " painted Sioux , in the fall of ' sixty-two , Came a-whooping on their ponies o'er the plain , And they killed my pigs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " When they danced around my blazing stacks of grain . And the settlers mostly fled , but I did n't have a chance , So I caught my hunting-rifle long and true , And Mollie poured the powder while I made the devils dance , To a tune that made ' em jump and tumble , too . And they fired upon the cabin ; ' t was as good as any fort , But the " beauties " would n't give us any rest ; For they skulked and blazed away , and I did n't call it sport , For I had to do my very " level best . " Now they do n't call me a coward , but my Mollie she 's a " brick ; " For she chucked the children down the cellar-way , And she never flinched a hair tho ' the bullets pattered thick , And we held the " painted beauties " well at bay . But once when I was aiming , a bullet grazed my head , And it cut the scalp and made the air look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said : " Never mind it , John , the Lord will help us through . " And you bet it raised my " grit , " and I never flinched a bit , And my nerves they got as strong as steel or brass ; And when I fired again I was sure that I had hit , For I saw the skulking devil " claw the grass . " Well , the fight was long and hot , and I got a charge of shot In the shoulder , but it never broke a bone ; And I never stopped to think whether I was hit or not Till we found our ammunition almost gone . But the " Rangers " came at last -- just as we were out of lead ,  --  And I thanked the Lord , and Mollie thanked Him , too ; Then she put her arms around my neck and sobbed and cried and said : " Bless the Lord !  - -  I knew that He would help us through . " And yonder on the hooks hangs that same old trusty gun , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and braided trophiesBX yet that I and Mollie won In that same old bloody battle with the Sioux . BX Scalp-locks . Fifteen years have rolled away since I laid my knapsack down , And my prairie claim is now one field of grain ; And yonder down the lake loom the steeples of a town , And my flocks are feeding out upon the plain . The old log-house is standing filled with bins of corn and wheat , And the cars they whistle past our cottage-home ; But my span of spanking trotters they are " just about " as fleet , And I would n't give my farm to rule in Rome . For Mollie and I are young yet , and monarchs , too , are we --  Of a " section " just as good as lies out-doors ; And the children are so happy ( and Mollie and I have three ) And we think that we can " lie upon our oars . " Illustration : THE PIONEER So this summer we went back to the old home by the hill : O the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lofty pines were gone but the rocks were all there still , And the valleys looked so crowded and so small ; And the dear familiar faces that I longed so much to see , Looked so strangely unfamiliar and so old , That the land of hills and valleys was no more a home to me , And the river seemed a rivulet as it rolled . So I gladly hastened back to the prairies of the West --  To the boundless fields of waving grass and corn ; And I love the lake-gemmed land where the wild-goose builds her nest , Far better than the land where I was born . And I mean to lay my bones over yonder by the lake --  By and by when I have nothing else to do --  And I 'll give the " chicks " the farm , and I know for Mollie 's sake , That the good and gracious Lord will help ' em through .

Aye , and is it not better , if only the dead soul knew ? Joy was there in the spring-time and hope like a blossoming rose , When the wine-blood of youth ran tingling and throbbing in every vein ; Chirrup of robin and blue-bird in the white-blossomed apple and pear ; Carpets of green on the meadows spangled with dandelions ; Lowing of kine in the valleys , bleating of lambs on the hills ; Babble of brooks and the prattle of fountains that flashed in the sun ; Glad , merry voices , ripples of laughter , snatches of music and song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roses they wore . And life was a pleasure unvexed , unmingled with sorrow and pain ? A round of delight from the blink of morn till the moon rose laughing at night ?

The summer of life came on with its heat and its struggle and toil , Sweat of the brow and the soul , throbbing of muscle and brain , Toil and moil and grapple with Fortune clutched as she flew --  Only a shred of her robe , and a brave heart baffled and bowed ! Stern-visaged Fate with a hand of iron uplifted to fell ; The secret stab of a friend that stung like the sting of an asp , Wringing red drops from the soul and a stifled moan of despair ; The loose lips of gossip and then -- a storm of slander and lies , Till Justice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the just , And Mercy , wrapped up in her robe , stood by like a statue in stone .

Fair was the promise of spring-time ; the harvest a harvest of lies : Fair was the promise of summer with Fortune clutched by the robe ; Fair was the promise of autumn -- a hollow harlot in red , A withered rose at her girdle and the thorns of the rose in her hand .

MINNETONKABY BY The Dakota name for this beautiful lake is We-ne-a-tan-ka -- Broad Water . By dropping the " a " before " tanka " we have changed the name to Big Water . I sit once more on breezy shore , at sunset in this glorious June , I hear the dip of gleaming oar , I list the singers ' merry tune . Beneath my feet the waters beat , and ripple on the polished stones , The squirrel chatters from his seat ; the bag-pipe beetle hums and drones . The pink and gold in blooming wold ,  - -  the green hills mirrored in the lake ! The deep , blue waters , zephyr-rolled , along the murmuring pebbles break . The maples screen the ferns , and lean the leafy lindens o'er the deep ; The sapphire , set in emerald green , lies like an Orient gem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RhuddinCA when he pipes in May , As downward droops the sun to rest , and shadows gather on the bay . In amber sky the swallows fly and sail and circle o'er the deep ; The light-winged night-hawks whir and cry ; the silver pike and salmon leap . The rising moon , o'er isle and dune , looks laughing down on lake and lea ; Weird o'er the waters shrills the loon ; the high stars twinkle in the sea . From bank and hill the whippowil sends piping forth his flute-like notes , And clear and shrill the answers trill from leafy isles and silver throats . The twinkling light on cape and height ; the hum of voices on the shores ; The merry laughter on the night ; the dip and plash of frolic oars ,  --  These tell the tale . On hill and dale the cities pour their gay and fair ; Along the sapphire lake they sail , and quaff like wine the balmy air . ' T is well .

In yonder tree the great Wanm-deeCC securely built her spacious nest ; The blast that swept the landlocked seaCD but rocked her clamorous babes to rest . By grassy mere the elk and deer gazed on the hunter as he came ; Nor fled with fear from bow or spear ;  --  " so wild were they that they were tame . " Ah , birch canoe , and hunter , too , have long forsaken lake and shore ; He bade his fathers ' bones adieu and turned away forevermore .

Alas ,  - -  Alas !  - -  for all things pass ; and we shall vanish too , as they ; We build our monuments of brass , and granite , but they waste away . BZ Spirit-Knob was a small hill upon a point in the lake in full view from Wayzata . It is now washed away by the waves .

The massacre and the Indian war that followed developed many brave men , but no truer hero than Mauley , an obscure Frenchman , the ferry-man at the Agency . Continually under fire , he resolutely ran his ferry-boat back and forth across the river , affording the terror-stricken people the only chance for escape . He was shot down on his boat just as he had landed on the opposite shore the last of those who fled from the burning village to the ferry-landing . The Indians disemboweled his dead body , cut off the head , hands and feet and thrust them into the cavity . See Heard 's Hist . Sioux War , p 67 .

Long ages groveling with his brother brutes , He plucked the tree of knowledge and uprose And walked erect -- a god ; but died the death : For knowledge brings but sadness and unrest Forever , insatiate longing and regret . Behold the brute 's unerring instinct guides True as the pole-star , while man 's reason leads How oft to quicksands and the hidden reefs ! Contented brute , his daily wants how few ! And these by Nature 's mother-hand supplied . Man 's wants unnumbered and unsatisfied , And multiplied at every onward step --  Insatiate as the cavernous maw of time .

Give him the gold of Ophir , still he delves ; Give him the land , and he demands the sea ; Give him the earth -- he reaches for the stars . Doomed by his fate to scorn the good he has And grasp at fancied good beyond his reach , He seeks for silver in the distant hills While in the sand gold glitters at his feet .

Of all the crops by sighing mortals sown , And watered with man 's sweat and woman 's tears , There is but only one that never fails In drouth or flood , on fat or flinty soil , On Nilus ' banks or Scandia 's stony hills --  The plenteous , never-stinted crop of fools .

The wise beginneth at the end ; the fool Ends at the beginning , or begins anew : Aye , every ditch is full of after-wit .

Yea , from the varied history of the world , From the experience of all times , all men , The wise man learneth wisdom . Folly learns From his own bruises if he learns at all . The fool -- born wise -- what need hath he to learn ? He needs but gabble wisdom to the world : Grill him on a gridiron and he gabbles still .

The days are past When virgin acres wanted willing hands , When fertile empires lay in wilderness Waiting the teeming millions of the world . Lo where the Indian and the bison roamed -- Lords of the prairies boundless as the sea -- But twenty years ago , behold the change !

The dreams of yesterday are deeds to-day . Our frugal mothers spun with tedious toil , And wove the homespun cloth for all their fold ; Their needles plied by weary fingers sewed . Behold , the humming factory spins and weaves , The singing " Singer " sews with lightning speed . Our fathers sowed their little fields by hand , And reaped with bended sickles and bent backs ; By hand they bound the sheaves of wheat and rye ; With flails they threshed and winnowed in the wind .

Lo every age refutes old errors still , And still begets new errors for the next ; But all the creeds of politics or priests Ca n't make one error truth , one truth a lie . There is no religion higher than the truth ; Men make the creeds , but God ordains the law . Above all cant , all arguments of men , Above all superstitions , old or new , Above all creeds of every age and clime , Stands the eternal truth -- the creed of creeds .

CHANGE Change is the order of the universe . Worlds wax and wane ; suns die and stars are born . Two atoms of cosmic dust unite , cohere --  And lo the building of a world begun . On all things -- high or low , or great or small --  Earth , ocean , mountain , mammoth , midge and man , On mind and matter -- lo perpetual change --  God 's fiat -- stamped ! The very bones of man Change as he grows from infancy to age . His loves , his hates , his tastes , his fancies , change . His blood and brawn demand a change of food ; His mind as well : the sweetest harp of heaven Were hateful if it played the selfsame tune Forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it bloomed throughout the year , Would blush unsought . The most delicious fruits Pall on our palate if we taste too oft , And Hyblan honey turns to bitter gall . Perpetual winter is a reign of gloom ; Perpetual summer hardly pleases more . Behold the Esquimau -- the Hottentot : This doomed to regions of perpetual ice , And that to constant summer 's heat and glow : Inferior both , both gloomy and unblessed . The home of happiness and plenty lies Where autumn follows summer and the breath Of spring melts into rills the winter 's snows . How gladly , after summer 's blazing suns , We hail the autumn frosts and autumn fruits : How blithesome seems the fall of feathery snow When winter comes with merry clang of bells : And after winter 's reign of ice and storm How glad we hail the robins of the spring . For God hath planted in the hearts of men The love of change , and sown the seeds of change In earth and air and sea and shoreless space . Day follows night and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; From when on dewy hills the rising dawn Sprinkles her mists of silver in the east , Till in the west the golden dust up-wheels Behind the chariot of the setting sun ; From when above the hills the evening star Sparkles a diamond ' mong the grains of gold , Until her last faint flicker on the sea . The voices of the hoar and hurrying years Cry from the silence --  " Change !  - -  perpetual Change ! " Man 's heart responding throbs --  " Perpetual Change , " And grinds like a mill-stone : wanting grists of change It grinds and grinds upon its troubled self . Behold the flowers that spring and bloom and fade . Behold the blooming maid : the song of larks Is in her warbling throat ; the blue of heaven Is in her eyes ; her loosened tresses fall A shower of gold on shoulders tinged with rose ; Her form a seraph 's and her gladsome face A benediction .

He whose sinewy arms Might burst through bars of steel like bands of straw , Caught in the net of her unloosened hair , A helpless prisoner lies and loves his chains . Blow , ye soft winds , from sandal-shaded isle , And bring the mogra 's breath and orange-bloom . Fly , fleet-winged doves , to Ponce de Leon 's spring , And in your bills bring her the pearls of youth ; For lo the fingers of relentless Time Weave threads of silver in among the gold , And seam her face with pain and carking care , Till , bent and bowed , the shriveled hands of Death Reach from the welcome grave and draw her in . FIDO Hark , the storm is raging high ; Beat the breakers on the coast , And the wintry waters cry Like the wailing of a ghost .

Inky darkness wraps the sky ; Not a glimpse of moon or star ; And the stormy-petrels cry Out along the harbor-bar . Seated by their blazing hearth --  John and Hannah -- snug and warm --  What if darkness wrap the earth ? Drive the sleet and howl the storm ! Let the stormy-petrels fly ! Let the moaning breakers beat ! Hark ! I hear an infant cry And the patter of baby-feet : And Hannah listened as she spoke , But only heard the driving rain , As on the cottage-roof it broke And pattered on the window-pane . And she sat knitting by the fire While pussy frolicked at her feet ; And ever roared the tempest higher , And ever harder the hailstones beat . " Hark ! the cry -- it comes again ! " " Nay , it is the winds that wail , And the patter on the pane Of the driving sleet and hail " Replied the farmer as he piled The crackling hemlock on the coals , And lit his corn-cob pipe and smiled The smile of sweet contented souls . Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kine are snug in barn and byre ; The apples sputter on the hearth , The cider simmers on the fire . But once again at midnight high , She heard in dreams , through wind and sleet , An infant moan , an infant cry , And the patter of baby-feet . Half-waking from her dreams she turned And heard the driving wind and rain ; Still on the hearth the fagots burned , And hail beat on the window-pane . John rose as wont , at dawn of day ; The earth was white with frozen sleet ; And lo his faithful Fido lay Dead on the door-stone at his feet . THE REIGN OF REASON The day of truth is dawning . I behold O'er darksome hills the trailing robes of gold And silent footsteps of the gladsome dawn . The morning breaks by sages long foretold ; Truth comes to set upon the world her throne .

Fantastic phantasms fly before the light --  Pale , gibbering ghosts and ghouls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands years ? Groping among the shadows of the night , Moon-struck and in a weird somnambulism , Mumbling some cunning cant or catechism , Thrilled by the electric magic of the skies --  Sun-touched by Truth -- awakes and rubs his eyes . Old Superstition , mother of cruel creeds , O'er all the earth hath sown her dragon-teeth . Lo centuries on centuries the seeds Grew rank , and from them all the haggard breeds Of Hate and Fear and Hell and cruel Death . And still her sunken eyes glare on mankind ; Her livid lips grin horrible ; her hands , Shriveled to bone and sinew , clutch all lands And with blind fear lead on or drive the blind . Ah ignorance and fear go hand in hand , Twin-born , and broadcast scatter hate and thorns , They people earth with ghosts and hell with horns , And sear the eyes of truth with burning brand .

Yea , some are slave to wine And some to women , some to shining gold , But all to habit and to customs old . Around our stunted souls old tenets twine And it is hard to straighten in the oak The crook that in the sapling had its start : The callous neck is glad to wear the yoke ; Nor reason rules the head , but aye the heart : The head is weak , the throbbing heart is strong ; But where the heart is right the head is not far wrong . Men have been learning error age on age , And superstition is their heritage Bequeathed from age to age and sire to son Since the dim history of the world begun . Trust paves the way for treachery to tread ; Under the cloak of virtue vices creep ; Fools chew the chaff while cunning eats the bread , And wolves become the shepherds of the sheep . The mindless herd are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned of the schools Furnished pack-saddles for the backs of fools . Pale Superstition loves the gloom of night ; Truth , like a diamond , ever loves the light . But still ' t were wrong to speak but in abuse , For priests and popes have had , and have , their use . Yea , Superstition since the world began Hath been an instrument to govern man : For men were brutes , and brutal fear was given To chain the brute till Reason came from heaven . Aye , men were beasts for lo how many ages ! And only fear held them in chains and cages . Wise men were priests , and gladly I accord They were the priests and prophets of the Lord ; For love was lust and o'er all earth 's arena Hell-fire alone could tame the wild hyena . All history is the register , we find , Of the crimes and lusts and sufferings of mankind ; And there are still dark lands where it is well That Superstition wear the horns of hell , And hold her torches o'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goblin dread Till Reason come the darkness to dispel . How hard it is for mortals to unlearn Beliefs bred in the marrow of their bones ! How hard it is for mortals to discern The truth that preaches from the silent stones , The silent hills , the silent universe , While Error cries in sanctimonious tones That all the light of life and God is hers ! Lo in the midst we stand : we can not see Either the dark beginning or the end , Or where our tottering footsteps turn or trend In the vast orbit of Eternity . Let Reason be our light -- the only light That God hath given unto benighted man , Wherewith to see a glimpse of his vast plan And stars of hope that glimmer on our night . Lo all-pervading Unity is His ; Lo all-pervading Unity is He : One mighty heart throbs in the earth and sea , In every star through heaven 's immensity , And God in all things breathes , in all things is .

God hath laid down the limits we can not pass ; And it is well he giveth us no glass Wherewith to see beyond the present glance , Else we might die a thousand deaths perchance Before we lay our bones beneath the grass . What is the soul , and whither will it fly ? We only know that matter can not die , But lives and lived through all eternity , And ever turns from hoary age to youth . And is the soul not worthier than the dust ?

Up-grew in silence through a thousand years The Titan-armed , gnarl-jointed , rugged oak , Rock-rooted . Through his beard and shaggy locks Soft breezes sung and tempests roared : the rain A thousand summers trickled down his beard ; A thousand winters whitened on his head ; Yet spake he not . He , from his coigne of hills , Beheld the rise and fall of empire , saw The pageantry and perjury of kings , The feudal barons and the slavish churls , The peace of peasants ; heard the merry song Of mowers singing to the swing of scythes , The solemn-voiced , low-wailing funeral dirge Winding slow-paced with death to humble graves ; And heard the requiem sung for coffined kings . Saw castles rise and castles crumble down , Abbeys up-loom and clang their solemn bells , And heard the owl hoot ruin on their walls : Beheld a score of battle fields corpse-strewn --  Blood-fertiled with ten thousand flattered fools Who , but to please the vanity of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spake not , neither sighed nor made a moan . Saw from the blood of heroes roses spring , And where the clangor of steel-sinewed War Roared o'er embattled rage , heard gentle Peace To bleating hills and vales of rustling gold Flute her glad notes from morn till even-tide . Grim with the grime of a thousand years he stood --  Grand in his silence , mighty in his years . Under his shade the maid and lover wooed ; Under his arms their children 's children played And lambkins gamboled ; at his feet by night The heart-sick wanderer laid him down and died , And he looked on in silence . Silent hours In ghostly pantomime on tip-toe tripped The stately minuet of the passing years , Until the horologe of Time struck One . Black Thunder growled and from his throne of gloom Fire-flashed the night with hissing bolt , and lo , Heart-split , the giant of a thousand years Uttered one voice and like a Titan fell , Crashing one hammer-clang , and passed away .

On the Spirit-Island CH sitting under midnight 's misty moon , Lo I see the spirits flitting o'er the waters one by one ! Slumber wraps the silent city , and the droning mills are dumb ; One lone whippowil 's shrill ditty calls her mate that ne'er will come . Sadly moans the mighty river , foaming down the fettered falls , Where of old he thundered ever o'er abrupt and lofty walls . Great Unktehee -- god of waters -- lifts no more his mighty head ; Fled he with the timid otters ?  - -  lies he in the cavern dead ?

Would you hear the legend olden hearken while I tell the tale --  Shorn , alas , of many a golden , weird Dakota chant and wail . CH The small island of rock a few rods below the Falls , was called by the Dakotas Wanagee We-ta -- Spirit-Island . They say the spirit of Anpetu Sapa sits upon that island at night and pours forth her sorrow in song . They also say that from time out of mind , war-eagles nested on that island , until the advent of white men frightened them away . This seems to be true .

In the battle 's din and clangor fast his fatal arrows flew , Flashed his fiery eyes with anger , many a stealthy foe he slew . Hunter swift was he and cunning , caught the beaver , slew the bear , Overtook the roebuck running , dragged the panther from his lair . Loved was he by many a maiden ; many a dark eye glanced in vain ; Many a heart with sighs was laden for the love it could not gain .

Let the eagle scream , and the bayonet gleam ! Hurrah for the Volunteers ! CHARGE OF " THE BLACK-HORSE " First battle of Bull Run . Our columns are broken , defeated , and fled ; We are gathered , a few from the flying and dead , Where the green flag is up and our wounded remain Imploring for water and groaning in pain . Lo the blood-spattered bosom , the shot-shattered limb , The hand-clutch of fear as the vision grows dim , The half-uttered prayer and the blood-fettered breath , The cold marble brow and the calm face of death . O proud were these forms at the dawning of morn , When they sprang to the call of the shrill bugle-horn : There are mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  - -  Is this then the glory of war ? But hark !  - -  hear the cries from the field of despair ; " The Black-Horse " are charging the fugitives there ; They gallop the field o'er the dying and dead , And their blades with the blood of their victims are red . The cries of the fallen and flying are vain ; They saber the wounded and trample the slain ; And the plumes of the riders wave red in the sun , As they stoop for the stroke and the murder goes on . They halt for a moment -- they form and they stand ; Then with sabers aloft they ride down on our band Like the samiel that sweeps o'er Arabia 's sand . " Halt !  - -  down with your sabers !  - -  the dying are here ! Let the foeman respect while the friend sheds a tear . " Nay ; the merciless butchers were thirsting for blood , And mad for the murder still onward they rode . " Stand firm and be ready ! "  - -  Our brave , gallant few Have faced to the foe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim riders go down in a breath At the flash of our guns -- in the tempest of death ! They wheel , and they clutch in despair at the mane ! They reel in their saddles and fall to the plain ! The riderless steeds , wild with wounds and with fear , Dash away o'er the field in unbridled career ; Their stirrups swing loose and their manes are all gore From the mad cavaliers that shall ride them no more . Of the hundred so bold that rode down on us there But few rode away with the tale of despair ; Their proud , plumed comrades so reckless , alas , Slept their long , dreamless sleep on the blood-spattered grass . ONLY A PRIVATE KILLED The soldier was Louis Mitchell , of Co. 1 , 1st Minn . Vols. , killed in a skirmish , near Ball 's Bluff , October 22 , 1861 . " We 've had a brush , " the Captain said , " And Rebel blood we 've spilled ; We came off victors with the loss Of only a private killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hot , "  --  Then he breathed a heavy breath --  " Poor fellow !  - -  he was badly shot , Then bayoneted to death . " And now was hushed the martial din ; The saucy foe had fled ; They brought the private 's body in ; I went to see the dead ; For I could not think our Rebel foes --  So valiant in the van --  So boastful of their chivalry --  Could kill a wounded man . A musket ball had pierced his thigh --  A frightful , crushing wound --  And then with savage bayonets They pinned him to the ground . One deadly thrust drove through the heart , Another through the head ; Three times they stabbed his pulseless breast When he lay cold and dead . His hair was matted with his gore , His hands were clinched with might , As if he still his musket bore So firmly in the fight . He had grasped the foemen 's bayonets Their murderous thrusts to fend : They raised the coat-cape from his face , And lo -- it was my friend ! Think what a shudder chilled my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed together merrily , As we talked of days of yore . " How happy we shall be , " he said , " When the war is o'er , and when With victory 's song and victory 's tread We all march home again . " Ah little he dreamed -- that soldier brave So near his journey 's goal --  How soon a heavenly messenger Would claim his Christian soul . But he fell like a hero -- fighting , And hearts with grief are filled ; And honor is his ,  - -  tho ' the Captain says " Only a private killed . " I knew him well ,  - -  he was my friend ; He loved our land and laws , And he fell a blessed martyr To our Country 's holy cause ; And I know a cottage in the West Where eyes with tears are filled As they read the careless telegram --  " Only a private killed . " Comrades , bury him under the oak , Wrapped in his army-blue ; He is done with the battle 's din and smoke , With drill and the proud review . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood will thus be spilled , And what care we if the Captain say --  " Only a private killed . " For the glorious Old Flag beckons . We have pledged her heart and hand , And we 'll brave even death to rescue Our dear old Fatherland . We ask not praise -- nor honors , Then -- as each grave is filled --  What care we if the Captain say --  " Only a private killed . " DO THEY THINK OF US ? October , 1861 , after the Battle of Ball 's Bluff . Do they think of us , say -- in the far distant West --  On the Prairies of Peace , in the Valleys of Rest ? On the long dusty march when the suntide is hot , O say , are their sons and their brothers forgot ?

Foremost on our line of battle All-day-long a veteran stood --  Stalwart , brawny , grim and steady , Black with powder , smeared with blood ; Never flinched and never faltered In the deadliest storm of lead , And before his steady rifle Lay a score of foemen dead . Never flinched and never faltered Till our shout of victory rose , Till he saw defeat , disaster , Overwhelmed our flying foes ; Then he trembled , then he tottered , Gasped for breath and dropped his gun , Staggered from the ranks and prostrate Fell to the earth . His work was done . Silent comrades gathered round him , And his Captain sadly came , Bathed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name ; And his fellow soldiers softly On his knapsack laid his head ; Then his eyes were lit with luster , And he raised his hand and said : " Good-bye , comrades ; farewell , Captain !

We have marched and fought together Till you seem like brothers all , But I hope again to meet you At the final bugle-call . " Captain , write and tell my mother That she must not mourn and cry , For I never flinched in battle , And I do not fear to die . You may add a word for Mary ; Tell her I was ever true . Mary took a miff one Sunday , And so I put on the " blue . " " And I know she has repented , But I never let her see How it cut -- her crusty answer --  When she turned away from me .

Ready and ripe for the harvest lay the acres of golden grain Waving on hillock and hillside and bending along the plain . Ready and ripe for the harvest two veteran armies lay Waiting the signal of battle on the Gettysburg hills that day . Sharp rang the blast of the bugles calling the foe to the fray , And shrill from the enemy 's cannon the demon shells shrieked as they flew ; Crashed and rumbled and roared our batteries ranged on the hill , Rumbled and roared at the front the bellowing guns of the foe Swelling the chorus of hell ever louder and deadlier still , And shrill o'er the roar of the cannon rose the yell of the rebels below , As they charged on our Third Corps advanced and crushed in the lines at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saber in air , Forward rode furious Longstreet charging on Round Top there --  Key to our left and center -- key to the fate of the field --  Leading his wild-mad Southrons on to the lions ' lair .

Drowned is the blare of the bugle , lost is the bray of the drum , Yelling , defiant , victorious , column on column they come . Only a handful are we , thrown into the gap of our lines , Holding the perilous breach where the fate of the battle inclines , Only a handful are we -- column on column they come . Roared like the voice of a lion brave Hancock fierce for the fray : " Hurry the reserve battalions ; bring every banner and gun : Charge on the enemy , Colvill , stay the advance of his lines : Here -- by the God of our Fathers !  - -  here shall the battle be won , Or we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today .

NEW-YEARS ADDRESS -- JANUARY 1 , 1866 Written for the St. Paul Pioneer . Good morning -- good morning -- a happy new year ! We greet you , kind friends of the old Pioneer ; Hope your coffee is good and your steak is well done , And you 're happy as clams in the sand and the sun . The old year 's a shadow -- a shade of the past ; It is gone with its toils and its triumphs so vast --  With its joys and its tears -- with its pleasure and pain --  With its shouts of the brave and its heaps of the slain --  Gone -- and it cometh -- no , never again . And as we look forth on the future so fair Let us brush from the picture the visage of care ; The error , the folly , the frown and the tear --  Drop them all at the grave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a burden of woe ? Has the spirit been cowed by a merciless blow ? Has the tongue of the brave or the voice of the fair Prayed to God and received no response to its prayer ? Look up !  - -  'twas a shadow -- the morning is here : A Happy New Year !  - -  O , a Happy New Year ! Yet stay for a moment . We can not forget The fields where the true and the traitor have met ; When the old year came in we were trembling with fear Lest Freedom should fall in her glorious career ; And the roar of the conflict was loud o'er the land Where the traitor-flag waved in a rebel 's red hand ; But the God of the Just led the hosts of the Free , And Victory marched from the north to the sea . Behold -- where the conflict was doubtful and dire --  There -- on house-top and hill-top , on fortress and spire --  The Old Banner waves again higher and prouder , Though torn by the shot and begrimed by the powder . God bless the brave soldiers that followed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the wild charge triumphant -- the sullen retreat --  On fields spread with victory or piled with defeat ; God bless their true hearts for they stood like a wall , And saved us our Country and saved us our all . But many a mother and many a daughter Weep , alas , o'er the brave that went down in the slaughter . Pile the monuments high -- not on hill-top and plain --  To the glorious sons ' neath the old banner slain --  But over the land from the sea to the sea --  Pile their monuments high in the hearts of the Free . Heaven bless the brave souls that are spared to return Where the " lamp in the window " ceased never to burn --  Where the vacant chair stood at the desolate hearth Since the son shouldered arms or the father went forth . " Peace !  - -  Peace ! "  - -  was the shout ;  - -  at the jubilant word Wives and mothers went down on their knees to the Lord ! Methinks I can see , through the vista of years --  From the memories of old such a vision appears --  A gray-haired old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent at his knees , Recounting his deeds with an eloquent tongue , And a fire that enkindles the hearts of the young ; How he followed the Flag from the first to the last --  On the long , weary march , in the battle 's hot blast ; How he marched under Sherman from center to sea , Or fought under Grant in his battles with Lee ; And the old fire comes back to his eye as of yore , And his iron hand clutches his musket once more , As of old on the battle-field ghastly and red , When he sprang to the charge o'er the dying and dead ; And the eyes of his listeners are gleaming with fire , As he points to that Flag floating high on the spire . Illustration : AND THE EYES OF HIS LISTENERS ARE GLEAMING WITH FIRE AS HE POINTS TO THAT FLAG FLOATING HIGH ON THE SPIRE .

The victim , no doubt , of Egyptian flirtation , You mistook your chagrin for divine inspiration , And condemned all the sex without proof or probation , As we rhymsters mistake the moonbeams that elate us For flashes of wit or the holy afflatus , And imagine we hear the applause of a nation ,  --  But all honest men who are married and blest Will agree that the last work of God is the best .

Where is the minstrel 's Father-land ? Where the sparks of noble spirits flew , Where flowery wreaths for beauty grew , Where strong hearts glowed so glad and true For all things sacred , good and grand : There was my Father-land . How named the minstrel 's Father-land ? O'er slaughtered son -- 'neath tyrants ' yokes , She weepeth now -- and foreign strokes ; They called her once the Land of Oaks --  Land of the Free -- the German Land : Thus was called my Father-land . Why weeps the minstrel 's Father-land ? Because while tyrant 's tempest hailed The people 's chosen princes quailed , And all their sacred pledges failed ; Because she could no ear command , Alas must weep my Father-land . Whom calls the minstrel 's Father-land ? She calls on heaven with wild alarm --  With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Retribution 's vengeful hand : On these she calls -- my Father-land . What would the minstrel 's Father-land ? She would strike the base slaves to the ground Chase from her soil the tyrant hound , And free her sons in shackles bound , Or lay them free beneath her sand : That would my Father-land . And hopes the minstrel 's Father-land ? She hopes for holy Freedom 's sake , Hopes that her true sons will awake , Hopes that just God will vengeance take , And ne'er mistakes the Avenger 's hand : Thereon relies my Father-land . MY HEART 'S ON THE RHINE From the German of Wolfgang Muller . My heart 's on the Rhine -- in the old Father-land ; Where my cradle was rocked by a dear mother 's hand , My youth and my friends -- they are there yet , I know , And my love dreams of me with her cheeks all aglow ; O there where I reveled in song and in wine ! Wherever I wander my heart 's on the Rhine . I hail thee , thou broad-breasted , golden-green stream ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain-fields of gold in the valley so blue ; Ye vineyards that glow in the sun-shimmered dew ; Ye forests and caverns and cliffs that were mine ! Wherever I wander my heart 's on the Rhine . I hail thee , O life of the soul-stirring song , Of waltz and of wine , with a yearning so strong , Hail , ye stout race of heroes , so brave and so true . Ye blue-eyed , gay maidens , a greeting to you ! Your life and your aims and your efforts be mine ; Wherever I wander my heart 's on the Rhine . My heart 's on the Rhine -- in the old Father-land , Where my cradle was rocked by a dear mother 's hand ; My youth and my friends -- they are there yet , I know , And my love dreams of me with her cheeks all aglow : Be thou ever the same to me , Land of the Vine ! Wherever I wander my heart 's on the Rhine . THE MINSTREL From the German of Goethe Wilhelm Meister 's Apprenticeship , Book 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateway ringing ? What bard upon the drawbridge singing ? Go bid him to repeat his song Here , in the hall amid the throng , " The monarch cried ; The little page hied ; As back he sped , The monarch said --  " Bring in the gray-haired minstrel . " " I greet you , noble lords and peers ; I greet you , lovely dames . O heaven begemmed with golden spheres ! Who knows your noble names ? In hall of splendor so sublime , Close ye , mine eyes -- 'tis not the time To gaze in idle wonder . " The gray-haired minstrel closed his eyes ; He struck his wildest air ; Brave faces glowed like sunset skies ; Cast down their eyes the fair . The king well pleased with the minstrel 's song , Sent the little page through the wondering throng A chain of gold to bear him . " O give not me the chain of gold ; Award it to thy braves , Before whose faces fierce and bold Quail foes when battle raves ; Or give it thy chancellor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his official burdens . " I sing , I sing as the wild birds sing That in the forest dwell ; The songs that from my bosom spring Alone reward me well : But may I ask that page of thine To bring me one good cup of wine In golden goblet sparkling ? " He took the cup ; he drank it all : " O soothing nectar thine ! Thrice bless 'd the highly favored hall Where flows such glorious wine : If thou farest well , then think of me , And thank thy God , as I thank thee For this inspiring goblet . " HOPE From the German of Schiller . Men talk and dream of better days --  Of a golden time to come ; Toward a happy and shining goal They run with a ceaseless hum . The world grows old and grows young again , Still hope of the better is bright to men . Hope leads us in at the gate of life ; She crowns the boyish head ; Her bright lamp lures the stalwart youth , Nor burns out with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and care , But see -- on the grave -- Hope is planted there ! ' T is not an empty and flattering deceit , Begot in a foolish brain ; For the heart speaks loud with its ceaseless throbs , " We are not born in vain " ; And the words that out of the heart-throbs roll , They can not deceive the hoping soul . MRS . MCNAIR Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem.  - -  Horace . Mrs. McNair Was tall and fair ; Mrs. McNair was slim ; She had flashing black eyes and raven hair ; But a very remarkably modest air ; And her only care was for Mr. McNair ; She was exceedingly fond of him . He sold " notions " and lace With wonderful grace , And kept everything neatly displayed in its place : The red , curly hair on his head and his face He always persisted Should be oiled and twisted ; He was the sleekest young husband that ever existed . Precisely at four He would leave his store ; And Mr. McNair with his modest bride Seated snugly and lovingly by his side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spick-span carriage would rattle away . Though it must be allowed The lady was proud , She 'd have no maid about her the dear lady vowed : So for Mr. McNair The wear and the fare She made it a care of her own to prepare . I think I may guess , being married myself , That the cause was not solely the saving of pelf . As for her , I 'll declare , Though raven her hair , Though her eyes were so dark and her body so slim , She had n't a thought for a man but him . From three to nine , Invited to dine , Oft met at the house of the pair divine : Her husband -- and who , by the way , was well able --  Did all the " agreeable " done at the table ; While she -- most remarkably loving bride --  Sat snugly and modestly down by his side . And when they went out It was whispered about , " She 's the lovingest wife in the town beyond doubt ; " And every one swore , from pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Yes ; Mrs McNair Was modest and fair ; She never fell into a pout or a fret ; And Mr. McNair Was her only care And indeed her only pet . The few short hours he spent at his store She spent sewing or reading the romancers ' lore ; And whoever came It was always the same With the modest lady that opened the door . But there came to town One Captain Brown To spend a month or more . Now this same Captain Brown Was a man of renown , And a dashing blue coat he wore ; And a bright , brass star . And a visible scar On his brow -- that he said he had got in the war As he led the van : ( He never ran ! ) In short , he was the " General 's " right-hand man , And had written his name on the pages of fame . He was smooth as an eel , And rode so genteel That in less than a week every old maid and dame Was constantly lisping the bold Captain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , Had a " bump of reverence " as big as a pear , And whoever like Brown Had a little renown , And happened to visit that rural town , Was invited of course by McNair -- to " go down . " So merely by chance , The son of the lance Became the bold hero of quite a romance : For Mrs. McNair thought him wonderful fair , And that none but her husband could with him compare . Half her timidity vanished in air The first time he dined with herself and McNair . Now the Captain was arch In whiskers and starch And preferred , now and then , a gay waltz to a march . A man , too , he was of uncommon good taste ; Always " at home " and never in haste , And his manners and speech were remarkably chaste . To tell you in short His daily resort He made at the house of " his good friend McNair , " Who ( ' t was really too bad ) was so frequently out When the Captain called in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. McNair was so lonely -- too bad ; So he chatted and chattered and made her look glad . And many a view Of his coat of blue , All studded with buttons gilt , spangled and new , The dear lady took Half askance from her book , As she modestly sat in the opposite nook . Familiarly he And modestly she Talked nonsense and sense so strangely commingled , That the dear lady 's heart was delighted and tingled . A man of sobriety Renown and variety It could not be wrong to enjoy his society : O was it a sin For him to " drop in , " And sometimes to pat her in sport on the chin ? Dear Ladies , beware ; Dear Ladies , take care --  How you play with a lion asleep in his lair : " Mere trifling flirtations " these arts you employ ? Flirtations once led to the siege of old Troy ; And a woman was in For the sorrow and sin And slaughter that fell when the Greeks tumbled in ; Nor is there a doubt , my dears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sack of more cities than one . I would we were all As pure as Saint Paul That we touched not the goblet whose lees are but gall ; But if so we must know where a flirtation leads ; Beware of the fair and look out for our heads . Remember the odious , Frail woman , Herodias Sent old Baptist John to a place incommodious , And prevailed on her husband to cut off his head For an indiscreet thing the old Nazarite said . Day in and day out The blue coat was about ; And the dear little lady was glad when he came And began to be talkative , tender and tame . Then he gave her a ring , begged a curl of her hair , And smilingly whispered her --  " do n't tell McNair . " She dropped her dark eyes And with two little sighs Sent the bold Captain 's heart fluttering up to the skies . Then alas --  What a pass ! He fell at the feet of the lady so sweet , And swore that he loved her beyond his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so frail Turned suddenly pale , Then -- sighed that his love was of little avail ; For alas , the dear Captain -- he must have forgot --  She was tied to McNair with a conjugal knot . But indeed She agreed --  Were she only a maid he alone could succeed ; But she prayed him by all that is sacred and fair , Not to rouse the suspicion of Mr. McNair . ' T was really too bad , For the lady was sad : And a terrible night o't the poor lady had , While Mr. McNair wondered what was the matter , And endeavored to coax , to console and to flatter . Many tears she shed That night while in bed For she had such a terrible pain in her head ! " My dear little pet , where 's the camphor ? " he said ; " I 'll go for the doctor -- you 'll have to be bled ; I declare , my dear wife , you are just about dead . " " O no , my dear ; I pray you do n't fear , Though the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it is -- I have had it before --  It 's only neuralgia : please go to the store And bring me a bottle of ' Davis 's Pain- Killer , ' and I shall be better again . " He sprang out of bed And away he sped In his gown for the cordial to cure her head , Not dreaming that Cupid had played her a trick --  The blind little rogue with a sharpened stick . I confess on my knees I have had the disease ; It is worse than the bites of a thousand fleas ; And the only cure I have found for these ills Is a double dose of " Purgative Pills . " He rubbed her head --  And eased it , she said ; And he shrugged and shivered and got into bed . He slept and he snored , but the poor lady 's pain , When her lord slept soundly , came on again . It wore away However by day And when Brown called again she was smiling and gay ; But alas , he must say -- to the lady 's dismay --  In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay , And must leave for his regiment with little delay . Now Mrs. McNair Was tall and fair , Mrs. McNair was slim , But the like of Brown was so wonderful rare That she could not part with him . Indeed you can see it was truly a pity , For her husband was just going down to the city , And Captain Brown --  The man of renown --  Could console her indeed were he only in town . So McNair to the city the next Monday hied , And left bold Captain Brown with his modest young bride . As the serpent did Eve Most sorely deceive --  Causing old father Adam to sorrow and grieve , And us , his frail children , tho ' punished and chidden , To hanker for things that are sweet but forbidden --  The Captain so fair , With his genius so rare , Wound the web of enchantment round Mrs. McNair ; And alas , fickle Helen , ere three days were over , She had sworn to elope with her brass-buttoned lover . Like Helen , the Greek , She was modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a trifle too weak . When a maid she had suitors as proud as Ulysses , But she ne'er bent her neck to their arms or their kisses , Till McNair he came in With a brush on his chin --  It was love at first sight -- but a trifle too thin ; For , married , the dreams of her girlhood fell short all , And she found that her husband was only a mortal . Dear ladies , betray us --  Fast and loose play us --  We 'll follow you still like bereaved Menelaus , Till the little blind god with his cruel shafts slay us . Cold-blooded as I am , If a son of old Priam Should break the Mosaic commands and defy ' em , And elope with my " pet , " and moreover my riches , I would follow the rogue if I went upon crutches To the plains of old Troy without jacket or breeches . But then I 'm so funny If he 'd give up the money , He might go to the dogs with himself and his " Honey . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark and with very great speed , For Mr. McNair -- when the fellow came back --  Might go crazy and foolishly follow their track . So at midnight should wait At her garden-gate A carriage to carry the dear , precious freight Of Mrs. McNair who should meet Captain Brown At the Globe Hotel in a neighboring town . A man should be hired To convey the admired . And keep mum as a mouse , and do what was desired . Wearily , wearily half the night The lady watched away ; At times in a spirit of sadness quite , But fully resolved on her amorous flight , She longed to be under way ; Yet with sad heaving heart and a tear , I declare , As she sorrowfully thought of poor Mr. McNair . " Poor fellow , " she sighed , " I wish he had died Last spring when he had his complaint in the side For I know -- I am sure -- it will terribly grieve him To have me elope with the Captain and leave him . But the Captain -- dear me ! I hardly can see Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But see -- there 's the carriage , I vow , at the gate ! I must go -- 'tis the law of inveterate fate . " So a parting look At her home she took , While a terrible conflict her timid soul shook ; Then turned to the carriage heart-stricken and sore , Stepped hastily in and closed up the door . " Crack ! " went the whip ; She bit her white lip , And away she flew on her desperate trip . She thought of dear Brown ; and poor Mr. McNair --  She knew he would hang himself straight in despair . She sighed And she cried All during the ride , And endeavored -- alas , but she could not decide . Three times she prayed ; Three times she essayed To call to the driver for pity and aid --  To drive her straight To her garden-gate , And break the spell of her terrible fate . But her tongue was tied --  She could n't decide , And she only moaned at a wonderful rate . No mortal can tell " What might have befell , " Had it been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached it she broke from her spell . A single hair For Mr. McNair She vowed to herself that she did not care ; But the Captain so true In his coat of blue --  To his loving arms in her fancy she flew . In a moment or more They drove up to the door , And she felt that her trials and troubles were o'er . The landlord came hastily out in his slippers , For late he had sat with some smokers and sippers . As the lady stepped down With a fret and a frown , She sighed half aloud , " Where is dear Captain Brown ? " " This way , my dear madam , " politely he said , And straightway to the parlor the lady he led . Now the light was dim Where she followed him , And the dingy old parlor looked gloomy and grim . As she entered , behold , in contemplative mood , In the farther corner the bold Captain stood In his coat of blue : To his arms she flew ; She buried her face in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " sighed Mrs. McNair ; Then she raised her dark eyes and -- Good Heavens ' I declare !  - -  -  Instead of the Captain ' twas -- Mr . McNair ! She threw up her arms -- she screamed -- and she fainted ; Such a scene !  - -  Ah the like of it never was painted . Of repentance and pardon I need not tell ; Her vows I will not relate , For every man must guess them well Who knows much of the " married state . " Of the sad mischance suffice it to say That McNair had suspected the Captain 's " foul play ; " So he laid a snare For the bold and the fair , But he captured , alas , only Mrs. McNair ; And the brass-buttoned lover -- bold Captain Brown --  Was nevermore seen in that rural town . Mrs. McNair Is tall and fair ; Mrs. McNair is slim ; And her husband again is her only care --  She is wonderfully fond of him ; For now he is all the dear lady can wish -- he Is a captain himself -- in the State militia . 1859 .

" THE DEVIL AND THE MONK Once Satan and a monk went on a " drunk , " And Satan struck a bargain with the monk , Whereby the Devil 's crew was much increased By penceless poor and now and then a priest Who , lacking cunning or good common sense , Got caught in flagrante and out of pence . Then in high glee the Devil filled a cup And drank a brimming bumper to the pope : Then --  " Here 's to you , " he said , " sober or drunk , In cowl or corsets , every monk 's a punk . Whate'er they preach unto the common breed , At heart the priests and I are well agreed . Justice is blind we see , and deaf and old , But in her scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harem in disguise , And virtue is a fig-leaf for the wise To hide the naked truth of lust and lecheries . " And still the toilers feed the pious breed , And pin their faith upon the bishop 's sleeve ; Hungry for hope they gulp a moldy creed And dine on faith . ' T is easier to believe An old-time fiction than to wear a tooth In gnawing bones to reach the marrow truth . Priests murder Truth and with her gory ghost They frighten fools and give the rogues a roast Until without or pounds or pence or price --  Free as the fabled wine of paradise --  They furnish priestly plates with buttered toast . Your priests of superstition stalk the land With Jacob 's winning voice and Esau 's hand ; Sinners to hell and saints to heaven they call , And eat the fattest fodder in the stall . They , versed in dead rituals in dead language deep , Talk Greek to th ' grex and Latin to their sheep , And feed their flocks a flood of cant and college For every drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon , " softly said the monk , " I fear your Majesty is raving drunk . I would be courteous . " But the Devil laughed And slyly winked and sagely shook his head . " My fawning dog , " the sage satanic said , " Wags not his tail for me but for my bread . Brains rule to day as they have ruled for aye , And craft grown craftier in this modern day Still rides the fools , but in a craftier way ; And priestcraft lingers and survives its use ; What was a blessing once is now abuse : Grown fat and arrogant on power and pelf , The old-time shepherd has become a wolf And only feeds his flocks to feast himself . To clink of coin the pious juggler jumps , For still he thinks , as in the days of old , The key to holy heaven is made of gold , That in the game of mortals money is trumps , That golden darts will pierce e'en Virtue 's shield , And by the salve of gold all sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence With hand outstretched for toll of Peter-pence , And sinners ' souls must groan in Purgatory Until they pay the admission-fee to glory . " There was an honest poet once on earth Who beat all other bardies at a canter ; Rob ' Burns his mother called him at his birth . Though handicapped by rum and much a ranter , He won the madcap race in Tam O'Shanter . He drove a spanking span from Scottish heather , Strong-limbed , but light of foot as flea or feather --  Rhyme and Reason , matched and yoked together , And reined them with light hand and limber leather . He wrote to me once on a time -- I mind it --  A bold epistle and the poet signed it . He thought to cheat " Auld Nickie " of his dues , But who outruns the Devil casts his shoes ; And so at last from frolicking and drinkin ' , ' Some luckless hour ' sent him to Hell ' alinkin ' ! CW Times had been rather dull in my dominion , And all my imps like lubbers lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And in ten minutes had all Hell aroaring . Then Robbie pulled his book of poems out And read us sundry satires from the book ; ' Death and Doctor Hornbook ' raised a shout Till all the roof-tin on the rafters shook ; And when his ' Unco Guid ' the bardie read The crew all clapped their hands and yelled like mad ; But ' Holy Willie 's Prayer ' ' brought down the house ' . So I was glad to give the bard a pass And a few pence for toll at Peter 's gate ; For if the roof of Hell were made of brass Bob Burns would shake it off as sure as fate . I mind it well -- that poem on a louse ! ' O wad some pow'r the giftie gie us , ' Monk , ' To see oursels as others see us '  - -  drunk ; ' It wad frae monie a blunder free us '  - -  list !  --  ' And foolish notion .

" CW Tripping . See Burns ' " Address to the Deil " Not to be beat the jolly monk filled up His silver mug with rare old Burgundy ; " Here 's to your health , " he said , " your Majesty "  --  And drained the brimming goblet at a gulp --  " ' For when the Devil was sick the Devil a monk would be ; But when the Devil got well a devil a monk was he . ' In vino veritas is true , no doubt --  When wine goes in teetotal truth comes out . To shake a little Shakespeare in the wine : ' Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall ' ; But in the realm of Fate , as I opine , A devil a virtue is or sin at all . ' The Devil be damned ' is what we preach , you know it --  At mass and vespers , holy-bread and dinner : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sanctify the sin and damn the sinner . This poet Shakespeare , whom I read with pleasure , Wrote once -- I think , in taking his own ' Measure ' :  --  ' They say best men are molded out of faults , And , for the most , become much more the better For being a little bad . ' The reason halts : If read between the lines -- not by the letter --  ' T is plain enough that Shakespeare was atrimmin ' His own unruly ship and furling sail To meet a British tempest or a gale , And keep cold water from his wine and women . Now I 'll admit , when he 's a little mellow , The Devil himself 's a devilish clever fellow , And , though his cheeks and paunch are somewhat shrunk , He only lacks a cowl to make a monk . Time is the mother of twins et hic et nunc ; Come , hood your horns and fill the mug abrimmin ' , For we are cheek by jowl on wit and wine and women . " And so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaffed and laughed the night away ; And when the " wee sma " hours of night had come , The monk slipped out and stole the abbot 's rum ; And when the abbot came at break of day , There cheek by jowl -- horns , hoofs , and hood -- they lay , With open missal and an empty jug , And broken beads and badly battered mug --  In fond embrace -- dead drunk upon the rug . Think not , wise reader , that the bard hath drunk The wine that fumed these vagaries from the monk ; Nor , in the devil ethics thou hast read , There spake the poet in the Devil 's stead . Let Virtue be our helmet and our shield , And Truth our weapon -- weapon sharp and strong And deadly to all error and all wrong . Yea , armed with Truth , though rogues and rascals throng The citadel of Virtue shall not yield , For God 's right arm of Truth prevails in every field .

NOTES 1 Called in the Dakota tongue " Hok-see-win-na-pee Wo-han-pee "  - -  Virgins ' Dance ( or Feast ) . 2 One of the favorite and most exciting games of the Dakotas is ball-playing . A smooth place on the prairie , or in winter , on a frozen lake or river , is chosen . Each player has a sort of bat , called " Ta-kee-cha-pse-cha , " about thirty-two inches long , with a hoop at the lower end four or five inches in diameter , interlaced with thongs of deer-skin , forming a sort of pocket . With these bats they catch and throw the ball . Stakes are set as bounds at a considerable distance from the center on either side . Two parties are then formed and each chooses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then thrown up half way between the bounds , and the game begins , the contestants contending with their bats for the ball as it falls . When one succeeds in getting it fairly into the pocket of his bat he swings it aloft and throws it as far as he can toward the bound to which his party is working , taking care to send it if possible where some of his own side will take it up . Thus the ball is thrown and contended for till one party succeeds in casting it beyond the bounds of the opposite party . A hundred players on a side are sometimes engaged in this exciting game . Betting on the result often runs high . Moccasins , pipes , knives , hatchets , blankets , robes and guns are hung on the prize-pole . Not unfrequently horses are staked on the issue and sometimes even women . Old men and mothers are among the spectators , praising their swift-footed sons , and young wives and maidens are there to stimulate their husbands and lovers . This game is not confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dakota maidens , who generally play for prizes offered by the chief or warriors . ( See Neill 's Hist .

A fabled spirit who dwells in the frozen North , in a great teepee of ice and snow . From his mouth and nostrils he blows the cold blasts of winter . He and I-to-ka-ga Wi cas-ta -- the spirit or god of the South ( literally the " South Man " ) are inveterate enemies , and always on the war-path against each other . In winter Wa-zi-ya advances southward and drives I-to-ka-ga Wi-cas-ta before him to the Summer-Islands . But in spring the god of the South having renewed his youth and strength in the " Happy Hunting Grounds , " is able to drive Wa-zi-ya back again to his icy wigwam in the North .

The Chippeways called the grandfather Ka-ka-ge -- crow or raven -- from his war-badge , a crow-skin ; and hence the French traders and courriers du bois called him " Petit Corbeau "  - -  Little Crow .

Wakinyan Tanka -- Big Thunder , was killed by the accidental discharge of his own gun . They were both buried with their kindred near the " Wakan Teepee , " the sacred Cave -- (Carver 's Cave ) . Ta-o-ya-te-du-ta , the last of the Little Crows , was killed July 3 , 1863 , during the outbreak , near Hutchinson , Minnesota , by the Lampsons -- father and son , and his bones were duly " done up " for the Historical Society of Minnesota .

From him personally I obtained much information in regard to Little Crow 's participation in the " Sioux War , " and minutely the speech that Little Crow made to his braves when he finally consented to lead them on the war-path against the whites . A literal translation of that speech will be found further on in this note . I knew Ta-o-ya-te-du-ta , and from his own lips , in 1859-60 and 61 , obtained much interesting information in regard to the history , tradition , customs , superstitions and habits of the Dakotas , of whom he was the recognized Head-Chief . He was a remarkable Indian -- a philosopher and a brave and generous man . " Untutored savage " that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the peer in natural ability of the ablest white men in the Northwest in his time . He had largely adopted the dress and habits of civilized man , and he urged his people to abandon their savage ways , build houses , cultivate fields , and learn to live like the white people . He clearly forsaw the ultimate extinction of his people as a distinct race . He well knew and realized the numbers and power of the whites then rapidly taking possession of the hunting-grounds of the Dakotas , and the folly of armed opposition on the part of his people . He said to me once : " No more Dakotas by and by ; Indians all white men . No more buffaloes by and by ; all cows , all oxen . " But his braves were restless . They smarted under years of wrong and robbery , to which , indeed , the most stinging insults were often added by the traders and officials among them . If the true , unvarnished history of the cause and inception of the " Sioux Outbreak " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the blush of shame to the cheeks of every honest man who reads it . Against his judgment and repeated protests , Little Crow was at last , after the depredations had begun , forced into the war on the whites by his hot-headed and uncontrollable " young men . " Goaded to desperation , a party of Little Crow 's young " bucks , " in August , 1862 , began their depredations and spilled white blood at Acton . Returning to their chief 's camp near the agency , they told their fellow braves what they had done . The hot-headed young warriors immediately demanded of Little Crow that he put on the " war-paint " and lead them against the white men . The chief severely rebuked the " young men " who had committed the murders , blackened his face ( a sign of mourning ) , retired to his teepee and covered his head in sorrow . His braves surrounded his tent and cut it into strips with their knives . They threatened to depose him from the chiefship unless he immediately put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knew that the Civil War was then in progress , that the white men were fighting among themselves , and they declared that now was the time to regain their lost hunting-grounds ; that now was the time to avenge the thievery and insults of the Agents who had for years systematically cheated them out of the greater part of their promised annuities , for which they had been induced to part with their lands ; that now was the time to avenge the debauchery of their wives and daughters by the dissolute hangers-on who , as employees of the Indian Agents and licensed traders , had for years hovered around them like buzzards around the carcasses of slaughtered buffaloes . But Little Crow was unmoved by the appeals and threats of his warriors . It is said that once for a moment he uncovered his head ; that his face was haggard and great beads of sweat stood out on his forehead . But at last one of his enraged braves , bolder than the rest , cried out : " Ta-o-ya-te-du-ta is a coward ! " Instantly Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of his insulter and flung them on the ground . Then , stretching himself to his full height , his eyes flashing fire , and in a voice tremulous with rage , he exclaimed : " Ta-o-ya-te-du-ta is not a coward , and he is not a fool ! When did he run away from his enemies ? When did he leave his braves behind him on the war-path and turn back to his teepees ? When he ran away from your enemies , he walked behind on your trail with his face to the Ojibways and covered your backs as a she-bear covers her cubs ! Is Ta-o-ya-te-du-ta without scalps ?

Therefore Wapasa means the Standard -- and not the " Leaf-Shaker , " as many writers have it . The principal village of these hereditary chiefs was Ke-uk-sa , or Ke-o-sa ,  - -  where now stands the fair city of Winona . Ke-uk-sa signifies -- The village of law-breakers ; so called because this band broke the law or custom of the Dakotas against marrying blood relatives of any degree . I get this information from Rev. Stephen R. Riggs , author of the Dakota Grammar and Dictionary , " Takoo Wakan , " etc .

Ate , on-she-ma-da "  --  " Sacred Spirit ,  - -  Father , have mercy on me . " As the Sun is the father , so they believe the Earth is the mother , of life . Truly there is much philosophy in the Dakota mythology . The Algonkins call the earth " Me-suk-kum-mik-o-kwa "  - -  the great-grandmother of all .

He inhabits fens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At night he often lights a torch ( evidently the ignis fatuus or Jack-o ' lantern ) and swings it on the marshes to decoy the unwary into his toils . 73 The Dakotas have their stone-idol , or god , called Toon-kan -- or Inyan . This god dwells in stone or rocks and is , they say , the oldest god of all -- he is grandfather of all living things . I think , however , that the stone is merely the symbol of the everlasting , all-pervading , invisible Ta-ku Wa-kan -- the essence of all life ,  - -  pervading all nature , animate and inanimate . The Rev. S.R. Riggs , who for forty years has been a student of Dakota customs , superstitions , etc. , says , Tahkoo Wahkan , p. 55 , et seq. : " The religious faith of the Dakota is not in his gods as such . It is in an intangible , mysterious something of which they are only the embodiment , and that in such measure and degree as may accord with the individual fancy of the worshiper . Each one will worship some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great object of all their worship , whatever its chosen medium , is the Ta-koo Wa-kan , which is the supernatural and mysterious . No one term can express the full meaning of the Dakota 's Wakan . It comprehends all mystery , secret power and divinity . Awe and reverence are its due , and it is as unlimited in manifestation as it is in idea . All life is Wakan ; so also is everything which exhibits power , whether in action , as the winds and drifting clouds ; or in passive endurance , as the boulder by the wayside . For even the commonest sticks and stones have a spiritual essence which must be reverenced as a manifestation of the all-pervading , mysterious power that fills the universe . " 74 **25;2986;TOOLONG ; literally -- Pine-shooter ,  - -  he that shoots among the pines . When Father Hennepin was at Mille Lacs in 1679-80 , Wazi-kute was the head chief ( Itancan ) of the band of Isantees . Hennepin writes the name Ouasicoude , and translates it -- the " Pierced Pine . " See Shea 's Hennepin , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 316. 75 When a Dakota brave wishes to " propose " to a " dusky maid , " he visits her teepee at night after she has retired , or rather , laid down in her robe to sleep . He lights a splinter of wood and holds it to her face . If she blows out the light , he is accepted ; if she covers her head and leaves it burning he is rejected . The rejection however is not considered final till it has been thrice repeated . Even then the maiden is often bought of her parents or guardian , and forced to become the wife of the rejected suitor . If she accepts the proposal , still the suitor must buy her of her parents with suitable gifts . 76 The Dakotas called the falls of St. Anthony the Ha-Ha -- the loud laughing , or roaring . The Mississippi River they called Ha-Ha Wa-kpa River of the Falls . The Ojibway name for the Falls of St. Anthony is Ka-ka-bik-kung . Minnehaha is a combination of two Dakota words -- Mini -- water and Ha-Ha , Falls ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cataract . Some authorities say they called it I-ha-ha -- pronounced E-rhah-rhah -- lightly laughing . Rev. S.W. Pond , whose long residence as a missionary among the Dakotas in this immediate vicinity makes him an authority that can hardly be questioned , says they called the Falls of Minnehaha " Mini-i-hrpa-ya-dan , " and it had no other name in Dakota . " It means Little Falls and nothing else . " Letter to the author . 77 The game of the Plum-stones is one of the favorite games of the Dakotas . Hennepin was the first to describe this game , in his Description de la Louisiane , Paris , 1683 , and he describes it very accurately . See Shea 's translation p. 301 . The Dakotas call this game Kan-soo Koo-tay-pe -- shooting plum-stones . Each stone is painted black on one side and red on the other ; on one side they grave certain figures which make the stones Wakan . They are placed in a dish and thrown up like dice . Indeed , the game is virtually a game of dice . Hennepin says : " There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even their great coat . Those who conduct the game cry at the top of their voices when they rattle the platter , and they strike their shoulders so hard as to leave them all black with the blows . " 78 Wa-tanka -- contraction of Wa-kan Tanka -- Great Spirit . The Dakotas had no Wakan Tanka or Wakan-peta -- fire spirit -- till white men imported them . There being no name for the Supreme Being in the Dakota tongue ( except Taku Skan-skan.  - -  See note 51 )  - -  and all their gods and spirits being Wakan -- the missionaries named God in Dakota --  " Wakan Tanka "  - -  which means Big Spirit , or The Big Mysterious . 79 The Dakotas called Lake Calhoun , at Minneapolis , Minn.  -- Mde-mdo-za -- Loon Lake . They also called it Re-ya-ta-mde -- the lake back from the river . They called Lake Harriet -- Mde-unma -- the other lake -- or ( perhaps ) Mde-uma -- Hazel-nut Lake . The lake nearest Calhoun on the north -- Lake of the Isles -- they called Wi-ta Mde -- Island-Lake . Lake Minnetonka they called Me-ne-a-tan-ka -- Broad Water . 80 The animal called by the French voyageurs the cabri ( the kid ) is found only on the prairies . It is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift that neither horse nor dog can overtake it . ( Snelling 's " Tales of the Northwest , " p. 286 , note 15 . ) It is the gazelle , or prairie antelope , called by the Dakotas Ta-toka-dan -- little antelope . It is the Pish-tah-te-koosh of the Algonkin tribes , " reckoned the fleetest animal in the prairie country about the Assiniboin . " Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner , p. 301. 81 The Wicastapi Wakanpi ( literally , men supernatural ) are the " Medicine-men " or Magicians of the Dakotas . They call themselves the sons or disciples of Unktehee . In their rites , ceremonies , tricks and pretensions they closely resemble the Dactyli , Idae , and Curetes of the ancient Greeks and Romans , the Magi of the Persians and the Druids of Britain . Their pretended intercourse with spirits , their powers of magic and divination , and their rites are substantially the same , and point unmistakably to a common origin . The Dakota " Medicine-Man " can do the " rope trick " of the Hindoo magician to perfection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wakan Teepee -- the Sacred Teepee . Carvers Cave at St. Paul was also called Wakan Teepee because the Medicine-men or magicians often held their dances and feasts in it . For a full account of the rites , etc. , see Riggs ' Tahkoo Wahkan , Chapter VI . The Ta-sha-ke -- literally , " Deer-hoofs "  - -  is a rattle made by hanging the hard segments of deer-hoofs to a wooden rod a foot long -- about an inch in diameter at the handle end , and tapering to a point at the other . The clashing of these horny bits makes a sharp , shrill sound something like distant sleigh-bells . In their incantations over the sick they sometimes use the gourd shell rattle . The Chan-che-ga -- is a drum or " Wooden Kettle . " The hoop of the drum is from a foot to eighteen inches in diameter , and from three to ten inches deep . The skin covering is stretched over one end , making a drum with one end only . The magical drum-sticks are ornamented with down , and heads of birds or animals are carved on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big pith ) is of two varieties -- one made of sumac , the pith of which is punched out .

E-ne-pee -- vapor-bath , is used as a purification preparatory to the sacred feasts . The vapor-bath is taken in this way : " A number of poles , the size of hoop-poles or less , are taken , and their larger ends being set in the ground in a circle , the flexible tops are bent over and tied in the center . This frame-work is then covered with robes and blankets , a small hole being left on one side for an entrance . Before the door a fire is built , and round stones about the size of a man 's head , are heated in it . When hot they are rolled within , and the door being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The devotee , stripped to the skin , sits within this steam-tight dome , sweating profusely at every pore , until he is nearly suffocated .

Father Hennepin was subjected to the vapor-bath at Mille Lacs by Chief Aqui-pa-que-tin , two hundred years ago . After describing the method , Hennepin says : " When he had made me sweat thus three times in a week , I felt as strong as ever . " Shea 's Hennepin , p. 228 . For a very full and accurate account of the Medicine-men of the Dakotas , and their rites , etc. , see Chap . II , Neill 's Hist . Minnesota . 82 The sacred O-zu-ha -- or Medicine sack must be made of the skin of the otter , the coon , the weasel , the squirrel , the loon , a certain kind of fish or the skins of serpents . It must contain four kinds of medicine ( or magic ) representing birds , beasts , herbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored red , the roots of certain grasses , bark from the roots of cedar trees , and hair of the buffalo . " From this combination proceeds a Wakan influence so powerful that no human being , unassisted , can resist it . " Wonderful indeed must be the magic power of these Dakota Druids to lead such a man as the Rev. S.R. Riggs to say of them : " By great shrewdness , untiring industry , and more or less of actual demoniacal possession , they convince great numbers of their fellows , and in the process are convinced themselves of their sacred character and office . " Tahkoo Wakan , pp. 88-9. 83 Gah-ma-na-tek-wahk -- the river of many falls -- is the Ojibway name of the river commonly called Kaministiguia , near the mouth of which is situated Fort William . The view on Thunder-Bay is one of the grandest in America . Thunder-Cap , with its sleeping stone-giant , looms up into the heavens .

A vast giant , turned to stone by his magic , lies asleep at his feet . The island called by the Ojibways the Mak-i-nak ( the turtle ) from its tortoise-like shape , lifts its huge form in the distance . Some " down-east Yankee " called it " Pie-island , " from its fancied resemblance to a pumpkin pie , and the name , like all bad names , sticks . McKay 's Mountain on the mainland , a perpendicular rock more than a thousand feet high , upheaved by the throes of some vast volcano , and numerous other bold and precipitous headlands , and rock-built islands , around which roll the sapphire-blue waters of the fathomless bay , present some of the most magnificent views to be found on either continent . 84 The Mission of the Holy Ghost -- at La Pointe , on the isle Wauga-ba-me --  ( winding view ) in the beautiful bay of Cha-quam-egon  - -  was founded by the Jesuits about the year 1660 .

The famous Father Marquette , who took Allouez 's place , Sept. 13 , 1669 , writing to his superior , thus describes the Dakotas : " The Nadouessi are the Iroquois of this country , beyond La Pointe , but less faithless , and never attack till attacked . Their language is entirely different from the Huron and Algonquin . They have many villages but are widely scattered . They have very extraordinary customs . They principally use the calumet . They do not speak at great feasts , and when a stranger arrives give him to eat of a wooden fork , as we would a child . All the lake tribes make war on them , but with small success . They have false oats ( wild rice , ) use little canoes , and keep their word strictly . " Neill 's Hist . Minn. , p . III . 85 Michabo or Manni-bozo -- the Good Spirit of the Algonkins .

This was the principal village of the Isantee band of Dakotas two hundred years ago , and was located at the Falls of St. Anthony , which the Dakotas called the Ha-ha ,  - -  pronounced Rhah-rhah ,  - -  the loud-laughing waters . The Dakotas believed that the Falls were in the center of the earth . Here dwelt the Great Unktehee , the creator of the earth and man : and from this place a path led to the Spirit-land . DuLuth undoubtedly visited Kathaga in the year 1679 . In his " Memoir " ( Archives of the Ministry of the Marine ) addressed to Seignelay , 1685 , he says : " On the 2nd of July , 1679 , I had the honor to plant his Majesty 's arms in the great village of the Nadouecioux called Izatys , where never had a Frenchman been , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village , but as the name of the band -- the Isantees . Nadouecioux was a name given the Dakotas generally by the early French traders and the Ojibways . See Shea 's Hennepin 's Description of Louisiana , pp. 203 and 375 . The villages of the Dakotas were not permanent towns . They were hardly more than camping grounds , occupied at intervals and for longer or shorter periods , as suited the convenience of the hunters ; yet there were certain places , like Mille Lacs , the Falls of St. Anthony , Kapoza ( near St. Paul ) , Remnica ( where the city of Red Wing now stands ) , and Keuxa ( or Keoza ) on the site of the city of Winona , so frequently occupied by several of the bands as to be considered their chief villages respectively . Mr. Neill , usually very accurate and painstaking , has fallen into an error in his prefatory notes to the last edition of his valuable History of Minnesota . Speaking of DuLuth , he says : " He appears to have entered Minnesota by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have explored where no Frenchman had been , and on July 2 , 1679 , was at Kathio ( Kathaga ) perhaps on Red Lake or Lake of the Woods , which was called ' the great village of the Wadouessioux , ' one hundred and twenty leagues from the Songaskicons and Houetepons who were dwellers in the Mille Lac region . " Now Kathaga ( Mr. Neill 's Kathio ) was located at the Falls of St. Anthony on the Mississippi as the whole current of Dakota traditions clearly shows and DuLuth 's dispatches clearly indicate . Besides , the Songaskicons and Houetepons were not and never were " dwellers in the Mille Lac region . " The Songaskicons ( Sissetons ) were at that time located on the Des Moines river ( in Iowa ) , and the Houetabons ( Ouadebatons ) at and around Big Stone Lake . The Isantees occupied the region lying between the mouth of the Minnesota River and Spirit Lake ( Mille Lacs ) with their principal village -- Kathaga -- where the city of Minneapolis now stands . These facts account for the " one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early French explorers . September 1 , 1678 , Daniel Greysolon DuLuth , a native of Lyons , France , left Quebec to explore the country of the Dakotas . " The next year ( 1679 ) on the 2nd day of July , he caused the king 's arms to be planted in the great village of the Nadouessioux ( Dakotas ) called Kathio " ( Kathaga ) " where no Frenchman had ever been , also at the Songaskicons and Houetabons , one hundred and twenty leagues distant from the former . * * * * On this tour he visited Mille Lacs , which he called Lake Buade , the family name of Frontenac , governor of Canada . " Neill ' ' s History of Minnesota , p. 122 . This is correct , except the name of the village -- Kathio , which is a misprint or perhaps an error of a copyist . It should be Kathaga . DuLuth was again at the Falls of St. Anthony in 1680 and returned to Lake Superior via the Mississippi , Rum River and Mille Lacs , according to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " printed at Paris A.D. 1684 , from information derived from DuLuth , who visited France in 1682-3 , and conferred with the minister of the Colonies and the minister of Marine -- shows the inaccuracy , as to points of compass at least , of the early French explorers . According to this map , Lake Buade ( Mille Lacs ) lies north-west of Lake Superior and Lake Pepin lies due west of it . DuLuth was afterward appointed to the command of Fort Frontenac near Niagara Falls , and died there in 1710 . The official dispatch from the Governor of Canada to the French Government is , as regards the great explorer , brief and expressive --  " Captain DuLuth is dead . He was an honest man . " To Daniel Greysolon DuLuth , and not to Father Hennepin , whom he rescued from his captors at Mille Lacs , belongs the credit of the first exploration of Minnesota by white men . Father Hennepin was a self-conceited and self-convicted liar . Daniel Greysolon DuLuth " was an honest man .

The **43;3102;TOOLONG live about Leech Lake ( **27;3147;TOOLONG ) were opposed to Pa-go-nay-gie-shiek , but he compelled them through fear to recognize him as Head-Chief . At the time of the " Sioux outbreak " in 1862 " Hole-in-the-day " for a time apparently meditated an alliance with the Po-ah-nuck ( Dakotas ) and war upon the whites . The Pillagers and some other bands urged him strongly to this course , and his supremacy as head-chief was threatened unless he complied . Messengers from the Dakotas were undoubtedly received by him , and he , for a time at least , led the Dakotas to believe that their hereditary enemies , the Ojibways , would bury the hatchet and join them in a war of extermination against the whites .

A little speech-making settled the matter for the time being and very soon thereafter a new treaty was made with " Hole-in-the-day " and his head men , by which their friendship and allegiance were secured to the whites . It was claimed by the Pillagers that " Hole-in-the-day " seized the occasion to profit personally in his negotiations with the agents of the Government . In 1867 " Hole-in-the-day " took " another wife . " He married Helen McCarty , a white woman , in Washington , D.C. , and took her to his home at Gull Lake ( Ka-ga-ya-skunc-cock ) literally , plenty of little gulls .
