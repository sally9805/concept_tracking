txt It happens this year that " Hospital Sunday " and Christmas fall on the same day , and this circumstance has led to some deviations from the long-established custom of devoting the collections in the churches to hospital purposes on the last Sunday of the year . In not a few churches that consistently observe " Hospital Sunday " it has been an immemorial custom to devote the Christmas collection to some specific charity closely connected with the work of the church , and in these cases the hospital collection has been advanced a week or is set down for some future Sunday . In St. Thomas 's and All Souls ' . Episcopal , the collection was taken last Sunday , and the large advance over previous years that has been turned over to Mr. CHARLES LANIER , the general Treasurer , augurs well for the total collection . It is certainly to be hoped that the offerings in all cases will be generous , for our admirable free hospital service , in order to keep abreast with the latest improvements , urgently calls for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday Association the hospital service of a community is brought very close to the people , familiarizes them with its details , its scope , and its needs , and in times of crisis , like that at the close of the late war , when thousands of fever-stricken soldiers required care and attention , the means to provide for them were found to be at hand , and there was no lack of spirit on the part of the managers of the hospitals to stretch the means at their disposal to the utmost limit This spirit was well illustrated in the case of one institution , which , though organized to care only for women and children , set about , without loss of time , to open a ward for men , and between thirty and forty victims of Santiago fever were nursed back to health and strength . Just now it is the grip that is taxing the hospitals to their utmost capacity , and a generous response to the appeal of the association will go far to tide them over this latest drain on their resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
