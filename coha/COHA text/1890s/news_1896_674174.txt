Kelsey , the Newark Gaslight Company , the Citizens ' Gaslight Company of Newark , and the Newark Gas Company . His bill of complaint sets forth that in 1893 John P. Persch of Philadelphia entered into an agreement with Kelsey , providing that the latter should sell to Persch the entire capital stock of the Newark and Citizens ' Companies for the purpose of consolidating them . Persch was to pay Kelsey $7,000,000 , part in first mortgage gold bonds , part in cash , and the remainder in preferred and common stock of the company to be formed by consolidation . According to the complainant , Persch 's profit by the deal was to be $1,000,000 or the gold bonds , $1,500,000 of the preferred stock , and $500,000 of the comon stock . These securities would have been worth much more than par , the complainant states , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the complainant bound himself by the contract to secure for the new company in question a monopoly of the business in Newark to extend over a period of ten years or more , the gas to be supplied for not less than $1.40 per 1,000 feet to private and $1.25 to public consumers . Although the contract , says the complainant , was made with the full knowledge and consent of the stockholders of the companies in interest , they failed to deliver the stock . The consolidation was effected without his - getting it . Kelsey , the complainant avers , endeavored to settle Persoh 's claim by giving him $50,000 of the common stock of the Newark Gas Company , which offer was refused . Persch has transferred his alleged rights to Furbush , who asks that the defendants be brought into court for an adjudication of the matter .
