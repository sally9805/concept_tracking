THE ART OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT . OUR New World demands an art expression characteristic and national . Hence the question often arises , What is to be the art of America ? In what visible form , enduring and distinguished , shall the country embody its high aspiration , and its intimate conception of eternal beauty ? All nations of intense vitality have found artistic ways of their own to express their peculiar genius . Some have invented , while others have borrowed and vitalized an idea ; in either case the stamp is that of the people who made the thought of moment ; for even an echoed art takes on the characteristics of the feebler nation which refines , or of the more powerful race which emphasizes and gives grandeur to the primitive conception . The English race has never been triumphant in the plastic arts , from the fact that with it the idea is apt to outrun the hand . Ever seeking to narrate or to suggest rather than to portray , the artist finds that his story overpowers his material , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality ; so that the painter struggling with a thought often fumbles with color , while the sculptor overstrains the function of marble . Beautiful form , the rare and delicate lines of the palette , are not enough to satisfy the Anglo-Saxon , who is ever oppressed by subtle ideas , and grasps Unconsciously after vital and eternal truths with an intense craving for largeness of utterance and escape from bonds . In short , the very love of liberty , which is the fusing principle of this intense and masterful race of which we form a part , renders it incapable of using brush or chisel to its full satisfaction , because it forever chafes at their material limitations . Only in controlling Nature does it find a congenial way to express its profound sense of true beauty , and to line out grandly for itself a bold and characteristic picture . The art of landscape gardening - or landscape architecture , as it is sometimes called on this side of the Atlantic - arose in Britain in that very sixteenth century in which art culminated elsewhere ; appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " English gardening " is applied to what is otherwise known as the natural method of ornamenting estates , in contradistinction to the more formal methods of the Latin nations . This art consists in enhancing the charm of the natural surroundings of a spot by skillful planting of trees and shrubs , by providing smooth extended lawns and appropriate flowers in the right situations , and by opening vistas to reveal distant objects of interest , so that the whole shall form a picture of varied beauty from all points whence it may be viewed by the observer . At the same time , while Nature // is really controlled and confined to prevent exuberance , nothing should obtrude that fact unduly , but the conditions should seem naturally harmonious , with only that delicate touch and suggestion of human intelligence necessary to perfection . Here Nature herself serves as brush and canvas , chisel and stone . Her varying moods , wild and stern , or soft and soothing , appealed early to the rugged British race , with its underlying tenderness , so that all over the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by every accessory a loving interest could suggest . Even when the gar(lener 's part in them may have been overdone , and results fantastic rather than tasteful are seen , everywhere in England one is touched by the ardent love evident for the rocks and trees and silver waters of the precious island , forever hallowed to us as to its own people by the reverent enthusiasm of the authors of our common literature . To the new continent to which they brought their energy , the British settlers brought also that passion for nature which is in our blood , and which the American is destined to carry far . Here , amid sylvan surroundings , separated by oceans from all that has artistically gone before , our fresh young race , if it is to achieve an artistic development , nmust do so on lines where there is still room for advance , with an art intelligible to the peol ) le to whom it must app*al , and in ways in which large participation is possible to produce a general result . It is in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our need for a great art , an art the people want , an art they can love , one that will give them true joy , that will appeal to the humblest an ( l the wisest alike ; for we crave something popular to please the masses , something large to gratify the race instinct for the colossal , something bold and far-reaching to strike an answering chord in every American heart . Ours must be an art that men are ready to pay for , to which the rich will give largely , and for which the poor will gladly submit to an extra tax , to be returned to them tenfold in health and enjoyment ; an art which will give work to those who need it , and will offer a chance for benefaction to the rich ; aim art in which the simple can bear a hand , and yet which will afford scope to the highest artistic gifts ; an art which will educate while it gratifies , and will uplift while it rejoices . What shall we call this art , the myide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain ; which requires state an ( l national governments for its support , and demnandls an ai my for its preservation , and a genius to conceive ? It is not forestry , it is not paik construction , it is not landscape nor ornamental gardening , yet it embraces them all , an ( l much more beside , since through it we are to find artistic expression for our inborn love of the beautiful in nature , and our desire for , its preservation and development . As a manifestation of the profound sentiment of our people , adapted above all to its especial needs , we claim that the art for America , the art in which we may hope to set an example to the world , is time Art of Public Imuprovemnent . That this art is destined to be popular is shown by the marked and growing interest manifested all over the country in the care of grounds , in the improvement of villages and towns , in the establishment of pa*ks and great forest reservations , and in a disposition to acquire by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unusual interest , to be forever pm'eservc ( l for time delight of coming generations . That a movement so widespread an ( l so well sustained has a meaning iii our national development we can hardly dloubt , and it certainly standls for time best there is in us , our taste , our pimihanthropy , our capability of self-s* cri ice for an idea . We do not claim vast achieve-743 // ments for it , but merely vitality , growing force , contagious enthusiasm , without which no advance can be made , and by the aid of which all things are possible , if only the right leaders arise . Nor are these lacking ; for two remarkable artists , of whom more will be said hereafter , have already illustrated our - national art , and the latest of them has carried it , by his conceptions and extraordinary achievements , beyond any point yet reached in the old world . Whatever height the art may attain in the future , the names of Andrew Jackson Downing and Frederick Law Olmsted will ever be recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers of an important artistic growth on this continent , the torch-bearers , bringing the light we sought so long , and which at last has begun to shine for us in the wilderness . No great movement is possible without a man to concentrate and formulate floating ideas , to give expression to what is vague , and to indicate the road development is to travel if it is to be truly momentous . So wholly does the man fit the need that it is often thought that he creates it , when he is merely its exponent ; and the philosophic study of all new departures shows the necessity of absolute touch between the people and the genius of the leader before a creation can be understood . As Diderot has said , great ideas originate with superior minds , but not till the multitude take up those ideas and push them along do they become effective . In our case , the evangelists preached to good purpose , so that we have awakened and heard , and in many instances have made the doctrine effective . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originator and exhorter , for he must arouse the taste he is destined to gratify ; therefore it was a great thing for the country that both Mr. Downing and Mr. Olmsted were not only men of executive ability , but also masters of the persuasive word ; and it is a matter of rejoicing that the latter lives to witness many results of magnitude from his teaching . It may naturally be asked what is the characteristic quality of public improvement as practiced in Anierica ; also , how ours differs from the landscape gardening of other countries , and on what ground it is claimed that we may hope to see a more expanded development of this art here than elsewhere . The answer to this is that all our public pleasure-grounds are creations for a given end , while many of those in the old world are adaptations .. Not a few of the ancient European galdens and parks were primarily adjuncts to palaces and castles , and the people were admitted to them only by favor . The formal gardens designed by Italian and French landseape artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme . The magnificent grounds of Versailles , designed by Le N6tre , form an architectural connection , by terraces and flights of steps , between the eh*teau and the formal parterres below , which are diversified with stately staircases , fountains , sculpture , clipped yews , and floral designs , till they gradually melt into the wilder portions of the park , whose woods bound the domain . Numerous famous parks and gardens of Europe belong to the crown or government , or are the property of individuals ; and though the public is permuitted to view their beauty , they were not primarily constructed solely for its enjoyment . This is the keynote of the difference . The reason why our art has a chance to become national is that every man , woman , and child has an interest in the preservation and development of the spot chosen for recreatiun , so that they learn to take the same interest in protecting their beauty from vandalism that any proprietor has in the care of his individual grounds . Any national American art must partake of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result from many willing hearts and hands , which is our // working secret . It mast be something not outside of us , intelligible only to the chosen few , with a signification too deep for the crowd ; but something at once large and simple , to which each of us can contribute after his fashion , - the workman with his spade , the farmer with the neat tilling and fencing of his broad acres , the small householder with a well-kept yard , the rich man with his stately pleasure-grounds , the village with its common and well - shaded streets , the town with its squares and greens and broad avenues , the city with its generous park systems , the nation with its vast reservations . From these well-orgaiiized components , from the humble and the magnificent scheme combined , might result a whole which should make our national art of public improvement an example to the world for breadth of conception and minute perfection of detail , while it would become a source of pride to each individual who had ministered to so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry our art far is that we still have room enough , so that we have a chance to secure vast areas , at a moderate expense , before the country becomes overcrowded . We have arboreta on a much larger scale than those of Europe ; our great public reservations , many of them of remarkable natural beauty , are of enormous extent . The national government owns , and ought to protect , thousands of miles of the primeval forest of the continent , which is far more important and beautiful than the planted forests of France and Germany , Belgium and Holland . Near our rapidly growing cities land enough can still be retained by municipalities to accommodate their greatest future need . Everywhere there is a recognition of the tremendous expansion to be prepared for even within one generation , and our tax-payers can , therefore , be brought to submit to charges for extensive plans of improvement . It seems as if the movement towards this result , which has within the last score of years assumed such consequence , must be significant of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ; for the spirit shows itself in many ways , the most important being the desire for the protection of our public reservations and the most vital Village Improvement . The subject demands consideration under several heads , each requiring special attention . These are , first , the park systems , which led the way ; second , the better care of our villages and small towns , and municipal improvements ; third , the great national reservations ; and fourth , the economic question of our forests , with the pressing need of congressional action to protect and utilize this valuable source of revenue to the country . Historically , the movement in the United States can not date much further back than the early fifties , when , roused by Mr. Downing 's writing in The Horticulturist , a few far-seeing minds recognized the necessity of providing for the health and recreation of urban populations by furnishing open and beautiful places of resort for them . This now seems so simple and obvious a duty that it is hard to remember that only persistent and unremitting effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome the sluggish indifference of municipal councilors and state legislatures ; while even intelligent citizens resisted the effort to provide large parks , on the ground that they would probably become merely lurking-places for the lawless and depraved , amid unfit resorts for the respectable . Eloquence , tact , and pertinacity at last prevailed to wring meagre appropriations from city fathers for those pleasuregrounds which are now recognized by all citizens as their most cherished possessmons . Little by little , after the fashion of all great reforms , at first suggested by the few , finally demanded by the many , the park question forced itself into prominence , // and began to take hold of the public . Contemporaneously with this urban movement , there was shown a desire for neatness and finish here and there in many a small town and village , where some enlightened man or woman , thirsting for organized loveliness , labored to improve the muddy roads and straggling dooryards which disfigured the Locality . As in the matter of parks , a few active minds were able to move a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of a few tumbled-down fences showed how unnecessary they were ; a few streets planted with trees inspired a neighborhood to emulation , and the example spread . The formation of a Village Improvement Society composed of public-spirited people , who oversaw , and helped with money , produced such results in one town that another was moved to go and do likewise ; and from one nucleus in New England , and others in the South and West , the idea is traveling far and wide , the present increased facility of communication helping to spread it . Better roads are a modern demand emphasized by the ubiquitous bicycle , and the States are furnishing smooth and well-kept highways linking town to town . Under the stimulus of the wheel the country inn is reviving , the outdoor restaurant appears , opening a new industry to the farmer , and affording a field for picturesque improvement . Growing tastefulness is apparent at railway stations , with buildings designed by competent architects , and surrounded by shrubberies and flowers cared for by the station masters in their spare moments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for carriages , refinement of approach indicates the character of the neighborhood , and the traveler is soothed by gentle sights and refreshed by pleasing outlooks . The need of shading our glaring dusty roadways is more and more recognized , and the example of older towns , now beautiful with avenues of stately elms and maples , inspires the younger ones to furnish with trees their newly opened boulevards and roads . Though the science of tree-planting is but poorly understood , and still less the proper care of trees after they are once rooted , Improvement Societies will in time give instruction in these matters , and the results will be more satisfactory . If at the same time shady footpaths , wholly apart from the highway , could be provided , it might make walking the pleasure which it is along the quiet lanes of the Old World , so sadly lacking here . Meantime we have tree clubs , and an effort is being made to arouse the interest of children by encouraging them to plant trees , and , still better , to cherish them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Agriculture , the Hon. J. Sterhin Morton of Nebraska , emphasize for them the value of trees and shrubs in ornamenting the village . The exercises will be still more valuable when they include instruction in the proper care of what has been already planted . The improvement of schoolhouses and libraries lends an added dignity to country towns , and makes these buildings , with their gronncIs , of importance in village ornamentation ; while religious societies rival each other in tasteful arrangement of the open spaces about their respective churches , with excellent effect . The planting and ornamenting of rural cemeteries originated in the United States , and in many little towns these afford almost the only opportunity for a Sunday stroll . Though the lack of unity of design and a tendency to florid decoration too often spoil the effect as a whole , the sentiment which cares so tenderly for time resting-places of the dead is another evidence of the promising material to work upon in this country . When taste shall have been educated , more simplicity will be shown , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Those who remember Mount Auburn , Cambridge , Mass. , half a century ago , as a valued resort , realize well how its natural loveliness has been marred by the intrusion of inappropriate marble ; but other burial-grounds , of more recent date , are showing how the memorials of the dead can be kept in harmony with the quiet beauty of sylvan surroundings ; and in time a more sensitive taste will prevail , of whose stirrings we begin to be conscious , which may gradually influence all our surroundings . Another evidence of the progress of taste is to be found in the growing interest in horticulture , and the disposition to study it scientifically . This has resulted in the founding of ten botanical gardens in the United States , and also in the purchase , by the city of Philadelphia , of the first park ever planted in America , on the farm of John Bartram on the Schuylkill , where , with only enthusiasm to begin with in 1728 , but with constantly expanding knowledge , he established his collections . The aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight lines and stiff alleys , the natural treatment of trees and shrubs in them in appropriate localities , so far as is possible , show that beauty and scientific arrangement are not incompatible , and that , while adding largely to the knowledge of the world , these gardens can also serve as object-lessons in pleasing arrangement . This is notably the case in the Arnold Arboretum at Jamaica Plain , near Boston , which twenty years ago was founded with the proceeds of a fund of a hundred thousand dollars left to Harvard College by Mr. James Arnold , a public - spirited citizen of New Bedford , Mass. , as a garden to be devoted to forestry and dendrology . There are about two hundred acres in the inclosure , and the treatment of the grounds , which form a part of the park system of Boston , is an evidence that accurate scientific arrangement can be combined with picturesque charm . The growth of interest in horticulture and floriculture in the last century is a subject capable of elaborate treatment . Time tasteful managen71ent of different flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper disposition in grounds , and the way to plant them to the best aesthetic advantage , has only recently received proper attention with us , but it must be recognized that floriculture is an important branch of artistic growth in public improvement . A simple but lively agent in the movement we chronicle has been the general introduction of the lawn-mower , which has made a rough dooryard as old-fashioned in many a village as the unsightly fences of former days , while the supply of water by aqueducts helps to preserve a uniform greenness in the little smooth lawns graded to the edge of the highway . Thus we see how one advance leads imperceptibly to another , till the whole great scheme is evolved . The beginnings of all the arts are very crude and formless , but the true Renascence begins when men want to know , and that is the age of progress . The secret strength of our civilization is that it wants to know ; it is not self-satisfied , passive ; it stirs ; it is discontented ; it recognizes its deficiencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has not access , and which it would fain master . These are the little blades , from seed scattered broadcast , which indicate a coming harvest . In a bnge , straggling , half-settled country like ours , one can not look for instant perfection or universal rapid progress . We have no autocratic municipal governments like those which accomplish wonders in European cities ; such order as we develop will not be enforced by anything mightier than popular conviction . The will and desire must come from within ; from that spirit of emulation and wish for the best there is going which is such a strong characteristic of Americans ; from that readiness to assimilate which makes our // women keen for the last mode and our men eager for the newest bicycle , stimulated by the newspapers , which keep each section of the United States informed of what the others are doing . The main thing seems to be to so present the right treatment of grounds , towns , parks , and forests that it may become the fashion . Fashion is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it is omnipotent with us . Now , to direct the movement rightly , so as to establish canons of good taste , and make this art a high expression , - that is , to have our people assimilate the best rather than the second-best , - necessitates the growth and education of the individual , the only source of progress for the race . Whatever proceeds merely from a ruler 's decree dies with the passing of the master mind ; but that idea which the community grasps is the really valuable working one , and in a sort indicates both the understanding and the social status of a people by the readiness with which it is adopted . Certainly artistic planting ought to be as contagious as the changes of attire . What we require next is a school of forestry and landscape gardening , and for this we have suggestions in the schools of European nations for horticulture , agriculture , forestry , and kindred subjects which we greatly need to study here . At present there is no place outside of an office where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be learned in institutions , and there are some agricultural schools and experiment stations which have their value , but if a young man seeks knowledge to fit himself for the career of landscape architect we have no such thing as a school of public improvement . The advantage of a school of art of any kind is , that though no school can create a great artist , it can at least show him the shortest road to his end , teach him how to prepare and use his tools , give him the history of what has been done before , and inspire emulation . An American school might furnish scholarships to the more promising pupils , to enable them to travel , to study the methods of other lands , with a view to grappling more successfully with the problems of our virgin continent . The varied branches of the comprehensive study of public improvement might be dealt with by competent teachers and illustrated by suggestive examples . It could accumulate a library such as no private student could afford to purchase , with pictures and plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future might draw his inspiration . However true it may be that no difficulty ever seems to check the growth of any supreme artistic genius , which has its own ways of bursting the shell , and of finding nutriment in everything , great artists are rare , and many valuable talents are lost to the world for the lack of an opportunity to train them , and to make the most of what the French call a " disposition " for art . We look for the time when some enthusiast for public improvement shall found an institution to impart instruction in it , or at least leave money for a chair in one of our universities , for a course of which many youths may avail themselves . We believe that the day of this institution is not far off , for we observe that the movement for public improvement is sporadic , it is confined to no locality , it springs up in all parts of the republic , and this sign is full of encouragement . Its advocates burn with zeal , and labor without repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plans are misguided , their aim is high , their motives are unselfish , the value of their services is incalculable . The more one studies this great subject , the more one is struck with the lofty public spirit of individuals , their almost poetic fire . They display that enthusiastic sense of duty to the community and the state , that high civic virtue , which // is the proudest attribute of man . Their self-sacrifice , their industry , their heroic efforts for a cause that may be called l ) urely one of sentiment , though based on the great economic principle of benefit to the race , arouse a respect which becomes veneration when we realize what large , farsecing patriotism is the mainspring of their untiring labor . As an instance of this we quote the followin' paragraph from a letter recently received from Mr. J. B. Harrison , formerly secretary of the American Forestry Congress , the man to whose personal effort the nation largely owes the Niagara Falls Reservation : - " The chief thing in my relation to the Niagara work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hamlet in the State of New York , to see the leading citizens , editors , lawyers , clergymen , and merchants , to work up ' sentiment , first for the appointment of a commission to examine and report , and then for the appropriation of the money to buy the land at the Falls . Everybody helped , and at last the brakemen in the cars used to come in and sit by me , and ask , Do you think the State will buy Niagara ? ' and the boys who carried my bag to the train would ask about it , too . Then I felt sure we should succeed . We got the subject into the mind of every man , woman , and child , apparently . " Here we have the true spirit of the apostle ; and such apostles are alive among us to-day , influencing their generation , sowing the good seed , and preaching the new gospel . To show what their work is , we have but to remark how , in town after town , individuals have labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands which they stood ready to give to their fellow-citizens , though it took years and years to induce selectmen and town councilors to accept the gift . These personal efforts , often ungratefully met , show us the force , the patience , the far-reaching benevolence , which exist among us , the little leaven which has to raise the whole lump of ignorance and inertia . The eloquence , the artistic feeling , the large wisdom , displayed in the park reports of Mr. Olmsted - often destined either to be read by unappreciative municipal officers , or , as lie pathetically remarks , never to be read at all , - would have made the fame of a purely literary man , yet we can find them only in pamphlets almost out of print which to-day are very difficult of access . These reports abound from beginning to end in imnportaut suggestions . Thus have men cast bread upon the waters , to be found again by the nation only after many weary years . Schemes which it takes decades to bring about , and a half century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " long patience " of genius to foster . Ordinary inventors look for large returns from their expenditure of thought and time and treasure , but the architect of public grounds gains little more than a modest livelihood from his labor , which is to confer a perpetual benefit upon his native land . As to the man who gives acres to beautify his town , he is a philanthropist , who sometimes hardly receives thanks . This is why we claim that our country abounds , as does no other , in evidences of purely unselfish zeal , and the study of our present theme indicates in this regard the claims of some individuals , now unknown beyond their immediate neighborhoods , to the gratitude of the nation . The difficulty has been to start the people on the right road , but once started , their progress promises to be steady and rapid . We see not only that individuals have learned to arrange their homes and surroundings picturesquely , but that communities are gaining in civic pride and interest in the ornamentation of villages* Parks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the unenlightened resistance of municipal gov // ernments is overborne by tim popular demand . Private and public reservations of beautiful lands , game preserves established by clubs and individuals , have taught the value of wild woods and flowing streams . The government is slowly awakening to the needs of its forests , and public sentiment is being educated by the press to the importance of an enlightened management of that source of revenue which in other lands is so carefully a ( iministered . To these educative influences must be added the quite recent foundation in Massachusetts of a Society for the Preservation of Beautiful and Historic Places , ' whose function is to receive and hold lands coiitaining objects of interest , which may not be willingly taken by the town or State , and to protect them from neglect and ruin . The example of this valuable society has been followed , so that runny historic sites will be retained , fine trees rescued , and striking natural objects preserved for the enjoyment of future generations . In imitation of this society a similar one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , famous in song and story , as may from time to time be offered for sale . Our reservations , long neglected , are becoming of importance to the American people . The need of outdoor life , so well understood in Europe , is beginning to be recognized by them , and the demand comes for more breathing-space . As soon as a park is opened the crowds gladly avail themselves of it , and with such decorum that the fear of depredation and lawlessness , which so long resisted the opening of parks to the public , has proved groundless . Their sanitary value is felt , for during the prolonged heated term of last August some of the parks in Brooklyn , N. Y. , were thrown open to the people at night , and the refreshment to tired mothers , imprisoned all day in crowded tenements , was obvious Now incorporated under the title of Trustees of Public Reservations . from the many baby carriages drawn thither , with their little occupants quietly sleeping under mosquito nettings , instead of tossing restlessly in narrow , unwholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , as solemn mementoes of the most tragic period of our history the acquisition , by the government , of Gettysburg , Antietam , and Shilob , and the field of Chickainauga with parts of Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountam , are a striking instance of the deep sentiment of our people , and their reverent regard for the honored dead who died that we might live . Never will these suggestive fields be pleasure-grounds , but from the summits of the surrounding hills watch-towers will look down upon the mountain ranges and rivers , and reveal to the eye of imagination the strategy of those terrific encounters . The forests , watered with the blood of suffering soldiers , will remain undestroyQd , and monuments will record the gallant deeds of those who fell in the sad struggle . At Chickamauga alone there are more than three thousand acres of forest , and these woods and the construction of appropriate memorials demand careful and artistic treatment . On certain private estates , such as Biltmore in North Carolina , the property of Mr. George W. Vanderbilt , experiments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to study ; and here , too , landscape gardening affords an object-lesson of great value . The large private hunting-parks in the Adirondacks are also accessible to whoever wishes to visit them , and are a notable part of the scheme for public in*-provement to which belong the magnificent state and government reservations . The extraordinary natural features of America are nowhere more surprising than in the neighborhood of Colorado Springs , where the private reservation of the Garden of the Gods , a singularly beautiful natural park , is thrown open // to the public . Reservations in Massachusetts , along Charles River , Beaver Brook , and other streams of quiet or picturesque charm , are another evidence of the growing sentiment among us for secluded haunts for recreation . Of the reservations of Niagara Falls , the Yellowstone Park , the Yosemite Valley , an ( l tim great forests of the Adirondacks there is no room to speak fully in this paper , which is , as has been said already , merely a brief summary of the national enthusiasm for the art of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its pioneers have broken ground . We have object-lessons destined to influence many youthful minds , and fit them insensibly for a higher revelation . The greatest of these was the Columnbian Exposition , and from that spectacle what ideals must have rooted themselves in many a soul until then starved for beauty ! There first the majesty of a great architectural conception was seen on our own soil , marred doubtless in detail , as must be even a poet 's glimpses of heavenly glory , by the obtrusion of things unspiritual , incident to mortal weakness ; but yet an enchanting whole , an inspiring dream briefly realized for awestruck millions , in whose minds it must forever remain as an indication of what the landscape artist of some future day may make perm*nent and real . Though the remembrance of the white vision may have faded like its substance , its impress must remain on every mind qualified to receive its stamp . It , too , was a part of that lift of the nation toward higher things , which is a compensation for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods , false heroes . As a people we cry for light ; our intense materialism goes hand in hand with that characteristic imagination which leads us to see things in large , - to magnify many a will-o ' - thewisp into a planet . If this imagination be our bane , it is likewise our glory , and , like the vital principle itself , it works for both destruction and salvation . If at times it brings us to the verge of political ruin , it again wafts us to the solemn heights of national triumph . In its fierce flame only the indestructible survives , for lesser men amid meaner motives shrivel to ashes as it burns heavenward . Thus iii our artistic development it may be trusted to lead us to something broader and more human than the older world has achieved , something which shall have in it a touch spontaneous and strong . We must have an art , spacious , because we have room for it ; far reaching , because it will be an exponent of popular fancy ; imposing , because in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many clew ents , barbaric and enlightened , from the fusion of which must proceed a fresh and powerful combination . If this presentation seem fanciful , remember what has been done in a score of crowded years : how swiftly thoughts travel along the electric cord which now binds us together ; how the middle West fires at a thought , and is ready , as was shown at Chicago , to pour out its easily gained millions for an idea ; how rich and lavish is the rarely emidowed Pacific coast . There is everything in the United States to nourish a great art , - wealth , enthusiasm , generosity , a sense of boundless capacity , time verce and spring of youth , unlimited aspiration . Iii the Art of Public Improvement the dreamer and the utilitarian can combine , the nation 's beauty and the nation 's wealth can in it he united , and our achievements may be such as to satisfy even American ambition .                   @ @
