txt FREE libraries have existed for less than half a century . Their establishment assumed that books are beneficial : but it involved also the assertion that it is the proper function of government to supply books to such of its citizens as may require them at the expense of the community as a whole . Libraries of this special type do not yet form the major portion of the institutions supplying books on a large scale to groups of persons . Under the head of " Public , Society and School Libraries , * ' these institutions in the United States aggregate 8,000 in number , with 35,000,000 volumes , with $34,000,000 invested in buildings , with $17,000,000 of endowments , and with over $6,000,000 of annual income . Of these the free public libraries supported by general taxation number less than 2,000 , with 10,000,000 volumes , and with less than $3,500,000 of annual income . They are , however , increasing with disproportionate and amazing rapidity . In Massachusetts , but ten of the 353 cities and towns , but three-fourths of one per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and ten library buildings there have been the gift of individuals . No form of private memorial is now more popular ; no form of municipal expenditure meets with readier assent . Nor are the initiative and the expenditure left wholly to local enterprises . The Commonwealth itself takes part : extending , through a State Commission , State aid in the form of books and continuing counsel . And Massachusetts is but one of eight States maintaining such commissions . New York * The term " free public libraries " as used in this article is meant to desiguate only those free libraries which are supported by general taxation . // State , in its system of traveling libraries , has gone further still in supplementing initial aid with a continuing supply of books , and even photographs and lantern slides , purchased by the State and distributed through the Regents of the State University from Albany to the remotest hamlet . The first stage of all such legislation is an enabling actauthorizing the establishment of a library by the local authorities ; the next is an act encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third by a law actually mandatory , requiring the local authorities to establish free libraries in proportion to their means and the population to be served . This seems to mark the high-water mark of confidence in the utility of these institutions . It indicates that free public libraries are to be ranked with the common schools , as institutions indispensable to good citizenship , whose establishment the State must for its own protection require . So the movement has progressed , until now these 2,000 public libraries combined are sending out each year over 30 million books , to do their work for good or ill in the homes of the United States . The entire 2,000 result from one conviction and a uniform purpose . Yet among them there is every variety in scope and in organization . There is the hamlet library of a hundred volumes , open for a couple of hours each week in some farm house , under a volunteer custodian , maintained by the town , but enlisting private contribution through bazaars and sociables-sending out its books by the local provision dealer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great city , with elaborate equipment and complex organization to meet a vast and complex need . Such a library as you may find at Chicago ; a city which , though it has two great endowed reference libraries , still considers its million and a half of people entitled to a municipal library , with a two million dollar building , studded with costly mosaics , and aided by forty branches and stations in bringing the books nearer each home . Or such a library as exists at Boston ; organized as a City Department , under Trustees appointed by the Mayor , maintained , like the schools , or the police , or the fire department , by general taxation ; with a central building which has cost the city two and one-half million dollars , with ten branch libraries and seventeen delivery stations scattered through the city and reached daily by // its delivery wagons ; with 700,000 books ; and accommodations for over 2,000 readers at one time ; including in its equipment such special departments as a bindery and a printing office ; requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance each year a quarter of a million dollars , in addition to the proceeds of endowments ; and representing in its buildings , books and equipment an investment of over five millions of dollars , the interest on which , at four per cent. , added to the expenditure for maintenance , is equivalent to an annual burden of $450,000 for its creation and support . When this function was first proposed for a municipality , the argument used was that in this country books had come to be the principal instruments of education ; that the community was already supporting a public school system ; that this system brought a youth to the threshold of education and there left him ; that it qualified him to use books , but did nothing to put books within his reach ; and finally that it was " of paramount importance that the means of general information should be so diffused that the largest possible number of persons should be induced to read and understand questions going down to the very foundations of social order , which are constantly presenting themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to decide , and do decide , either ignorantly or wisely . " A glance at the libraries now in operation in the United States shows that the ends proposed for them fall far short of the service which they actually perform . They begin with the child before he leaves the school ; w ? iile he is still in his elementary studies they furnish to him books which stir his imagination , and bring the teaching of the text books into relation with art and with life . They thus help to render more vivid the formal studies pursued ; but they also prepare the child to become an intelligent constituent hereafter . This work can not begin too early , for four-fifths of the children pass out into active life without reaching the high schools . It need not be deferred , for now the number is almost countless of books that touch with imagination and charm of style even the most elementary subjects ; and the library can add illustrations which through the eye convey an impression of the largest subjects in the most elemental way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was foreseen , it is prepared to accompany him further than was thought // necessary . It responds not only to the needs of the general reader , but also to those of the student and even , to the extent of its means , to those of the scholar engaged in special research . The maintenance of universities at the common expense is familiar in the West ; it is less so in the East . And there is still contention that institutions for highly specialized instruction should not be charged upon the community as a whole . But no one has questioned the propriety of charging upon the community the support of a library whose leading purpose may be the encouragement of the higher scholarship . Finally , to the services just above described the public library has added another the supply of books for purposes purely recreative . This service , if anticipated , was certainly not explicitly argued for ; nor was it implied in Edward Everett 's prediction that the public library would prove the " intellectual common " of the community . The common that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base ball ground , or lovers ' walk , or a loafing place for tramps . But as regards certain of the books customarily supplied , the ordinary public lilrary of to-day is furnishing recreation rather than instruction . In fact , if we look at the history of free public libraries in this country , we find that the one point of practice on which they have been criticised is the supply of merely recreative literature . The protest has come from thoughtful persons , and it means something , lightly as it has been waived aside . The excuse that used to be given for the supply of inferior books was that they would entice to the use of the better books . There was to be reached a mass of persons of inferior taste and imperfect education . These persons must be introduced gradually to an acquaintance with the better class of reading through the medium of the familiar . And , at all events , it was better that they should read something than not read at all . I am not quite so confident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am confident that the reading of a book inferior in style and taste debases the taste , and that the book which sets forth , even with power , a false view of society does harm to the reader , and is so far an injury to the community of which he is part . But even granting the premises , the conclusion is doubtful . We do not deliberately furnish poor art at public expense because there is a portion of the public which can not // appreciate the better . Nor when the best is offered , without apology , does the uncultured public in fact complain that it is too " advanced . " Thousands of " ordinary " people come to see and enjoy the Abbey and Ohavannes and Sargent decorations in the Boston Public Library . No one has yet complained that the paintings are too advanced for him . The best of art is not too good for the least of men , provided he can be influenced at all . Nor are the best of books too good for him , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are permitted , as are the pictures , to make their appeal directly . They must not be secluded behind catalogues and formal paraphernalia . The practice which admitted the scholar to the shelves , and limited the general reader to the catalogues , gave the best opportunity to him who least needed it . The modern practice sets before the reader least familar with good titles a selection of good 6oolcs . It places them on open shelves where he may handle them without formality . The result is , almost invariably , that he is attracted to a book in advance of his previous tastes . Perhaps a chance paragraph appeals to some experience or ambition , or an illustration stirs his imagination . The books themselves draw him outside of his previous limitations . In the place , therefore , of books inferior in quality , the more modern public library seeks to attract by the freest possible access to books of the best quality . Not that this practice is universal . But the opinion and tendency are in this safe direction . However , quality assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature remains . What shall we say of the fact that sixty per cent . of the circulation of the free public libraries still consists of fiction ? In the first place , that this percentage takes no account of reference use , which is almost wholly of serious literature ; second , that as to home use the ratio in circulation of fiction to serious literature does not represent a similar ratio of trivial to serious service . Fiction is the small coin of literature . It must circulate more rapidly to represent the same volume of real business done . A volume of fiction may be issued , returned and reissued three times , while a biography or history or work of science is issued once . It will then count seventy-five per cent . in the circulation . But the serious book has during the entire period been out in the hands of the reader ; and the service which // it has performed  --  the period of attention which it has occupied - equals that of the novel in its three issues . And , finally , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward general culture ( if the library is not merely to inform but also to cultivate ) - in broadening the sympathies , giving a larger tolerance , a kindlier humanity , a more intelligent helpfulness ; in affording the rest that is in itself an equipment for work , and the distraction that may save from impulse to evil . flowever , the amount of fiction circulated in proportion to the total work of the library is on the average steadily decreasing . At the same time the quality is improving ; in part through critical selection , in part as a happy result of the fact that the inferior novels are also , as a rule , inferior books , so poorly manufactured that libraries can not afford to buy them . But there is standard fiction and current fiction ; and it is the current fiction that constitutes by itself a special problem still perplexing . It is a problem that concerns not the uneducated child , nor the illiterate adult ; it is caused by the people of intelligent education who are avid to read the latest novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest novel by Mr. X. or Mrs. Y. It is being talked about at dinner and afternoon tea . Well-informed people are reading it ; to read it is a social necessity . The reason that presses the public library to supply promptly every most recent book in the domain of scientific literature is apparent enough . Such literature contributes facts which are the data for action . But novels in general belong to the literature of power . Their purpose is not to furnish information but to give pleasure . Literature of this sort adds no new fact , nor is it superseded , nor does it lose any of its value by lapse of time . To assume that it does would be to assume that beauty of form could become obsolete . This is not so in painting , in sculpture , in architecture ; why should it be so in prose fiction , in poetry , in the drama ? Was there , in fact , an aesthetic value in the Canterbury Tales in 1380 , in Hamlet in 1602 , in Ivanhoe in 1819 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But a large portion of latter day fiction is fiction with a purpose ; another way of saying that it is a work of art composed for the dissemination of doctrine . This element proThotes it at once to the dignity of a treatise ; a new view of politics , a new criticism of 8ocial conditions , a new creed ! Here is something that // concerns the student of sociology . And surely his needs are worthy of prompt response . In fact , his needs and the general curiosity do get prompt response , and the new novels are freely bought . How freely I have recently sought to ascertain . I asked of some seventy libraries their yearly expenditure for current fiction in proportion to their total expenditure for books . The returns show an average of from ten to fifteen per cent . In one case the amount reached fifty per cent. , in others it fell as low as two per cent . The ratio for fiction in general is much higher on the average ; but fiction in general includes Scott and Thackeray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not usually be questioned . At Providence and at Worcester , two of the most active and popular of public libraries , the purchases of fiction , current and standard , formed last year but seven and eleven per cent. , respectively , of the entire expenditure for books . At Boston there were selected but 178 titles of current fiction ( out of nearly 600 read and considered ) . But some dozen copies were bought of each title , so that the entire purchases reached 2,300 volumes and cost about $2,300 . This was about six and a half per cent . on a total expenditure for books of $34,000 . At St. Louis the practice is to buy but two copies out of the general funds to be circulated free . Nearly a hundred more are added which are rented out and thus pay for themselves . The statistics do not seem to show that the initial expenditure for current fiction is very alarming . But the purchase price of these books is but a fraction of the expense of handling them . They can not be supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persists , an adequate supply is beyond the resources of any library . But since the attempt to supply is futile the pretence is injurious . The presence of the titles in the catalogues misleads the reader into a multitude of applications which are a heavy expense to the library without benefit to him . And the acquisition of the single book means to the library the expense of handling a hundred applications for it which are futile to one that can be honored . In this sense a current novel involves perhaps a hundred times the expense of any other book in being supplied to but the same number of readers . The British Museum acquires the new novels as published ; but it withholds them from readers until five years after their // date of publication . It is my personal belief that a one year limitation of this sort adopted by our free libraries generally would relieve them of anxiety and expense and their readers of inconvenience and delusion . But as regards current light literature in general it is worth while to consider whether the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of the newspaper and periodical press . In 1850 , when the free public library was started , the number of newspapers and periodicals published in the United States was about 2,500 ; now it is nearly 20,000 . The total annual issues have increased from 400 million to over 4j billion copies . The ordinary daily of 1850 contained perhaps a single column of literary matter . To-day it contains , for the same price , seven columns . In 1850 it gave no space to fiction ; now it offers Kipling , Howells , Stockton , Bret Harte , Anthony Hope , Crockett , Bourget and many others of the best of the contemporary writers of fiction . Then there are the cheap magazines , which tender a half dozen stories for the price of a cigar or a bodkin . There are , also , the cheap " libraries , " which have flooded the United States with engaging literature available to almost any purse . In short , conditions have altered . A vast mass of light literature is now cheaply accessible to the individual which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why then should the public libraries strugele longer to supply it in book form at the public expense ? But as to a certain percentage of current light literature there is an embarrassment that I have not touched . It is the embarrassment of making selection without giving offence . All can not be bought . A choice must be made . With reference to standard literature authoritative judgment is not difficult to obtain . But here there has been no lapse of time to balance opinion . An anticipatory estimate must be attempted , and attempted by the library itself . Now , if the library decide against the book it is very likely held to blame for " dictating " to its readers . " It is one thing , " Bays a journal commenting on a certain adverse decision , " it is one thing to consider this novel pernicious , but it is another and more serious thing for the foremost library in the country , main // tamed at public expense , to deny to a large and respectable portion of the public an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( this author 's ) calibre is pernicious or not . " The author in this case was , of course , not Mr. X. , but rather Mr. A. , an already known quantity . So a library is not to be permitted to apply a judgment of its own ! It is not protected by the fact that this judgment coincides with the judgment of professional critics-so far at least as these may be ascertained . The author may have turned perverse and written a book distinctly bad . Yet this book is to be bought and supplied to enable each member of the publi3 to form a judgment of his own upon it . And it is to be so bought out of public funds entrusted to the library for educational purposes . Censorship has to us an ugly sound ; but does the library act as censor when it declares a book beyond its province ? Does it dictate what the people shall read when it says , " We decline to buy this book for you with public funds ? " This is a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a novel or two . It involves the whole question of authority , and it concerns not merely the extremes , but the varying degrees of worth in literature . Most departments of educational work are founded upon principles , cautiously ascertained , and systematically adhered to . Their consistent maintenance upon principle is the easier because each other such department deals with a special constituency , limited either in age or perhaps in sex , or at least in purpose , and one which accepts as authoritative the system provided for it . The free public library , however , has to satisfy a constituency practically unlimited , including every age and both sexes , whose intellectual need ranges from that of the most illiterate to that of the most highly accomplished , whose education in books ranges from that of the person who has never entered a library to that of the scholar whose life has been a perpetual training in the use of a library ; the assertive classes , the bashful classes . And if toward this vast and heterogeneous constituency it seeks to assume the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one which the constituents themselves are unanimously willing to concede . Each constituent deems himself not a beneficiary accepting some service , but a proprietor demanding it . Now , within each community there are persons who would have every kind of printed matter published . If , // therefore , a public library exists simply to respond to the demands of its readers , we must have , instead of an educational system devised by experts and administered with reference to general principles , a system fluctuating with each eccentric requirement of individuals , indefinite in number , various in taste and culture , inexpert , except as each may be competent to judge his own need , incapable of expression in the aggregate , and as individuals without responsibility for the general results . If , on the other hand , an authority is to be vested in the library , what limits shall it set upon itself , upon what principles of discrimination shall it proceed , in what directions may it expediently control ? I but state the problem . I shall not endeavor to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the relation of the public library to the community . From such questions an ordinary educational institution stands aloof . It is content to represent the judgment of the majority in matters of morality and to inculcate the lesson of tried truths as against untried fancies in matters of opinion affecting the social order . It thus throws its influence in favor of the established order of things . But its right , nay , its duty , to do this is unquestioned . Nor is it regarded as disparaging the opinion which it does not teach . But a public library is not so exempt . In addition to the doctrine which is accepted , it is held to have a duty to the opinion which is struggling for recognition . As to minority opinion , it is not so much a university as a forum . Nay , it is to give every advantage to minority opinion , for-in our resentment of intolerance-minority opinion is not merely tolerated , it is pampered . Now , it is not for libraries or librarians to act as censors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered that a library which circulates a book helps to promulgate the doctrine which the book contains . And if public libraries circulate books which teach restless , irreverent or revolutionary doctrines , they offer us the incongruity of a municipality aiding in the propagation of ideas which are subversive of social order . On the other hand , if there is to be exclusion on such grounds , where is the line of exclusion to be drawn ? Shall we say at doctrines which , if carried into action , would be criminal under the law ? Would the public rest content with this ? Moreover , the principle of exclusion accepted , who is to apply // it ? Whose judgment shall determine whether the particular book does or does not offend ? Shall the library determine ? But will it not then be " dictating " to its readers ? Will it not be unduly discriminating against a certain class of opinion when it has undertaken to represent impartially all shades of opinion ? Will it not offend the remonstrant against the existing order of things who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard ; and the defender of the existing order of things who must know the new opinion in order to combat it ; and the student of sociology whose curiosity reaches all extremes and regards them simply a phenomena upon which he is entitled to be informed ? I believe that it will . And yet I do not see how the library can escape exercising judgment . For there is no other responsible authority which can be brought to exercise it . We must then expect numerous decisions which will offend a portion of the community . They will usually be on the conservative side - of exclusion . And it is for those who believe that a public library should be a conservative influence in the community to see that it has the authority and is protected in its exercise . Not that in respect of the violent books there is great injury in present conditions . In the public libraries of to-day there exists no doubt material sufficiently anarchic to upset society , if it could have its will upon society . The fact is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little in our community that is inflammable . The good that the libraries do is obvious and acknowledged . They represent the accumulated experience of mankind brought to our service . They are the custodians of whatever is most worthy of preservation in our own life and literature . They are the natural depositories of what we have of memorial and of records ; the original entries of legislation and of achievement They must render history available ; they must adequately exhibit science ; they may help to refine by the best examples in each art , and in this they may also contribute to the industrial life of the community by educating the artisan into an artist , his craft into an art . And through record and description of processes and inventions they may contribute to the foundations of great industries . They touch the community as a whole as perhaps does no other single organized agency for good . They offer to the shyest ignorance equality with the most confident scholarship , // and demand no formal preliminary which might abash ignorance . They have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of our population . Thirty per cent . of it has come to us from an alien life and alien institutions . One-third of the people in our six leading cities are of foreign birth ; seventy-one per cent . were either born abroad or born of foreign parentage . In the assimilation of this foreign element no single agency is perhaps so potent as our public libraries . The public libraries deem themselves the allies of formal educational processes ; but also the direct educators of that part of the community not subject to the formal processes . It is this latter responsibility which has led them to attempt a broader service than the mere supply of books . A book is not the only nor necessarily the most effective vehicle for conveying knowledge . There are illustrations which more directly convey an impression , and often as fully state a fact . And photographs and process reproductions are now part of the equipment of a public library almost as conventional as books . Within the past year 10,000 such have been added to the collections of the Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for the most part cheap silver prints and the Art Museum is but a hundred feet distant ) ; nor merely as aids to the study of the fine arts and the useful arts , but also as convenient auxiliaries to the study of history , of literature and of institutions . And they are used by individuals and by classes not as a substitute for the text , but as helping to render vivid the lesson of the text . With these go lectures in exposition . Every building of importance recently designed for the uses of a public library includes an art gallery and a lecture hall . What an immense augmentation of function this implies ! It implies that the library is no longer merely an aggregate of books , each passive within rigid limits ; but that it is.an active agent having under its control material which is kept plastic and which it moulds into incredibly varied shapes to suit incredibly varied needs . The experience of the Boston Public Library shows that in the case of books each increase of facilities creates an increased demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as many as fifty readers at a time ; the trustees of 1887@@189067110. txt NEVER have the framers of a constitution profited by so rich an experience as have the Australian statesmen who finished their deliberations at Melbourne a few months ago , and submitted the result to the popular vote of the different colonies . The instrument of government fashioned by their skill and patience ought to be free , one would suppose , from the propositions of the doctrinaire as well as the limitations imposed by the exclusive study of one model . Besides the constitution of the mother country , they had before them the record of the practical working of the American , Canadian and Swiss federal systems , as well as that of the German Empire . In solidity and complexity of structure these systems surpassed all previous examples of federal government , and two of them had special claims upon the attention of Australian legislators , who had little reason to go beyond the constitutions of the United States , Canada and the Swiss Republic for the necessary guidance and instruction . These summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federalize democracy , and their historic and structural differences allowed a catholic choice of material . Far more difficult was the task that confronted the statesmen of the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 , or that which engaged the energies of the pioneers of Canadian Confederation . In both cases the territorial area and the diversity of interests were greater than had ever been embraced under a federal government , and in both there were disturbing causes severely trying to the resources of the most experienced judgment . In the former case the experiment was made after the emergence of a group of colonies from a prolonged and sanguinary war of insurrection ; // in the latter , it was somewhat hastily resorted to as a refuge from dangers which seemed imminent , and under prejudices which biassed political deliberation . But if the United States and Canada came into federal being under stress , the calm of unforced development has been the lot of Australia . Not a battle has been fought , nor a single shot fired , in the course of progress whose results are so remarkable and rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which almost aspired to test the millennial claims of the new theories of social reconstruction , has been largely replaced by the concept of continental unity and the wider outlook which accompanies it . It has been said that little originality can be claimed for this latest experiment in constitution building , and that both trend and goal had , been unmistakably revealed by expediency as well as by shining political examples . It is hardly necessary to discuss the question of comparative originality in the case of a people who inherit a racial instinct for self-government , and who , if latest in the order of time , may claim an original use of the lessons of experience . The eulogies pronounced upon the Constitution of the United States have been largely inspired by its position of initiative , as a federation under new and untried conditions ; the strength and size of the structure bespoke the daring wisdom of the architects . They patterned chiefly from British and colonial models , but they ventured much without the sanction of any precedent . In like manner the Canadian framers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent they copied the Constitution of the United States . They had to devise a federation within that Empire which their American prototypes had cast off ; they had a triple set of political powers to consider , while the convention at Philadelphia had only two . It is hardly necessary to emphasize the incomparable vantage ground from which the Australian statesmen could see where and why their federating predecessors had in some respects been mistaken . Careful in their study of the American and Canadian constitutions , intent and plan were compared with result in the history of their practical working , and the necessary imitations , omissions and variations were made in the Australian system . The Australian people have not been suddenly enthusiastic in support of federation , although in parliamentary circles the idea has long been familiar . Practical progress thus far has de . // pended upon the necessity of communicating to the people the views and beliefs which had almost become axiomatic with some of their ablest leaders As far back as 1849 a committee of the Imperial Privy Council , acting in conformity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a separate colony , and at the same time favored the creation of a general assembly to legislate on intercolonial subjects . There was strong opposition to any imperial enactment embodying these recommendations , but the movement went on in the discussions of deliberative bodies , formal and informal , and its progress was registered in the reports of select committees and royal commissioners . Public men saw the trend of events , and leavened parliamentary discussion with the desirability and high promise of the coming change . Influences from without quickened the movement that was progressing from within , and in 1883 the perception of French and German designs in the Pacific helped to efface the differences which had weakened the feeling for union . The result was the Federal Council Act , providing for a federal legislature of limited powers , and extending only to such colonies as chose to come under its authority . It was strongly opposed by Sir Henry Parkes , who had at first looked favorably upon the project , and it was felt that the measure was only preparatory . Major-General Edwards ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a military point of view , made salient the features of a situation which called for a remedy . In New South Wales , Sir Henry Parkes and his friends took advantage of the report to press the claims of federation , and the political leaders of the other colonies were urged to fall in line with the movement . An intercolonial conference held in Melbourne , in 1890 , resulted in the Sydney Convention of 1891 , composed of delegates elected by the parliaments of the different colonies , and authorized to frame an adequate scheme for a federal constitution . The Commonwealth Bill was the result ; but its reception showed comparative apathy on the part of the colonial electorates . There seemed to be no strong popular impulse in favor of it , except in a few places , and no enthusiasm spread from these . The friends of the bill claimed that the great mass of voters had not been taken into the confidence of the parliamentary leaders , and they forthwith set about to remedy the defect . Federation leagaes // and other voluntary , unofficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation ; and it was agreed that if a new convention , with delegates elected by popular suffrage instead of by the parliaments , were held , and efficient legal machinery provided for the whole constitutional process , from the election of delegates np to the transmission of the completed instrument to the imperial authorities for final enactment into law , there would be neither a lack of popular support nor a long delay in attaining the completed result . These ideas found a voice at the Corowa Convention of 1893 , where Dr. Quick procured the passage of resolutions in favor of a federal enabling act to be passed by the parliaments of the different colonies . New South Wales , Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia , and finally Western Australia ( though not in favor of delegates elected by the people ) passed the act , under whose provisions the final convention has been held . It should be borne in mind that the Commonwealth Bill of 1898 differs somewhat from that drafted by the Sydney Convention of seven years ago , and that the more democratic character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined the popular election of the delegates . Between 1891 and 1897 federation became more truly a popular question , and the different electorates shared , in the revived movement , the initiative which had formerly rested with their leaders in Parliament . Such , in brief outline , is the history of the federation question , and whether the Commonwealth Bill is or is not ratified by the people , it is unlikely that its provisions will be materially changed so long as it is a living issue. * The new constitution provides for a federation under the British Crown , and composed of the colonies of New South . Wales , Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia and Western Australia . The Federal Legislature consists of the Queen , represented by a Governor-General ; a Senate , in which each colony , henceforth to be known as a State , is to be equally represented by members directly elected by popular vote ; and a House of IRepresontatives whose members will be in proportion to population . There will be a Fedt*ral Supreme Court , whose judges will hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of * Since the above was written Victoria . Tasmania and South Australia have voted for federation , thus ensuring the establishment of the new constitution , at least so far as the three colonies that supported it are concerned . // legislative power between the federation and the States is the same as that of the American Republic , the States retaining all powers except such as are expressly given to the federation . The House of Representatives has the power of originating money bills , which the Senate may accept or reject , but may not amend . An important safeguard against deadlock between House and Senate has been made by a clause which provides for simultaneous dissolution to be followed , in the event of continued disagreement , by a joint session of both Houses , when a two-thirds majority shall decide the passing of the bill in dispute . Among the subjects exclusively within the scope of federal legislation are commercial relations with other countries and among the several States , customs and excise , posts and telegraphs , military and naval defence , navigation and shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difficult question of the financial relations of the States was referred to a special committee whose report has been largely incorporated in the constitution , which provides that a uniform customs tariff shall be established for the federation within two years . Trade within the borders of this tariff is to be absolutely free , and the just contribution of each State to the federal revenue is to be determined by careful investigation . Constitutional amendments require a majority of the Senate and House of Representatives , after which they must be submitted to conventions elected by the people of the several States , and approved by a majority of such conventions . The people of the States whose conventions so approve must also be a majority of the people of the Commonwealth . An amendment diminishing the proportionate representation of any State in either House of the Federal Legislature shall not become law without the consent of such State . It is not easy to say whether the American or the Canadian constitution has been more closely copied . If the former has been the chief model in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter has been imitated in the introduction of cabinet or responsible government , thus establishing the rule of British constitutional usage in the exercise of executive power and the conduct of legislation-a principle of growth whose processes and results are unwritten law . That the new nation is not to be an independent republic , but the Commonwe*tdth of Australia under the British Crown , is // doubtless owing to the peaceful political development which was repugnant , from the standpoint of interest as well as of racial affiliation , to a separation from the mother country . The relation of a dependency which is more nominal than real , and which may look forward to a larger and final federation in an ? qual union , has not been found incompatible with a national life and dignity . Some of the constitutional features in which the new federation differs from the American and Canadian are of more than ordinary interest . The scope of federal executive power is substantially the same as in the Dominion of Canada , though time may develop some unexpected divergences . In the Australian system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States will be different from that which obtains in the Dominion . In the latter , the executive heads of the different Provinces are appointed by the Governor-General in Council-that is to say , by the federal prime minister of the day . They may at any time be dismissed from office by the same authority for cause assigned , and provincial legislation is likewise subject to a federal veto . But in Australia each State will appoint its Governor , and State legislation will not be subject to either an imperial or a federal veto . The powers of the Supreme Court are a close approximation to those of the Supreme Court of Canada . It is , of course , designed to be the guardian of the constitution , whose provisions it will interpret . It will also have jurisdiction in cases arising under federal legislation and in inter-State cases , as well as appeals from State courts . It can not be strictly called , like the Supreme Court of the United States , a tribunal of final resort , because its powers are subject to alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions to the Queen in Council further restricts its jurisdiction . The federal legislature may define or custom may establish classes of cases on which its decision may be considered final , so that it may be difficult to obtain leave to appeal therefrom ; but there is the constitutional provision , overriding everything to the contrary , that the Queen in Council may in any case in which the public interests of the Commonwealth , or of any State , or of any other part of the Queen 's dominions are concerned , grant leave to appeal from any judgment of the Supreme Court of Australia . The granting of such leave is dis // cretionary , and judging by Canadian experience it will prove to be without friction . The suggestive fact is that the Australian States , though relatively of greater importance than the Provinces in the Canadian system , have shown no jealousy of any judicial interpretation of their rights . The thread of connection runs from the State courts up to the throne ; contests over questions of greater or less importance may proceed in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and by these provisions , which would seem to break in upon the consistency of separate spheres of federal and State sovereignty , and to go beyond them both , the people of Australia have shown their confidence in the integrity of the bench . Apart from the purely legal view , the result can not but tighten the political bord with the mother country . The constitution of the Senate is a departure from the usual form of the upper house in the British and colonial parliaments . Like the Senate of the United States , it stands consistently for the federal principle , and the States are therefore equally represented in it . There is no such marked disparity in their populations as that which allows the votes of Nevada and New York to neutralize each other . For the choice of senators by the State legislatures , as established by the Sydney Convention of 1891 , direct popular election has been substituted . It is quite evident that the members of the Melbourne Convention made a careful study of the Canadian , American and Swiss senates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . The influential minority of reformers , who have long been satisfied that United States senators should be elected by popular vote , will regard the Australian experiment with deep satisfaction , nor will they fail to attribute the result partly to their own persistent efforts . Between 1891 and 1897 resolutions in favor of this change , involving an amendment of the Constitution , passed the House of Representatives at Washington and were reported favorably in the Senate . Only a few weeks ago the House passed another similar resolution by a practically unanimous vote of 184 to 11 . The arguments in the support of these resolutions are well known by forcible repetition . The corrupt methods by which an undue number of rich men have become senators , the tedious and bitter contests in certain cases , the cynical despotism of the " boss , " the gerrymandering of senatorial and representVOL . CLXVII. - NO. bOO . 3 // ative districts by State legislatures , the narrowing of political issues by the personal interests of senators seeking election-all these abuses have been set forth not without benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fearing their probable recurrence in the new federation , its framers have in effect declared that an indirect choice of senators is undemocratic ; they have recorded their disbelief in a vicarious exercise of the individual franchise ; they did not think that the State legislatures could act with a more trained discretion than the people themselves , or rather they held that the people 's instinct for the right men could supply the public service better than could party management in a State legislature of variable complexion . The Canadian Senate , an imitation of the House of Lords so far as unsuitable conditions would allow , was evidently regarded by the Australian statesmen as something to avoid imitating . It was , of course , looked upon as undemocratic both in principle and practice , and the apportionment of members was deemed a plain violation of the federal principle of equal representation . In the Confederation Act the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were counted as one and given an equal representation with Ontario and Quebec ; there was a creation of three equal groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown on the subsequent admission of Manitoba and British Columbia . The undemocratic character of the chamber may be accounted for to some extent by the strong temper and exciting conditions under which the Canadian framers matured their plans . Their deliberations were made exigent by the Civil War , which to them conveyed a lesson of the danger of State rights . Besides , they remembered the unsatisfactory experience with the elective Legislative Council which existed for some years prior to Confederation . Under the circumstances it is not strange that they were disposed to belittle and distrust an upper house patterned after that of the neighboring republic , and although they saw that a federal constitution was inevitable , they put as much of the British leaven in it as they possibly could . The opening words of the preamble to the British North America Act are : " Whereas the Provinces of Canada , Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , with a constitution similar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last clause seems inconsistent , unless very freely interpreted , but if justifiable at all , it is by the provisions relating to the Senate . An irresponsible body , fixed in number and nominated for life by a Governor-General , who is advised by a party leader , is the constitutional anomaly of Canada , and suggests Voltaire 's witticism on the Holy Roman Empire . He said it was neither " Holy , " nor " Roman , " nor " Empire , " hut not with more truth than any one can say of the Dominion Senate , that it is neither federal , nor representative , nor democratic , although it has many excellent and able men among its members . The hereditary principle is lacking , because the structure of Canadian society put that out of the question ; but , on the other hand , it has no fear , like the House of Lords , of a sufficient increase in membership to ensure the passage of a popular measure toward which it may be recalcitrant or reactionary . Only saving common sense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstruction of public business , By virtue of its constitutional powers it could almost wreck the legislation of a session , if partisanship were strong enough to prompt such a course ; but it only Nemesis is a constitutional amendment . Experience alone will determine whether the Australian upper house will , like that of England and Canada , prove inferior to the lower in the contribution of its members to the interest and dignity of public life . In this respect the Senate of the United States has , in the estimation of some capable critics , of late years descended from its former high estate . The presence of members who have no exceptional ability or real political importance , and the marked deterioration in eloquence and argument as compared with the great days when Webster , Clay and Calhoun made memorable the debate of public questions , have been ascuibed , as already intimated , largely to election by the State legislatures , especially in their later phase of control by a rigid party mechanism whose methods , quite removed from the prevision of true statesmanship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage . It is , perhaps , as much owing to this , fact as to any other that so many men of character and ability have grown indifferent to the claims of political duty . To the objection that a Senate directly elected by the people will not be less liable than the House of Representatives to im // pulsivo action , or that it is not likely to have that discernment in legislative revision which is often supposed to distinguish the upper house in bi-cameral parliaments , the Australian statesmen have made answer by providing for the election of one-half of the members every third year . This , according to expert opinion , is calculated to prevent sudden and rash changes , without unduly retarding the passage of any law decisively favored by the people . Two classes of senators , elected at different times , are also less liable to reflect too thoroughly any passing phase of opinion . The introduction of cabinet or responsible government in the new federation has been made under exceptional conditions . It is the most marked divergence from the system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important resemblance to that of the Dominion of Canada . The British House of Commons , in the course of its development as the embodiment of the popular principle , has drawn to itself the practical control of the executive and legislation , and the dependence of the Cabinet upon the majority in the House is the central fact in parliamentary government . But it implies a certain inferiority in the power of the House of Lords , and has been inveterately associated with the non-representative character of the latter . The question arises , how will the Australian cabinet system work when both Houses are directly elected by the people ? If even at the present day in Great Britain and Canada responsible government is a prii*ciple whose force and direction are not always closely calculable , how much less so may it be when one of its historic elements is changed in this new experiment ? Will an Australian ministry rest upon a majority in one House , or in both ? The Commonwealth Bill does not specify ; it declares in effect that the Goveruor-General shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be eligible to seats in either House . The rest is left to unwritten custom . It seems difficult to reconcile the usual meaning of a " parliamentary session " with the prescribed duration of either House in the new federal legislature . In Great Britain and Canada those words signify the constitutional term of the House of Commons , and the expiry of that term marks the time for dissolution and the possible advent of a new ministry . The Australian House of Representatives is to be elected for three years , and if the custom of the mother country is to govern , popular confidence in the // ministry must be similarly tested by dissolution . The Senate need not be consulted , and either its importance must be lessened thereby or the traditional practice in cabinet government must be greatly modified . It seems improbable that the House of Representatives will consent to share the prerogatives inherited from its great original . It retains the power of the purse by the right to originate money bills , which the Senate can not amend . rphe Governor-General can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , and that is a restriction which is more than likely to have a marked influence in perpetuating cabinet government on customary lines , as it excludes the Senate from that direct appeal to the people which not only arises by effiuxion of time , but is contingent on an executive act . It is difficult to see why the resulting verdict should not decide the fate of a ministry , independently of the Senate . In the case of a party leader of strong personality and tenacious grip on the springs of political power , a few decisive precedents might determine this question . Suppose , for example , that during the opening years of federation there should appear on the scene a statesman equal in capacity to the late Sir John Macdonald , and who should wield in Australian politics a sway as continuous and masterful as that of the late Conservative leader in Dominion affairs . Sir John held the premiership for nineteen years , exclusive of his lease of power before Confederation . His last tenure of office was from 1878 to 1891 without interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a majority in the House of Representatives for that length of time , an adverse majority in the Senate would have some difficulty in displacing him . He would control legislation in the House during more than four tennis , and in default of opposition from the Senate during the first term he could invoke such default in support of the right to hold power so long as he could retain his majority . All the presumptions of cabinet custom would be in his favor ; he could dispute the claim of the Senate to a voice in determining the fate of a ministry which owed its existence to the House alone . And he could with consistency allege that the Senate , though elected by the people , did not represent the people as a whole , but only the States , as electoral districts with separate and possibly conflicting interests . If the hereditary principle of the House of Lords , or the nominee power which fills // the Canadian Senate , or the federalism of the Senate of the United States-if each of these is different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people expressed at one time , none of them , it might be argued , should be suffered to share that control of the executive which has so long depended upon the popular branch of the legislature . The question of frequency in changes of the federal ministry is suggested in connection with the unenviable showing in the colonies . New South Wales , Victoria and South Australia had ninety-six different cabinets in forty years . It is inconceivable that efficiency in federal administration could exist with such a kaleidoscopic shuffling as has marred the field of view in provincial politics . But there are reasons why this need not be expected . Political affairs will henceforth demand a broader outlook and compel wider issues . Many of the most contentious subjects of legislation will be left to State control . Ministries will not rise and fall , as they have in the past , on a petty question of accounts or some matter of merely municipal interest . New conditions rule , and it is warrantable to expect a more equable conduct of public administration when the national life shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When that service is given , it will be moulded by the traditions of British parliamentary goveminent . The " manners , virtue , fieedom , power " which have been associated with those traditions in the mother country will not be absent from the political career of her youngest daughter nation.
