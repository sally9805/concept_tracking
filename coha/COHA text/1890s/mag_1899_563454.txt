txt THE historian of the future will find an interesting task in tracing , within what has practically been a single century , the rise and growth of two great republics , the French and our own . The former may be said to have been born in 1789 , and the latter in 1783 ; and , though the history of the former was obscured and apparently terminated by the recurrence of periods of imperialism , yet with the year 1848 the republican form of government re-established itself , and with a brief interval , represented by the pyrotechnics of Napoleon the Third , has persisted until this hour . Such a study would become naturally , first of all , a study of origins ; and , from this point of view , its contrasts would be both interesting and dramatic . When one takes the French D&amp;laration des Droits de l'Homme , and puts it beside our own Declaration of Independence , it is , indeed , first of all , the resemblances rather than the contrasts that impress us . The charter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are born and continue free and equal in rights ; ( 2 . ) That Society is an association of men to preserve the natural rights of men ; ( 3 . ) That sovereignty resides in the nation , and that all authority , whether vested in an individual or in a body of men , comes expressly from the nation ; ( 4 . ) That liberty is the power of doing what we will , so long as it does not injure another ; the only limits of each man 's natural rights being such as secure the same rights to others ; these // limits being determinable only by the law , and not by the " divine rights " of anybody ; ( 5 . ) That the law can forbid only such actions as are mischievous to society , and that quod lex non vetat permittit ( what the law does not forbid , it permits ) ; ( 6 . ) That all citizens have a right to take part through their representatives in the making of the laws ; ( v. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save in cases reserved by the law ) , is one of the most precious rights of man , etc . Here it will be seen that the French D*claration des Droits was much more explicit than our own , but , equally , that our Declaration , by its forms of protest , carried with it the same claims , the same original conceptions of the rights of a citizen , and the same distinct repudiations of those older forms of government which were absolutist , paternal , or monarchical in their character . And yet , if one had gone to Paris , and thence to Boston or Philadelphia , toward the close of the last century , he could not easily have found more marked contrasts than these communities , on different sides of the Atlantic , presented . The early Puritanism of New England , the Reformation spirit as it came from Holland to New York , and the earlier Quakerism of Philadelphia had , indeed , already begun to experience the effects of those modifying influences which , since then , have so largely obliterated many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the ideas of the fathers survived , and the earlier traditions and manners widely ruled . Nothing more unlike them , whether in the city of Penn or in the city of Cotton Mather , could easily have been found than the beliefs , the traditions , the license of that gay Parisian capital , which , since then , has had so much to do with forming the manners and modifying the social and moral standards of the rest of the civilized world . The French people demanded a republic as the one form of relief from the wanton wastefulness , the personal corruptness , the cruel exactions of princes , nobles and ecclesiastics , whose lives were even a greater offence than their feudal claims and their aristocratic indifference . The Americans demanded a republic , though from the beginning they had known nothing else than the most severe colonial simplicity , and though , with many of them , the contention was rather for a principle than for the transformation of a condition . // In France , there were great social extremes , great prodigality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hardship on the other . In America , there was neither extreme luxury nor extreme want , neither great wealth nor great poverty . And while in France there was the heroism of a fine indifference to suffering , if it could purchase freedom , in America there was something more and higher , in those great moral aspirations which were more concerned with a great opportunity for the realization of a lofty ideal of government and citizenship , than with any mere impatience of the intolerable character of existing conditions . As one saw them then , the situations seemed to be so unlike , that any considerable resemblance in their history and development appeared to be altogether improbable . * And yet , as a matter of fact , as one looks to-day at France and America , unlike as they are in so many of their national characteristics , the tendencies which have in them elements that are mischievous and alarming are substantially the same . I shall not attempt to trace them in the history of our sister Republic ; it will be sufficient for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own . I. First among them , I would name what I may call the gradual alteration of the standard of values . A clever foreigner not long ago remarked , after discussing our national incertitude as to a permanent standard in the matter of commercial exchanges , that it seemed to him an image of something that underran our whole theory of life and modes of conduct . " In other words , " he observed , " I find among different classes and sections such varying measurements of what , for instance , is personal excellence . Among educated and civilized peoples , ordinarily , there is a very strong conception of what is national , personal , social justice and honor ; but in America this conception seems to me a shifting quantity , having one character and certain definite elements in one community or individual , and in others quite another . " The criticism has in it , undoubtedly , the note of exaggeration which is usually characteristic of the judgment of foreigners ; but it is certainly worth while to ask whether there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious reflection . It can not be denied that the earlier pages of the history of the Republic were disfigured by greed , unscrupulousness and chicanery , both in public and private life , and I have no mind to chal // lenge the statement of the writer who , in the pages of an English periodical , not long ago , recalled how , on one occasion in our early history , " Gouverneur Morris was sitting over the polished mahogany at Bedford with John Jay , when he suddenly ejaculated , through clouds of smoke : Jay , what a set of d-d scoundrels we had in that Second Congress ! ' Yes , ' said Jay , that we had , ' and he knocked the ashes from his pipe . " But I am very confident that no one who knows our earlier American history will pretend that such a tone or such incidents were generally descriptive of it . It may indeed be urged that the conditions in those earlier days were different , and they were . Society was more homogeneous then ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are to-day . But the very fact that to-day we are wont to speak of a certain type of business or professional man as almost an extinct species , has in it a significance of which we can not afford to lose sight . What was that type ? It was that of one to whom a nice sense of integrity , a fine scruple in a business or professional transaction was so instinctive a thing , that it would not have been possible to conceive of the individual without it . But it must be owned , I think , that to-day that type of man is ordinarily referred to as slow , antiquated , a " back number , " or by some other more or less polite periphrasis by which we indicate a certain remoteness and inadequacy , so far as the tasks and transactions of our modern life are concerned . We are all , theoretically , in favor of honest dealing and a nice scruple ; but , in the enterprises which make our most conspicuous successes , in the financial schemes that illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much these , as that adroitness that takes advantage of an opportunity , and that shrewd far-reaching which , if it be not overreaching , consists , often , largely in taking advantage of another 's ignorance . In the great industrial and financial combinations which are the especial feature of our day , it must be admitted that it is the gain of a few , and not the equities of the many , which are chiefly kept in view . And so it is in connection with the public service , and the qualities which may justly be demanded of those who are appointed to it . It must be owned that in our political history the standard , here , has not from the beginning been fixed in accordance with the highest conception of those standards ; and this , // since we know what were the standards of the mother country when the Republic came into existence , is not surprising . In an admirable paper on " Imperialism and the Civil Service , " * Professor G. E. Howard has lately pointed out how slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England ascended to the idea of an honest and competent civil service . But it is to be remembered that England had had no such objectlessons as we have had from the beginning , in connection with a system which , with the recurrence of every presidential election , has practi'cally made of every office in the land a spoil . That our doctrine that " to the victor belong the spoils " has given us neither capability nor efficiency , and that its glaring defects have been before our eyes for more than a hundred years , ought , one would think , to be a reason for admitting that a better and a purer system is indispensable in the interests of public business and of the public integrity . It is doubtless true that the enemies of Civil Service reform are in the minority , or else we should not have secured so much of it from Congress as we have already obtained . But that the public sentiment in the matter is a strong and resolute one , that attacks upon the principles and the administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to awaken , wide-spread resentment and resistance , this is so little evident that those attacks do not cease , and that , even in very high places , they have lately had the encouragement of a quasi-endorsement if not approval . It is the existence of facts such as these that , in connection with an estimate of our present social tendencies may well give us pause . Society , if it is to be something more than a breed of predatory animals preying upon one another , must be based upon certain established principles of mutual honesty ; and if a people whose boast is their progress along the pathways of a higher civilization expect to vindicate that claim , it must be by demonstrating that , in their dealings with one another and the world , they are dominated by a sentiment of incorruptible integrity . II . But , to advance a step higher , what shall we say of those social relations which , as compared with those of business and the state , are so much closer and more intimate ? There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of our whole soPolitical &amp;ience Quarterly , June , 1899. pp. 240-250. // cial system , and which has , in the progress of human society out of the brutalities of its lower barbarisms , been its distinguishing note . I mean the institution of marriage . Some recent features of our social history may well awaken in even the most unreflecting among us , in this connection , profound anxiety ; and , if they do not , sooner or later , bring to pass throughout the land some strenuous movement of legal and moral reform , are surely prophetic of the most deplorable consequences . For , when we come to trace the rise of great peoples , we are constrained to recognize that marriage , its sanctity , its indissolubility , its very intimate and sacred relations to that oldest and most sacred institution , the family , is one of the earliest concerns of the moral teacher and of the law-making power . If we go back in this matter to the history of beginnings , we at once discover , in the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those merely tribal associations of Greece and India , and other relatively more advanced peoples , the idea of the family , the laws of its constitution , the guardianship of its traditions , the maintenance of its rights , grew up ; and how closely all th ' *e were connected with , and , indeed , sprang from , the idea of the sacredness of marriage , the sanctity of which in later ages , and in Christian communities as a Sacrament , found its prototype in that striking religious ceremony in which , before ten witnesses ( wise provision , which our modern law might wisely imitate ! ) an ox was sacrificed , and a wheaten cake broken and divided between the spouses by the priest . Under these provisions , also , the consent of the paterfamilias was essential , and the restrictions as to age , relationship by consanguinity , etc. , were substantially those which have prevailed in modern Europe and in our own country . Of course , when the time came that the regulation of the marriage relation was taken over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of restrictions which , in time , precipitated the revolt whose consequences we are experiencing to-day . It was inevitable that , when the powers of the Church and the State ceased to be identical , and when communities came mo being in which ecclesiastical authority , outside of the immediate fellowship that recognized it , was practically disowned , there should be great reaction . The Church had often used its power in connection with marriage in ways that were gravely open to suspicion ; and its stern front to the weak and poor , and its easy // compliance in the case of the rich and powerful , were not the least among potential influences in producing the revolt , both from monarchical and ecclesiastical authority . Out of such a condition of things came , inevitably , and by steps which I need not trace here , the condition of things which we find in this land to-day . Marriage was practically taken out of the custody of the Church , and made altogether an affair of the State . Ministers of religion might , as they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the transaction , rather than any other . Worst of all , as we ate now slowly coming to realize , in a Republic whether of thirteen or three times as many States , each State might make its own marriage laws , and the contract according to any one of them was valid anywhere in the land . And so , in the forty-five States of this Union , there are almost as wide diversities in the matter of marriage laws , as there are of climate , color , or local tradition . Nor is this all . The revolt from ecclesiasticism carried with it many of those conditions precedent in the case of marriage , which experience has shown to be among its wisest safeguards . Thoughtful people to-day throughout the land are shocked and dismayed by the reckless and dissolute precipitance with which the marriage tie is broken , and with which unscrupulous people conspire to rid themselves of its obligations to one person , in order that they may flippantly assume them towards another . But what was to be expected in a relation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative communities , enables people to create without either circumspection , publicity , or deliberation ? The old ecclesiastical provision , still existing in other countries , which requires publication in Church , or otherwise , of the intention of marriage , is widely scouted by us as intolerable tyranny and impertinence . And yet , upon even the lowest view of it , marriage is something in which not those alone who contract it are concerned . The State , human society , the community of whatever description , have a large stake in the marriage of individuals ; for such a contract implies , according to the law of nature , burdens in which all must directly or indirectly share , and the possible perpetuation of evils from which all must more over less really suffer . We approach here , I recognize , a line where the question passes over into the domain of what we are wont to define as that of those larger rights and larger freedoms which // no law may equitably invade . But the question which , in the United States , demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions to freedom have not already been concessions which threaten primary moral sanctions and the whole social fabric . rro endure a condition of things such as exists among us , where that which , within one geographical area , law and public sentiment both declare to be wrong , becomes right the moment one has crossed a territorial line a few miles away ; to recognize divorces , and marriages subsequent to them , which have in them no other element than the loosest license , and the most wanton self-will ; this is to tolerate a situation which , sooner or later , threatens all social or moral sanctions , and condemns a people which accepts it to that reversion to primitive type that would land us at last in barbarism . It is a matter for profound thankfulness that there has been , of late , on this subject , a wide axVakening of the public conscience . It is true , I presume , that the time for the ideal remedy , at least in one direction , for our present situation , is not yet ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . But we may at least begin , in the several commonwealths , some organized movement for strengthening our defences against reckless and imprudent marriage . In some of our oldest states , such , for instance , as New York , the present law is , in this respect , most defective . Persons desiring to be married may come from anywhere , accompanied by anybody and often by nobody , without previous notice , published proclamation , or warning of any kind ; and without any license from State , city , or court , may demand marriage of magistrate , or minister of religion , and be married by him solely upon his own discretion . He is in all cases to be the judge of their legal or moral competency to contract marriage , of their previous condition , unmarried , widowed or divorced , and of every other question which so great a step involves . And yet , when these persons are married , when the wife has borne children , and when the husband has abandoned them , the State must interfere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to conceive of a situation which , under the most solemn sanctions of law , and often of religion , could be more deplorable . Let it not be supposed , however , that in this matter , or in any other , in connection with our present social tendencies , of which I have spoken thus far , I am building greatly upon the // law . A great authority has reminded us that the law was made " not for a righteous man but for the disobedient , ' ** a barbed wire fence , as it were , coming against which he is to find that he is a creature living within fixed restrictions , whose unyielding limitations , and not his own wayward will , are to be the boundaries of his liberty . But as , to follow the same homely figure , reason , intelligence , an awakened moral sense , the power of fixed habits on the side of good conduct , are better guides to life than a barbed wire fence , so society may wisely recognize that more potent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with reference to any social evil among us , is that nurture of the individual which determines in him , at length , those higher motives and judgments of life , in all its various relations , which are to make of that life something worthy of its origin and its powers . And so this discussion leads us finally to the question , What is that institution and order which has in it the forces most coinpetent to contribute to that end ? To that question I answer , that institution which in human history is the oldest and most nearly universal , the family . We take it up in its earliest and most primitive forms , and we find in it the first dawnings of a regulated and organized life resting , for its foundation , upon authority . That first step which takes a group of people out of a condition of utter lawlessness , is the investing of the parent with the right to rule . Crude impulse , unbridled passion , ignorant prepossessions , these must give way in every direction to that wiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years and experience , and which are the reasonable grounds of the authority of a parent . And as we go forward from the least civilized beginnings to the highest developments of human society , it is impossible to miss the profound significance of this fact . There is one race in the world to-day which , in the face of disabilities , persecutions , ostracisms of the most persistent and implacable nature , has for thousands of years illustrated this fact in a very remarkable way . The Hebrew has , of all other peoples , clung to a high ideal of the family life , its affections , its mutual loyalties , and above all its submission to parental authority . And , whatever other traits may explain the remarkable triumphs of this people over obstacles , this must be owned to be pre-eminent among them . *St . Paul , 1st Epistle to Timothy , I. , 9. // I do not forget that it has been urged that it has been the transplantation of the Hebraic idea of the family to our shores , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier history , which largely explain the situation confronting us to-day . The earlier homes of our fathers , especially in New England , it will be said , were largely dominated by the Hebraic note . Paternal authority was absolute ; filial obedience was , or was expected to be , unquestioning ; and it may not unnaturally be urged that the present reaction , in many aspects of the large domain of morals , is the result . But even if this were more than partially true , it would prove no more than that an exaggeration in one direction had produced its inevitable reaction in another , and that the extremes of that reaction are less excusable than the austerities that provoked them . For , as a matter of fact , that melancholy disintegration of family life which it must frankly be owned is a characteristic of our modern society , is , quite as often as otherwise , to be found where there is no such explanation to account for it . For myself , 1 believe it to be the product of that enormous exaggeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , and which has brought with it in its train a whole host of evils . The struggle for freedom has issued , in more than one direction , in the triumph of license ; free thought has been translated to mean free love ; and the restraints of august and eternal sanctions have , under the pretext of the rights of the individual , been thrown down and trampled under foot . One illustration of this will be sufficient for my purpose , and it has at least this advantage , that it is pertii*ent pre-eminently to the sanctity and perpetuity of the family . One of the large movements in the direction of individual rights which have occurred in our day is that in behalf of the rights of woman . Her condition has been described as one of defenceless servitude , and the laws of several of our American commonwealths have undergone considerable modifications in the direction of her personal independence , and of a more equitable definition of her rights in the matter of her person , property , the custody of her children , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can only regard , on the whole , with sympathy and approval , a very considerable widening of her opportunities for indopendent maintenance . The large excess of single women necessarily dependent upon their own resources , // in countries like England and our own , where men are being constantly withdrawn from the mother country to the colonies , or from the older to the newer portions of the Republic , has made it necessary that avenues of employment for women should be opened in directions wholly unprecedented . It is of this state of things , especially in cities , that we are just beginning to see the consequences . The independent single woman , with her own n*nage , however simple and microscopic , mistress of herself and of her time when the task hours of the day are done , and of her own person all the time , presents a tempting contrast to her married sister , weighted with cares of little children , with impaired health , narrow means , and , it may be , a selfish and brutal husband . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children may often be absent ; but , in such a case , the situation is not greatly changed , and the modern wife , without domestic occupation sufficient to keep her happily employed , falls a prey to false teachers and foolish dreamers , who are continually finding some better order on which to rest the foundations of human society than that on which the Originating Mind has rested it . " For God setteth the solitary in families , " and it is at our peril that we tamper with His Divine Order ! And so , a wise foresight will see that he is the truest friend of the Republic who strives to re-build the Home and re-create the Family . In this connection , it would be worth while for some one to gather and tabulate for us our American statistics of hotel life . The proportion of married people who , in cities and towns , live in hotels is coming to be one of the most curious and grave phenomena of our modern civilization . The proportion of *nch persons who have no children or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an interesting statistic ; and the plea , in such cases , that the city is no place for childrenas if any mere hygienic conditions could supply the place of home love and training-would bring us face to face with the most pathetic revelation of alL For , straightway , in such a case there must needs arise in the memory of any thoughtful person a home which he has known , and of which , it may be , it was his high privilege once to be an inmate . In such a home the family circle , which in our modern life exists , so far as it survives at all , in the attenuated dimensions of the breakfast table , to which its members , if they come at all , // come in ragged and disjointed order , the other meals being eaten down town , at the Club , as guests at somebody else 's table , at restaurants , and the like ; in such a home , I say , the daily order was a daily privilege , and the family gathering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such companionships , daily touched each other in mutually helpful and inspiring ways . Fatherhood was wisdom , gentleness , counsel , sympathy . The boy 's tasks and books were the counters through which the common knowledge and interest were exchanged ; the girl 's dainty needlework the first expression of artistic taste , which a mother 's reading , travel , social intercourse , gilded with the fine charm of a wider horizon ; the thought for others ; the consideration for helplessness ; the homage to age ; the gentle breeding , in one word , that makes fine manners because its fruit is a sensitive respect for what is due to others rather than a brusque determination to exact what is due to ourselves , these it was that made in such a home a centre of reverence and loyalty to all that was pure and good , to all that was just and tender . And this because to such the home was not a tavern but a sanctuary , not a lodging house , but a haven of rest and strength . The passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the yoke of authority was forever transformed by the touch of love . And so we Americans may well see our calling to-day . That brilliant people to whom I began by referring have no word in their vocabulary for home , and their tragic history is the monumental illustration of the absence of that training and nurture for which , in its highest aspect , the home stands . As one of their own prophets has lately said , " The children are the principal victims of the French home system . It would seem that our homes are really organized for strangers more than ourselves . This must be changed . Our course of action must be reversed . Private life is an unrecognized but formidable power ; no social recovery is possible unless this be recognized . " * I italicize these last words , for they are the key to reform in our whole social structure . Wherever we end , we must begin with the home . Our own history has given to us , here , a high and noble ideal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
