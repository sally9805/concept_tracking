txt The Baltimore schooner Robert H. Mitchell sailed from this port early yesterday morning , and a few hours later furnished to residents and Summer visitors of Seabright , N. J. , an illustration of a drowning craft . The Mitchell encountered threatening weather , started back to port , sprang a dangerous leak soon afterward , and foundered off the New-Jersey coast , in plain view . of hundreds , who had been attracted to the beach by the report that a vessel was in distress . The crew of five men were rescued by the life savers . Capt . Benjamin Pratt of Baltimore , part owner of the vessel , commanded the unlucky craft . Accompanied by the others of the crew , he returned to this city last night . To a reporter for The New-York Times the Captain gave an account of the disaster and the rescue . Capt . Pratt said his vessel , which had a total capacity of 2S0 tons , was laden with 145 tons of salt when she put to sea yesterday . Norfolk was the port to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blowing when the vessel crossed the bar . The wind gathered more weight as she stood out to sea , and shortly before noon the weather ' became so threatening that the Captain decided to put back into the horseshoe and await a more favorable outlook . The schooner was accordingly put about and headed toward her wake . A considerable sea had got up in the meantime , and an occasional shower of spray would fly across her decks , The well was sounded at noon and three feet of water were found in the hold . Capt . Pratt refused to believe the seaman who told him his vessel was leaking , and made a personal examination . Instead of three feet of water , he found six . It did not take him long to decide that in order to save the vessel she would have to be beached . The helm was put up and the sheets eased off . For a half hour or so she made fair speed , and then , as her hull sank deeper in the water , her movements became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessly waterlogged , and after putting on their best clothes and securing such valuables as they had , the men assembled on deck . Every sail was set . The shore was in plain sight at 1 o'clock , and the men on the ' schooner saw that many people had accumulated on the beach . The colors were fluttering union down , but it did not require that mute appeal to let the watchers know that the schooner , heading straight for the beach under all sail , was in sore distress . The vessel staggered on for twenty minutes longer , bravely lifting her heavy burden over the swollen seas . Then a big wave burst over the stern , and as the flood rolled forward , the craft began to settle . The crew made a rush for the rigging , and none too soon , for the next wave engulfed the hull . The schooner slowly sank , stern first , and buried herself under the seven fathoms of water , leaving her two masts projecting out of the sea like the arms of a drowning man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats and hands in a vain effort to attract the attention of a passing steamship . A tug and an excursion boat also passed near , they say , but they were unable to make their condition known . The waves , swelling heavily against the sails , threatened to snap the masts , and to avoid that danger the Captain ordered the halliards cut . That relieved the strain , but it did not increase the comfort of the men , who were clinging to the crosstrees and who expected every minute to be precipitated into the sea . Capt . A. H. West and the lifesavers of Station No. 3 were making every effort to go to the rescue . The launching of the lifeboat was a dangerous undertaking , and the life savers were heartily cheered as they started . The crew who manned the boat were Capt . West , Peter Olsen , Andrew Swanson , James Miller , August Johnson , Charles Erickson , and Charles Larson . With the aid of Summer visitors the lifeboat was hauled to Normandie and launched . It was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the roaring surf and the bow of the lifeboat pointed toward the topmasts of the sunken schooner , where the sailors could be seen clinging to the rigging . This was at 2:15 P. M. The wind was blowing almost a gale and the rain was swept along with it . A mile and a half out an enormous sea broke over the boat and nearly swamped it . It was an hour before the Mitchell was reached . Seaman Brown was clinging to the fore rigging ; the others had found refuge in the . main rigging . With great difficulty the men were taken on board the lifeboat and the return trip began . The news of the wreck had spread along the North Jersey coast , and hundreds were on the beach . The boat plunged through the breakers for an hour and a half before a landing was made . Rescued and rescuers were taken into the Hotel Normandie and cared for . The guests at the Normandie and the Shrewsbury Inn collected a purse of $60 for the shipwrecked sailors . Gen. F. P. Earle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing , and all were soon enjoying a hearty dinner . Nearly $400 was collected and distributed among the life-saving crew . The life-saving station at Seabright is only kept open by the Government from Sept. 1 to May 1 , and a number of prominent men who witnessed the wreck promised to agitate the question of securing an appropriation from Congress for making the service continuous the year round . Capt . Pratt could give no reason for his vessel springing aleak . She was old , however , and that may account for the disas -- ter . She was 104 feet long , 28 feet beam , 7,1 feet deep , and was valued at $5,000 , and was uninsured . The crew , besides Capt . Pratt , was made up as follows : Mate  --  M. D. Twiford ; Steward  --  John Paul ; Seamen  --  E. Brown and John Massey .
