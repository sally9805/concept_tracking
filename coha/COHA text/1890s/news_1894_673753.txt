txt in his opinion , was an increase in the amount of greenbacks by the amount of national bank circulation retired . Mr. Bowers ( Rep. , Cal. , ) also opposed the bill . Referring to the present business conditions , ' which he asserted were the result of Democratic tinkering with the tariff , he said that if this bill became a law a panic , unequaled in intensity and extent , would inevitably and speedily ensue . The result of the operation of the bill would be to destroy national banks and wipe out their circulation . The party that should be guilty of such legislation , in his opinion , would be ground into powder . The establishment of the postal savings banks , coupled with the issue and sale of small bonds with which to take up the outstanding greenbacks , and the coinage of silver were the elements of the scheme which , in his opinion , would give relief to the people . Mr. Bryan ( Dem. , Neb. , ) was the third consecutive opponent of the bill who addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inception and introduction of the bill , Mr. Bryan said it was an unprecedented repudiation of the principles of Democratic government . No declaration in favor of the annihilation of greenbacks had been made by any party or President , and yet , immediately after the late erections , the most remarkable in many respects the country had ever seen , the party in charge of this Congress proposed to surrender , in the last hours of their possession of power , the control of our banking and currency system to the banks by a measure that includes the prohibition of greenbacks . There was absolutely no excuse for the bill , said Mr. Bryan . Its introduction at this time could not be defended unless it would afford a remedy for the evil complained of . The reason given by its friends and promoters for bringing it into the House was that the exigencies of the Treasury demanded it ; that the Treasury was being drained of gold by the exchange of greenbacks therefor . But the bill did not provide even a primary remedy . The only remedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fund them in bonds . When that was done , if it ever were done , the trouble would still exist , for the silver certificates would still remain , and they must be redeemed in gold on demand . The gentleman from Connecticut ( Mr. Sperry ) admitted at the close of his speech the other day that the situation demanded the funding , not only of the greenbacks , but also a portion of the silver certificates . Mr. Bryan denounced the bond issue as a conspiracy against the Government , quoting the movement of gold from the Treasury between the dates of advertising for bids of the last issue of bonds and of the delivery of the first lot of bonds as proof of his assertion . " If we had brave Andrew Jackson in the White House no w , he would rise in his might and say : By the eternal , the rights of the people are dearer than those of Wall Street . ' But what answer does the present Chief Executive make ? ' Whatsoever they ask of me , even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ' " Proceeding then to the provisions cf the bill , Mr. Bryan expressed his opposition to them in detail . The first ground of opposition was that giving to bankers the privilege of issuing paper money , while depriving other classes of the same privilege was Government favoritism of the worst sort , It was this sort of favoritism that bred more discontent among the people than any other thing . Mr. Bryan expressed the opinion that the active dissemination of smallpox among the people of the Nation would be productive of less harm than the granting of this privilege to the banks . The second ground of opposition was that the granting of such a privilege makes the recipient of it an enemy to any law that proposes to abridge or revoke it . Jefferson warned the people against the establishment of paper-money banks , State or national ; Cleveland believed that the ideal ' form of government included the entire divorcing of Government from the issue of paper money . " It is hardly necessary for me to state , " said Mr. Bryan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Government rather than with Cleveland in favor of taking Government out of the issue of money . " He said that Jefferson had expressed the opinion that the existence of private banks of issue would be more dangerous to government than standing armies , in which opinion he fully concurred . " For standing armies , " he said , " can not bring such power to bear upon legislation as can these banks . " The third ground of Mr. Bryan 's opposition was that the Government can not safely give to private corporations the power to control the volume of paper money . He was opposed to any law which gave to banks more power over the fortunes and interests of the people at large than they now possessed . And that , he said , this bill proposed to do . On this point Mr. Bryan said the danger lay in the disposition of the banks to conspire to regulate and fix the volume of paper money for their pecuniary profit . The probability of this course being pursued at any time having been questioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1893 to so affect legislation as to secure the repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sherman law . He mentioned this , he said , as tending to prove that they would conspire with reference to the issue of money when they could do so to their profit . Another objection urged by the speaker was that the notes proposed to be issued would not be legal tender . It was not pretended by anybody that the legal tender quality could be conferred upon these notes , and that he was opposed to the circulation of anything as money that was not legal tender for the payment of all debts . We can not afford to substitute a non-legal tender money for a legal tender , said Mr. Bryan . No one is demanding it , except those of that class who hope to issue the money . That the notes to be issued under the provisions of the bill would not be secure in all circumstances was another objection to the bill in the estimation of Mr. Bryan . He called attention to the action of the Gcvernment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notes of failed banks in that country to the extent of their assets , and asked why the Government which was good enough to make bank notes good in times of adversity was not good enough to issue the notes In time of prosperity . In conclusion , Mr. Bryan called the attention of silver men to what he believed to be the purpose of the bill ? it was simply another step toward the universal adoption of gold monometallism . " You can be deceived if you like , " he said , " but if you are you simply deceive yourself , " The only remedy for the trouble now confronting the country and its citizens , in the opinion of Mr. Bryan , was the restoration of silver to stand beside gold , to return to the constitutional coinage of both gold and silver . Mr. Bryan 's speech closed the day 's discussion , and at 5:10 o'clock the House adjourned until Thursday , Jan. 3 , 1895.                   @ @
