txt Another follower of " Healer " Dowse has died . The latest victim is Mrs. Charles Robinson , who , with her husband , belonged to the Zion Temple . She fell ill about two months ago , but no physician was called . Instead she was visited by J. H. Lagrange , who is an elder in the DOwle congregation . On successive , Sundays large numbers of the healer 's follow- ers Went td see the sick woman , and there were services held in the house . Last night at 7 o'clock she died , and neighbors say that at 9 o'clock an undertaker 's wagon bearing no name carried off the body . Where it was taken the husband refuses to tell . All he will , say is that his wife is dead . The Dowieltes refuse to talk of the case because of the notoriety they have received from the frequent deaths in the congregation .
