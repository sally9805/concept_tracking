txt The re-imposition of tonnage dues on German vessels is understood to be due to a quiet investigation conducted during the past year by Mr. Chamberlain , United States Commissioner of Navigation , who went abroad for that purpose . He found that while the Imperial Government of Germany as a nation did not impose any tonnage duties on American vessels arriving at German ports , the maritime States which compose part of the German Empire do impose such a tax , in violation of the treaty existing between the two countries . The German tonnage tax now being imposed is about 6 1/2 cents per ton , or greater than the tax revoked by the President in his proclamatio# of Jan. 26 , 1888 , and which is now revived . The new proclamation affects all vessels coming from German ports and entering the United States , regardless of the nationality of the vessel . From June 30 , 1888 , to June 30 , 1894 , foreign vessels to the number of 5,000 , with a tonnage of 10,000,000 tons , were exempted from tonnage dues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were American vessels , with only 30,000 tonnage , so it is seen that the President 's action will have but a slightly injurious effect on American maritime in-terests . Prior to 1888 no vessels of the United States were subject to tonnage dues .
