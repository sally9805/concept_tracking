txt By one of the most remarkable accidents in the history of railroads , the " State Express , " No. 46 , of the New York Central and Hudson River Road , south bound , was wrecked , and most of it was thrown into the river a mile south of this place , and fifty-two miles north of New York City , at ten minutes of six o'clock this morning , nineteen persons losing their lives , and nine being seriously hurt . The railroad men know how the tragedy occurred . None of them can offer anything but a general theory of why it occurred .
