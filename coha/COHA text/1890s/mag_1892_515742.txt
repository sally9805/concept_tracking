BY JULIAN RALPH . L HAVE called Montana the Treasure State , and have shown that it is vastly larger than Pennsylvania , with prospectively many times its wealth in minerals and in the variety of its resources . But much that we find promised in Montana is amplified within the territory of Washington . The hopeful inhabitants of the former boldly adopt the motto , " The last shall be first , " as if to say that amid the riches of which they find suggestion and promise all around them , they see for themselves a greater wealth-producing future than is boasted at present by any of the older States . I can not follow them so far . There is a certainty that Washington has more varied resources than Montana , and I think that , with or without irrigation , Washington will support a larger population ; but with both States it is too early for closer comparisons . The vast treasures of precious metals in Montana are sufficiently worked to give as definite a basis for hope as is found in the marvellous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are great areas of thirsty soil whose future is a moot point in Washington , and of which in Montana it is only certain that they yield a good return from their present use as grazing-grounds for cattle . The Evergreen State is a huge block of land . It is as large as New England and Delaware , as Pennsylvania and West Virginia . It contains 69,994 square miles . It is 360 miles wide between the Pacific coast and the Idaho border , and to journey over it from British Columbia southward is to travel 245 miles . It is the most populous of the new States , and its inhabitants outnumber those of Oregon . In 1890 , according to the last cen sus , it contained 349,390 souls , but its people now assert that they number 360,000 . They have suffered some losses in certain cities , or the increase would be from 15,000 to 20,000 greater . The State shows to poor advantage for those who cross it upon the Northern Pacific Railroad , because the route taken by that great and well-equipped line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses a vast reach of usually brown bunch-grass before it plunges into the mazes of the Cascade Mountains and rushes out from them upon the perennially green Pacific slope into the Puget Sound country . But the necessities of railway construction compel a disregard for such choice of territory as would be made by an agriculturist or a sceneryhunting tourist , and , in this case , even the land granted to the railway , alone its route , is in great part very valuable , though its richer parts are not always close beside the rails . Washington is in every material way a grand addition to the sisterhood of States . With the easy and rich fancy of the West , her people say that if you build a Chinese wall around Washington the State will yield all that her inhabitants need without contributions from the outer world . Nevertheless , the Chinese wall they think of oftenest is the true one , and that they wish to break down , for a trade with Asia is a thing dear to their hopes . " If I could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a talented son of Washington , in whose veins the blood of one of our most gifted orators is flowing , " I would make this the richest State west of the Mississippi . I would tell him we wanted the trade of Asia as New York has that of Europe . I would explain to him that we entertain no prejudice against his people , and mean no insult in shutting them out of our territory . I would make it clear to lilin that our dislike is only for his coolies , but that as for his merchants and scientists and scholars-we welcome them , we want them , especially , the merchants . " Now let us look at this great State in detail , keeping in mind that it is by nature divided into two parts by the Cascade Mountains , which bisect it along a line to the westward of the middle of the State . West of the mountains is the seat of the great timber industry of the future . There the land is all heavily timbered except in the bottom-lands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a future source of great wealth , is yet but a small factor . East of the Cascade Range there is smaller , inferior timber , but it cuts a minor figure in the wealth or character of the State , for in the main we have returned to land something like that of the other new States-we are at the end of the plains that have crossed the Rocky Mountains , // and we are again in a bunch-grass country . But in crossing the Rockies the plains have partaken of their character , or rather of the disturbance that produced them . A large area of eastern Washington has been several times overflowed by lava , and it crops out in a disorder that is sometimes abundant in the Big Bend country and in the sage-brush lands . The powder or decay of this lava makes rich land , and where it is driest and most forbidding , the addition of water will turn it into a blooming garden . The Columbia River flows through this country in a deep gorge far below the level of the adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks in the earth , where you may see marked in the side walls eight or ten distinct strata or flows of lava . At the bottom of these " coulees " there is generally good land underlaid by lava . It is used for range land for cattle . For the rest , a great part of eastern Washington is in hills and mountains with valleys between them , with grassy or wooded slopes , profitable always to the fruit-grower , the farmer , or the cattle-man . Gold , silver , copper , lead , and small coal basins are found all over the northern tier of counties . This is part of that extraordinary treasure belt that reaches from the Cascade Mountains across Washington , across the Rockies and Idaho , and far into Montana . It is a vast tract of once-convulsed nature , a sweeping ocean of timbered billows of rock and soil . Where man has scratched the western end of it , and he has nowhere done more than that , is in the Kootenay country , but everywhere its productiveness is thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a marvellous scenic region . For grand desolation , ruggedness , vastness , and primitive wildness , it is unparalleled in our country . Below the ever snow - clad peaks that raise their white heads above the black solitudes of the forests are unnumbered glaciers , some of them even ten or twelve miles long , and many of them a quarter that length . The forests on the west slope of the Cascades are bewildering , stultifying to the mind , in their magnitude and denseness and stupendous individual growths . The entire western slope of the main range is a solid belt of cedar and Douglas fir . There is spruce among the fir , and in the bottoms a little cottonwood and maple , but these lesser woods are unconsidered . The Douglas firs attain a size of from eighteen inches to eight feet in diameter . They shoot MAP OF wAsHINGTON . c ; ez*r-c ' , i**s 4 A *o 20 compteted - coc. , . e* .. Raf2roadsproiectoct . .  --  - // 100 feet in air without putting out a limb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 feet higher , and often more than that . The cedars vary between a foot and a half to fifteen feet in thickness . The larger trees are hollow at the butt for many feet above the ground , but this still leaves from one to three feet of solid timber around each hollow core . Over thousands of square miles upon the forest bed lies the debris of another forest prone upon the ground , as if a tangle of toothpicks from 200 to 300 feet in length had been strewn upon the earth , and through and over this giant lace - work grows the forest of to-day . The roots of the new trees straddle and ride the trunks of the old ones . The fallen firs are rotten , but the cedars are as stout and sound as when they reared their topmost branches beneath the eagle 's path . Amid the dense moist undergrowth the dampness has forced coats of moss upon the prostrate giants . It is a solemn and an awful forest . It might be likened to a graveyard in which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolute silence reigns there , and daylight becomes twilight over the earth . It is a task to see the sky . Far above his head the prospector in those pathless woods sees the wind swaying the tree-tops , and half hears their gentle murmuring , without being sure of the sound . There is no bird life in that oppressive solitude , no animal life , except that now and then a bear is seen . He who would penetrate the forest must be content to make two miles a day in a straight line , and then only by seesawing many miles to and fro , clambering from tree trunk to tree trunk , and patrolling the lengths of what fallen trees lead nearest to the course he would pursue . The forest has only been penetrated by the waterways . The Indians , the most expert canoe-men in the world , know nothing of it . Travel there is only where water takes it . The streams are the roadways , and canoes the red men 's horses . Hunters and prospectors upon the eastern , more lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mountain - goats may be seen feeding close to the glaciers . The wool of these animals is used by the Indians . The skin is clipped close , and the wool is given to the squaws , who card it roughly , and then roll it on their bare thighs with their bare hands . They weave it with rude looms into blankets , and out of the finer yarn they knit stockings and mittens . And now for the pastoral regions of eastern Washington . This table of the production of wheat in the State in 1891 , prepared for the government , will , if the reader consults the map while he studies it , reveal what farming lands are now in use and where they are situated : Counties Acreage .

They are the best that could be obtained as early as last Christmas . The Washington wheat fetched seventy cents a bushel , or about twelve and a half million dollars . The same authority from whom the above figures were obtained is of the opinion that without irrigation-that is to say , outside the lands that must be watered  --  the State will eventually produce between forty millions and fifty millions of bushels of wheat . In a pamphlet issued by the State Board of Trade , and written by President N. G. Blalock , of the Washington World 's Fair Commission , the advantages of the soil and climate for the cultivation of cereals are clearly set forth . The soil is very deep , and is a sedimentary deposit of volcanic origin , made up of a sandy loam , disintegrated basalt , and ash . It is porous , readily takes in and yields moisture , and allows the salts to rise to feed the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly , and where the rains are sufficient , they bring up and mature the grain without its being scorched . This writer has known wheat to be sowed in every month of the year . In the summer the ground is covered with dust thick enough to keep the moisture in the soil underneath . Wheat sowed in the dust between the months of June and September will spring up only after the autumn rains have set in . From September 15th to December 1st is the best time for seeding . There is no neces // sity for haste in harvesting . The wheat need not even be stacked . If left standing it does not suffer . Though the harvesting begins in early July , " the machines are in the field until December , and occasionally the crop is left standing until the following spring . " Thus a man in Washington can cultivate more land than he could in many other States where wheat is grown . The Federal statistics for 1890 showed that Washington 's average yield per acre ( 23.5 bushels ) was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation of the cost and profit of wheat-raising , taking three successive crops that averaged thirty-two bushels to the acre . He found that the labor made it cost nineteen cents a bushel . To this he added interest on the value of the land for two years , and thus brought the cost to twenty-nine cents a bushel . As the crops sold for an average of fiftyfive cents a bushel , he found a profit of eight dollars and twenty-eight cents an acre . These statements , which accord closely with my own deductions from all that I heard on the subject , are so remarkable , and reveal conditions and results so different from any that obtain in most parts of the other new States , that a study of Washington would be incomplete without them . Spokane is the principal city of eastern Washington , and a good point from which to view the agricultural and mineral resources of the lands east of the Cascade Range . It used to be called Spokane Falls , after the falls in the Spokane River , which attracted the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " Falls " in June , 1891 , and Spokane is the city 's full name . Long before its settlement the trails and roads from every point of the compass met there , and seemed to mark it as a natural distributing centre . Eight railroads meet there now . It is a dozen years old as a settlement , and now extends its broad streets and battalions of brick and stone buildings over a considerable part of the bowllike , level-bottomed basin in which it has been built . There are evergreen hills all around it , and upon one slope overlooking the town the well-to-do citizens have massed a considerable number of villas , many of which are both costly and handsome . Milling , the lumber trade , and jobbing in all the necessaries of life are its mainstays , and possibly by the time this is published it will have started up its smeltery to lead the new industry which many think must become its main one when , amid the development of the innumerable mines of eastern Washington , it shall have become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $21,565,000 . Spokane is very enterprising . It has an opera-house that is the finest theatre west of the Mississippi River , and its Board of Trade , under the tireless energy of Mr. John R. Reavis , is incessantly at work to strengthen and enlarge the industries of the city . The place has 25,000 population . It lost 3000 last year as a result of the general monetary depression , but its gains continue , and the agricultural country tributary to it has grown steadily and suffered no set-backs . It trades with 200 towns , and talks with 60 over its telephone wires . Its water - power-having a minimum power of 32,000 horses-runs its electric cars , electric lights , cable-cars , printing - presses , elevators , and all its small machinery . It is not rampant in its vices as most Northwestern cities are . Gambling is done under cover , the variety theatres are closed on Sundays , and there is even broached a proposition to close the saloons on Sunday . In justice to Spokane , I should explain that the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high-toned character of the leading citizens , who embrace a large proportion of Eastern blood , and good Eastern blood at that . Such an explanation is highly necessary here , for in the new Northwest public morality is sometimes regarded as a concomitant of failing business powers . Happily I can vouch for the fact that Spokane society is leavened by a considerable class of proud and cultivated men and women , who live in charming homes , and maintain a delightful intercourse with one another . They make it a very gay city-they and the fine climate  --  and are fond of highbred horses , good dogs , and bright living , with dancing and amateur theatricals , good literature and fun . San Francisco is no longer peculiar in this respect , for Spokane shares her brilliancy among our Western cities . Close to Spokane is the famous Palouse country . The 1,300,000 acres of Whitman County , and 1,000,000 acres of Spokane County form this rich region , which bears various names in its minor exten // sions , but is all alike in its extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants known in the West as " Pikes , " who came in 1844-54 from Missouri , Kentucky , Arkansas , Tennessee , and as far east as the Piedmont region . They were poor whites , and were a tall , angular , drawling band of blond men , lazy and shiftless , but of dauntless courage . They took up the bottom-lands between the rolling , timber-topped hills , beside the streams . In time they were driven to the hills , and then they discovered that more and better wheat could be raised there , without irrigation , than on the bottoms . This Palouse country is about 150 miles long , and averages 30 miles in width . It is said that in summer the soil is covered with a thick dust , and that in place of rain they have heavy dews . It is reputed to grow an extraordinary amount of wheat , and its yield really did reach 30 bushels in 1890 . Wheat , barley , and flax are the great crops , but melons , all vegetables and fruits , both large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anywhere in our country . Berries of every kind , peaches , plums , apricots , apples , pears , and grapes all grow in abundance and of superfine quality . Land fetches $36 an acre , and will soon sell for $50 . Eight hundred thousand acres of it is the rich land of which I speak , and of this 389 ,  - -  000 acres are in cultivation , 320,000 acres being in wheat . The land is all taken up . Farming has been done with small holdings , but moneyed men are now buying large tracts . In Colfax , the main town , the principal loaning brokers report that they know of no single failure there in the payment of interest upon loans last year . Walla Walla County , down in the same corner of the State , ranks next after the Palouse country . Its basaltic soil has been cultivated for forty years , and one farm of that age produced 40 bushels of wheat to the acre last year without fertilizers , of which , by-the-way , not any have ever been used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wheat . They have 200,000 acres under cultivation , all but 50,000 acres being in wheat . Prunes , pears , enormous yields of strawberries , blackberries , and the finest ( because the oldest ) orchards are their most important products after the wheat . Walla Walla , the principal town , bears a name familiar even to the school-boys of 30 years ago . It is the seat of an old army post , is a beautiful town , and boasts a cultivated society . It has 5000 population , and though at one side of the main tide of travel , is growing slowly . It was once the great outfitting point for the mines of Idaho and Montana , and pack trains left there daily . A heap of nonsense is spoken and written about the Big Bend country in order to dispose of it . It is simply a fairly good wheat country , difficult to irrigate , and bound to be uncertain in its products until it is irrigated . How this shall be done is one of the great problems before the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern part of the State . Elsewhere I have spoken of the strata or flows of lava that underlie it . The trouble is that this crops out in fields and bunches all over the region , as we see ice-floes in a harbor at the time of a thaw in the spring . There are pieces of good land between the outcroppings of volcanic rock , and some of these bits of good ground contain as much as twenty square miles of land all covered with grass . It is a high plateau , rolling far above the Columbia , which cuts a cation through it . It has scarcely any other streams , and but few springs . It embraces the two large counties of Lincoln and Douglas . There are in it a million acres of land that can be cultivated . Only a small part is yet so utilized . In 1890 about 80,000 acres in Douglas County and 7000 acres in Lincoln County were under the plough , but it is believed that last autumn ( 1891 ) this sum of cultivated acres was doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps the best chance left in eastern Washington for " the homesteader , " but he must irrigate or be prepared for great uncertainty in his crops . In 1890 the Big Bend wheat lands produced nearly 30 bushels to the acre ; but in 1891 the yield was not over 15 bushels , dryness being the cause . An effort to get artesian water is being made near Water*-ille in Douglas County . If they find water , and it is abundant and not too far underground , the result will promise redempfion to a great belt of soil that is second to none when it has moisture . The problem what to do with the sagebrush country is a greater one . It embraces Adams and Franklin counties , and lies between the Big Bend and the Palouse // regions . It is sage-brush from end to end-nothing but sage and cactus and basalt rock , except that in Adams County there is some good land . The region has a rainfall of only nine inches . It too is all good land if water can be got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great Yakima tract across the Columbia is very promising . Small farmers are rapidly putting it under settlement and cultivation . They are growing fruits , vegetables , and alfalfa , the last to be marketed as hay . Hops also are grown in great abundance , and since this part of the country has not known the hop-louse , and is not damp enough to invite that pest , the outlook for a great hop industry there is most encouraging . The whole Yakima country was divided between railroad and government lands . The latter have been thrown open , and are all taken . The railroad lands were offered for very little before the Northern Pacific company experimented with its admirable schemes for irrigating the soil . Now the farms command high prices , and fetch them so easily that it is predicted that within 25 years Yakima Valley and County will be in as high state of cultivation as any part of the State . The rainfall is only about ten inches a year , and irrigation is necessary . The Northern Pacific Railroad is building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water taken from the Yakima River at a point below that at which the river issues from the mountains . The ditch is an enormous one , and was built at great expense across ravines and all the irregularities of the country . Seventeen miles of it was ready for water in December last . It will moisten thousands of acres that once were purchasable at $1 50 each , but now are held at $45 an acre or more , because no lands in the State will be more productive , if the best judges reason correctly . With the sale of the irrigated lands , stock in the irrigation company is offered , and the scheme is so planned that when the land is all sold , the stock will all be in the hands of the farmers . It is likely that the farmers will then continue to pay water rents , and will divide the profits after the expense of maintaining the ditch and its laterals is defrayed each year . A second canal , 250 feet higher than the present one , is said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from three large lakes on the eastern slope of the Cascades . Thus the highland district of the Yakima country will also be brought under the ditch . This is the most extensive irrigation - work that I know of in the new States . It may not make the Yakima the richest section of eastern Washington , for it may not excel the Palouse or Walla Walla tracts , but it will be highly productive , and uncertainty about crops will be reduced to a minimum . Perhaps time will show the richest land to be in the future clearings of the big timber on the Pacific slope . I have spoken of the prospect of a great yield of hops in Yakima County in the future . The cultivation of hops is a source of large income to the State . The hop was first cultivated in the Puyallup region in 1866 , and with such results that in 1890 the crop was 50,000 bales , about half of which was grown in the Puyallup fields . That crop was marketed for two millions of dollars . The industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Snohomish , and Skagit rivers , all to the westward of the Cascades , at the feet of which rich valleys of alluvial soil of great depth have been formed . Since it is known that one hop-yard in England has been uninterruptedly cultivated for 300 years , there is no reason to look for a wearing out of the rich soil of West Washington . The Washington hops are of a high grade , and the yield , averaging 1600 pounds to the acre , is almost threefold that of the fields of England , Germany , and New York State . The hoplouse has now made its devastating presence felt in western Washington , and must be fought there as it has long been fought elsewhere . On account of this pest the Puyallup yield was reduced to fifty per cent . of what had been expected last year , and since the price was low , it was thought that the revenue from hops would not be above one million dollars . Hops have fetched more than a dollar a pound in the past ; of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To produce them costs less than ten cents a pound in Washington . North of Yakima is the Wenatchee Valley , reaching from the mountains to the Columbia . It is prophesied that this will prove an extremely rich fruit country . And this is measurably true of all the very numerous valleys that seam the mountains west and north of the Columbia , all the way around to Kettle Falls in // the northeast part of the State . Washington is going to be a great fruit State , and the time must soon come when she will do with her fruits as California does with hers- export a great deal , dry a great deal , and can and bottle more . Perhaps the best business done in Spokane to-day is that of handling provisions for the mining camps of Idaho and British Columbia , and fruit is an important factor in these supplies . For a time , as the mining lands are extended , there will be this market for Washington fruits , but the outlook is that the production of fruits will eventually far exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the government and the Northern Pacific Railroad , are just beginning to be settled . As the Great Northern Railroad , which is to give a tremendous impetus to the development of northern Washington , is to pass along that valley , its lands will soon reach their full value . North of the Wenatchee Valley is the great Okanagon country , and east of that is Stevens County , or " the Colville district , " as the miners call it . It is mainly viewed as the scene of future mining activity , and of that we will tell farther on ; but it is all guttered with rich valleys for fruit and vegetable raising , and it is today as fine a sporting region as there is in the United States . In the Okanagon country , west of the Columbia , is Lake Chelan . It Is a beautiful sheet of blueblack water 70 miles in length and from half a mile to three miles in width . It starts at its Columbia River end from a noble bunch-grass valley , already fairly settled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Wilkeson , who is familiar with the country , describes the lake as practically landlocked . Soundings to the length of 700 feet have not touched its bed . Its waters teem with trout of from half a pound to six pounds weight , and of several varieties . Suckers and chubs , and an unclassified fish that attains a weight of 14 pounds , are also plentiful . The lake terminates with an eight-foot waterfall , up which no salmon seem to have swum , for none has been found in the lake . Many creeks empty into the lake , and almost all show the distinct marks of old glacier basins at their heads . In the Stehegan belt these departed glaciers have left their former rocky confines bare , and prospecting is done with a glass , the prospectors scanning the rocks , and easily perceiving the metalhiferous ledges . In the trails or ridges of bowlders left by the melted glaciers are seen masses of galena ore that have been torn from the leads . It is the sight of these that directs the prospectors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ore in these glacial deposits , and doubtless the day will come when it will be worked . In the rugged , wooded mountains that rise precipitously from the lake and wall it in , the mountain-goats are so numerous that they will long provide sport for the hunters . Black-tail deer are plenty , and so are black and cinnamon bear . A packer in that country reports having seen twenty-seven bears in one day last autumn . The grouse there are without number , and include the blue , the gray , and the ruffed varieties . Smaller birds are equally numerous . A hotel - keeper near the lake , wishing to explain why he only charged seven dollars a week for lodging and the luscious fare that weighted his table , said that venison and bear meat only cost a cartridge now and then , and for trout he used the same fish-line that he brought into the country years ago . Mining in Washington , though its promises are vast , is in its veriest infancy . The production of metals is insignificant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners along the Columbia River , and this ground is still worked , by Chinamen now , with trifling results . Recent discoveries have been , first , in the Colville district , Stevens County . It is a mountainous region , an extension of the rich Kootenay country of British Columbia . Silver and lead are found there , but not yet in such large or promising leads as those north of the boundary . Development-work is being done there , the ores are being sent out , and concentraters are building . In the Okanagon country , east of the Cascades and west of Stevens County , silver and gold without lead are found . It is smelting ore , and cheap transportation facilities are needed for the development of the mines . One railroad operator is ready to build from Marcus on the Columbia , north of Colville , along the Kettle River , to the Boundary Creek mines of silver and gold , which show splendid prospects . The Colville Indian Reservation hinders // him from tapping the Okanagon country , and , as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strong movement to have the reservation reduced , and the upper part thrown open . The railroad could be built across it as it is , but there is no money in a railroad on reservation land where settlers may not come nor towns spring up . It is apparent that the reservation must be reduced in response to this pressure , because it is a vast tract , bigger than some large counties in the State , and yet it contains but a thousand red men , remnants of several tribes . The notorious Chief Joseph , who harried several of our generals , is there , and so is Chief Moses , whose people once inhabited the Okanagon country before it was " bought , " and President Grant set aside the Colville Reservation for them . An argument used to help to open this land is that the reservation leaves sixty miles of our frontier unprotected . The Spokane Chamber of Commerce is bending all its energy to the redemption of this border land , and what that body sets out for it generally obtains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argentiferous galena . At least 700 claims have been taken , and this summer 's work will prove the value of the district , though all miners qualified to judge of it express confidence in its great richness . The Stehegan belt of hills , where the ore is found , runs northeast beyond the British border . In addition to the galena , other ores are found , though not yet in sufficient quantities to excite the cupidity of the prospectors . But the belt contains more limestone and white marble than the world can use . It is proposed to build a railroad to Lake Chelan , whereon the ore can be boated seventy miles , and then carried by short rail to the Columbia , and thus to the Great Northern Railroad at Wenatchee . Western Washington is another proposition , as its people would themselves say . All over the Evergreen State inanimate nature would appear to be divided in two parts , so that whatever is not a " proposition " must be an " outfit . " One word or the other applies to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is either a good proposition-that is to say , it has good chances to grow-or it is not . The Nicaragua Canal is a good proposition , and so is the prospective million - dollar hotel in Tacoma . I several voL . LXXXV. - No. 508-60 times heard the word " outfit " applied to men , particularly when they seemed to deserve to be called " queer outfits , " but I never heard the word proposition applied to anything animate . I did hear a waterfall called a " proposition , " however . Up to that time , I confess , I had regarded it as an " outfit . " The chief city in western Washington is Seattle . It has a population of about 40,000 . It is a remarkable city , perhaps the most enterprising one in this country . When the odds against which it has fought are taken into consideration , and when it is understood that its progress has been made against railroad opposition , instead of with the aid of that usually powerful influence , its progress , size , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called the most indomitable and plucky organizers that any city , even in the West , can boast . Seattle is metropolitan . It has that indefinable tone that marks the city from the town , and that when amplified belongs only to the chief city in a State or industrial district . It has the crowds of hurrying men and women , the lounging , staring groups of yokels , the daily battalions of tourists and drummers and strangers generally , bent on selling or buying , and driving about with heavy baggage piled on their cabs ; it has large and fine hotels , theatres of several grades . beer-gardens , and an unduly large vicious quarter on the Pacific coast plan of a myriad little cabins each with one frescoed occupant . It makes the visitor feel that it is a bustling capital town , and that is a character and influence that can not be simulated or made to order . From the harbor Seattle makes an impressive appearance , because it is built on the side of a steep hill , and is uplifted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesser degree all the chief cities of Washington send portions of themselves up steep hill-sides ; and though Seattle is not the city in which I saw cleats on some sidewalks , to make the pavements even more like ladders , its streets are so steep that one feels sorry for the horses of its cab system-which , by-the-way , is the best I know of on this continent outside of Montreal . Towering buildings do not make a city . London has not one steeple of offices within her limits , while Seattle , on the other hand , has many and to // spare . But it is the districts of wholesale stores , whose merchandise and customers crowd one another on the sidewalks , it is the bustle at the depots and wharves , the activity in the harbor-if it is a seaport  --  the flurry of people in the retail quarter ; such are the telltales of a city of importance , and Seattle has them , and has kept them in a great degree after the financial crash in London , which disturbed the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in them an effort was making to reverse the natural order of things by which territorial development creates city extension . Seattle 's jobbing trade in 1890 was in goods of the value of $35,000,000 . The town is strengthened by neighboring coal mines , has built up a large shipping trade , and boasts several manufacturing industries . Since the above was written new despatches from there tell of the discovery of slavery among the Japanese in Seattle . The slaves are the women in the singular rows of one-story cottages by the waterside in what is locally known as Whitechapel - the vicious quarter . In that strange district and still stranger community are women from Mexico , China , Japan , and France , as well as American blacks and white women . The police say that of them all the Japanese are the least troublesome , since they alone refrain from adding theft to their other outlawry . It is more than likely , as the news despatches relate , that they are owned by men who purchased them of their parents in Japan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appear to lend themselves . The " tough end " of Seattle , as the Western vernacular would have it called , is very much like the pestilential parts of Butte and Helena , and all the other Northwestern towns of considerable size of which mention has been made in this series , but it is livelier than most others , in addition to having the most motley population . It is said to be well under police control , and I was told that the gambling there is abovestairs , and not too public . Tacoma , an hour and a half away by water , and also on the sound , seems a substantial town . It has great wealth , and is the financial , though not the trading or popular centre . It has about 35,000 population . Its homes seem to me the proudest possessions of Tacoma . Separate dwellings of tasteful design , and costing from $3000 to $20,000 , are to be seen there in great numbers , and I am told that the proportion of still less costly cottages owned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cityany city anywhere-might well be proud to show a club-house like that in Tacoma , wherein the most perfect taste prevails throughout . The city is the seat of a large circle of wealthy and cultivated folk . Though the place is nothing like so showy as Seattle , it has shown great enterprise  --  a force which there has always felt the backing of a great transcontinental railway . Some of the capitalists are building a floating dry-dock 325 x 100 feet in diruensions , and to be extended by smaller docks of the same sort , so that almost any vessel on the Pacific can be handled upon it . Tacoma has hopes of being at the eastern end of a transpacific line of steamers at an early day , and of being the seat of the iron industry which must certainly spring up somewhere on the coast . What Tacoma is most sure of is that she is at the end of a great railway line , and that she is at the gate of , and indeed is surrounded by , a very rich country , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not mentioned the electric lights , electric cars , water systems , and such modern conveniences in speaking of either of these chief cities . It would be an omission due to familiarity with the entire new West if I failed to say explicitly that almost wherever one may travel in that country the same conveniences are at hand that one is accustomed to finding in New York . If there is a difference , it is that the West is the more progressive , and the more quickly takes up whatever is good as well as new . Seattle has cable as well as electric cars , but all the cities have the latter sort of vehicles . The traveller who steps from the newest Pullman car on the Northern Pacific Railroad suffers no jar when he is in such hotels as the Tacoma , the Rainier or Denny in Seattle , or the Fairhaven in the hopeful little city of that name , near the head of the sound . Appointed with that most artistic furniture in the world which is turned out of Michigan factories as pins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights and calls , offering great public rooms richly decorated and // draped , with French cooks , with the best food in the markets of the world ( refrigerated and whirled from place to place ) , the hotels of Washington are in the same list with the leading hotels of London and New York . Need I say that the same is true of the public schools ? That also goes without saying in any study of the West . The State of Washington expended $932,000 for its free schools last year . The steamboats that ply between Seattle and Tacoma and up and down the sound are also unexcelled . One called The Flyer is the most admirable vessel of its kind that I have ever seen . It is of the build of a fish , and is almost as swift . Its two saloons , one above the other , are carpeted , and provided with soft plush-covered reclining-chairs . The walls are , to all intents and purposes , plate-glass . The machinery is exhibited like jewelry , in a glass case . By day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers ; by night the little Flyer is all aflame with electric light , like a glass boat or a lantern shot over the water from a cannon . These boats are not the prettiest products of the Pacific slope , because nothing animate or inanimate can be more beautiful than the women there . I will not commit myself to a decision whether it rains there six months in the year , as I think , or all the year around , as the critics of that country insist ; but the effect of that warm , soft , moist climate upon the complexions of the women is magical - is worth going to see . The effect upon the ladies ' gowns of one of the concomitants of the rainy season , as the wearers climb and descend the muddy hills of those cities , is not nearly so admirable . If ever Mistress Fashion will permit dress reform to be undertaken by women , it will be hailed with joy on the shores of Puget Sound . But with regard to the beauty of the women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women of the interior insist that the Puget Sound belles all have web-feet , the result of the frequent wet weather on the coast . The reader may judge from that how captivating the coast women must be . Western Washington comprises nearly one- third of the State . It contains 25,000 square miles west of the Cascades , as against eastern Washington 's 45,000 square miles . Through a part of this western end of the State , tearing a great mouth in it , is Puget Sound . It is a majestic harbor , and no one who sees it can criticise its human neighbors for the store of hope they rest upon its future . It has a superficial area of 2000 square miles , a shore line of 1600 miles , an average depth of 70 fathoms , and , lying north and south 90 miles back from the ocean , it is all within the State . Its first surveyor , in 1841 , reported to the government : " I venture nothing in saying that no country in the world possesses waters equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of navigation , 200 miles inland , not a shoal nor reef nor hidden danger exists . At times it narrows to a river 's width , and again widens into the majesty of a sea , but is everywhere free to navigation , the home of all craft , blue , deep , and fathomless . " The quotation is hackneyed , but it describes this wonderful body of water better than any other words that can be chosen . Yet it but helps to distinguish an equally wonderful country  --  a country with the climate of England , and better than the best qualities of California and Florida . I have described its amazing forests of giant timber . They cover the greater part of it . It is said that they contain two hundred billion feet of marketable wood . It is very valuable wood . It will continue to supply the country when all other timber is gone . For a long while the great stringers used in the flooring of the Pullman and Wagner cars have come from these forests , and a shrewd railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cedar stumps that the lumbermen have left standing in the present clearings he can build the walls and roofs of freight cars that will pay for themselves in three years in the saving of weight . The Washington timber competes with Georgia pine and Eastern oak in the uses to which those woods are put . Lumbering is the chief industry in western Washington , but it is small to what it must be when reduced rates are brought about by competing transcontinental railroad companies and by the Nicaragua Canal . This lumber has already found good markets in South America , China , France , Australia , and the Sandwich Islands . The coal measures of the Puget Sound basin come next in importance . The coal and the iron , which is also abundant , lie side by side . Limestone is also found , and // although practically nothing has been done with the iron , some most excellent coking coals have been found , and the happy combination must soon prove alluring to capital and enterprise . The coal supply seems inexhaustible , and already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it will soon be to Fairhaven and other ports near the coal beds . All the coal of the coast , including that at Nanaimo , on Vancouver Island , may be classed as lignite , but it is often of so high a grade that the operators do not greatly strain the truth in classing it as bituminous . The Seattle coals do not make coke or gas , but are excellent for general domestic use and steam-making . Large mines are being opened in the Skagit country west of the mountains . The coal lies in the cretaceous measures , and is in dipping seams of from four to eighteen feet of clean coal . Farther down the river are the Fairhaven mines , opened by the Great Northern Railroad Company and by Montana capitalists . All this Skagit coal makes a coke that is held to be only second to the Connellsville ( Pennsylvania ) coke , if it is not fully as good . Coking ovens are being erected , and a large market in California , Mexico , and South America is looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound steamboats , is superior to the Nanaimo product . The South Prairie coal , near Tacoma , makes a fine coke that is used in a smeltery at the latter place . There are mines and coke ovens at Wilkeson also . The coal product of the State in 1890 was nearly a million tons , worth at the mines $2,203,755 . When it is known that California has but little coal , and only of an inferior quality , and that Oregon is but slightly better off , the value of the superabundant coal measures of Washington will be understood . Then again , the Washington coke will displace the Eastern and English material on the coast . At San Diego these other cokes are received for distribution among the smelteries of northern Mexico , New Mexico , and Arizona at $13 a ton ; indeed , they are sold in Victoria , British Columbia , at $20 a ton . Capital is needed to take hold of the iron . There is talk of iron and steel works near Seattle , the enterprise of Eastern men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in the making of steel bars , plates , and rods from imported blooms , as is done in San Francisco . In time , whether these projects rise or fall , fortunes will be made from the iron industry in that new country . Asbestos is plenty ; and there are clays that must yet be the foundation not only for rude wares , but for good white ware . Sewerpipe is already made in Seattle . The reader sees that all the resources are practically in embryo . In spite of the fact that the first settlements in the east and west were in the forties , the State is nearly as new , so far as all except its farming is concerned , as if the date of its admission to Statehood - November 11 , 1889-were the date of its first settlement . Whoever passes along the main retail street of Seattle and happens to notice the counters in the principal fish store will be astonished . In the chromatic display of the captive creatures of the sea is the text for another chapter on future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that catch is credited to Oregon and Alaska . There are in the northern waters cod banks thousands of miles in extent ; halibut , codfish , rock-cod , sole , sea-bass , smelts , shrimps , herrings , and oysters are all abundant . Apparently the fisheries outweigh those of the East as the timber belt excels that which once enclosed the Great Lakes . Candor compels me to say that the Pacific fish , with one exception , are inferior to the same kinds of fish in the East , yet they are not wanting in fine qualities . The halibut of Washington and the North is , I believe , the finest sea fish for the table that is known in America . The tiny muddy oysters , the size of a dime or a quarter , are the meanest product of that sea , but they find a ready sale and are admired . Since that is so , hope for all the rest should be rampant . Their crabs , on the contrary , are not mere samples ; they are wholesale products , regular marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make good food . The fishing that must in a few years fleck the waters of the Pacific with sails is scarcely begun . There is only a million invested in it , and only a million a year is produced by it . The new transcontinental railroads that are expected to cross to Puget Sound  --  the Great Northern and a spur of the Union Pacific-are thought to be going to work wonders . They will find many present industries controlled by the older companies . They will encourage the de // velopment of new industries and the extension of others . Mr. Hill 's road , the Great Northern , is to be pushed through the mountains in what is described as a scenic wonderland . " It is thought that Fairhaven will be its terminus ; but whether that prove true or not , a feeder all along the sound , at right angles to the main road , will tap all the country between the Cascades and the great harbor . And what of the land which these railroads will open up ? What of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name to the State-it is evergreen . Roses , nasturtiums , and chrysanthemums may be seen blooming in the gardens the year around . The ocean , and especially the Japan current , keep the climate equable . The mercury seldom rises above 900 in the summer , and to see it at zero in the winter is to see an extraordinary thing . The rains produce semi - tropical abundance of vegetation . Agriculture cuts a small figure yet , but where it is carried on , in the valleys and reclaimed marshes , oats grow higher than a man 's head , and so does timothy . Oats will run from 60 to 100 bushels to the acre . Men have been known to make more than $800 from an acre of strawberries . If good land is chosen , and a market is handy , five acres will support a family well . Raspberries , currants , gooseberries , orchard fruits , all do well . There are some who think the sound country may yet supply the whole United States with prunes , so fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown there . Tobacco does well ; and , by-theway , it is being grown and made into cigars in the Yakima country , in East Washington . Wherever the big timber is cleared - and many of the farms are abandoned logging camps-there is found the richest soil imaginable . It raises hay , potatoes , oats , barley , wheat , hops , cherries , apples , berries , and all which that list implies . It is a natural grazing land . The grass is forever green , and cattle and sheep keep " hog-fat all the year . " East of the sound the land that can be farmed is practically all taken , but west of the sound is the great Olympic Peninsula , until lately almost uninhabited , and even now but little known . It has not been surveyed . Out of the heart of it rise the eternally snow - clad Olympic Mountains . On their sides roam the elk , black bear , cougar , and other more or less noble beasts . Over the earth is a mass of timber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and white cedar are in the woods , and in the many waters wild-fowl abound . Frost is said not to know the country . On the Pacific coast side are many valleys , and some small prairies . In this absolutely new country the homesteaders are appearing in such numbers that it is said that between 700 and 800 settlers went in there last year to pre-empt the lands along the streams and on the prairies . There , entirely cut off from the world , they will wait until the lands are surveyed , and they can file their claims . They believe that a railroad from Gray 's Harbor or Shoalwater Bay to the strait of Juan de Fuca will soon be built past all their holdings . It is likely , for , in addition to the timber , that is the best dairy country in the State . As one citizen put it , " They have more rain than we on the east of the sound , but the presence of water has never yet been considered an objection in the dairy trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in western Washington is whether it is possible for both Seattle and Tacoma-lying so near one another as they do  --  to become great cities ; and if not , which will eventually become the chief and gigantic seaport whose development is so confidently looked for . I wish I could say . Indeed , since everywhere that I travel I find these rivalries between neighboring cities ( Bismarck and Mandan , Rapid City and Deadwood , Helena and Butte , and so on through the list , which rightly begins with St. Paul and Minneapolis ) , I find myself constantly wishing that I could postpone the publication of these numbers of HARPER 'S MAGAZINE for a trifling term of ten or a dozen years , so as to avoid this series of conundrums . In this case , in western Washington , there is a little speck upon the horizon . It calls to mind the small black cloud that shows itself in all wellregulated nautical tales as the herald of frightful disaster . It may be a hurricane or only a teacupful of wind . It is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief to Seattle , Tacoma , and Fairhaven , along with all the other points on Puget Sound . It is on the Pacific coast , on the front of the Olympia peninsula , only four hours from Portland by rail , and very much // nearer to Asia , Nicaragua , and Europe by water than the sound ports . South Bend is a yearling , and where it rubs its juvenile eyes the map shows only the words Shoalwater Bay , but that , being a libellous name , is now changed to Willapa Harbor . It is 57 miles north of Astoria , and is said to be a harbor of the first grade , variously credited with offering 29 to 32 feet of water at its bar . It is the only generally useful harbor between the Columbia River and the strait of Juan de Fuca . South Bend is about to be connected with the Northern Pacific Railroad system . In the region tributary to it is an extraordinary wealth of timber and of agricultural lands . The founders of the town insist that if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other port in the State can compete with it , since vessels from Puget Sound ports must double the Olympia peninsula before they reach the point at which South Bend shipments begin . South Bend is several hundreds of miles nearer to San Francisco , Nicaragua , and Cape Horn than any Puget Sound port . But it is too early to say more . The best possession of the new little seaport thus far is that essence which was deserted by all its companions in Pandora 's box . With a mention of those considerable islands in the Northwest which are , from a military point of view , the key to the British possessions in the North , we must end this view of the forty-second State in the Union . Of the islands , be it known that they are thinly wooded , but rich for agriculture . Sheep are raised there in great numbers , and more wool than they grow is shipped to the mainland , smuggled over from Vancouver Island . Smuggling wool , opium , and Chinamen are profitable callings up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the seat of a great lime deposit that is of considerable value , and is already marketed all along the coast . There is a peculiar feature of the affairs of Washington upon which I have not dwelt . The critics of the State think it an important element , but I can not see that it cuts any figure in the future of the great commonwealth . It seems to some critics as if several regiments of our nomads , who keep moving West in the belief that they " must succeed there because they failed in the East , " are gathered in this last of the States , principally at its jumping-off edge , in the cities on Puget Sound . Town-site gambling is what attracted these persons . The booming of new towns , that vice which swept the Northwest like an epidemic , ran all along the Pacific coast . The snap of the whip took place at its end in southern California , but the whole of what they up in Washington call " the sound country , " felt the strain and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect us to develop our soil or our mines , said a leading spirit in one city , " when we could buy a town lot on one day , and four days afterward could sell it for fifty dollars more a front foot than we gave for it . " And that is true . Wiser behavior was not to be expected where , after all , a great many persons went at first rather to make money than to- establish homes and found families . The fever for town-lot gambling has abated , and we can look back on it as an episode . It must have raged marvellously , for before it ended some cities were far overbuilt . This was not peculiar to Washington ; it was the case from Vancouver , in British Columbia , all the way down to southern California . A cruel but useful reaction came , and now one hears little more about the matter . The talk now is of smelteries and furnaces , of the possibilities of the trade with Asia , of the blessed prospects of new railroads from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the sound  --  a very likely town , now that it too has lived* down the epidemicand I heard of only one boom in progress ; that was in the " city** of Everett , which was pluming itself upon the hope that a certain boating company was to put up works there for the building of vessels to carry petroleum to the Orient or somewhere ; but I passed many dead boom towns , extinct volcanoes , so to speak , and they were often wonderful to look at . They were , for the most part , mere acres of stumps , clearings hastily made in the forest , with suggestions of streets and avenues laid out at right angles among the stumps , and dotted at long and irregular intervals with cabins , frame saloons , and perhaps a brick building or two-all rendering the scene the more confused and unkempt . We have seen something of the scramble for public lands in the other States ; the companion picture in Washington // was this mania for town sites  --  or rather for city sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it is nothing at all . Some of the greatest corporations in the State  --  the railroads-were not above setting the example . Sometimes it was a railroad which , as a corporation , essayed to " boom " a tract of land on its route  --  a terminal station , a divisional point , or a junction . Sometimes one of these corporations would strain not only to " boom " a city of its own creation , but to crush or cripple a near-by town which had grown up without leave . It is as interesting a chapter as any in our new history , that which tells of how the planning and sale of new towns goes on in these new States ; I now refer to what may be called the ordinary and customary method , such as obtained before the thing became a craze , and such as will obtain as long as there are virgin districts for men to rush in upon . Suppose a number of fine " leads " of ore are struck in any new neighborhood , the town-site man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build towns in the older States , wherever towns were needed , but in the new Northwest the speculator is up earlier than nature . Men have to nudge the slow old dame along out there . They note where the new mining prospects are , and then they look up the most likely town site . Often its natural position is self-evident ; it is at the head of the valley below the mountains , or it is where two streams join . The capitalist " locates " the spot , and goes home for friends , relatives , and employees to claim homestead or timber lands where he wants the town to be . They make their claims . He sets up a store and post-office ; a hotel also , if he has the means . He employs some of the squatters ; the others go away , and only come back to " prove up . " He pays them a hundred dollars each or two hundred dollars for their trouble , and they turn over their land to him . In one case that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and determined to hold on to the land they had pre-empted . That is considered the next worse thing to horse-stealing out West . Fancy , if you can , how society could exist were such men common ! The theory and policy are to this effect , that a man shall accept for such services what sum will repay him for the trouble he has been put to , without computing the value of his services or of his claim to the land baron who employs him . But suppose that all works smoothly , as it usually does . The capitalist establishes his store , has one of his clerks empowered as recorder and notary , and opens a hotel . The miners come the second year to do that " improvement-work " which the law requires that they shall perform each year in order to keep their titles to their claims . They need giant - powder for blasting ; they need picks and shovels and barrows ; they need food , tobacco , and rum . They gravitate to the only place at which these commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets up a shop , perhaps a saddle-maker comes several saloon-keepers equip their establishments , a few painted women order shanties put up , and a " hurdy-gurdy " ( dance-house ) or variety show is started . The transition from wilderness to town is rapid and wonderful . The founder asks all he can get for his lots , and coins money like a mint . His customers stop at the hotel and gamble with the building lots they have bought . The revised maps contain the name of another city , usually called " So-and-so City , " or " Such-andsuch City , " in order that there shall be no mistake about its really being a city . When it is carried to an excess , townlot and town-site gambling hinder the development of a region and bring together a great many unscrupulous and irresponsible men ; but in the State of Washington , in the presence of the vast and varied resources of the soil , the mountains , and the waters , the epidemic that brought communal tragedy elsewhere can here be called only an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem to share with all the others many of their greatest resources , as if it were the essence and epitome of them all . If it is not " the last which shall be first , " it is the one in which we see the summing up of all the rest . A sweeping glance over it , in the mind 's eye of one who knows it well , is like the transformation scene at the end of a Christmas pantomime , wherein we see gloriously some hint of all that went before-of all the climates , forests , metals , fruits , cereals , and vegetables of our entire country ; of the men of all the world , the fishes of both oceans . But the scenes that are hurried along the grooves were never hung before a paint bridge . They are real .
