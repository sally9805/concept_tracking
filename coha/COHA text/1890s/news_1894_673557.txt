txt There are indications that the real measure of protection given to the combined refiners of sugar by the revised sugar schedule was not perceived by certain Democratic Senators for some time after the revision was made , and that the protective effect of the ad valorem rate is not understood by some of them even now- We showed yesterday that even a prominent Republican Senator , looking for everything he could use against the Democrats of the committee , had not seen this protection , which should be added to the specific protective duties of one-eighth and one-tenth of a cent . A short debate in the Senate upon this point , a few days ago , ? showed that Mr. Harris then supposed that the refiners ' protection in the revised schedule was limited to the one-eighth of a cent on all refined sugars and the one-tenth additional upon refined sugars from Germany . But it also showed that the real measure of the refiners ' protection was clearly seen by the Republican minority . We quote from The Congressional Record the report of the remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I wish to ask the Senator is whether he thinks it wise or unwise to reduce from a half cent to oneeighth of a cent per pound the protection on refined sugar given to the refiner , or the Sugar Trust , as the Senator is pleased to say , by the law , for which the Senator voted ? " Mr. Platt  --  The pending bin does no such thing . " Mr. Harris  --  Then all the experts who have mathematized the proposition are wide of the mark , and the Senator from Connecticut alone knows how it is . " Mr. Platt ? I am not alone , Mr. President . There is not a man connected with the Sugar Trust , as a stockholder or speculator in New-York , who does not understand it ; there is not a Senator who has demanded it on this floor who does not understand it . The duty as it stands under the bfil will not be less than three-eighths of 1 cent , and it will fluctuate , according to the price of sugars , from three-eighths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Senator from Iowa , Mr. Allison , whom we regard as our Chairman of the Committee on Finance , to know if I am out of the way in this statement . " Mr. Allison ? I do not wish to enter into the discussion of the sugar clause at this time , but by the ad valorem provision in the bill and the great difference between the value of raw sugar and refined sugar there is on the average importations of sugar a protection of certainly three-tenths of a cent before you reach the one-eighth of a cent . * * * The raw sugar pays an ad valorem duty . The average on raw sugars , as stated by those who are familiar with it , is now , say , 02 ? , costing from 21/2 to 2% cents per pound in Cuba and elsewhere where it is purchased . Now , granulated sugar , which is the refine sugar , sells in London and Hamburg all he time at 31,4 cents a pound . So , as a rule , taking the average , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw sugar and the refined . That being true , 40 per cent . on the raw sugar as compared with 40 per cent on the refined sugar will make a difference of three-tenths of a cent a pound at least " Mr. Platt and Mr. Allison were right and Mr. Harris was wrong . Before the revision was made it could be said truthfully that the bill reduced the Sugar Trust 's protective duty from one-half of a cent ( in the tariff ) to oneeighth of a cent , but as the bill stands now the refiners ' ? protection is almost onehalf of a cent , or 50 cents per hundred . We estimated it yesterday at 47% cents per hundred . Remarks made by Mr. Vest in reply to those of Mr. Allison ( quoted above ) show that he , as well as Mr. Harris , at that time supposed that the protective duty was confined to the oneeighth and the additional one-tenth , and had overlooked the protection of at least one-quarter ( or 25 cents per hundred ) I ' concealed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement given to the press by Secretary Carlisle on the 80th ult. indicates that he also had failed to perceive the protection afforded by the practical operation of the ad valorem duty . H3 was interested only in the question whether the proposed ad valorem rate of 40 per cent . on raw sugars was equal to the specific duties on such sugars that had been provided in the sugar schedule originally reported , and he appears to have supposed . that the measure of protection to the refiners had not been appreciably changed , because that pgoteetiOn had been about one-eighth of a cent in the committee 's first schedule and the revisers had substituted a specific differential of just one-eighth , with a , contingent one-tenth . But Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Harris and Mr. Vest and all the other Senators must see now that to the clearly-expressed protective . duty of one-eighth plus one-tenth ( or 22% cents per hundred ) there is added by the operation of the ad valorem rate at least one-quarter ? ( or 25 cents per hundred . ) Mr. Allison says three-tenths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as much as that , or even more , but it , is not less than 25 cents , or 47 cents in all ,
