txt Brooklyn has a very good chance this year to judge of the relative fitness of three candidates for Mayor . The office , thanks to the excellent Brooklyn charter , is one requiring the highest grade of ability and character . Each of the regular party machines has done its best to supply a candidate with the requisite , qualifications . The Republican machine , being pretty rickety through the bad management , ignorance , and treachery of the chief engineer , " JAKEY " WORTH , turned out the less desirable product . Had it been in decent condition , Mr. SCHIEREN would have been nominated . Had it been in really good condition , a flitch stronger man would have been named . The best it could do was WURSTER , who is a very poor representative of what there is good in the Schieren administration and only too good a representative of what is bad . He makes the impression wherever he appears of a weak man , quite . incapable of resisting the bosses of his party even to the extent that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little better . Mr. GROUT is a man who has done much good work for the city and has been  --  not very firmly or loyally , but still has been  --  associated with the reform movement in his own party . He is making an active personal canvass , and is working his reform antecedents to the exclusion of the claims of the regular organization . He appears to be about the stature of the average candidate for Mayor , stronger far than Mr. BOODY , but not nearly so able as Mr. CHAPIN . He is a much better man than the machine would have chosen had it been entirely free to choose , but it Is fair , we think , to say that he gives no evidence of especial native force , either mental or moral . He certainly does not arouse confidence in his fighting powers , or that they could successfully cope with the men to whom he owes his nomination . Mr. SHEPARD , on the contrary , is distinctly superior in intellectual capacity and in moral stamina to Mr. GROUT , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid , and what he says is not only obviously sincere , but is the fruit of careful study and mature reflection . He approaches all questions from the point of view of intelligent public spirit , and discusses them with impartiality , thoroughness , and breadth , and with as near an approach to impersonality as could be conceived . For the first time in their experience the people of Brooklyn find a candidate for Mayor who completely appreciates the serious magnitude and difficulty of the administration of their great city , and who treats the problem as one of statesmanship . It is really nothing less , and in some respects it is more complex and trying than the tasks with which statesmen have to deal , because it is more novel , subject to less definite principles , and with but inadequate precedents . It would be a fortunate thing for Brooklyn if enough of its citizens should have the sense to cut loose from party ties , which can have nothing whatever to do with their city affairs , to elect Mr. SHEPARD . It would place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open up a future of which every intelligent citizen could be proudly hopeful .
