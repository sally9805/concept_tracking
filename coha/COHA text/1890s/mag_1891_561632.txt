txt THE article on " The Brutal Sex " in the January number of THE REVIEW is so frank in its pessimism , and so bold in its statements with regard to a subject about which we all think , but seldom speak , that it should not be allowed to pass unchallenged . The writer of it begins his arraignment of his brothers by distinguishing between the kindred qualities of brutality and cruelty , assigning the former to man and the latter to woman . I have no objection to this generalization , though , admitting cruelty to be the " attribute of weakness " and brutality " the vice of strength , " we need not go far to find members of the sterner sex who display towards the weaker vessels what the writer in question considers to be the exclusively feminine prerogative , or to discover proofs that , as the women of the French Revolution have demonstrated to us , the weaker vessels may on occasion overstep the barrier which distinguishes the cruel from the brutal . Besides , he evidently forgets that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned . " However , I would not for a moment maintain that women are as brutal as men , though their latent capabilities may be as great , but would simply consider the ground on which the critic rests his belief that men have predminent claims to being regarded as the sex of which the predominant characteristic is that of the brute . This he finds in the attitude of man towards women . " Think for a moment , " he says , " what is implied in the single fact that in no part of the world is it deemed safe for a woman to go alone after dark , nor , in many localities , by day even . " The reason for this " fact , " according to him , is that woman " fears that , if unattended , some man will seek to rob her of her honor . " But is it true that " in no part of the world is it deemed safe for a woman to go alone after dark " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immaterial to consider whether it be true of her In other countries , as one exception to this sweeping statement is sufficient to destroy its force . And admitting that woman fears to go out alone after dark , is her fear due to a dread of being robbed of her honor ? Surely no American woman of average independence and intelligence , in a decentlyprotected community , thinks that a walk abroad at night is not " safe " for her , though she may consider it imprudent as a defiance of conventionality or as running the risk of being mistaken for one of that large class of women who are to be found in cities and who have a purpose in being seen alone at a time when the majority of their sisters are " protected . " But the assertion that the " unprotected woman " in a large community fears that she will be // 246 " robbed of her honor " if she ventures out under the night shades belongs to the category of the grotesque . The modern man may not be any better in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravishers of the Sabine women , who , in spite of their wickedness , had the grace , not common among our Don Juans , of marrying those whom they seized , or than the savage Tartars , " strong only to destroy " ; but he is a discreet creature , and , knowing well that " swift retributive justice " which falls upon those who do not their sinning as well as their praying in private , wisely refrains from that wholesale robbery of women 's honor which this critic would fain make us believe may be practised upon those indiscreet females who venture out at night . lie has a strong enough case against " the brutal sex " without yielding to the temptation of misinterpreting and exaggerating facts to make it stronger than the truth admits it to be . Another manifestation of our author 's tendency to exaggerate facts is his statement with regard to the attitude of men toward women , which he defines thus : " Briefly and plainly , it is that man 's physical welfare requires for its maintenance the moral ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no need for any one to dwell on this unpleasant statement in order to prove the absurdity of the fact implied in it . It is interesting chiefly because it probes the heart of the social evil and suggests one of the possible reasons why society has thus far been unable to cope with it . The tacit assumption in the minds of a large proportion of men-I can not add those of even a small quota of women , for I doubt if there is on record an acceptance by a woman of the theory that the social evil is a necessary evilthat a certain proportion of women in every generation , like Carthage of history , must be destroyed for man 's bestial gratification , is , I believe , one o* the greatest obstacles with which the social-reformer has to contend in his war against immorality . Many men who believe that the " modern Babylons " are essential to the physical welfare of men hold a belief kindred to it in the natural powerlessness of a large portion of their kind to restrain their lower instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend , the maintenance of them . Assuming both of these beliefs to be false , how are they to be disproved in the minds of men ? Deep-rooted as they are , clinging , as they do , like innate prejudices in the very warp and woof of their mental structures , and strengthened by their passage through generations , are they to be destroyed by argument ? The arguments of nineteen Christian centuries have been powerless to shake them ; and can we expect to do in a day what the combined years of our ancestors failed to effect ? Assuming , on the other hand , that we must have our modern Babylons , it is interesting to ask why we must have them . Here we meet the social problem face to face . God made man and woman for each other  --  to be united at maturity in the holy bonds of marriage . Can we say that God 's design  --  or nature 's design-is followed out by the men and women of to-day ? Most men are matured and fit candidates for marriage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom do we hear of marriages of men and women at these ages ! Our social conditions have run counter to nature 's conditions , and it is not surprising that evil consequences should arise from the collision , and that one of these consequences should be the existence and the flourishing of social vice . There is no better way to prevent widespread violations of the marriage law than by marriage . Unhappily the youth of the present day can not afford to choose a mate at the time when it is natural that he should seek one . Consequently it is not remarkable that rebellious // 247 nature should lure him into those narrow paths leading from nature 's path , which is broad enough , but from which he is " banned and barred . " The maiden of to-day , too , frequently waits long after the mating-season for her mate to seek her . She must wait till he comes , and he comes perforce , if at all , sadly late . To those who hold up their hands in horror at " the shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why are you surprised by it ? Let us thank God that it is not worse . " The author of " The Brutal Sex " reiterates the old charge against society , that it shows unfairness in condemning immorality in men and condemning women for it . " We forgive the one class , " he says , " readily enough , or even deny the need of the exercise of forgiveness : the other class we refuse to respect , if we be men , or if we be women , we refuse to forgive . " I believe that if we could investigate the origin of most popular beliefs , whether they be true or false , they would be *ound to have sprung , if not from a truth , at least from that which had in it elements or the semblance of truth . In the popular horror of fallen women , and the belief that the sin of impurity is greater in woman than in man , there is far more truth than falsity , and on this truth , which so many modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests the stronghold of morals . Woman is in a sense the repository of morality . She guards the doors of virtue . So long as she is faithful to this charge , society is safe ; as soon as she is unfaithful to it , she corrupts not only herself , but posterity . The physical conditions of the sexes would alone make woman 's purity of more vital consequence to herself and to the world , even though other considerations did not contribute to this end . When a man sins , he defiles himself alone ; but when a woman forgets her honor , a whole family-nay , a whole generation , sometimes even a whole nation-may share the consequences of her shame . Once degraded , she can never regain the physical , even though she may regain the moral , purity which she has lost . This may seem a coarse and a material way of putting her case , but is it not the true one ? And , being true , is it not fitting , as her crime is greater than man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should suffer accordingly ? The social evil , great as is the danger to morality which attends a public discussion of it , is one that cries out for reform . We can not say of it with Hamlet , " Oh , reform it altogether , " for experience of the past has shown us that it will not be reformed altogether . But we can at least endeavor to seek out the causes of it and reform these as best we may . Silence with regard to immorality has ceased to be a virtue ; and we are beginning to see that it does not necessarily indicate on the part of those who practise it a fine moral sense , as we once supposed that it did . But when we lift the veil which hides the modern Babylons from our gaze , let us try to see the facts presented to us as they are ; not exaggerate or belittle them , but meet them squarely and try to solve the problems with which they confront us . JOHN II . BARRY . A REPLY TO MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the January number of THE REVIEW , takes the same view as Mr. Balfour and Mr. Morley did in former numbers of the effects of Mr. Gladstone 's Irish land acts . All are mistaken , and very gravely mistaken , in their conception of the legal effects of the acts in question . They seem to think that Irish landlords are mere rent-chargers , with thie // *PRE NORTH AMPRICAN RE ViE W* difference in favor of the rent-payer : that he can get the annuity reduced from time to time . With Mr. Lecky 's historical retrospect I decline to deal . I do not think that it has the degree of relevancy to the conclusions summed up in the last four paragraphs that premises and conclusions are required to possess . But he is an authority in political philosophy , as Mr. Morley is in statesmanship , and as Mr. Balfour ought to be . I think it only fair that the American public should be disabused of the ideas , exceedingly erroneous indeed , which the papers of these gentlemen are calculated to impress upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the legal effects of Mr. Gladstone 's land legislation , which , I apprehend , will account for much that puzzles fair-minded men with regard to the agrarian agitation in Ireland . It must first be understood that not all agricultural tenants come within the purview of the land acts ; that there areten classes of tenants " specially excepted " from their operation , and that the lands of the tenants so excepted are by far the most valuable lands in the country . The land legislation was passed to protect the weaker class of tenants on the inferior lands-that class who could not be supposed to enter into their so-called contracts with any freedom . If Mr. Lecky had read Mr. Morley 's paper , he would have seen that the relation which subsisted between this class of tenants and their landlords was one of tenure until the year 1800 , and not one of contract , but by an act passed in that year the relation was changed to one of contract . The change was not a favorable one for the tenants . Now , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays so much stress ? First , the contracts sprang into existence , without the consent of the tenants , at one blow , by an act of Parliament , in a legislature where the tenants were not represented ; secondly , by the contracts one party possessed every power , privilege , and right over the soil " from the sky to the centre of the earth , " as the old phrase expressed it ; the other party was absolutely and entirely at his mercy . Under this relation of contract , the tenant built the farmhouse , fenced the fields , drained the marsh , reclaimed the bog , and gave verdure to the barren hillside . For this the landlord rewarded him by increasing his rent whenever calculation or caprice impelled him . Some idea of the value of the tenants ' improvements  --  the improvements upon which the successive increases of rent were charged-may be formed from the fact that the estates of the London Companies in Derry advanced in rent from less than ? 2,000 a year in 1614 to ? 160,000 a year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Arrears Act of 1882 , receipts of tenants of that county which disclosed a most startling state of affai'rs . In one instance the receipt for the rent in the year l8l4was ? 0 lOs. ; the receipt when the tenant came before me to get the benefit of the act showed his rent at ? 37 , and nearly treble the government valuation . There were other cases in which the rise of rent was equally striking , and I am bound to say that the picture powerfully affected me . It seemed really as if rent-raising ran a race with the tenants ' expenditure . The frightful immoralty of confiscating the results of such expenditure by charging rent upon them , irstead of allowing the tenant to reap the benefit , seems never to have struck large classes of opinion in Ireland . It was regarded as a matter of course , strictly within the landlord 's rights , and for the exercise of which he was accountable to no one . The public conscience of England at length became so shocked that Mr. Gladstone was enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a check // *49 *Ipon reckless increases of rent and capricious evictions . But the act worked so ineffectively on account of the organized * attack made upon it by the landlords in the county courts that it became necessary to pass the act of 1881 , which , according to Mr. Lecky , has " rooted " the tenants " forever on the soil . " If the tenants are " rooted on the soil , " how does it happen that they are evicted every day ? If the landlords are only rent-chargers , how is it that they exercise seigniorial rights ? The fact is that all this legislation did was to import some new clauses into a pr&amp;ixisting contract , which they conditionally limited by preventing eviction and arbitrary increases of rent . This is the correct legal statement of the matter , which I shall presently expand in a way to make it intelligible to lay readers . What the tenant within the scope of Mr. Gladstone 's acts gets by the act of 1881 is a right to have the letting value of his holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenancy may be forfeited by a breach of any one of a series of statutory conditions as stringent as the most skilful conveyancing lawyer could devise . No doubt the courts can relieve against forfeiture , but it is only upon such conditions that hardly a single tenant could perform , if he were not assisted by the benevolence of friends . It may be taken for granted that no tenant would wilfully commit a breach which on the bare happening would extinguish his interest , except upon the terms of obtaining relief at an expense little short of ruinous . It is a statutory condition for the judicial tenant to pay the rent the day it becomes due ; it is one not to sublet any part of the holding ; it is another not to let any part of it in " conacre " for white crops ; another not to part with the possession of the holding or any part of it for any purpose what ever ; another not to cut turf for sale ; another not to quarry for the purpose of raising limestone to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another not to take sea-weed ; another not to prevent the landlord or any one authorized by him from entering on the holding for the purpose of setting bog for turf-cutting , or for quarrying , or for digging for gravel , sand , or other materials ; another not to prevent the landlord or any persons authorized by him from entering for the purpose of shooting , hunting , fishing , fowling , or the taking of game . Many of the privileges taken away by the statutory conditions were enjoyed by the tenants before the passing of the land acts , because the landlords were aware that otherwise they could not pay high rents . The cutting of turf for sale , for instance , was an important adjunct to a tenant 's means of support . The blending of gravel , sand , and lime with certain kinds of soil was necessary to quicken them into fertility . The taking of sea-weed to spread upon land as manure was a privilege beneficial to tenants near the coasts . This privilege , with the others , has been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consents . This very few landlords will do , exasperated as they are and have been by legislation which they regard as confiscatory of their rights , and which a man so distinguished in letters as Mr. Lecky tells us has no " parallel in English history . " ? Mr. Lecky further states that under the act of 1881 " rents have been reduced by judicial sentence , with complete disregard both to previous con *Irish Law Times ' Reports , Donel 's " Land Cases : ' t What about the copyhold tenure of England It is an exact parallel of what Mr. Gladstone intended , but failed to accomplish , by the act of 1881. // THE NORTH AMERIUAN REVIEW . tracts and to market value . " I dissent in toto from this statement . But first it should be understood and constantly borne in mind that it was the tenant 's improvements that gave all the value to the land over and above certain inherent capabilities which his expenditure started into activity . These inherent capabilities must be regarded in fixing the fair rent . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full in the leading case of Adams v. Dunseath ( Irish Law Reports , vol. for 1882 ) ; and in practice sub . commissions have given them an excessive value . Moreover , the act of 1870 limited the time which a tenant could go back in making a claim for compensation for improvements to twenty years before the filing of the claim . This act , incorporated with the act of 1881 for all purposes , consequently confers upon the landlord the property in all improvements made before twenty years . This in effect has bestowed by far the greater part of the value in the improvements upon the landlord , and has prevented the reduction of rents below what lawyers call the " rack rent " - that is , the highest letting value . If , then , the sub-commissions can not reduce rent below the " rack rent , " where did the 25 per cent . over and above that value come from which tenants had to pay under the old untrammelled license which enabled landlords to hunt them like vermin off the land if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give the answer in the words of Swift , writing on the same subject in 1729- " from the blood and vitals of the tenants . " With the terrible power landlords possess in being able to evict tenants owing a year 's rent , and thereby depriving them of all interest in their land , it is idle to say that the relation of landlord and tenant has been changed from a contract for six months into an interest in perpetuity . If the perpetuity had been conferred in reality , the condition of the country would be widely different from what it is . We should not read of the rule of anarchy , whether from above or from below , which has made Ireland for the last four years a sign and a wonder to the world . We should not have a decreasing population side by side with an increasing pressure of the residue against subsistence , and we should not have a government representing the landlords bringing forward a measure in Parliament to terminate landlordism forever . GEORGE MCDERMOT . FAIR PLAY FOR THE INDIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should like to make a few remarks upon General Miles 's article , " The Future of the Indian Question , " published in the January number . General Miles says : " Again , take the Sioux nation that committed the terrible massacre of 62 , " etc . The Sioux , as a nation , did not commit that terrible massacre . One might as justly say that the Sioux as a nation fought the Sioux . In 1862 the money due the Sioux from the sale of lands was sent to them in gold ; the agent paid them in greenbacks , pocketing the difference . The Indians protested against this , insisting upon all that was due , but the agent refused to give it to them . Their treaty stipulations were not kept by the government , and their annuities were in arrears ; they were consequently suffering for food , but must starve , though provisions were in the government warehouse . Becoming desperate , they broke into the storehouse , and thus began the outbreak , these Sioux being designated as hostile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and children from these warriors , risked their lives to carry them to safe places , sheltered them and fed them ; others lied , as much victims of the outbreak as white people . Some of the Sioux now at Yankton Agency were organized as scouts under General Sibley , who said that " they proved more effectual than twice that number of white soldiers " ; but the white troops received a salary , while the scouts have not yet been paid . And now , twenty-nine years after , these starving Sioux , brave , loyal fellows , are asking for this money due them ; they want it to buy food for their families ; otherwise they must watch them die for lack of nourishment . The crops this year have failed , and there is not work enough to keep them all earning something during the winter in a farming community . Others of the Sioux , " who were known to be absolutely guiltless of any acts of hostility , " but " deserving of reward for the rescue of white captives , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their property confiscated . Two hundred and fifty friendly Indian farmers lost not only their homes , taken by the government , but their crops and their herds of stock ; $125,000 worth of their property was used to feed United States soldiers and prisoners . After repeated urging , Congress appropriated $7,500 for these farmers ; what the government had taken the government refused to pay , and to-day we honestly owe the Sioux $117,500 of this debt . These loyal farmers , who had fed the troops and committed no hostilities , were deprived of their annuities for four years , and sent to another State , where they lived in want , suffering for food ; having been deprived of their homes , thefr stock , clothing , and furniture . The Indian Commissioner in 1868 wrote : " What I ask for them is that our government restore to them a part of what we took , and give them the same chance to live and thrive which we give to all the other inhabitants of our country , whether white or black . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of Sioux history knowingly . General Miles also says that in 1876 the Sioux " were again openly hostile " - because the government drove them to desperation . Owing to a failure in appropriation , the supplies did not come . The crops and vegetables were destroyed by grasshoppers . Unless one witnessed this devastation , as I did , it would be difficult to realize it . Their farming implements , schools , and teachers were not furnished as per treaty-have not been furnished , as promised , up to the present moment . People constantly told them that they were to be removed to another territory . When these starving creatures left the reservation to seek game , in order to save the lives of their wives and children , troops were sent to arrest them . In violation of the treaty stipulation the Black Hills had been entered . Put yourself in such conditions as these Indians were placed in , and see if you , even with years of civilization and Christianity as an inheritance , would not conclude that it were better to escape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They slipped away from the agency and joined Sitting Bull . No wonder that they " were again openly hostile . " In 1877 , according to General Miles , " their war ponies were sold and the proceeds returned to them in domestic stock . " General Miles would not have made such a statement had he not believed it true . I am very glad to be able to call attention to this matter . It is true the war ponies of the Sioux were seized , but it was in direct violation of Article 8 of their lastconciLded treaty . Not only the ponies but fh e mules were seized by order // 2*2 of the War Department . This property was sold ; from the sale of the horses alone the War Department received $19,412.96 . The Indians were told that the loss would be made good ; so 450 cows were given them , valued at not more than $20 each , amounting to $9,000 . Instead of the proceeds of the sale of war ponies being returned in domestic stock , $10,000 is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen years where their $10,000 is . " General Miles belieV*es the messiah was a messenger of war . Most of the people in the Indian country believed him to have been a messenger of peace . Bright Eyes says the Sioux looked upon the messiah as a messenger of peace ; no weapons were allowed in the ghost-dance , not even a piece of iron ; the first serious trouble occurred when the troops came to the ghostdance with their weapons ; this the Sioux looked upon as an insult to their sacred dance . Bright Eyes is at Pine Ridge , among the Sioux ; she is an Indian , an educated , cultivated Ponca , and has been sent there to get at the truth , and has a better opportunity of knowing the true state of affairs than any white person at a distance , or even there . The present trouble with the Sioux was caused , first , by the autocratic power of one incompetent individual over a community of individuals ; secondly , by the failure of crops and the immediate reduction of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dying daily from starvation . The failure of crops was caused by drought . To the white farmers thus suffering money and food were sent , but the Indian 's ration was reduced ; unsuitable farming implements were sent him , made of poor material ; threshers where there was no wheat to thresh ; corn-shellers where no corn would grow . Schools as per treaty , domestic animals , and wagons were not forthcoming , though the United States has three million dollars in the treasury belonging to the Sioux . Before their land was properly surveyed eleven million acres were opened to settlers . Those Indians who had built themselves houses and owned respectable farms were told that when the land was allotted their farms would be elsewhere . All this is summed up in " the Indians became restless . " The white man who posed as the messiah has been arrested . What is to be done with him ? Sitting Bull was killed because he preached the messiah to the Sioux , though Sitting Bull offered to go with the agent and find out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no messiah . Sitting Bull , a superstitious , ignorant , cunning medicine-man , was killed in violation of both civil and military law , and the result is a war . His followers surrendered 250 women and children and 150 fighting men . The troops searched them because they did not yield up their weapons . The truth of what these Indians had been told flashed upon them ; they were to be torn from their homes and sent to Florida . With one bound they faced death ; the troops outnumbered them , and the Indians knew what this meant ; but they fought " like red devils , " says the newspaper correspondent ; had they been white men it would have read " they fought bravely . " Bright Eyes writes to me December 28 : " The rumor is that they are to take the hostiles-who were not hostile , mark you , and who have not taken a single life  --  to Florida . If true , it is the most outrageous performance yet . The country ought to ring with it . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world they were brought here for in the first place ; the Indians seem to look at it as an outbreak of the army instead of an outbreak of themselves . The idea of tearing these people away from // 2*3 their homes because many of them fled from fear into the Bad Lands . I hope every paper in the land will open a broadside on whoever has done this . " When the battle reported at Daly 's ranch is sifted , it turns out that one of the men , feeling pity for some starving Indian women , gave them two rams . The first intense battle at Pine Ridge was purely a newspaper spacefiller ; no one at Pine Ridge , I have accurate information , knew of the battle . When General Brook sent out to tell the Sioux to come into the agency , people interested in keeping them out told them they would be made prisoners and sent to the Indian Territory . The lower class of white people want troops because it puts money in their pockets ; men who received but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One man who has a contract for forwarding supplies to Pine Ridge from Rusliville gets $561 a day ; people have contracts for supplying troops at Pine Ridge with three hundred tons of hay and over two hundred pounds of oats alone . Newspaper correspondents sent out there have been determined to telegraph something ; so the military authorities have been annoyed and the good work they might have done has been hampered by sensational press despatches . All these mistakes , with the false move of killing Sitting Bull , have forced an Indian war . To make this impossible in the future there is but one course to take . It is absurd to pauperize the Indian by giving him either food or clothing ; it is beyond reason to place any people under autocratic rule in this country ; it is useless to give money destined for private individuals into the hands of politicians ; not that our politicians are as a class dishonest , but that a temptation to cheat what people call the government , not realizing it is the people , seems too great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try impossibilities , but at once make each Indian amenable to the law of the State or territory in which he resides by making him a citizen . Treat him as a responsible individual , as has been done in Nebraska , and he will earn his own living , be willing to educate his ohildren , learn not to be cheated . Do not chain him to the ground , as in Nebraska , by forcing him to farm whether he wills or not ; let him rent his land and practise a trade there or elsewhere . Until the Indian is a citizen , subject to the same privileges and penalties as are other men in this country , we may expect war , expensive in loss of life , loss of money , and loss of prosperity in that part of the country where it occurs . GEORGE TRUMAN KERCHEVAL . THE CONVICT AND THE CHURCH . - THE recent action of a well-known church in determining to retain upon its roll of membership a man convicted of the crime of forgery and sentenced to a term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of attention and called forth no small amount of oomment . In some quarters the church in question has been warmly commended for a course which is declared to be precisely in the spirit of the founder of Christianity , while by others its action has been roundly denounced . Without naming any names , let us consider the facts for a moment . 5- was a man whose reputation both socially and as a business man // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . was apparently unimpeachable . He possessed the entire confidence of all who knew him . He was engaged in a lucrative business , having two partners who believed him thoroughly trustworthy . He was an active member of a prominent church , and an earnest worker in its Sunday-schooL His social position was good , and his name was gladly sought to be added to to the boards of directors of charitable and benevolent institutions . He had a charming family , and , while he lived well , there was no suspicion that he was living beyond his means . Nor did he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indulge in extravagant habits . To all appearances he was a prosperous , successful , happy , and contented man . Suddenly it was revealed to his partners , by an examination of the firm 's accounts , that this man , in whom they had reposed the most absolute and unquestioning confidence , was a forger . S- for six years had been living a lie , He had been a conscious and consummate hypocrite . He had taken advantage of and most cruelly deceived those who trusted him . His method of operation had been to " raise " certificates of stock-that is , to increase the number of shares represented by certificates in the possession of his firmand then dispose of them and avail himself of the fraudulent proceeds . This operation he had repeated many times , until the sum secured by his forgeries was counted by hundreds of thousands . It is certainly to S- 's credit that , when the terrible discovery was made known to him , he made no denial and no attempt to leave the country , as perhaps he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid in ascertaining the full extent of his criminal acts , and voluntarily surrendered himself to the authorities . More than that , he was willing to plead guilty to the charge of forgery and prevent the necessity of a trial ; but , inasmuch as the crime was one which might involve life-imprisonment , this was not permissible under the law , and a trial was accordingly had , although no defence was interposed . Hardly had he been taken to prison before 5- wrote a letter to his pastor , setting forth that he had repented of his sins , and believed that he had received divine forgiveness . This letter was read at a meeting of the church held a few days later , and on the recommendation of the pastor , who had visited the convict in prison , the church voted to retain 5- on its rolls of membership , believing , as was stated in its formal resolutions , that if he ever needed the church 's help and sympathy , it was in the situation in which he then found himself . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convict in striped clothes , and undergoing a long term of imprisonment on his own confession of evil-doing , has been allowed to remain in good and regular standing as a member of a Christian church ! There are circumstances conceivable in which a church might pursue such a course toward one of its number without laying itself open to any adverse criticism whatever . Suppose , for example , that S had committed a single fault of a criminal nature ; that he had yielded for once to a momentary temptation ; and that he had confessed this to his pastor and his fellow-church-members , expressed his contrition therefor , and then bowed to the majesty of the law and gone to prison . In a rightly-constituted church , permeated by the right spirit , the question of dropping him from membership would never have been raised for a moment . But how different is the case we are considering I Here the repentance is merely ex post facto . Not one solitary crime has been repented of and confessed , // but a long series has been committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confession until the exposure has been made and concealment is no longer possible . When a prison suit has been donned , and temptation no longer confronts the convict because he is wholly beyond its reach , it is easy to repent and promise restitution , and ask the forgiveness of one 's church and the privilege of remaining one of its members . Here it is pertinent to inquire what degree or kind of crime would be sufficient to justify the church in question , in the estimation of its own members , in refusing to extend further fellowship to one of their number who had fallen into sin . If forgery carried on for years by a man professing Christianity is not , would burglary , or highway robbery , or murder , or any one of a hundred other crimes for which the criminal code provides penalties ? Surely ' it would seem , the line must be drawn somewhere ; but where ? That is the question . A wife-murderer on the church-membership books in unimpeachable standing is the logical consequence of the action which forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the murderer , after conviction of his crime , shall write to his pastor making confession and beseeching forgiveness ; whereupon nothing but the noose or the electric current shall terminate the unfortunate man 's active connection with the church which he has disgraced and brought into contempt . But , says S s chief apologist , his pastor , he committed his first forgery when suffering from nervous prostration . But what about the other ones ? What about the six years of basest hypocrisy ? And does not the apologist see that he opens wide the door for the justification of every possible sort of crime ? Would nervous prostration excuse the murderer , the sneakthief , the rehypothecator of bonds , or even the miserable wretch who steals a loaf of bread in order to keep his wife and children from starvation ? Away with such silly sentimentalism ! But , says another defender of the church , there can be little doubt of the genuineness of 5 s repentance , and in all probability he was glad when the exposure came and he could quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . It must have been a great relief to him , and doubtless he went to prison with a glad heart . Well , we should really like to know what there was to hinder him from ending the lie at any moment he pleased during the years when he chose to be one thing and to seem another ! Voluntary confession on his part would assuredly have afforded proof of a heart not wholly bad , and impelled the holding out of a helping hand . Such a course would have been manly and straightforward . It would have commanded respect at least . The fact is that such a series of crimes as this person was guilty of strike a blow at the very foundations of business and of the social structure . The impairing of confidence in one 's fellow-men is a very serious matter . If the comrade who has stood shoulder to shoulder with you , on whom you have felt that you could rely as firmly almost as on your very self-if he falters , stumbles , gives way utterly , your faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which it can not soon , if ever , recover . Have a care not to underestimate the baseness of such a crime ; have a care not to overestimate the soundness of the repentance that so speedily and so glibly follows . Still another voice is heard in the way of apology , and it declares that the action of the church in question is altogether in the line of the Christianity of Jesus . Has this apologist forgotten the thunders of denunciation // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . hurled by the gentle man of Nazareth against the hypocritic Pharisees of his day and generation ? " Woe unto you , scribes and . Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outwardly , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and all uncleanness . . . . Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ? " There is no lack of vigor and barb in these words , and if they do not " fit the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find any that do . " Muscular Christianity " is a phrase that has had a considerable vogue . Whatever the specific meaning put into the words at any time , it is certain that the Christianity which found expression in the action of this church towards its convict member had little muscularity about it . To my mind , at all events , it was decidedly flabby . Doubtless , had the opportunity presented itself , this church would have compounded the felony and prevented its member 's crime from becoming known to the public . Society and the church owe a higher duty than that to themselves . Our penal systems are far from perfect , and come far short of accomplishing the results that ought not unreasonably to be expected from them . But they must be applied with impartiality to all . There can not be one law and one punishment for the rich man who commits forgery , and another law and another punishment for the poor man who yields to temptation . Nor will the churches do their duty so long as they sternly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who knows whether S- 's alleged repentance and his remaining an unchallenged member of - Church may not be employed within a few years as an argument in favor of his pardo*ii ? It is easily possible . Nay , it is easily possible that a man shrewd enough to carry on a series of forgeries for six years without detection is shrewd enough not only to foresee this , but to make plans for it . Under similar circumstances a wise church would " beware of the leaven of the Pharisees . " By all means let Christianity be tender , loving , patient , long-suffering , forgiving ; but let its churches , its professors , and its pastors and teachers beware of namby-pamby sentimentalism !
