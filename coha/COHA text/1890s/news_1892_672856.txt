txt The rumsellers ' Excise bill now before the Legislature makes it a misdemeanor for any officer or agent of a society to enter a liquor saloon during the hours when it is unlawful to sell liquor , in order to see whether he can purchase some . The liquor dealers as a class appear to have no confidence in their own intention to obey the law they ask for , and therefore they consider it necessary to provide against the peril of spies . But if this is a sound theory as regards police duty , why should it not have universal application ? A case in point is the following : The police in the Chrystie Street district discovered lately that several men arrested for drunkenness had been drugged and robbed . They had their suspicions as to the guilty persons and where the business was done . On Wednesday night last they had a person enter a certain saloon in that street simulating intoxication , - who called for more liquor and showed some money . Two loafers in the place made Mends with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave him drugged beer , laid him on chairs to sleep , and when he was asleep " went through him , " as their slang is . .. A detective appeared on the scene , arrested the two men , found the marked money in their possession , and on one of them also a bottle of tincture of opium with which the man had been drugged , actually drugged so as to suffer from his treatment all the following day . Now , was it an " outrage " and an " abuse " practiced upon the two violators of the law against robbery to send this unknown man to exhibit himself as a fit victim , and . so " tempt " them to the . commission of a crime ? And if it was not , how does the case differ in ethics and practical justice from the ease of going into a saloon . which is open when the law .. says it must be closed and asking for liquor which it is unlawful to sell or give away at that hour ? ' Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of detection that are considered proper in other cases and are almost essential to the discovery of some crimes ? And if they are entitled to be a specially exempted class , upon what grounds does their claim rest ?
