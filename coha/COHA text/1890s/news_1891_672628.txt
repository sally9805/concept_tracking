txt The " raid " upon the Boulangists in Paris at least attests the confidence of the French Government in the attachment of the French people to the republic . That is , thus far , its single redeeming point . Our ways of thinking and of acting are so different from those of Frenchmen that it is difficult for an interested man to draw a satisfactory conclusion from any political event that may happen in France short of actual revolution . The issue of a warrant for the seizure of papers in the houses of members of Congress would in thi country be a revolutionary act . In point of fact , it is an action that has never been taken , even in the crisis of a Congressional dead-lock , and it would be recognized by all Americans as an absolutely desperate action on the part of the party temporarily in power . It does not in the least follow that it is such an action in France , and the difference is not a difference in kind , or even in degree , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private life and of individual activity are much stricter than those that prevail in France . On the other hand , the French notion of what may be called , in the French phrase , " incivisme " are much stricter than our own . Even if it comes to be decided that there is nothing incriminating in the papers seized by the Parisian police , the fact of the seizure , which in this country would constitute an outrage of the first magnitude , would go almost unnoticed in France . As we had occasion a day or two ago to point out in reference to the death of the Prince NAPOLEON , the reason of being of Bonapartism and of Boulangism in France is the desire on the part of timid persons for the appearance of the " strong man " and " the man on horseback . " If Bonapartism had really fulfilled this requirement , Boulangism would never have been heard of , as an important factor in the politics of France . The republic , however , has very fairly fulfilled its duties as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of a government , and . in order to make it appear that a ma-a on horseback is needed , it must first appear that some grave threat to social institutions has been made . The visit to Paris of the Empress Dowager of Germany was converted into such a , threat by M. DA. - ROUL ? DE and . his colleagues of the League , in default of anything better . Their aspirations were promoted , it must be admitted , by the Emperor of Germany . It must be owned that the man is not a common specimen of our race who would consent to the use of his mother as a " trial balloon " and would acquiesce in the putting of her in the way of a presumably hostile mob is order to test the real sentiment of the mob . This is what the young 4seiser actually did , for it is plain that the Empress Dowager did not proceed - to Paris of her own motion or otherwise than in consequence of a large number of official and diplomatic consultations . If the Parisian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raiser as saying , then it would be established that revenge was still the prime political object of the Parisian populace , if not of the French authorities . It is remarkable enough , doubtless , for a statesman to act upon the ancient adage of fiat exp Srimeizturn in corporc viii , but when the cheap substance comes to be the person of his own mother , the prudence of the experimentative statesman becomes the object of a somewhat shuddering admiration . All the same , there is a certain satisfaction in seeing M. agnouLknE and his gang of rowdies brought to some sort of account . Possibly it would have been a violation of the noblest and most intimate sentiments of all Frenchmen to bring them openly to account for a boorish and brutal demonstration toward the widow of a GermanEmperor , who was herself evidently actuated by none but the kindliest sentiments . Nevertheless , in the present . quiescent condition of Boulangism , the seizure of the persons and papers of Boni angi st deputies can not be construed otherwise than as an indirect expression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulangism took on during the visit to Paris of the ex-Empress . This is very satisfactory , even if the prosecution would be more satisfactory if it had avowedly been directed against the raising of a mob to drive out of the country an inoffensive woman .
