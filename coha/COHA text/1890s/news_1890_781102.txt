txt The Committee of One Hundred , which has played such an important part in Boston school eleotione for the past two years , held its annual meeting on Thursday , but the report of their Secretary could not be prepared in shape for publication before today . It is , of coarse , very decided in its tone , but its statements will be very interesting to both Protestants and Catholics , whether or not they agree with its conclusions . The report was very long , as it covered the work of the Committee on National Affairs as well as in local politics . It begins by stating the principles of the organization , and then speaks of the affairs of the Boston School Board for the past year , judged from the point of view of the committee . It says that , with the exception of two , all the members elected Deo . IV . 1888 , have studied to discharge their duties in the light of that election , and while the improvements accomplished by these men have not been as numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet no one can look at the schools as they were a year ago , and not see that very much has been done . " In the matter of text books , " says the report , experience of the past year was remarkable . Members of the School Board sueceeeded in postponing all action till they supposed it was too late to affect them in the election of 1889 , but the result showed that the committee of One Hundred placed rightly every member of the board regarding his position on Anderson 's History . " This episode is reviewed at some length and then the report takes up national matters . A petition has been sent to Congress with the signatures of 20.000 citizens of Massachusetts , asking for an amendment to the National Constitution prohibiting all sectarian appropriations . Tne presence of President Harrison at the inauguration of a Roman Catholic theological seminary in Washington recently is regarded as a cause for alarm as showing the trend of the polities of both parties to court the votes of the Romanists . Not only did the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted the President of the Nation to be insulted without protest . He was given a seat on the left or the presiding Meer of the occasion , and the seat of honor at the right was given to a Cardinal of the Roman Catholics Church . Cardinal Tasenereau of Canada . The first toast wnioli was drunk on the occasion was to the health of Pope Leo XIII and that of the President of the United States was second . In diplomatic circles this would Do taken to acknowledge Papal supremacy , to which the Government of the United States was secondary . Yet this insult was quietly borne by President Harrison . In the same line is the course of the Administration regarding the alien contract law . If an Episcopal church in Brooklyn gives a call to a rector from abroad it must pay a fine 01 $1,000 to the Government . When a Presbyterian congregation in Erie , Penn. , calls a pastor from Canada it is lined $1,000 by the Government under the alien contract law . But the Roman Catholic Church can engage and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and ottieere for the university in Washington , and not a word will the Administration say about any violation of the alien contract law . " Where is our Admin-istration now I " asks the report .
