txt It was discovered on Aug. 28 , 1897 , that the branch of the Dominion Bank at Napanee , Ontario , had been robbed in the night , $7,000 worth of securities , $23 in cash , and about $20,000 in unsigned bills being:stolen . ThePinkertons were asked by the bank to take up the case , and Inspectors Wilkes and Dougherty of New York were detailed for the work . Albert Mackie of Belleville , a town near Napanee , was arrested first , , and a few days after William Hamilton Ponton , teller of the robbed bank , was also placed behind the bars . Later on William H. Holden and Edward Parr of New Haven were arrested and had in ' their possession more than $2,000 each . Some of the unsigned bills were also traced to points in the New England States , and It was found that the New Haven men had circulated them . After an investigation all four were held for trial , which began on Nov. 24 at Napanee . Parr was the first to confess , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both men as witnesses . On cross-examination they admitted having been convicted and having served time for theft , burglary , and forgery . The Crown also relied on the Pinkerton men to corroborate the men 's story , but the defense charged the officers with perjuring themselves to make a case . Ponton was very popular , and feeling against the Crown witnesses grew very bitter . The case was given to the jury at 6:30 last night , and immediately thereafter mobs began to gather . Judge Ferguson , who was staying at the Spaisley House , was mobbed going to his rooms . Crown Attorneys and witnesses were also insulted , and at midnight , the jury not having decided , the outlook was so dangerous that , after reading the riot act , the court was adjourned until 9 o'clock this morning . The Sheriff at midnight armed all the officers and a number of citizens , guarding the Judge and Court House all night , and this morning escorting the Judge and prosecuting attorneys to the Court House with a heavily armed force . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to the Sheriff . At 10:30 the jury brought in a report that they could not agree on Ponton 's case , but found Mackie guilty . He got ten years in the penitentiary and Ponton was let go on $10,000 bail . He will probably be tried in Toronto next assizes . The feeling ran strongly against the Pinkerton men , so much so that at the next session of the Dominion Parliament legislation will be proposed to prevent their employment in Canada . Ponton , it has now transpired , is related to a wealthy English merchant , and his father here is said to be heir to great wealth . It is certain funds came from England for defense .
