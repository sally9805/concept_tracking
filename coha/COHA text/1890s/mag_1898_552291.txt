By Rickard Webb . HE public career of William Pitt Fessenden covered the period from 1854 to i868 ,  --  from the rise of the Republican party to the close of Johnson 's administration . With the exception of about eight months , when he was Secretary of the Treasury , he was during all this time a member of the Senate . He entered that body as the slavery question was reaching a crisis , and in the momentous events which followed he bore a leading part . In many respects this period of our history , from the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill to the first inauguration of President Grant , is the most important . It witnessed the rise and suppression of a great rebellion , the abolition of slavery , the reconstruction of the South , and the impeachment of a President . At no former period had the necessity for the highest order of statesmanship been greater ; and this necessity developed in many of our public men the qualities and abilities which the occasion demanded . Many who then occupied important positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save perhaps in the localities where they lived or by those who were in some sense their contemporaries . Lincoln and a few others have already achieved immortality . But there were many more whose names are now rarely heard , but whose services to the republic merit at least remembrance . Such a one was Fessenden . As an apostle in the anti-slavery crusade , and for many years as a leader in the Senate , he exhibited those qualities of mind and character which mark the statesman ; and especially as Secretary of the zi6 Treasury , as chairman of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction , and in daring to vote against his party for the acquittal of Andrew Johnson , his services were most important . No sketch of Fessenden , however brief , would be complete without some reference to his father , General Samuel Fessenden ; for from him were inherited in marked degree the intellectual traits which made the senator distinguished . Samuel Fessenden was a son of William Fessenden , the first minister of the first parish in Fryeburg , Maine , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained at the Fryeburg Academy , the principal of which , during the latter part of his course , was Daniel Webster , then a recent graduate of Dartmouth College . A warm friendship sprang up between teacher and pupil , which continued during life ; and it was doubtless due to Webster 's influence that Samuel Fessenden went to Dartmouth , where he was graduated in i8o6 . He studied law in an office in his native village , and was admitted to the bar in 1809 . He began practice in New Gloucester , Maine , and remained there until 1822 , when he moved to Portland , and formed a partnership with Thomas Amory Deblois . This firm continued for many years , and from the beginning had a large and important practice . The early volumes of the Maine Reports show that Fessenden &amp; Deblois appeared in more cases before the law court than any other lawyers in Cumberland County , and it is said of General Fessenden that probably no other lawyer in Maine ever argued so many cases to the jury . As a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a safe counsellor and an able and eloquent // advocate . For many years he was president of the Cumberland Bar Association , which position he held at the time of his death . He was not only well read in the law , but was also a man of scholarly and literary tastes . In 1828 he might perhaps have been elected president of Dartmouth , had he not declined to be considered a candidate . In 1848 he received from l3owdoin the degree of LL . D. For many yearsbefore Maine was set off as aseparate state he represented the town of New Gloucester in the General Court of Massachusetts , serving in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate , and it was on account of his legislative services that he was elected , in i8i8 , a major-general of the militia , thereby receiving the title by which he was commonly known . In politics he was a pronounced and ardent Federalist so long as Federalism had life . He then became a Whig , but his extreme anti-slavery views soon alienated him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican party . He was , therefore , during the greater part of his life , a member of the minority . Maine was a sure Democratic state from the time of its organization until the rise of the Republican party . Except in the memorable election of 1840 , when Edward Kent was chosen governor , no Whig was ever elected by the people to that office , and except in the same election , when William Pitt Fessenden was elected to Congress , the seat for the Portland district was regularly filled by a Democrat . Had General Fessenden lived a little earlier , so that his prime of life might have come when the Federalist party was dominant , or had he lived a little later , so that his prime might have come during the Rebellion , he would doubtless have been a man of national position and reputation . He lived in both periods , but Federalist supremacy had ceased before he was of age , and the success of the later Republican party found him an old man nearing his eightieth year . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward public life , and battled with keen zest in behalf of principles which he believed to be right . He did all he could for the negro when it cost something to befriend a slave . He received colored people at his house , visited them himself , and aided them in their attempts to attain position in society . The unpopularity of such a course did not deter him . He entered into the antislavery cause from sincere conviction and gave to it the best efforts of his mind and heart . He was a man of great strength of character , of intellectual force , and of firm convictions . He died at Portland , March is , 1869 , aged nearly eighty-five years , preceding his distinguished son to the grave by only about six months . William Pitt Fessenden was the eldest son of General Samuel Fessenden , and was born at Boscawen , N. H. , October i6 , i8o6 . The name which he received is indicative of his father 's political opinions , as Pitt , then at the height of his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New England Federalists . His childhood was spent at his father 's home in New Gloucester . He was early studious and unusually precocious . In 1819 , before he was thirteen years old , he entered Bowdoin College , and was graduated there with honors in 1823 . Franklin Pierce , who afterwards became President , was in college at the same time , being a member of the class of 1822 , while in the class of 1825 were Longfellow and Hawthorne . While Fessenden was in college , his father had moved from New Gloucester to Portland , so that when his college course was completed he came to his father 's new home , and began to study law in the office of Charles S. Davis , at that time one of the leading lawyers in Maine . He was a law student for four years , part of the time in the office of his uncle , Thomas Fessenden , in New York , and in 1827 , being then twenty-one // years old , he was admitted to the Cumberland bar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a new branch in the jurisprudence of Maine . After his admission he opened an office in Bridgton , Maine , where he remained about two years . He then returned to Portland , and became a member of his father 's firm , but this arrangement not proving satisfactory , he went to Bangor , where he stayed until 1832 , when he again returned to Portland , and for the rest of his life made his home in that city . He was married on the year of his return , to the youngest daughter of James Deering . Fessenden soon took high rank at the bar , and developed much of the true spirit of the lawyer . He was fond of the profession , and in many respects preferred it to holding public position . He enjoyed a large , although not specially lucrative practice , and long before his election to the Senate he was recognized as one of the leading lawyers of the state . He early took an interest in politics . In 1827 , when only twenty-one years of age , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July oration , in which he clearly showed the bent of his mind toward public affairs . In 1832 he was elected to the legislature as a Whig , having been offered and having declined the Whig nomination for Congress . It may be that this latter nomination was declined because there seemed to be slight prospect of election , or it may be that he did not consider it wise at the very beginning of his professional career , and before he had established a practice , to afford the time necessary for a congressional term . Service in Congress does not seem to have been then considered the honor it has since become . An appointment to the bench was much preferred , and on two separate occasions seats in the United States Senate were resigned for positions on the bench of the supreme court of Maine . In 1840 , however , Fessenden accepted the congressional nomination and was elected ; but service in the House of Representatives did not seem to suit his tastes , and , although renominated , he positively declined to run . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress , but lost his seat through an error in the returns . In 1843 and 1845 the Whigs in the legislature gave him their votes for the senatorship , and in 1853 , when the term of James W. Bradbury , who was a Democrat , expired , he again received the support of his party . But the legislature of 1853 failed to elect , no candidate receiving a majority of the votes cast , and adjourned , leaving the vacancy to be filled by the legislature to be elected in the coming fall . In the political campaign of that year a serious split occurred in the Democratic party , so long dominant in Maine . A considerable faction , calling themselves " Independent Democrats , " bolted the regular nominations and supported , as their candidate for the governorship , Anson P. Morrill . There was no election of governor by the people , and it fell , therefore , upon the legislature , which met in January , 1854 , to elect both a governor and a senator , with the balance of power resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Morrill . Mr. Fessenden had been at all times a consistent Whig , and was the most prominent man of that party in the state . Besides his brief experience in Congress , he had served many terms in the legislature , had been a delegate to several national conventions , and had before been the regular* candidate for the senatorship . For these reasons his friends claimed for him the united support o* the party . But he was a pronounced antislavery man . While he had not followed his father 's example in breaking with the Whig party , he was at all times in favor of vigorous constitutional opposition to the slave power . These views commended him to the " Independent Democrats , " who had broken with their own party on the slavery question , but not to several // members of his own party of proslavery proclivities , who called themselves " Strict Whigs , " and who were willing to vote for him as the party candidate so long as there should be no prospect of his election , but who would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anti-slavery Democrats . Any open combination was therefore impossible , and Mr. Fessenden 's election was brought about by a ruse , secretly planned by Mr. Morrill and shrewdly executed by his followers . It was reported and not denied that the " Independents " would support as their senatorial candidate Ex-Governor Hubbard . On the day of the election they circulated ballots for him , and then they all voted for Fessenden . So well had the secret been kept as to what the " Independents " would do , that the Whigs were completely deceived , and as all the Whigs had voted for Mr. Fessenden , he was , to their great surprise , elected on the first ballot . At the time of Mr. Fessenden 's election to the Senate , the great debate on the Kansas-Nebraska bill was in progress . This bill for the organization of the two territories of Kansas and Nebraska provided for the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , and its passage by Congress broke up the Whig party , consolidated the antislavery men of the North into the new Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fessenden took his seat in the Senate , on February 23 , 1854 , the debate on the Kansas-Nebraska bill was at its height ; and into this debate he plunged at once , delivering his first speech on the evening of March 3 . This speech bears no evidence of careful literary preparation . It was delivered without notes and upon the inspiration of the moment ; but it was clear , logical , forcible and consistent . The frequent interruptions and questions of such veteran debaters as Cass , Douglas and Butler of South Carolina did not disconcert him . Having come directly from the people , he voiced thz* popular indignation which this bill had aroused ; and having been elected by a Democratic legislature , although he himself was a lifelong Whig , his presence in the Senate was an example of how this slavery question , so suddenly and unexpectedly reopened , had made men forget past political differences . His speech won from his fellow-senators their immediate recognition of him as a debater of more than usual ability , and drew public attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of anti-slavery men then in Congress . But the Missouri Compromise was repealed . In a Senate of sixty-two members , only fourteen voted against the bill . As had so often happened before , the demands of the South were granted . Instantly the Republican party sprang into being , taking for its creed opposition to the extension of slavery in the territories , while " popular sovereignty " became the rallying cry of the Democrats . The old issues were forgotten , and slavery became the one political question . The Whig party was dead , and although many Whigs became Democrats , many Democrats joined their old opponents in becoming Republicans . Then came the fierce and bitter struggle for the possession of Kansas , fought out largely in hand-to-hand encounter upon the soil of that new territory , the attempt fraudulently to force a slavery constitution upon the Kansas people , the final defeat of the proslavery party , and the admission of Kansas as a free state . As the southern leaders saw power slipping from their grasp , and realized that not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time was at hand when control of the government in all its branches would pass to enemies of southern institutions , angrier and more arrogant grew their demands , and firmer and more determined became the northern resistance . The supreme court issued the Dred Scott decision , John Brown attempted to capture Harper 's Ferry , Abraham Lincoln was // elected to the presidency , the southern states passed ordinances of secession , and active preparations for war began . Mr. Fessenden 's first term in the Senate was therefore crowded with exciting and momentous events ; and in all the legislative struggles of the time he bore a conspicuous part . The prominent position he had assumed at the beginning , he held to the end , as the little band of champions for freedom grew greater . He spoke frequently in the Senate , making notable speeches on the Lecompton Constitution and the Dred Scott decision ; but it was as a debater rather than as an orator that he shone . In debate he was always ready . Nobody could match him in immediate and incisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In sentiment he was thoroughly anti-slavery . It was his inheritance , and he was faithful to it . To all demands of slavery for recognition and protection his opposition was inflexible . When to be antislavery was to be anti-American , he was anti-slavery ; when his party would compromise , he dissented ; when , on the eve of rebellion , conference and concession were proposed , he would have no participation in it and would yield no assent ; and when war came for separation and independent slave power , he saw in it the nation 's opportunity . When the Republican party came into power , to Mr. Fessenden was assigned the difficult and important position of chairman of the Finance Committee . Here he was most conspicuous in sustaining the national credit during the war . He prepared and carried through the Senate all measures relating to revenue , taxation and appropriations ; and so much confidence was reposed in him and so great was his influence , that his bills almost always became laws substantially as he had reported them . As declared by Sumner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was in the financial field . " In one important instance he was outvoted . He objected to the Le gal Tender bill , and he stated his objections in one of his ablest speeches . He disputed the coicitention that such action was necessary . Although the credit of the government had been impaired , it was still strong ; but a measure of this kind would further injure it , as being practically a confession of bankruptcy . It would be in bad faith , for it would compel one to take in payment of a debt that which he would not otherwise be willing to receive and what would probably not be full payment . It would encourage bad morals by enabling men to pay their debts at a discount . It would inflict a stain upon the national honor incompelling foreign creditors to receive their debts in depreciated paper . It would change the values of all property . Instead of using gold and silver as the measure of values , a new measure would be adopted , which would be constantly fluctuating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a premium , and all other kinds of property would also appreciate . The heaviest loss would fall upon the poor . The constitutionality of the act was at best doubtful . The correctness of these views was soon apparent after the passage of the bill . All his predictions were fulfilled , and to the evils of a civil war were added the misfortunes of a depreciated and fluctuating currency . At the darkest hour of the war , in June , 1864 , Secretary Chase resigned the portfolio of the Treasury . To fill the vacancy , David Todd of Ohio was nominated , but he immediately sent a telegram to the President , declining the office . The nomination of Mr. Fessenden was then sent to the Senate , and was at once confirmed . Mr. Fessenden was completely surprised . He was at the White House , conferring with the President upon the situation of affairs in the Treasury Department when Mr. Lincoln told him that his own nomination was on the way to the capitol . He at once hastened to the Senate chamber to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed before he arrived . He sought to decline , but the President insisted that he must accept . Influential senators and members of the House promised to aid and support him with such financial legislation as he might wish , and public opinion , so far as it was made manifest in resolutions of chambers of commerce and boards of trade and in the editorials of leading party newspapers , called upon him to take the office . So he resigned his seat in the Senate , and became Secretary of the Treasury . This act showed greater political courage than those who urged him to it could realize . No one knew better than he the desperate condition in which the finances of the country then were . Credit seemed to be exhausted , paper money was very much depreciated , no new and untried source of revenue was apparent , and the demands for funds for prosecuting the war were increasing every day . Successful administration of the Treasury might well have seemed to him impossible , and yet upon him would fall the responsibility of failure , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessor or by circumstances beyond his control . In the Senate his position was secure . In entering the Cabinet , he staked his entire reputation and all his political prospects upon what must have seemed to be the most desperate chances . Mr. Fessenden 's career as Secretary of the Treasury has been too often referred to in a parenthesis ; yet during the eight months that he held his office he quietly and unostentatiously performed the most important public services of his life up to that time . When he assumed the office , July 5 , 1864 , the condition of affairs was , as he afterwards modestly described it in his report to Congress , " peculiarly embarrassing . " There was a cash balance on hand of about $i8 , ooo*ooo . The internal revenue averaged about three-quarters of a million a day , but the revenue from customs , which was payable in gold , bad been pledged to pay interest on outstanding bonds . It had been the policy of the Treasury to issue to government creditors , whom it was not convenient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payable in one year with interest at six per cent . At this time $i6i , ooo , ooo of these certificates were outstanding , and they were coming due daily in amounts more than sufficient to absorb the current revenues . Furthermore , in the summer of i86i , when it was believed that the war would be of short duration , a loan had been negotiated for three years , and these bonds , amounting to $110,000,000 , were coming due in August and September of 1864 . Pay to the army and current expenses generally were greatly in arrears . The unpaid requisitions upon the Treasury amounted to $92,000,000 . It had been decided to increase the army by 500,000 men , and Grant had given notice that he should fight it out on the line chosen by him , if it took all summer . This meant that the expense of prosecuting the war was about to be increased from two and one-quarter millions to three millions a day . To meet these enormous requirements money must be had immediately , else the government was bankrupt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic party that summer declared in convention , " the war was a failure . " There were three courses of action open to the Secretary . First , he might issue further certificates of indebtedness . This at best would be but a temporary expedient . The amount already issued exceeded the limit of safety , and the certificates were selling on the market at several points below par . Second , he might increase the issue of legal tenders ; but this he at once determined not to do if he could possibly avoid it . His original opposition to the Legal Tender act had been strengthened and confirmed by the results of that act . There were then outstanding about $6oo , ooo , ooo legal tenders , of which $43 i , ooo , ooo // were greenbacks and the balance treasury notes bearing interest , - and gold was at 285 . Third , he might borrow money through the sale of bonds . But the bonded debt of the government was then $8i6 , ooo , ooo . Just before resigning , Secretary Chase had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his advertisements for bids , which were published on June 25 , were withdrawn a week later , since it appeared that the loan would not be taken upon terms which it would be for the interest of the government to accept . Of these three courses , each thus beset with difficulties , the Secretary at once discarded the first two as impracticable for furnishing permanent relief , and determined to try to dispose of a new issue of bonds . Bonds which had heretofore been issued had been sold in most instances to banks , capitalists and syndicates , and by them placed upon the market , but it now appeared that this market would take no more except at a ruinous discount . Mr. Fessenden realized , however , that another market for government securities might well exist outside the stock exchanges of the great cities , in which market the people themselves might deal directly with the government without the intervention of brokers and middle men . In the people of this country he had full confidence . He firmly believed in their determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew , too , that the people had faith in the government . They were determined to win , and they believed that they would . He therefore determined to offer as a great popular loan the " seven-thirty " bonds which had just been authorized by act of June 30 , 1864 . If the people should be made to understand the financial necessities of the government , he believed their patriotism would induce them to assist the government with their means ; and as they had confidence in the ultimate success of the Union cause , he believed that government bonds would appear to them as a safe and desirable form of investment . But to carry out successfully the plan which he had in mind . would require a large and well-organized corps of assistants , such as the Treasury department did not possess and had not time to obtain . So the Secretary called to his aid Mr. Jay Cooke , who had before assisted the department in placing the " fivetwenties . " Mr. Cooke had organized in his own business an immense and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in every city , village and hamlet of the North the people should be thoroughly informed of this new loan . Local newspapers were furnished with full , accurate and carefully prepared information . Circulars and personal letters were sent out by the thousands , and in every way then known to the science of modern advertising these bonds were placed before the public . Opportunities were given to every one to subscribe ; and that the bonds might be within the reach of people of humble circumstances , they were issued in small , as well as large , denominations . The plan proved a pronounced success . The " seven-thirties " became very popular almost immediately . Money flowed into the Treasury in a constantly-increasing stream , and the financial embarrassment of the government was soon relieved . A most gratifying incident in connection with the sale of these bonds was the alacrity with which they were taken by the soldiers in settlement of the arrears of pay due them . The soldiers were not compelled to take the bonds . They were offered their pay either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over $20,000,000 in bonds were taken by them . The spectacle of soldiers in the ranks not only fighting the battles of their country , but also loaning the government money to carry on the war , is believed to be without historical parallel . When Mr. Fessenden left the Treasury , in March , 1865 , to take again the // seat in the Senate to which the legislature of Maine had re-elected him , the clonds of eight months before had disappeared . Threatened bankrnptcy had been averted , and the financial affairs of the government had been conducted to a position of safety ; the empty coffers had been filled , the obligations of the government had been met , and its badly shattered credit had been restored . To these results the victories of the Federal armies contribnted in no small measure , for no financial policy could have been long successful in the face of continned military defeat . But on the other hand , the firm will , the clearlydefined and well-sustained policy and the unflinching constancy of the Secretary , which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment and danger , had to no small extent made Union victories possible , for no campaign of any importance could have been conducted to a successful termination without the " sinews of war . " For his services in the Treasury Department Mr. Fessenden has never had the full credit that was his due . His predecessor has received unlimited praise for meeting the financial requirements of the first three years of the war , - requirements that were without precedent . But when Secretary Chase resigned , the financial necessities of the government , great as they had been before , were greater than ever . Secretary Chase raised by loans , in three years and four months , $8i6 , ooo , ooo , or about $2o , ooo , ooo a month , and of this $110,000,000 had to be met by Secretary Fessenden at the most embarrassing period . Mr. Chase also issued $6oo , ooo , ooo of legal tender paper and $162,000,000 of certificates of indebtedness . Secretary Fessenden raised by loans in eight months $450,000,000 , or $*6 ,  - -  000,000 a month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fessenden 's successor has taken to himself great credit for supplying without embarrassment the immense sums needed to pay off the troops when they were finally discharged , and for his success in refunding the " seven-thirty " loan . But Secretary McCulloch in the one case had merely to pay out money from a Treasury , which he found overflowing , and from which no further war expenses were to be paid , and intheotherto exchange for a maturing obligation worth only par one worth a premium of ten per cent and constantly appreciating . While Mr. Fessenden-held office , few knew the serious condition of the Treasury or could appreciate the measures taken for its relief . Great events were happening elsewhere , and the people were watching the armies . Generals had been produced at last who could and would fight , and those who led the northern arms to victory received from the people all the credit and all the glory for the salvation of the Union . The most difficult political problem of the century was perhaps that of reconstruction . Upon the surrender of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North . What should be done with her ? The Union had been saved ; how should it be preserved ? Slavery , which had been the curse of the republic , was dead ; what should be the status of the freedman ? The problem was complicated at the outset by a controversy between the executive and legislative branches of the government as to which branch had the constitutional power of seeking and applying a solution . First , President Johnson attempted to solve it alone . When he came into office , in April , i86* , upon the death of Lincoln , instead of then calling an extra session of Congress to deal with the many questions presented by the cessation of hostilities , he thought best to proceed without legislative assistance or hindrance . He therefore had until the following December for carrying on his experiments . At the beginning of this brief space of time , he was in favor of harsh and severe measures in dealing with the South , and talked vehemently of punishment ; // at the end , he was warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern oppression . He had , therefore , sought to restore the southern states in their former position in the Union as quickly as possible . First a proclamation of general amnesty was issued , excepting from its benefits only certain classes . Those excepted in the proclamation , however , were practically promised a full pardon if they would apply for it in person ; and over fourteen thousand availed themselves of this privilege . Conventions were then held in the different southern states , for revising the state constitutions and providing for the reorganization of the state governments ; and the people were soon called upon to elect state officials and members of Congress . Before Congress met , reconstruction according to the President 's plan was practically completed . New state governments had been organized , and United States senators and members of Congress had been elected . If the President 's acts were valid , there was nothing for Congress to do in the matter except to admit to their seats those claiming to represent the states lately in rebellion , and to proceed with the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . To Congressmen returning to Washington in December , 1865 , after a nine months ' absence , a strange spectacle was presented . When Congress had adjourned in March , the war was still in progress , the Confederate armies were in the field , and battles were still to be fought . When in December members returned for the first session of the next Congress , they found there many of the most prominent leaders of the rebellion coolly demanding the seats in the Senate and House of Representatives to which their various " sovereign peoples " had elected them . They had come to Washington not as petitioners , but as claimants , not as representatives of a defeated people to sue for mercy , but as if they themselves were victors to dictate terms of peace . In March they were attempting to overthrow the Constitution ; in December they were prepared to construe it to its defenders . The power of the government which they had failed to overthrow they now claimed to share . The successive acts of the President which had ended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indignation at the North , and the President soon found that he had almost entirely lost the support of the Republican party which had . elected him Vice-President . When Congress met , members were in no temper to listen to these claims for southern representation . They were hardly prepared to be even civil to the President , who had , as they believed , assumed the functions of Congress . It was at once decided to appoint a special joint committee on reconstruction , a resolution to this effect passing the House even before the President 's message was read ; and to this committee should be referred all the questions and all proposed legislation relating to the restoration of the late Confederate States . This was the famous " Committee of Fifteen . " It numbered among its mem-* bers the leo ding men of both parties ; and its chairman was Senator Fessenden . In the appointment of this committee , Congress had practically disregarded as of no legal validity the various steps taken by the President and by the southern people under his direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with alacrity , and publicly and privately encouraged the South to insist upon its demands . Utterly lacking in tact and discretion , and blind to the gathering storm of disaffection in the party which had elected him , he obstinately persisted in the course upon *Vhich he had started . Around him was gathering a party largely made up of office holders and flatterers , soon to lose , however , all but an insignificant num // ber of the Republicans , but to be reinforced by practically the entire Democracy . Congress was overwhelmingly Republican in both branches , and the members were early assured of the support of their constituencies in their opposition to the President . On the one hand was the North , angry and excited at the prospect of losing the legitimate fruits of its dearly-bought victory ; on the other was the South , as arrogant as before the war , as defiant as before defeat . It was evident that the peace , which had been hailed so joyously in the spring , had not yet come . The country was still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the method of carrying on the contest had changed . How could the contest be ended ? Upon what terms could a real and lasting peace be secured ? These were the questions for the committee to answer ; and the excited state of the public mind and the open and growing hostility between the President and Congress made them almost hop1elessly complicated and difficult . The report of the committee , which was made after a thorough and careful examination into the condition of the southern states , was anxiously awaited in the belief that it would shed light upon the darkness , and would point out the true path leading to a reunited nation . The report was written by Mr. Fessenden ; and it has been said of it that with the possible exception of the Proclamation of Emancipation it is the ablest state paper of the period . With perhaps the same exception , it is the most important . Clear and lucid in its style , admirable in its composition , faultless in its logic , convincing in its argument , thorough and complete in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations , it is a docume n't upon which Mr. Fessenden might well rest his reputation for broad , intelligent , patriotic and wise statesmanship . The influence of the report was immense . It became the creed of the Republican party , and the settlement of the ques tion therein proposed was considered throughout the country as reasonable , practicable and just . The committee 's plan of reconstruction was through the Fourteenth Amendment , which should be ratified by the southern states as a condition of readmission . The Fourteenth Amendment was accordingly adopted by Congress in accordance with the suggestion of the committee , and in nearly the same form in which the committee had drafted it . It was at once ratified by the northern states and also by Tennessee ; and that state was promptly readmitted to representation . But as the other southern states rejected the amendment , some other measure was necessary ; and in March , 1867 , ten months after the committee had presented its report , the Reconstruction bill was p'assed , by the terms of which the South was placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions previously offered should be accepted . This bill made loyalty to the government the sole requirement for suffrage , thereby enfranchising the negroes while disenfranchising all unpardoned rebels . Under these circumstances the conditions imposed by Congress were soon complied with ; and the South came back into the Union through the votes of its former slaves . In thus granting suffrage to the negro , which grant was made perpetual by the Fifteenth Amendment , a grave error was committed . It may be said that the negro , who had been constantly loyal to the government and had fought in the Union ranks , ought to have as much right to vote as the white man who had been but recently pardoned for disloyalty and rebellion ; but it was surely an error to grant the negro such right and not protect him in the exercise of it . By means of bulldozing , terrorizing and fraud , the negro vote was promptly suppressed just as soon as the Federal troops were withdrawn . The Fifteenth Amendment has been and is // openly disregarded and defied , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Congress has been powerless to interfere . Instead of a boon to the colored man , suffrage has been a hindrance . Instead of diminishing the power of the southern white man , the Fifteenth Amendment has largely increased it ; for the southern states have been increased in power in the House of Representatives and in the electoral college by counting the colored men as voters , and this power has been wholly exercised by the whites . By forcing negro suffrage upon the southern states the Republican party placed in their hands the means by which its own overthrow was to be accomplished . Mr. Fessenden , although he had from his earliest days been an opponent of slavery , and had always been a true friend to the colored race , was not in favor of negro suffrage as a condition of reconstruction . When the proposed Fourteenth Amendment was before the Senate , it was most forcibly attacked by Mr. Sumner because it did not grant universal suffrage , and Mr. Fessenden , in his reply , contended that it was in all respects better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding out to them , however , the prospect of increased representation whenever they should make suffrage universal . Negro suffrage might thereby appear as for the interest of the South , and the negroes would in time be enfranchised by act of the states themselves . Had the negro received the right from the state , he would have been much more likely to be protected in its exercise . Mr. Fessenden was now at the height of his power and influence , and was the recognized leader of his party in theSenate . He had therespectof his opponents , and calumny and slander had spared him . Had death here ended his career , the mourning would have been far more general and sincere than that which actually occurred two years later , and his memory would have been far more warmly cherished by his contemporaries than has been the case . But another great public service remained for him to perform - to vote " Not guilty " on the impeachment of Andrew Johnson . By so doing he forfeited all his popular support , lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a party leader . For the first time in his life , he was subjected to general and unmitigated abuse , much of it coming from those who had long looked to him for leadership . It would be beyond the limits of this paper to review , even briefly , the acts of the President which so aroused against him the antipathy of the northern Representatives and led them to seek his removal from office . Prominent among these acts may be mentioned his vetoes , his exercise of the pardoning power , his appointments , and his messages to Congress . Many of them merited , doubtless , the severe criticism which they received ; but such offenses were political , and could not properly subject him to impeachment . But these were what had raised against him the most enemies , and could he have been legally impeached for them , he would not have held office longer than the time necessary for a fair trial . In his exercise of the powers of the presidential office he had antagonized opinions as to public policy which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing he had acted strictly within his constitutional rights could have little weight with the mass of the people , who desired his removal and were unused to legal distinctions . In his speeches and public addresses he had often shocked and even outraged good taste , and he had been unmindful of the proper dignity of his office . In desiring his removal for this cause , it was forgotten that Congress had no constitutional right to set itself up as a school for manners . The North desired his removal , and this desire was based upon acts and opinions of his // for which he could not be impeached ; but long before he was put upon his trial before the Senate , he had been tried and condemned by public opinion at the North , so that when the impeachment came , the people insisted and demanded that he be adjudged guilty , regardless of the truth or falsity of the charges actually preferred against him in the articles of impeachment Among the leading political opponents of the President was Senator Fessenden . No two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect , habits of thought , manner and political opinions , they were in pronounced and irreconcilable opposition . They had practically nothing in common ; and for Johnson 's character Fessenden had a supreme contempt . Yet while the Senate was sitting as a court of impeachment , Mr. Fessenden realized that his duties were then judicial and not political , and that he must base his decision upon the articles presented and the testimony offered in support of them , not upon anything outside of the record . Personal and political considerations must be wholly disregarded . The charges brought against the President were in themselves not serious . The gravest of them was that he had attempted to remove a member of his cabinet , Secretary Stanton , without the advice and consent of the Sei ; - ate . This , it was contended , was a violation of the Tenure of Office Act . If this were so , the violation was technical . The act alleged to have been violated was of doubtful propriety , and was , in fact , soon after repealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no excuse for its violation . But had President Lincoln or President Grant disregarded the provisions of this law in precisely the same way , it was charged , President Johnson had done , there would never have been a thought of impeachment . In Johnson 's case , however , it offered an portunity which had long been waited for , and the incident was seized upon as furnishing means by which really the President might be punished for sins which in themselves could not be directly reached . But even on the question here presented , as to whether the President in removing Mr. Stanton had acted outside of his constitutional and legal rights , there was a grave difference of opinion among those equally competent to judge . Able and learned constitutional lawyers maintained that the law had been violated , and lawyers no less able and no less learned maintained the contrary . Mr. Fessenden was one of those who held the latter view , and believed that the President had a legal and constitutional right to remove Mr. Stanton in the manner and at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow his acting upon this view did not deter him , and in his opinion filed in the case he thus referred to it : " To the suggestion that popular opinion demands the conviction of the President upon these charges , I reply that he is not now on trial before the people , but before the Senate . In the words of Lord Elden , upon the trial of the Queen , I take no notice of what is passing out of doors , because I am supposed constitutionally not to be acquainted with it ; ' and again , it is the duty of those upon whom a judicial task is imposed to meet reproach and not court popularity . ' The people have not heard the evidence as we have heard it . The responsibility is not on them , but upon us . They have not taken an oath to do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws . ' I have taken that oath . I can not render judgment upon their convictions , nor can they transfer to themselves my punishment if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeserving the confidence of that just and intelligent people who impose upon me this great responsibility , and unworthy a place among honorable men , if for any fear of public reprobation , and for the sake of securing popular favor , I should disregard the convictions of my judgment and my conscience . The consequences which may follow conviction or acquittal are not for me , with my convictions , to consider . The future is in the hands of Him who made and governs the universe and the fear that He will not govern it wisely and well would not excuse me for a violation of His law . " // The vote of the Senate was thirtyfive for conviction and nineteen for acquittal , Mr. Fessenden voting with the minority ; and since the necessary twothirds had not voted " Guilty , " the President was not convicted . A change of a single vote given for acquittal would have changed the result . Seven Republican senators voted " Not guilty , " and upon them was at once poured the vials of public wrath , since any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the vast majority of the people so ardently desired . Among the members of the House who voted for impeachment was Mr. Blame , and he has since said : " Sober reflection of later years has persuaded many who favored impeachment that it was not justifiable on the charges made , and that its success would have resulted in greater injury to free institutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was able to inflict . " But Mr. Fessenden did not live until " sober reflection of later years " could persuade his detractors that they had been unjust to him . Before the anger which his action had aroused had subsided , he died at his home in Portland , September 8 , 1869 . For , the last ten years of his life he had not been well . In 1858 he had been one of the victims of a mysterious sickness which broke out among the guests of the National Hotel in Washington , from the effects of which he never fully recovered . In the onerous duties imposed upon him he had doubtless overworked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first thought to be not serious , it proved more than he could bear , and in about a week after he was first attacked he died . The suddenness of his death especially shocked the community in which he had lived ; and there , at least , recent animosities were at once forgotten in the universal effort to do honor to his memory . The funeral services which took place in the First Parish church , where he had been a constant attendant , were largely attended , crowds waiting on the steps from early morning until the church should be open . The streets were lined with people as the funeral procession passed . All flags were at half mast both in the city and on the shipping in the harbor , all the bells of the city tolled , and minute guns were fired from the fort and arsenal . That the mourning was widespread and sincere was self-evident . Portland had lost her greatest citizen , the greatest man who had ever lived within her walls . Mr. Fessenden was not what is called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that quality best described , perhaps , as " personal magnetism , " such as was possessed in such marked degree by that other distinguished son of Maine , who soon after occupied his seat in the Senate , - Mr. Blame . The people believed in his integrity , had confidence in his judgment , and admired his ability , but they were not inspired with a feeling of personal loyalty and of intense and unquestioned devotion to himself and his fortunes . His character did not appeal to their emotions . It was not their love he won . He appealed to their consciences and to their common sense , and they followed him because they were convinced that he was right . He , was reserved and dignified in manner , and was perhaps somewhat aristocratic , had little patience with those whom he considered bores , cared nothing for the patronage of his position , and was often short and sharp with office-seekers . He had great contempt , which he took no pains to conceal , for those who were in politics for what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits naturally made him unpopular with certain classes , and gave him a reputation of being cold and unapproachable , but to those admitted to his personal friendship he was a most genial comp*inion , and was by them held in such close affection as to prove such reputation undeserved . No man had warmer friends , and they knew , as perhaps others did not , that a truer , // kinder heart than his beat in no other human breast . Fessenden exercised in private life the same virtues that made his public career conspicuous . He had no private vices such as dim the lustre of the fame of Clay . He was always a perfect gentleman , courteous and refined . He was slight in figure , with erect and dignified carriage , and his face , finely cut and attractive , without being handsome , bore an expression of shrewdness and sagacity that did not suggest cunning . During the later years of his life he was so engrossed in public affairs that he had little time and less inclination for social life , and except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He often seemed indifferent to popular opinion . He was , perhaps , too much so . Yet he was peculiarly sensitive to praise and censure , the more so , doubtless , because he was unwilling to purchase the one or seek to conciliate the other by concessions which he regarded as venial . He was not the man to feel the public pulse before making up his own mind . He was governed by principle , not by policy . But in the application of principles no one was more practical . He was not a theorist , and while believing that moral principles should underlie legislation , he realized that perfect righteousness is not always attainable in this world , and that what may be theoretically right is sometimes beyond the power of human legislatures to enact . He was remarkably modest . He never distributed copies of his speeches , and he made no collection of his works for publication . He underestimated the importance of his public services . He had self-confi deuce , but not self-assurance ; selfrespect , but not self-conceit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their language and in the clearness of their composition . There are in them no metaphorical or other figurative expressions , no classical allusions or poetical quotations . They appealed to the reason and the common sense , not to the passions or the imagination . His was not an eloquence to move the masses , nor to win the applause of the galleries , but was most effective in bringing senators to his point of view . To him the Senate was a legislative body , an assembly convened for business , not an audience for oratorical display . He spoke not to win applause , but to win votes . Consequently , it was as a debater , not as an orator , that he excelled , and in the parry and thrust of general debate he was without a peer . Fessenden was vigorous and strong in intellect , keen and sagacious in judgment , practical in striving for results , but the great overshadowing elements of his fame and character were an integrity of purpose yielding to no temptation , persuasion or circumstance , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Utterly indifferent to danger , he trod only the straight path of rectitude . Maine had never had a son before of whom she was so proud . The Senate of the United States never bore upon its long distinguished roll a name deserving more honor : a model senator , with a character that was Roman in the highest sense , inflexible , yet courteous , pure without ostentation. // L 0 N D 0 N literary newspaper devoted a page of one of its recent *ssues to the subject of Books to be Written , " calling attention to what it felt to be real lacks in the library and giving some definite and detailed suggestions to writers about supplying the need . It is certainly with some misgiving and terror that one reads such a page of hints as this . In this day , when the scriptural word is so fully realized , and of making many books there seems indeed no end , what is to become of us if we are to have men w&gt;o set their wits to work to suggest innumerable new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so prolific ? We have ourself long been in the habit of refusing such suggestions to youthful literary aspirants , and some unyouthful ones , asking if we did not think of something for them to write about . We have begged such not to write at all if they could possibly help it , ifas in the case of getting married or preaching the gospel-they did not feel a distinct call and subjects did not command them instead of having to be sought and conjured . We still think it good advice on general principles , and in the true interest of a long-suffering generation . Yet as for the London newspaper , we could but feel that almost all of its suggestions - for certain needed guide-books , scientific handbooks , histories and novels-were reasonable and good , and that if the hints were taken up by the right men , we should be better off and not worse off . 130 But what the London newspaper 's suggestions of " books to be written " chiefly did for us was to revive old thoughts which we have had about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed more than once of late , as so much has been said of the importance of the taking up of impressive American subjects by our American artists to whom the new opportunities of decorating our many new public buildings are opening up larger visions and giving commands for larger subjects and a nobler manner . We have remembered not a few noteworthy hints which have been given American artists by some noteworthy men ; and it seems worth while to bring some of these together here , in the hope that they may prove to be seed falling upon good soil .
