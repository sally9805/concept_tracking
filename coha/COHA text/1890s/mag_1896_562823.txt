txt MILITARY jurisdiction is of four kinds , viz. : 1 . Military law , which is the legal system that regulates the government of the military establishment . Military law is a branch of the municipal law , and in the United States derives its existence from special constitutional grants of power . 2 . The law of hostile occupation , or military government , as it is sometimes called ; that is , military power exercised by a belligerent over the inhabitants and property of an enemy 's territory , occupied by him . This belongs to the law of war , and , therefore , to the law of nations . 3 . Martial law applied to the army ; that is , military power extended in time of war , insurrection , or rebellion over persons in the military service , as to obligations arising out of such emergency , and not falling within the domain of military law , nor otherwise regulated by law . It is an.application of the doctrine of necessity , founded on the right of national self-preservation. 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by which is meant military power exercised in time of war , insurrection , or rebellion in parts of the country retaining allegiance , and over persons and things not ordinarily subject to it . It is to this last-mentioned kind of military jurisdiction that these remarks apply . Whether , under our political system , such a jurisdiction can exist , and , if so , what it is and by whose authority , or under what circumstances it can exist , and what would be its justification ? as to these questions theories widely differ . For , even by those who admit that it may exist , it is claimed , on the one hand , that it is a constitutional power vested in Congress , and , in cases of emergency not admitting of delay , in the President ; and , on the other hand , that it is purely the // THEY NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . doctrine of necessity as applied to the right of national selfpreservation ; neither expressed nor included in any written law , but depending for its justification upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject were clearly stated in the celebrated case of ex pane Milligan ( 4th Wallace , United States Supreme Court Reports , p. 2 ) , in which five of the justices sustained the theory of necessity , and the Chief Justice and three others contended for what , for the sake of convenience , I will call the constitutional theory . The majority of the court held as follows " It follows , from what has been said on this subject , that there are occasions when martial rule can be properly applied . If , in foreign invasion or civil war , the courts are actually closed , and it is impossible to a*ninister criminal justice according to law , then , on the theatre of active military operations , where war really prevails , there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority , thus overthrown , to preserve the safety of the army and society ; and as no power is left but the military , it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its duration ; for , if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated , it is a gross usurpation of power . Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open , and in the properand unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction . It is also confined to the locality of actual war . Because , during the late rebellion it could have been enforced in Virginia , where the national authority was overturned and the courts driven out , it does not follow that it should obtain in Indiana , where that authority was never disputed , and justice was always administered . And so in the case of a foreign invasion , martial law may become a neces sity in one State , when , in another , it would be mere lawless violence . ' " On the other hand , the minority , consisting of Chief Justice Chase and Justices Wayne , Swayne , and Miller , said : " There is no law for the government of the citizens , the armies , or the navy of the United States , within American jurisdiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And further , what may be denominated martial law proper ( i. e. , martial law at home ) , " is called into action by Congress , or temporarily , when the action of Congress can not be invited , and in the case of justifying or excusing peril , by the President , in times of insurrection or invasion , or of civil or foreign war , within districts or localities where ordinary law no longer adequately secures public safety and private rights . " I can not but think that the opinion of the majority presents the true doctrine-that of necessity . There is a difference of views as to whether the fact that the courts are closed is the conclusive test of the existence of the necessity justifying a resort to martial law , or rather that the fact that the courts are open is // conclusive proof that the necessity does not exist , but this is not the main question at issue . That question is : What is the justification , law or necessity ? And this question is of vital importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of military power . But it is evident at first sight that there can be no such safeguard if there is not an ultimate responsibility on the part of him who has committed the arbitrary act , whether in person or by deputy . That is to say , when the war is over , there must be an ultimate responsibility before the courts . There can be no other safeguard than that . Take that away and the people are without any protection against the invasion of their civil rights by the military power . In the arraignment of the King of England in the Declaration of Independence it was said : " He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power ; " and , carrying out the principles of that arraignment , the makers of our Constitution agreed upon a bill of rights which was at all times and under all circumstances to prevent encroachment by the federal government on the citizen 's inalienable rights of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " ARTICLE IV. - The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . " ARTICLE V.-No person shall be held to answer fora capital or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .

" Chief Justice Chase , in the minority opinion in ex pane Milligan , said : " We agree in the proposition that no department // of the government of the United States-neither President , nor Congress , nor the courts-possesses any power not given by the Constitution . " But he further says : " Congress has the power not only to raise and support and govern armies , but to declare war . It has , therefore , the power to provide by law for carrying on war . This power necessarily extends to all legislation essential to the prosecution of war * ith vigor and success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conduct of campaigns . That power and duty belong to the President as commander-in-chief . Both these powers are derived from the Constitution , but neither is defined by that instrument . Their extent must be determined by their nature and by the principles of our institutions . " The power to make the necessary laws is in Congress ; the power to execute in the President . Both powers imply many subordinate and auxiliary powers . Each includes all authorities essential to its due ex*cise . But neither can the President , in war more than in peace , intrude upon the proper authority of Congress , nor Congress upon the proper authority of the President . Both are servants of the people , whose will is expressed in the fundamental law . Congress can not direct the conduct of campaigns , nor can the President , or any commander under him , without the sanction of Congress , institute tribunals for the trial and punishment of offences , either of soldiers or civilians , unless in cases of a controlling necessity , which jnstL fies what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the justice of the legislature . " We by no means assert that Congress can establish and apply the laws of war where no war has been declared or exists . " Where peace exists , the laws of peace must prevail . What we do maintain is , that when the nation is involved in war , and some portions of the country are invaded , and all are exposed to invasion , it is within the power of Congress to determine in what States or districts such great and imminent public danger exists as justifies the authorization of military tribunals for the trial of crimes and offences against the discipline or security of the army or against the public safety . " I confess that I can not understand how this can be true when we have all these safeguards of the Constitution , which we know are not suspended by war ; for as the Supreme Court has said , " the Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people , equally in war and in peace , and covers with the shield of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under all circumstances . " * It is true that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus may be suspended during insurrection or invasion , but , as Judge Cooley says : " The suspension does not legalize what is done while it continues ; it merely suspends for the time this particular remedy . All other remedies for illegal arrests remain Not , of course , those against whom war is being waged. - Miller v. U. 5. , 11 Wallace , 288. // and may be pursued against the parties making or continuing them . " Had the framers of the Constitution suspected that there lurked somewhere in it so dangerous a doctrine as that the safeguards of the bill of rights could be set aside by legislation , the Constitution in its present form would never have become the organic law of the United States . For the danger is this . If that military power over civil rights , which we call martial law , can be called into existence by Congress by virtue of its constitutional powers , the military person , who acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it ; for Congress in enacting such a law would be acting under a constitutional political power ; the act would be a political act ; Congress would be the judge of its necessity ; and the necessity could not be inquired into by the courts . Congress can not be controlled by the courts in the exercise of its political discretion . If it has the constitutional power to legislate on the subject at all , it must have the power of deciding on the occasion for the legislation . Is this not true of all the legislative powers ? Is the power to regulate commerce , the power to declare war , the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus during rebellion or invasion , subject to a judicial examination of the necessity or occasion for the legislation ? Can its expediency be inquired into by the courts ? Certainly not . The exercise of such a power is a political measure with which the courts can not interfere . " Redress may be given in court for an excess or usurpation of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an impeachment , or at the polls . Nor can a court declare a statute unconstitutional and void when the objection to it is merely that it is unjust and oppressive , and violates rights and privileges of the citizen , unless it can be shown that such injustice is prohibited or such rights and privileges guaranteed by the Constitution . The propriety or justice or policy of legislation , within the limits of the Constitution , is exclusively for the legislative department to determine ; and the moment a court ventures to substitute its own judgment for that of the Legislature , it passes beyond its legitimate authority and enters a field where it would be impossible to set limits to its interference , except as should be prescribed in its own discretion . The protection against unwise or oppressive legislation , within constitutional bounds , is by an appeal to the justice and patriotism of the representatives of the people . If this fail , the people in their sovereign capacity can correct the evil , but courts can not assume their rights . The judiciary can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution . It can not run a race // of opinions upon points of right , reason , and expediency with the lawmaking power . The question of the validity of a statute must always be one of legislative competency to enact it ; not one of policy , propriety , or strict j uistice2 ' * And so , if Congress has the constitutional power to declare martial law in time of war , the courts can not enter the field of its legislative discretion in the exercise of this power . Congress may abuse its power and put forth martial law , though there be no actual necessity for it , but the courts will not be able to give any redress for the abuse . If the Constitution confers this power on Congress , its decision as to the expediency of having recourse to it must be conclusive on the courts . What , then , becomes of the theory of ultimate responsibilitythat is to say , of the ultimate liability-in the courts oi the military person exercising this kind of military power ? The legislative act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the person injured would be without remedy . f In Mitchell v. Harmony ( 13 Howard , U. S. Supreme Court Reports , 427 ) the doctrine of necessity considered as the basis of a military war power-applied in this case to the taking of private property-was thus stated by Chief Justice Tanev : " There are , without doubt , occasions in which private property may lawtully be taken possession of or destroyed to prevent it from falling into the hands of the public enemy ; and also where a military officer , charged with a particular duty , may impress private property into the public service or take it for public use . Unquestionably , in such cases , the government is bound to make full compensation to the owner ; but the officer is not a trespasser . " But we are clearly of opinion that in all of these cases the danger must be immediate and impending ; or the necessity urgent for the public service , such as will not admit of delay , and where the action of the civil authority would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is impossible to define the particular circumstances of danger or necessity in which this power may be lawfully exercised . Every case must depend on its own circumstances . It is the emergency that gives the right , and the emergency must be shown to exist before the taking can be justified . " In deciding upon this necessity , however , the state of the facts , as they appeared to the officer at the time he acted , must govern the decision ; for he must necessarily act upon the information of others as well as his own observation . And if , with such information as he had a right to rely upon , there is reasonable ground for believing that the peril is immediate and menacing , or the necessity urgent , he is justified in acting upon it ; and * cooley 's Constitutional Law , page 148. t See , in addition to ex parte Milligan , Griffin s .

Jones , 44 Illinois . 142 ; Hare 's American Constitutional Law , Volume II. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sec. 709 , et seq . // the discovery afterwards that it was false or erroneous will not make him a trespasser . But it is not sufficient to show that he exercised an honest judgment , and took the property to promote the public service ; he must show by proof the nature and character of the emergency , such as he had reasonable grounds to believe it to be , and it is then for a jury to say whether it was so pressing as not to admit of delay ; and the occasion such , according to the information upon which he acted , that private rights must for the time give way  --  to the common and public good . " We , therefore , have the two cases of ex pane Milligan and Mitchell v. Harmony , in which the Supreme Court of the United States rested the justification for the setting aside of the established safeguard of personal rights on necessity alone . Professor Hare finds in Mitchell v. Clark ( 110 , U. 5. , 630 ) , a dangerous recognition by the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the decision in that ca* will bear and should receive a different construction . The important question in the case was the constitutionality of the Acts of Congress of March 3 , 1863 , and May 11 , 1866 , whose object was the protection of military persons against suits for certain acts done by them during the war without authority of law . The fourth section of the act of March 3 , 1863 , is as follows : " Sec. 4 . And be it further enacted , That any order of the President , or under his authority , made at any time during the existence of the present rebellion , shall be a defence in all courts to any action or prosecution , civil or criminal , nending , or to be commenced , for any search , seizure , arrest , or imprisonment , made , done , or committed , or acts omitted to be done , under and by virtue o* such order , or under color of any law of Congress and such defence may be made by special plea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of May 11 , 1866 , gave this provision a more extended application . With regard to the act of 1863 , Professor Hare says : " This statute assumed that Congress may provide that an order from the President , or under his authority , shall be a justification for any search , seizure , arrest , or imprisonment done or committed by virtue of such order , or under color of any law of Congress , irrespective of the circumstances , and whether these did or did not require the exercise of arbitrary power . It operated as a declaration of martial law throughout the length and breadth of the United States , by authorizing any commanding officer , of whatever grade , to arrest and imprison the citizen or despoil his goods , irrespective of the circumstances , or the necessity which alcne can justify an arbitrary deprivation of the natural rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . It was therefore directly in the teeth of the principles laid down in expcsrte Milligan , and may hereafter serve as a foundation on which to erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision in Mitchell v. Clark upholding the constitn tionality of these acts he says that " contrasting this decisio* with the language held in Mitchell v. Harmony we seem to be in another land and under a different system of jurisprudence , and no one who was not assured of the fact would believe that both judgments were delivered by the same tribunal . " And yet it is quite certain that Mr. Justice Miller who delivered the opinion in Mitchell v. Clark could not have attached that meaning to his words , for in his " Lectures on the Constitution " he says : " A state of war does not change the relation of a citizen to his government , or displace the civil authorities outside the theatre of conflict " ( citing ex parte Milligan ) ; " what it may do there depends upon the circumstances and exigencies of the c*se " ( citingMitchell v. Harmony ) . The acts of 1863 and 1866 related to three matters , viz : the removal of certain cases from State to United States courts ; the protection contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a limitation to two years for suits growing out of illegal acts committed during the war . Mitchell v. Clark was decided upon the question of the constitutionality of the limitation provisions ; recognizing the right of Congress to fix a limit to the jurisdiction of the United States courts and thus to the jurisdiction of State courts in cases which can be removed from them to United States courts . In regard to the fourth section of the Act of 1863 the court made use of this language " It is not at all difficult to discover the purpose of all this legislation . " Throughout a large part of the theatre of the civil war the officers of the army , as well as many civil officers , were engaged in the discharge of very delicate duties among a class of people who while asserting themselves to be citizens of the United States were intensely hostile to the government , and were ready and anxious at all times , though professing to be noncombatants , to render every aid in their power to those engaged in active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For this state of things Congress had provided no adequate legislation , no law by which the pcweys of these officers were so enlarged as to enable them to deal with this class of persons dwelling in the midst of those who were loyal to the government . " Some statutes were passed after delay of a general character , but itwas seen that many acts had probably been done by these officers in defence of the life of the nalAon for which no authority of law could be found , though the purpose was good and the act a necessity . " For most of these acts there was constitutional power in Congress to have authorized them if is had acted in the matter in advance . It is pos // sible that in a few cases , for acts performed in haste , and in the presence of an overpowering emergency , there was no constitutional power anywhere to make them good . " But who was to determine this question ? and for service so rendered to the government by its own officers and by men acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant no relief ? " That an act passed after the event , which in effect ratifies what has been done , and declares that no suit shall be sustained against the party acting under color of authority , is valid , so far as Congress could have conferred such authority before , admits of no reasonable doubt . These are ordinary acts of indemnity passed by all governments when the occasion requires it . " In the legislation to which we have referred in the act of 1863 , and the amendatory act of 1866 , Congress seems to have well considered this subject , By the fourth section of the act of 1863 it undoubtedly intended to afford an absolute defence , as far as it has power to do so , in this class of cases . " Now , there is absolutely nothing in this language to indicate that in the opinion of the Supreme Court Congress could do more than by a retrospective law legalize what it might have legalized in the first instance . On the contrary it contains the express admission that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw no line , to lay down no rule pointing out what kinds of things Congress may and what it may not thus legalize . It simply says that which Congress may under its recognized constitutional power authorize to be done it may when its authority is not given in advance cover with an act of indemnity . There does not seem to me to be anything in this decision justifying the conclusion that the Supreme Court intended to fly in the face of its decision in exparte Milligan and to lay down a different theory of martial law from that of necessity as there explained , or indeed to lay down any theory of martial law at all . It has been claimed that the Reconstruction Acts are also instances of the exercise by Congress of its martial-law power ; but they were not so regarded by the Supreme Court . That court , having under consideration the relation of the United States to States in and after rebellion , said " These new relations imposed new duties upon the United States . The first was that of suppressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations of the State with the Union . The first of these duties having been performed , the next necessarily engaged the attention of the National Government . " The authority for the performance of the first has been found in the power to suppress insurrection and carry on war ; for the performance of the second , authority was derived from the obligation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a re // publican form of government . The latter , indeed , in the case of a rebellion which involves the government of a State , and for the time excludes the national authority from its limits , seems to be a necessary complement to the former . " ( Texas v. White , 7 Wallace , 727 . ) According to the Supreme Court , therefore , the governments under the Reconstruction Acts were not the result of an exercise of the war power of Congress , but of the power to guarantee a republican form of government , which is an entirely distinct and independent power . Dr. Francis Lieber , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the armies of the United States in th' field , " which was found among his papers after his death , wrote as follows " As to martial law at home , which may become necessary in cases of foreign invasion , as well as in cases of domestic troubles , it has full sway in the immediate neighborhood of actual hostilities . The military power may demolish or seize property , or may arrest persons , if indispensable for the support of the army , or the attaining of the military objects in view . This arises out of the immediate and direct physical necessity , as much so as the law of trespass is inoperative against those who forcibly enter . a house in a case of conflagration . This operation of martial law is not exclusive or exceptional . Any immediate physical danger , and paramount necessity arising from it , dispenses with the forms of law most salutary in a state of peace . " The subject of the greatest difficulty connected with martial law is its existence in a country distant from the scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of insurrection . How far may it extend in point of geographical limits ? How far may it extend iu intrinsic action ? Can it be dispensed with under all circumstances ? How can people devoted to liberty limit its action so that it may not become a means of military despotism ? " It can not be dispensed with under all circumstances , and if there were a law prohibiting it , it would break through the law in cases of direct and absolute necessity . The salvation of a country is like the saving of an individual life-it is paramount to all else . . " It has been denied that the government has any right to proclaim martial law , or to act according to its principles , in districts distant from the field of action , or to 4leclare it in larger districts than either cities or counties . This is fallacious . The only justification of martial law is the danger to which the country is exposed , and as far as the positive danger extends , so far extends its justification . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for the protection of the state ? It is , indeed , given as a reason why the military officer should not be held to a strict accountability under the doctrine that necessity alone will justify his act , that he will often find himself in // the embarrassing and even dangerous dilemma of having to choose between imperilling the public interests with which he is entrusted and the risk of being held personally to account . But , as we have seen in Mitchell v. Harmony , the rule of necessity for an act done on the theatre of war is not that the necessity must be absolute , but that it will be measured by its surrounding circumstances , as they appear at the time when the act is done ; and away from the theatre of war , which is the greater evil-that the military officer who is at least free to exercise his judgment should be responsible , or that the innocent citizen and community , who have no choice , but must submit to the military power , should suffer ? Chief Justice Chase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted both theories of justification-martial law as a legislative act and martial law as founded in necessity . He expressed it in this language : " It is called into action by Congress , or temporarily , when the action of Congress can not be invited , and in the case of justifying or excusing peril , by the President , in times of insurrection or invasion or of civil or foreign war , within districts or localities where ordinary law no longer adequately secures public safety and private rights . " To the theory of the martial-law power of Congress others , however , add the further principle that the citizen whom the enforcement of an act of Congress authorizing martial law has injured in person or property has his remedy in the courts ; so that their theory on this point , taken all together , is that Congress has the power under the Constitution to declare martial law when necessary in time of war , and the courts may determine the constitutionality of such an act according to their judgment of its necessity . For the reasons already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this power . If they did , all legislation of Congress would be subject to the supervision of the courts as to the necessity or occasion for it . It has also been asserted that the principle that the constitutional power to declare war includes the power to use the customary and necessary means effectively to carry it on lies at the foundation of martial law . I can not agree to the proposition . It is positively repudiated by those who justify martial law on the ground of necessity alone , and the Supreme Court of the United States stands committed to no such theory . It is contended // that martial law may be authorized by Congress or resorted to by the President or his officers without such authorization , and that in either case its justification is necessity , and that though it be authorized by Congress the officer who enforces it is liable to have his acts judicially investigated and measured by the rule of necessity . But there is no foothold for such a theory . If Congress can declare or authorize a resort to martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside the safeguards of the Constitution and substitute military power , or authorize it to be done , its doing so places the military act which it authorizes entirely beyond the reach of the courts , ' and there is no protection for him who is threatened with it , nor redress for him who suffers by it . It can not be that the law of the land is so impotent . Thus far we have been considering the powers of the national government and not of the States . When we come to consider the latter we find ourselves face to face with a political fact quite inapplicable to the former . Congress has no powers save those granted to it by the Constitution , whereas the Legislature of a State has a general power to legislate on all matters which can be made the subjec*t of legislation , subject to the restrictions of the constitutions of the United States and of the State . " In creating a legislative department and conferring upon it the legislative power , the people must be understood to have conferred the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exercised by , the sovereign power of any country , subject only to such restrictions as they may have seen fit to impose , and to the limitations which are contained in the Constitution of the United States . The legislative department is not made a special agency for the exercise of specifically defined legislative powers , but is intrusted with the general authority to make laws at discretion . " * Therefore , in order to ascertain whether Congress has a certain power we look to see whether it is delegated to it by the Constitution ; but when the question is whether the legislature of a State possesses it we look to see whether it is withheld from it by the Constitution of the United States or of the State . It follows that the existence of a power in Congress can not be inferred from the existence of a similar power in the State legislature . I call attention to this because it has been attempted . In the case of Luther v. Borden ( 7 Howard , 1 ) the right of a * Cooley ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its military power in suppressing forcible resistance to its authority was considered . On the occasion which gave rise to this suit the Charter Legislature of Rhode Island passed an act declaring the State under " martial law " and calling out the militia , for the purpose of overcoming those engaged in an attempt to overthrow the established government ; and in carrying out this purpose one of its officers , in obedience to the orders of his superior , broke into the house of a person engaged in this unlawful attempt for the purpose of arresting him . The Supreme Court said : " In relatbn to the act of the Legislature declaring martial law , It is not necessary in the case before us to inquire to what extent , nor under what circumstances , that power may be exercised by a State . Unquestionably a military government , established as the permanent government * the State , would not be a republican government , and it would be the duty of Congress to overthrow it . But the law of Rhode Island evidently contemplated no such government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the peril in which the existing government was placed by the armed resistance to its authority . It was so understood and construed by the State authorities . And , unquestionably , a State may use its military power to put down an armed insurrection too strong to be controlled by the civil authority . The power is essential to the preservation of order and free institutions , and is as necessary to the States of this Union as to any other government . The State itself must determine what degree of force the crisis demands . And if the government of Rhode Island deemed the armed opposition so formidable , and so ramified throughout the State as to require the use of its military force and the declaration of martial law , we see no ground upon which this court can question its authority . It was a state of war , and the established government resorted to the rights and usages of war to maintain itself , and to overcome the unlawful opposition . " In regard to this case it is deserving of particular notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theory that Congress has the power to declare martial law , in the sense in which we have been using that term . It is true that this was a case of socalled " martial law " declared by the legislature , but what did the legislature mean by it ? The term has no fixed meaning even at the present day ; different writers still give it different meanings . When the legislature of Rhode Island made use of it in 1842 it probably was intended to have no more definite meaning than that the militia of the State was to use its military power to suppress the enemies of the State . It was an authorization to do what was done when the military officer broke into the house of one of the enemies of the State in order to arrest him . He was a public enemy against whom the military power had been // called out . It is evident that this is not the kind of martial law which we have been discussing . And although the legislature did call it forth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon which department of the government possessed the power ; and accordingly the Supreme Court did not consider this question , but only the more general one whether the State possessed it . If the legislature in declaring martial law meant only to authorize the use of the military power of the State to put down its enemies , it exercised a legitimate legislative power , and this was probably all that it did mean , because the facts of the case of Luther v. Borden correspond with this view . In whichever way we look at it , that case is no authority for holding that in Congress is vested that martial-law power which we have been considering . If the question were at the present time to arise whether the legislature of a State has the power to declare martial law , we would , in the first place , consult the Constitution of the United States , and there we would find this prohibition : " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liberty , or property , without due process of law , nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . " The Constitution of the United States affords protection , therefore , against the danger of a declaration of martial law by the legislature of a State as well as against the danger of its decclaration by Congress . The principle holds true both as to the United States and the States that the only justification of martial law is necessity . It is a well-settled principle that when a person is vested by law with a discretionary power his decision within the range of his discretion is conclusive on all , and therefore binding on the courts . This rule has been applied to the subject of martial law , and it has been contended that the officers who enforce it are acting within the range of their discretion , and are protected by the principle which makes them the judges of the necessity of the acts done in the exercise of a martial-law power . From my standpoint such an application of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial law is nothing more than the doctrine of necessity called out by the State 's right of self-defence the officer can have no discretion in the matter . He will or he // will not be able to justify according to his ability to prove the necessity for his act ; he will find no toleration of the plea that the necessity for his act , and therefore its justification , can not be inquired into by the courts because he was acting within the sphere of his lawful discretion . The officer is not by any law vested with a discretion in this matter . Such a discretion and the doctrine of necessity can not exist together . But this necessity need not be absolute , as determined by events subsequent to the exercise of the power . The Supreme Court has , as we have already seen , laid down the rule much more favorably to the person using the power . It is worth re-peating : " In deciding upon this necessity , however , the state of the facts , a they appeared to the officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must necessarily act upon the information of others as well as his own observations . And if , with such information as he had a right to rely upon , there is reasonable ground for believing that the peril is immediate and menacing , or the necessity urgent , he is justified in acting upon it , and the discovery afterwards that it was false or erroneous will not make him a trespasser . But it is not sufficient to show that he exercised an honest judgment , and took the property to promote the public service ; he must show by proof the nature and character of the emergency , such as he had reasonable grounds to believe it to be , and it is then for a jury to say whether it was so pressing as not to admit of delay ; and the occasion such , according to the information upon which he acted , that private rights must for the time give way to the common and public good . " Under the Constitution of the United States there can never be any justification for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than the rule of necessity as thus applied.
