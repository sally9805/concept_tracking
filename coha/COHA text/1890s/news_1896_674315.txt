txt The ground taken by President ROOSEVELT as to the degree of control the Police Commissioners should have over the force under them is one that TEE TIMES has steadily urged for many years as sound . If it were now a new proposal , that the power of dismissal should be used by the Commissioners who are responsible for the force and its work , only on the approval of the courts of ldw , it would be seen to be absurd . You can not hold men fairly or in fact responsible for doing a thing when you withhold from them the means of doing it . A good police force requires good police officers , and if the Commissioners can not remove officers whom they think not good , they can not secure the best force , can not do the best work , and can not be blamed for not doing it . Not only Commissioners who sincerely seek to do good work are prevented from doing it , but Commissioners who do n't care for good work , political schemers , personally greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do bad work and escape accountability . The system is bad clear through and has a bad effect in every direction . It never was intended to promote efficiency . The only plausible argument for it was that it would prevent abuse by the constantly changing Commissioners . It has not done that in the past , while it has helped wrongdoers on the commission to hide their wrongdoing , The only logical and practical system ' is to give the head of the police force ample power and then keep a strict account of its use . And the only possible means of securing accountability is to concentrate power . This is recognized in business enterprises , and they are never successful where it is not recognized . It is recognized and applied in the army and navy , which are by far the most efficient branches of the public service . We shall never have a really efficient police force in this city until that principle is adopted .
