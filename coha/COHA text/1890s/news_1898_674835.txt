txt The Madrid correspondent of The Times , telegraphing Saturday , says : " in the Chamber of Deputies to-day Sefior Osma. a highly respected Deputy , questioned the Government , among other matters , as to whether a blockade can legitimately be made effective by obstructing a port with sunken ships , mines , or torpedoes ; whether it is allowable for a belligerent in this fashion to obstruct a port which is not formally blockaded ; whether an effective blockade , once interrupted , must be formally reproclaimed , and whether it is legitimate for a belligerent to employ as allies semi-civilized natives living under the jurisdiction of an opponent , especially when there is reason to apprehend that the latter will ' Commit all manner of excessas , now happily unknown in civilized warfare . " Duke Almodovar de Rio , the Foreign Minister , in the course of a very guarded reply , expressed the opinion that an interrupted blockade must be reproclaimed . He said the question as to whether the blockade from Cardenas to Bahia Honda was formally proclaimed had been submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America , he proceeded , was operating against Santiago apparently on the assumption that a blockade of that port had never been formally proclaimed . " Duke Almodovar said he would not conceal his opinion that the attempt to block the entrance to Santiago Harbor was unjustifiable , adding that the use of mines for such a purpose had been condemned by such eminent authorities on international law as Sir Richard Webster , the British Attorney General , and Desjardins , the French jurisconsult . With reference to ' exciting and arming barbarians , ' the Foreign Minister was careful to avoid accusations against the Washington Government ; but he gave the Chamber clearly to understand that in his opinion a nation professing humanitarian sentiment- , by instigating rebellion among a population capable of pillaging . devastating , violating , and torturing , would incur a tremendous moral responsibility in the eyes of the civilized world .
