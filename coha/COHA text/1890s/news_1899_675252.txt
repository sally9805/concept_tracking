txt Herman Hauser , Treasurer of the Herald Square Theatre , jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday afternoon . Unless he received internal injuries , which can not be known definitely until to-day , he will exDerience no serious result from his plunge of 125 feet into the river . Hauser had been to Coney Island and was on his way back to the city on a Third Avenue car of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit system , when he took it into his head to join the long list of bridge jumpers . It was about 4:30 o'clock when the car reached the middle of the bridge , on the north driveway . Hauser suddenly leaped from the car , climbed the guard rail , and jumped into the river . He turned several somersaults in his descent , but struck the water feet first . Frank Ludwig , a passenger on board the ferryboat Southampton , which had just left James Slip and was almost directly under the Bridge , leaped into the water , and after a sharp struggle managed to obtain hold of Hauser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was conscious , although completely exhausted by his jump , was attended by Dr B. G. Strong , Coroner 's Physician . Officer Richard Godson of the , Astoria Precinct , who was also on the Southampton , placed the jumper under arrest . The officer , doctor , and prisoner were transferred soon afterward to the tug Richard Moran and landed at Corlears and South Streets . An emergency call was sent in , and Dr. Fleischauer of Gouverneur Hospital , who responded , took the exhausted man to the hospital . Hauser did not seem to be seriously injured . He complained , however , of pains in his chest and side , which may be indicative of internal injuries . Policeman Godson reported the arrest to the police at the Delancey Street Station , who turned the case over to the custody of the Bridge police . JUMPED FOR A LITTLE GIRL . On board the Third Avenue car , on which Hauser was a passenger , were also a gentleman and a little girl . Just back of them sat Hauser . As the car started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" she inquired , " Several persons have tried it , " the tattler replied , looking troubled and quietly nudging the little one to be still . She subsided for a moment , and then , a thought striking her , called out : " Say , papa , I 'd like to see somebody jump off . " " Well , I 'm afraid you wo n't get your wish to-day , " . replied the father as everybody on the car smiled . " Wo n't she ? " came a voice in reply . " jump for the little girl : .

Stopping for a single instant , and waving his hand toward the people on the car , he sprang from " the rail and disappeared , revolving over and over as he fell . Before jumping he threw off his coat . When picked up he was dressed in a silk outing shirt , black trousers , and tan shoes . The jumper 's sister . Miss E. Hauser , with whom he lives at 323 West Thirty-sixth Street , went to see him at the hospital last night . After she returned to her home she said that her brother had been drinking , and that his jump was without doubt to be accounted for in this way . He had not been at all depressed , she said , and had not been under any sort of strain . He went to Babylon , L.

At the hospital the physicians confirmed Miss Hauser 's theory as to the cause of her brother 's act . At 10 o'clock they said that he had not even then fully recovered from the effect of his drinking . Hauser himself recognized two or three friends , who went to see him , and told them that he had been drinking at Coney Island . The physicians said that it would be impossible to tell until to-day whether he had sustained any internal injuries . THE JUMPER 'S RESCUER CHEERED . Frank Ludwig , who saved Hauser 's life , is an employe of the Long Island Express Company at James Slip . He is thirty years of age , and lives at 20 New Chambers ' Street .

Every drop of blood in me seemed eager to jump in after that drowning man . Anybody would have done it . " Ludwig 's brother , Emil , was a lifesaver at Coney Island last year . Hundreds of people saw Hauser 's jump . Most of the electric cars on the bridge were crowded with passengers , who jumped off and for a few minutes completely blocked all traffic in their efforts to see what had become of the jumper . Among the men who made desperate efforts to get to Hauser before he reached the top of the . guard rail were William Gannon , the bridge rigger , and Officers English and Walsh of the bridge squad .

Many of the passengers saw Hauser take his plunge , ' and there was great excitement an.ong th sm . When tile jumper and his rescuer were struggling in the water there was an intense strain , which gave way to a loud cheer when It was seen that Ludwig 's effort had been successful .
