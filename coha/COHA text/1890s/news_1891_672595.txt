txt Our London dispatches yesterday morning reported the impression that prevails among observers of European politics that the tie binding the members of the triple alliance is so far loosened that it may be regarded as practically severed , and that the three great powers of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy are seriously considering a general reduction of armaments . The very great eh ange in the European situation implied in the mere currency of such an impression is obvious . It is not a twelvemonth since European correspondents were still engaged in watching the horizon for the appearance of the " war Cloud " which was the constant object of their thoughts , while there were many grave men who discussed with anxiety the course of affairs in the Balkan peninsula , the plots of the Greek politicians , the incidents in the relations of France with Italy or with Russia , the manipulation of the Egyptian finances , and other things apparently even more minute , with reference to the spark that they believed might at any moment light the fires of war throughout Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seriously considered in this century would have been laughed at . And now it is at least the impression of well-informed men that it is being considered very seriously . Do we Americans realize what such a change as that would mean to us ? We have no immediate political relations with the powers of the triple alliance or with those whom it was formed to keep in check . But we have a considerable interest in the commerce of the world which these powers with Great Britain largely control , and we might have an interest therein many times larger than we have . It is in its effect upon this vast and complex body of relations that the plan of possible disarmament concerns us . For : twenty years now the four great powers of Western Europe , Germany , France , Austria , and Italy , have kept under arms a force of men varying from 1,200 , - 000 tok 600,000 , while the latest reports put the number of troops , all trained by regular service , having given from three to five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in time of war , at not less than 9,000,000 . Besides these there is the army of European Russia , ranging on a peace footing from 500,000 to 900,000 men , and on a war footing from 2,000,000 to 2,500 , - 1 000 . Taking only the powers of Western Europe above mentioned , we find that a total population of 155,000,000 , yielding not more than 25,000,000 men of military age , and a still smaller number of ablebodied men , is obliged to give up constantly at least one in sixteen of these to the armies . In case these armies are put on a war footing , the proportion of men in arms to the men of adult age would be one to less than three . In time of peace , therefore , the productive laboring force is directly diminished by at least one-sixteenth , while that remaining is taxed to pay the cost of the maintenance and training of those withdrawn , besides the enormous cost of the supply and renewal of war material and equipment , including a large sum for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day from the product of the labor of these nations , already reduced by the withdrawal of the strongest young men , is , economically , absolute waste . It produces nothing , and even if it may be said to save the nations from the greater sacrifices of war , its advantages are purely negative . Now if , by the wisdom and courage of the young Emperor of Germany , a serious reduction is made in this great burden , the necessary and immediate consequence will he to stimulate production , to lessen its cost , to develop the improvement of methods and machinery , to increase the energy of the mercantile and industrial classes , and to impart a steadily progressive activity to ever branch of commerce in every part of the world . How does this country stand with reference to the new or newly-widened contests of trade thus presented I It stands with its hands bound by gratuitous , unequal , unnecessary , and oppressive taxation imposed on the general body of the Nation for the exclusive advantage of a small proportion of each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present Congress , which can not immediately be done away with , there is not an industry of any importance in the whole country that is not burdened by heavy and vexatious taxation upon its materials or its machinery , while every industry largo and small must feel the increased cost of living due to almost universal taxation of the necessaries of life or of trade , not for the benefit of the Treasury , but for that of a small number of favored capitalists and monopolies . In other words , the foolish and unscrupulous leaders of the Republican Party have subjected the freest country of the world to arbitrary and costly restraints at the moment that the older nations of Europe are trying to relieve themselves , from burdens that , at least , had the ap-. - pearance of necessity to justify them . Partisan greed and the abuse of partisan power impose on our people a load that the most arbitrary Governments of modern Europe would not venture to undertake to place on theirs .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
