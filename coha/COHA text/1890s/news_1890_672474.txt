txt The speech of Mr. PADDOCK of Nebraska in the Senate yesterday is full of meaning for those who care to find meaning in it . It was made in sorrow rather than in anger . The Nebraska Senator declared that he was a believer in the principle of protection ; that be recognized the great difficulties with which the Finance Committee had had to deal and the honest work it had done , and he should vote for its bill . But , like Mr. BUTTERWORTH in the House , he gave the strongest possible reasons why the bill should not pass , why the policy it embodied should not be continued . He declared that protection had done its work and overdone it , until it was time that the hands of the infant industries should be forcibly removed from the skirts to which they were clinging . He had interpreted the Republican platform , and so had the farmers of his constituency , to mean that revision of the tariff was to be reduction . Now this is precisely what Mr. PLUMB has been saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate . The significance of Mr. PAnnocn 's attitude , as well as that of Mr. PLUMB , is that they are representative in their views , but not necessarily in their action . They may condemn the policy of their party and yet vote for it , but thousands and tens of thousands of plain farmers in the West who also condemn it , may vote against it , and against the party that clings to it after all these warnings . If this prove to be the case ? and it is as certain as anything in politics can be  --  where are the Republicans to make up for the votes thus lost ?
