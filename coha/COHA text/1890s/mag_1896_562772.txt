txt THE chief obstacles to the progress of education in England*. are party spirit and religious intolerance . Proposals for educational reform are discussed and decided , not in a philosophical spirit , but with all the acrimony of partisans . Yet it is admitted that the case is a very urgent one ; that England is engaged in a struggle with her foreign competitors not only for the supremacy but even for the very existence of her industries ; that her workers are worse instructed than their rivals , and are on that account going to the wall ; and that better education , both elementary and technical , is vital to the continuance of her prosperity . It is the fact that in both town and country elementary instruction is so backward that , even if adequate technical schools were provided , the mass of the people are unfitted to take full advantage of them . Yet , notwithstanding all this , English statesmen will postpone reform indefinitely if they can see their way to secure a party ad vantage thereby . The only hope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , the position of education , both elementary and technical ; may become agreed as to the direction in which development ought to take place , and may force P*rliament and the government to grapple with the difficulties which have to be overcome . The origin of all education in England was voluntary ; there were no elementary schools established by public authority before 1870 ; there were no technical schools so established before 1 *90 ; and there are no public colleges for the training of teachers at the present moment . The duty of the State to assist elementary education was fulfilled by subsidizing schools established by the philanthropic efforts of religious bodies . The defect of thIs // system was that it could not cover the ground . In the poorer quarters of great cities , where masses of workers were congregated , there were multitudes of children requiring instruction , while the richer classes , by whose subscriptions alone the necessary schools could be maintained , had gone to live elsewhere . It was the necessity of making some provisiQn for elementary education in such places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principle of that act was the division of England into school districts , consisting of the metropolis , the boroughs , 4**d the parishes outside of boroughs . Every one of these districts which had not sufficient accom'modation for the children who ought to be in school could be compelled to form a School Board , which was under a legal obligation to equip and fi*rnish the necessary schools , and which had the power to levy rates to an unlimited amount to pay for them . This Act has been in operation for a quarter of a century . Its results have differed greatly in the boroughs and in the country districts . The questions now affecting town and country schools are so distinct from each other that it will conduce to a clearer understanding if an entirely separate consideration is given to each class . Two-fifths of the children of school age are to be found in the metropolis and in the large county boroughs having their own school boards . In these the Act of 1870 has worked in a most satisfactory manner ; the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely desirous of promoting good education and who take a lively interest in municipal government , and they have established thoroughly efficient schools . Some persons attach extraordinary value to the fact that the members of school boards are elected for the express purpose of managing schools . It is doubtful whether any real advantage has been obtained by this arrangement , and whether the same results would not have been attained if the school authority had been a committee of the Municipal Council . However this may be , the effect of the school-board system in boroughs has been greatly to raise the level of elementary education , and at the same time to increase its cost , with the general assent , however , of the rate-payers who have to furnish the money . There are two obstacles which hinder the full measure of success being attained . The first is the short time which the children remain in the elementary schools . Till recently , the age // for exemption from full-time attendance at schooX was ten . It is now eleven , and in some boroughs has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The value of the child 's labor is too great a temptation to parents and employers , and the general interest the communitythave in keeping children longer at school is not sufficiently realized to counteract this strong motive . But if we choose to sacrifice our children at so early an age to the necessities of their parents or to the industries of the enuntry , we must not expect to find them so apt to receive technical instruction as the German or Swiss child who has been kept at school to the age of fourteen . Until the school age is raised , English children can not be turned out by the borough board schools as well equipped for further instruction as the Continental children who are to b* their future rivals . The second obstacle to complete success is the fact that the school board system in boroughs does not cover the ground . Of seven children educated in boroughs , three are educated in voluntary schools , as against four in board schools , and these voluntary schools do not in general possess the means of giving so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this ground many persons , zealous for the improvement of secular education , hope that the voluntary schools will soon suffer painless extiuction ; but their hope is not likely to be realized , for two reasons First , becanse of the cost . The subscriptions , the unpaid man2gement , and the bnildings of the voluntary schools , save the rate-payers a considerable expense which they would have to incur if the voluntary system were abandoned . The second reason which prevents the extinction of voluntary schools is the religious sentiment of a considerable number of the people . The people of England desire generally that religious instruction should be given to their children , and accordingly religion is taught by most school boards . It is a new kind of religion established by law and popularly known by the name of " Undenominationahism , " and it consists of so much of the doctrines of Christianity as do not conflict with the tenets of any particular church or sect . The Nonconformists generally like this religion , it differs little from what they teach , or used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents of the children , who are usually indifferent to the particular doctrine which is taught to // their children , do not raise any objection , especially as the teachers , who have become , as Mr. Disraeli stated in 1870 , " a new sacerdotal order , " are a sacerdotal order which does not attempt to make proselytes . But the system of undenominational teaching is objected to by a considerable section of the Church of England , by the Roman Catholics , possibly by a few bodies of religious dissenters , and by the Jews . The " Undenominationalists " meet the objectors with religious intolerance . They consider that people ought to be satisfied with their teaching , and if L ) ot that it should be forced upon them . It is the determination to have definite religious teaching on the part of a considerable proportion of the population , that will prevent the absorption of denominational schools . They would not be utterly destroyed even if the parliamentary grant were to be wholly withdrawn . If these schools are , therefore , sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be maintained in an efficient condition . At present , although there are numerous exceptions , it is true , as a general rule , that the secular instruction given in the voluntary schools in boroughs is inferior to that given in the board schools . The expenditure of the former is less ; upon an average in boroughs the voluntary school managers spend from local sources ten shillings per child in - average attendance , while board schools spend twenty-five shillings , a difference of fifteen shillings per child ; and thirteen shillings of this difference is accounted for by a difference in the amount spent on the teaching staff . The teachers in voluntary schools are paid lower salaries , the assistants have lower qualifications , the proportion of children to teachers is greater , and child labor is more extensively employed . Thus it is evident that if the voluntary schools are to be maintained in a proper condition of efficiency the managers must have more money . They can not obtain this by increased subscriptions , for in the boroughs the subscribers to voluntary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they are unwilling to submit to the injustice of bearing a double burden . In board school districts the subscriptions to voluntary schools in proportion to the children maintained are considerably lower than in districts which have no school boards . If denominational schools can expect no further support from voluntary subscribers , they can only look either to an increased // grant from the imperial government , or to aid from the borough rates . The objection to the former is that it can neither be adequate nor permanent . The difference in expenditure between the voluntary and board schools is , as above stated3 fifteen shillings per child ; and a grant of four shillings per child , which is all that is likely to be obtained from the Imperial Exchequer , would go a very small way towards placing the two classes of schools upon an equality ; besides this , it is not reasonable to suppose that the cost per child in board schools will be arrested at the figure of twenty-five shillings . It has increased greatly since 1870 , and no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit by a hard and fast line the cost of elementary education is as absurd as to attempt to limit the cost of a gun or a war ship . The rivalry of nations is continually increasing the cost of these instruments of war , and the rivalry of nations may continually increase the cost of education . Besides , not being adequate , there is no security that the grant from the Exchequer would be permanent . An act of Parliament is no security , even if the House of Lords were powerful enough to withstand its repeal , for if a party were to come hereafter into office determined to prevent the differential treatment of voluntary schools , they could cut off supplies in the House of Commons , and render impossible the distribution of any exceptional grant . The other method suggested of giving to the managers of denominational schools the means of improving the secular instruction is by assistance out of the rates . In this matter there are two parties concerned , the managers and the rate-payers , and both have a common interest in securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and management for the common purpose , provided they are allowed in return to the children , and are indifferent to the particular religious instruction afforded so long as liberty of conscience is secured . If no obstacles were thrown in the way these two parties would inevitably come together and make an agreement . It was originally proposed in the Act of 1870 that such power should be given to the town councils of the boroughs ; it was owing to party considerations that this power was struck out of the bill . It is perhaps too much to expect that Parliament will confer // on town councils full power to act in this matteras they think best for the interest of the ratepayers ; for although in England people express themselves generally in favor of local self-government they are seldom willing to leave discretion to local authorities unless they feel certain that the discretion would be exercised in the way which they approve ; but Parliament might be willing to prescribe a form of contract which should be allowed to be made between the party representing the rate payers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they should receive assistance out of the rates . It is clear that relief given to the managers of voluntary schools by means of a rateaid would be both adequate and permanent . It would be adequate , because it would be the interest of the party repr*esenting the rate-payers to secure full efficiency in secular instruction , and it would be permanent , because if arrangements acceptable to local authorities were once in satisfactory working order , Parliament would find it quite impossible to disturb them . There are certain boroughs in which the generally successful Act of 1870 does not work satisfactorily , because in them the burden which the act imposes on the rate-payers is intolerable . These are boroughs in which an abnormal proportion of the inhabitants are poor ; in which there are a multitude of children to teach , and a very low ratable value upon which . to levy rates . Such a difficulty was foreseen in the Act of 1870 and was supposed to be provided for . It was then thought that seven shillings and six pence per child would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply , and that about three pence in the pound would be about the average rate which would meet such a demand ; it was , therefore , prescribed by the Act of 1870 that where the rate of three pence in the pound did not raise an amount of seven shillings and six pence per child the local contribution should be supplemented by such a Parliamentary grant as would make up the deficiency . Now that the cost per child to be defrayed out of local resources has risen to twentyfive shillings , such a provision has become wholly inadequate . If , in boroughs like West Ham and Gateshead , inhabited by a population which works in London and Newcastle , the schools are to be kept efficient , either much more imperial assistance must be provided , or the areas must be included for purposes of education in the cities to which they economically belong . // Of the remaining three-fifths of the children , many are , it is true , in boroughs and urban parishes in which the position of education approaches more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large proportion are in rural parishes where the Education Act of 1870 has been much less successful , and where the general level of education is very far below the city standard . It is the opinion of those who are experienced in elementary education that , in country districts , schools under the charge of school boards are generally inferior to those which have voluntary managers . Rural school boards are costly and inefficient , and have failed to establish schools which are superior to the voluntary schools around them . Yet there is no part of the country in which education is more necessary to the preservation of English industry . Manufacturing districts are still struggling against their foreign competitors , and are in many cases holding their own ; but the agricultural interest is already beaten . The greater part of the food of the English people must of necessity be supplied by foreign competitors . But not only are bread and meat , the great staples of agricultural production , imported from abroad , but such articles as eggs , poultry , butter , and vegetables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supplied to a great extent from Normandy , Belgium , Holland , and Denmark . If anyone contrasts the elementary and technical instruction imparted to the children of the peasantry in these countries and in England , as well as the amounts spent by the respective governments thereon , there is no reason for surprise at the defeat of English agriculture ; and it is impossible to refrain from asking whether better education of the people would not tend more to the relief of agricultural depression than remedies like bimetallism or protection . The understandings of all those who are connected with the cultivation of the soil appear to be darkened . The landowners exhibit that dislike to intellectual development which is characteristic of a territorial aristocracy ; the farmers regard the imitation of the methods of their forefathers as the highest agricultural art and scoff at the teachings of science ; and the laborer 's children are turned out of school to scare crows when eleven years old , and often by the connivance of the school attendance officers , who are under the thumb of the farmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children YOI* . CLXIII. - NO. 479. 28 // get no further instruction ; they have no means of keeping up the little knowledge they have obtained ; and in a few years they forget everything they have learned , and are often incapable even of reading and writing . How can such a population compete with the French agriculturists , carefully trained in schools and colleges in the art they are to practise ? The mere distribution of a capitation grant from government amongst the country schools would not raise rural education . Unless ear-marked and appropriated to specific purposes , it would all go in relief of subscriptions and rates . As between board and voluntary schools , the case of the towns is reversed ; in the country the latter are better off than the former ; there is no competition and no necessity for levelling up as in the towns ; the voluntary schools can hold their own without further pecuniary support . The rates levied in school-board districts are a greater burden upon the people than the subscriptions in parishes which have voluntary schools ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable the instruction given in them to be levelled up to the same efficiency as that given by their rivals . So general has become the conviction of the disadvantage of having a school board in a country district , that in many parishes voluntary rates are cheerfully paid by the inhabitants in order to escape such a catastrophe , and when a country parish lapses into a school-board district it is generally the result , not of want of money , but of some parochial quarrel . No improvement in education is possible in rural districts until the voluntary schools are grouped by some system of federation , and until the areas of school districts are enlarged and some educational authority is provided which is more fit to manage schools than the village board . Until such an enlargement takes place , there is no possibility of establishing in rural districts any plan for a common training of the young teachers ; there is no opportunity for the employment of itinerant teachers to go from school to school and there is no scope for an organizing teacher who might improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective character of rural education was proved in 1891 , when a considerable sum in the hands of the Exchequer , which was originally intended for the extinction of public-house licenses , and which is popularly known as " The Drink Money , " came into the hands of the county councils for the purpose of // promoting technical instruction . Whenever the council of an agricultural county attempted to apply these funds directly to the instruction of the mass of people , the operation proved a failure . Those councils which applied their funds to the technical instruction of teachers no doubt succeeded in filtering some amount of knowledge into the rural mind , but the lectures upon bee-keeping , cottage gardening , poultry-keeping , cookery , and so forth , which were delivered in rural villages , were but little frequented by the peasantry and their families , and the technical instruction afforded was enjoyed by an entirely different class from that for which it was intended . It is thus evident that , as a preliminary to any attempt to give to the cultivator of the soil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi* rivals on the Continent , it is necessary to improve his elementary education , so as to make him fit to receive higher learning . The action of the government , which is intended to promote in England education higher than elementary , is ill-designed and ineffective . Public money is spent for this purpose through three distinct channels . First , the Science and Art Department , which is a branch of the Education Department , distributes grants to all schools and classes which give instruction in science and art upon a defined system . It gives this money as a payment for results , so much for every pupil who passes an examination prescribed by the department in various branches of science and art . Whether payment by results is a good method for promoting the particular kind of instruction for which grants are given may be doubted , but at all events it has the effect of injuring and depressing those subjects of instruction which are not within the curriculum ; the literary side of education has suffered severely in many of our secondary schools from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects , and it is very likely that on the whole the distribution of these grants has produced as much evil as good . The second source through which public money is spent in promoting secondary education is through the operation of the Technical Instruction Acts , the first of which was passed in 1889 . Under these acts the councils of counties and county boroughs are empowered to levy a rate , and spend the proceeds in the promotion of technical instruction , either by subsidizing i udepend // ent institutions , or by establishing institutions of their own . The grant of the " drink money , " above referred to , in 1891 , put considerable means into their hands , and enabled them to carry the provisions of the Technical Instruction Acts into practical effect without adding to local burdens . The action of the local authorities and the expenditure of the " drink money " must be confined to what is defined in the acts as " technical or manual instruction " ; but the deilnition of the former includes all the subjects of science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of instruction ( including modern languages and commercial and agricultural subjects ) sanctioned by the Science and Art Department on the representation of a local authority that such a form of instruction is required by the circumstances of its distvict . With so wide a definition , the Technical Instruction Acts might be so extended as to be applicable to all secondary education without any violent disturbance of their existing operation . The third way in which public money is expended in the promotion of secondary education is through the higher grade schools established in many of the great cities by the school boards . The school boards are in this particular exceeding the functions for which they were originally designed ; but in the absence of any more regular mode of providing the people with that secondary education which the necessity of the times so urgently demands , their proceedings are undoubtedly highly approved by the people for whom they act ; and any attempt to curtail by legislation the operation of school boards in this direction , without providing some better alternative method by which the wants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through these three sources a considerable amount of public money is expended upon secondary education . It amounted in 1894 to ? 1,424,404 , and it might have amounted , if all the powers of the various acts had been made use of , to ? 2,381,184 . There is , however , no concert between these different authorities ; their operations seriously overlap . Schools are inspected by several sets of inspectors , and draw their funds from distinct and different sources ; there is urgent need for co-ordination to prevent the waste of effort which must otherwise prevail . A Royal Commission on Secondary Education , which reported in // that unfortunately , so far from tending to cure itself , it was an evil which every day struck its roots deeper ; that vested interests were being created which would stand in the way of the needed reforms ; that the difficulty of introducing the needful coherence and correlation became constantly greater , and would be more serious a year or two thence than it was at that time . It is indispensable to have for this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public money should flow . That district should be the county , because that is already the area of the Technical Instruction Acts . The county authority should have both primary and secondary education under its jurisdiction ; first , because these two shade insensibly into one another , and it is impossible to draw a line , with all the subjects of primary education on one side and all those of seconday edu*ation on the other ; and secondly , because the higher grade schools , which are processes of the elementary education system , already occupy the ground . Two separate authorities would be in conflict from the outset , and there would be a certain margin of education to which each party would assert its claim , and which it would be impossible to assign satisfactorily to either . It is obvious from this survey of the condition and prospects of education in England that the early attention of the government and of Parliament to this subject is most urgently demanded ; but if every attempt to promote the reform and development necessary for the progress of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to be recklessly thwarted for the sake of a party victory , and if the difficulties which have been pointed out are to be made greater still by the infusion of sectarian and religious animosity , it is very improbable that a system of education can be established which will enable the workers of England to compete on fair terms with their foreign rivals . Public opinion , has , however , already , to a considerable extent , removed questions of foreign policy and of the national defence from the party arena ; it may do the same for national education , and compel both parties to shape their policy with a due regard to national interests.
