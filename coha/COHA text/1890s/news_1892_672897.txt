txt William D. Bynum , Congressman from Indiana , talked very freely on national matters to-night . " What do you think of Cleveland 's chances for the Presidential nomination 1 " he was asked . " I think they are improving every day . I can not express an opinion as to whether or not he will be nominated , for the condition of things is constantly changing . I can say , however , that be is very strong in the West , and is constantly grooving stronger . Indiana 's delegation to the National Democratic . Convention will probably oast a complimentary vote for Gray , provided he does not attempt to swing the delegation against Cleveland after it is sure that he can not be nominated . The people of Indiana  --  that is , fully 00 per cent . of them  --  are strong for Cleveland as against any outside man . They believe he is the strongest man that could be nominated . " " How about Hill I " " I thought at one time that Hill 's prospects for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , do not seem to be directed as the people desire and look lot in a Presidential candidate . I do n't know as his Southern trip has done him any good or any harm , but it has probably confirmed the people in the belief that he was pursuing the Presidency with too ranch zeal and too little discretion . I think Cleveland can carry New-York , and believe he will have the earnest support of the Tammany Democracy in cage of his nomination . I have attended a number of Tammany meetings , and never was at one-where the mention of Cleveland 's name did not provoke greater applause than the mention of Hill 's . " ? ? What is the silver status now ? , " " The free-silver people were knocked out . My judgment is that the bill will snot pass the House . There will be urgent efforts made by the extreme free silver wing , represented by Speaker Crisp and Mr. Bland , to bring the matter before the House , probably on Monday , and in doing so I apprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering the previous question on the bill and its amendments at a specified time . Such a rule will be obnoxious to many Democrats who are supporting the bill , and its passage will depend upon the action of the Republicans . It is unquestionably a fact that many Republicans are willing to do everything they eau to promote the passage of the bill through the House . They are willing to do anything they can to do this except to vote for it directly . Now that the responsibility for the passage of the measure rests upon almost each and every member , what course they will pursue I am unahle so say . " Will there be any new features in the tariff argument ? " " I think not . I think the strongest thing for us to do is to pass the wool schedule , putting wool on the free list . I want to see the Eastern Senators , and particularly those from Rhode 1 Island , come right up on that issue . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
