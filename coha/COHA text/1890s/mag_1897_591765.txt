ATLANTIC MONTHLY : A MA *AZINE OF LITERATURE , SCIENCE , ART , AND POLITICS ' . VOL . XXXIV. - SEPTEMBER , 18T4. - No . CCIII. - 4-  WHO WAS SHE ? COME , now , there may as well be an end of this ! Every time I meet your eyes squarely , I detect the question just slipping out of them . If you had spoken it , or even boldly looked it ; if you had shown in your motions the least sign of a fussy or fidgety concern on my account ; if this were not the evening of my birthday , and you the only friend who remembered it ; if confession were not good for the soul , though harder than sin to some people , of whom I am one , - well , if all reasons were not at this instant converged into a focus , and burning me rather violently , in that region where the seat of emotion is supposed to lie , I should keep my trouble to myself . Yes , I have fifty times had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But who can be certain that his best friend will not smile - or , what is worse , cherish a kind of charitable pity ever afterwards - when the external forms of a very serious kind of passion seem trivial , fantastic , foolish ? And the worst of all is that the heroic part which I imagined I was playing proves to have been almost the reverse . The only comfort which I can find in my humiliation is that I am capable of feeling it . There is n't a bit of a paradox in this , as you will see ; but I only mention it , now , to prepare you for , maybe , a little morbid sensitiveness of my moral nerves . The documents are all in this portfolio , under my elbow . I had just read them again completely through , when you were announced . You may examine them as you like , afterwards : for the present , fill your glass , take another Cabafia , and keep silent until my " ghastly tale " has reached its most lamentable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three years ago last summer . I suppose most unmarried men who have reached , or passed , the age ' of thirty - and I was then thirtythree - experience a milder return of their adolescent warmth , a kind of fainter second spring , since the first has not fulfilled its promise . Of course , I was n't clearly conscious of this at the time : who is ? But I had had my youthful passion and my tragic disappointment , as you know : I had looked far enough into what Thackeray used to call the cryptic mysteries , to save me from the Scylla of dissipation , and yet preserved enough of natural nature to keep me out of the Pharisaic Charybdis . My devotion to my legal studies had already brought me a mild distinction ; the paternal legacy was a good nest-egg for the incubation of wealth ,  --  in short , I was a fair , re Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1874 , by H. 0 . Houcaros &amp; Co. , in the Office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , " desirable to the humbler mammas , and not to be despised by the haughty exciusives . The fashionable hotel at the Springs holds three hundred , and it was packed . I had meant to lounge there for a fortni , ght and then finish my holidays at Long Branch ; but eighty , at least , out of the three hundred , were young and moved lightly in muslin . With my years and experience I felt so safe , that to walk , talk , or dance with them became simply a luxury , such as I had never - at least so freely - possessed before . My name and standing , known to some families , were agreeably exaggerated to the others , and I enjoyed that supreme satisfaction which a man always feels when he discovers , or imagines , that he is popular in society . There is a kind of premonitory apology implied in my sayin , this , I am aware . You must remember that I am culprit , and culprit 's counsel , at the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills sweep around in a crescent , on the northern side , and four or five radiating glens , descending from them , unite just above the village . The central one , leading to a water-fall ( called " Minne-hehe " by the irreverent young people , because there is so little of it ) , is the fashionable drive and promenade ; but the second ravine on the left , steep , crooked , and cumbered with bowlders which have tumbled from somewhere and lodged in the most extraordinary groupings , became my favorite walk of a morning . There was a footpath in it , well-trodden at first , but gradually fading out as it became more like a ladder than a path , and I soon discovered that no other city feet than mine were likely to scale a certain rough slope which seemed the end of the ravine . With the aid of the tough laurel-stems I climbed to the top , passed through a cleft as narrow as a doorway , and presently found myself in a little upper dell , as wild and sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brink of sleep . There was a pond - no , rather a bowl - of water in the centre ; hardly twenty yards across , yet the sky in it was so pure and far down that the circle of rocks and summer foliage in* closing it seemed like a little planetary ring , floating off alone through space . I ca n't explain the charm of the spot , nor the selfishness which instantly suggested that I should keep the discovery to myself . Ten years earlier , I should have looked around for some fair spirit to be my " minister , " but nowOne forenoon - I think it was the third or fourth time I had visited the place - I was startled to find the dint of a heel in the earth , half-way up the slope . There had been rain during the night and the earth was still moist and soft . It was the mark of a woman 's boot , only to be distinguished from that of a walking-stick by its semicircular form . A little higher , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to awake an ecstasy , but with a suggestion of lightness , elasticity , and grace . If hands were thrust through holes in a board-fence , and nothing of the attached bodies seen , I can easily imagine that some would attract and others repel us : with footprints the impression is weaker , of course , but we can not escape it . I am not sure whether I wanted to find the unknown wearer of the boot within my precious personal solitude : I was afraid I should see her , while passing through the rocky crevice , and yet was disappointed when I found no one . But on the flat , warm rock overhanging the tarn - my special throne lay some withering wild-flowers , and a book ! I looked up and down , right and left : there was not the slightest sign of another human life than mine . Then I lay down for a quarter of an hour , and listened : there were only the noises of bird and squirrel , as before . At last , I took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketches . There were , indeed , some tolerable studies of rocks and trees on the first pages ; a few not very striking caricatures , which seemed to have been commenced as portraits , but recalled no faces I knew ; then a number of fragmentary notes , written in pencil . I 258 September , // found no name , from first to last ; only , under the sketches , a monogram so complicated and laborious that the initials could hardly be discovered unless one already knew them . The writing was a woman 's , but it had surely taken its character from certain features of her own : it was clear , firm , individual . It had nothing of that air of general debility which usually marks the manuscript of young ladies , yet its firmness was far removed from the stiff , conventional slope which all Englishwomen seem to acquire in youth and retain through life . I do n't see how any man in my situation could have helped reading a few lines - if only for the sake of restoring lost property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finished by reading all : thence , since no further harm could be done , I reread , pondering over certain passages until they stayed with me . Here they are , as I set them down , that evening , on the back of a legal blank . " It makes a great deal of difference whether we wear social forms as bracelets or handcuffs . " " Can we not still be wholly our independent selves , even while doing , in the main , as others do ? I know two who are so ; but they are married . " " The men who admire these bold , dashing young girls treat them like weaker copies of themselves . And yet they boast of what they call expe-rience ! ' " " I wonder if any one felt the exquisite beauty of the noon as I did , today ? A faint appreciation of sunsets and storms is taug , ht us in youth , and kept alive by novels and flirtations ; but the broad , imperial splendor of this summer noon ! - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ! " " The men I seek must exist : where are they ? How make an acquaintance , when one obsequiously bows himself away , as I advance ? The fault is surely not all on my side . " There was much more , intimate enough to inspire me with a keen interest in the writer , yet not sufficiently so to make myperusal a painful indis cretion . I yielded to the impulse of the moment , took out my pencil , and wrote a dozen lines on one of the blank pages . They ran something in this wise : - " JGNOTUs IGNOLE ! - You have bestowed without intending it , and I have taken without your knowledge . iDo not regret the accident which has enriched another . This concealed idyl of the hills was mine , as I supposed , but I acknowledge your equal right to it . Shall we share the possession , or will you banish me ? " There was a frank advance , tempered by a proper caution , I fancied , in the words I wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that certainty there lay a vast range of possibilities , some of them alarming enough . However , if any nearer acquaintance should arise out of the incident , the next step must be taken by her . Was I one of the men she sought ? I almost imagined so - certainly hoped so . I laid the book on the rock , as I had found it , bestowed another keen scrutiny on the lonely landscape , and then descended the ravine . That evening , 1 went early to the ladies ' parlor , chatted more than usual with the various damsels whom I knew , and watched with a new interest those whom I knew not . My mind , involuntarily , had already created a picture of the unknown . She might be twenty-five , I thought : a reflective habit of mind would hardly be developed before that age . Tall and stately , of course ; distinctly proud in her bearing , and somewhat reserved in her manners . Why she should have large dark eyes , with long dark lashes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Quite forgetting that I was ( or had meant to be ) Iguotus , I found myself staring rather significantly at one or the other of the young ladies , in whom I discovered some sli* , ht general resemblance to the imaginary character . My fancies , I must confess , played strange pranks with me . They had been kept in a coop so many years , that now , when I 1874. 259 // suddenly turned them loose , their rickety attempts at flight quite bewildered me . No ! there was no use in expecting a sudden discovery . I went to the glen betimes , next morning : the book was gone , and so were the faded flowers ; but some of the latter were scattered over the top of another rock , a few yards from mine . Ha ! this means that I am not to withdraw , I said to myself : she makes room for me ! But how to surprise her ? - for by this time I was fully resolved to make her acquaintance , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sandy-haired . I knew no other way so likely as that of visiting the glen at all times of the day . I even went so far as to write a line of greeting , with a regret that our visits had not yet coincided , and laid it under a stone on the top of her rock . The note disappeared , but there was no answer in its place . Then I suddenly remembered her fondness for the noon hours , at which time she was " utterly alone . " The hotel table d'hôte was at one o'clock : her family , doubtless , dined later , in their own rooms . Why , this gave me , at least , her place in society ! The question of age , to be sure , remained unsettled ; but all else was safe . The next day I took a late and large breakfast , and sacrificed my dinner . Before noon the guests had all straggled back to the hotel from glen and grove bind lane , so bright and hot was the sunshine . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sides of the ravine , but for a fixed belief that I should be successful . While crossing the narrow meadow upon which it opened , I caught a glimpse of something white among the thickets higher up . A moment later , it had vanished , and I quickened my pace , feeling the beginning of an absurd nervous excitement in my limbs . At the next turn , there it was again ! but only for another moment . I paused , exulting , and wiped my drenched forehead . " She can not escape me ! " I murmured between the deep draughts Who was She ? September , of cooler air I inhaled in the shadow of a rock . A few hundred steps more brought me to the foot of the steep ascent , where I had counted on overtaking her . I was too late for that , but the dry , baked soil had surely been crumbled and dislodged , here and there , by a rapid foot . I followed , in reckless haste , snatching at the laurel-branches right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About one third of the way up I slipped , fell , caught a bush which snapped at the root , slid , whirled over , and before I fairly knew what had happened , I was lying doubled up at the bottom of the slope . I rose , made two steps forward , and then sat down with a groan of pain ; my Left ankle was badly sprained , in addition to various minor scratches and bruises . There was a revulsion of feeling , of course , - instant , complete , and hideous . I fairly hated the Unknown . " Fool that I was ! * ' I exclaimed , in the theatrical manner , dashing the palm of my hand softly against my brow : " lured to this by the fair traitress ! But , no ! - not fair : she shows the artfulness of faded , desperate spinsterhood ; she is all compact of enamel , liquid bloom of youth ' and hair-dye ! There was a fierce comfort in this thought , but it could n't help me out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sun-stroke should be added , and there was no resource but to hop or crawl down the rugged path , in the hope of finding a forked sapling from which I could extemporize a crutch . With endless pain and trouble I reached a thicket , and was feebly working on a branch with my pen-knife , when the sound of a heavy footstep surprised me . A brown harvest-hand , in straw hat and shirt-sleeves , presently appeared . He grinned when he saw me , and the thick snub of his nose would have seemed like a sneer at any other time . " Are you the gentleman that got hurt ? * ' he asked . " Is it pretty tolerable bad ? " " Who said I was hurt ? " I cried , in astonishment . // " One of your town-women from the hotel - I reckon she was . I was binding oats , in the field over the ridge ; but I have n't lost no time in comm ' here . " While I was stupidly staring at this announcement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes f ashioned me a practicable crutch . Then , taking me by the other arm , he set me in motion towards the village . Grateful as I was for the man 's help , he aggravated me by his ignorance . When I asked if he knew the lady , he answered : " It s more a likely you know her better . " But where did she come from ? iDown from the hill , he guessed , but it might ha ' been up the road . How did she look ? was she old or young ? what was the color of her eyes ? of her hair ? There , now , I was too much for him . When a woman kept one o ' them speckled veils over her face , turned her head away , and held her parasol between , how were you to know her from Adam ? I declare to you , I could n't arrive at one positive particular . Even when he affirmed that she was tall , he added , the next instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stepped mighty quick ; so I guess she must ha ' been short . " By the time we reached the hotel , I was in a state of fever ; opiates and lotions had their will of me for the rest of the day . I was glad to escape the worry of questions , and the conventional sympathy expressed in inflections of the voice which are meant to soothe , and only exasperate . The next morning , as I lay upon my sofa , restful , patient , and properly cheerful , the waiter entered with a bouquet of wild flowers . " Who sent them ? " I asked . " 1 found them outside your door , sir . Maybe there s a card ; yes , here s a bit o ' paper . " I opened the twisted slip he handed me , and read : " From your dell-and mine . " I took the flowers ; among them were two or three rare and beautiful varieties , which I had only found in that one spot . Fool , again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them placed on a stand within reach , and fell into a state of quiet and agreeable contemplation . Tell me , yourself , whether any male human being is ever too old for sentiment , provided that it strikes him at the right time and in the right way ! What did that bunch of wild flowers betoken ? Knowledge , first ; then , sympathy ; and finally , encouragement , at least . Of course she had seen my accident , from above ; of course she had sent the harvest laborer to aid me home . It was quite natural she should imagine some special , romantic interest in the lonely dell , on my , part , and the gift took additional value from her conjecture . Four days afterwards , there was a hop in the large dining-room of the hotel . Early in the morning , a fresh bouquet had been left at my door . I was tired of my enforced idleness , eager to discover the fair unknown , ( she was again fair , to my fancy ! ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a crimson velvet slipper on the left foot would provoke a glance of sympathy from certain eyes , and thus enable me to detect them . The fact was , the sympathy was much too general and effusive . Everybody , it seemed , came to me with kindly greetings ; seats were vacated at my approach , even fat Mrs. Huxter insisting on my taking her warm place , at the head of the room . But Bob Leroy , - you know him , - as gallant a gentleman as ever lived , put me down at the right point , and kept me there . He only meant to divert me , yet gave me the only place where I could quietly inspect all the younger ladies , as dance or supper brought them near . One of the dances was an old-fashioned cotillon , and one of the figures , the " coquette , " brought every one , in turn , before me . I received a pleasant word or two from those whom I knew , and a long , kind , silent glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She was tall , stately , twentyfive , had large dark eyes , and long dark lashes ! Again the changes of the dance brought her near me ; I threw ( or strove to throw ) unutterable meanings into my 1874. 261 // eyes , and cast them upon hers . She seemed startled , looked suddenly away , looked back to me , and - blushed . I knew her for wbat is called " a nice girl " - that is , tolerably frank , gently feminine , and not dangerously intelligent . Was it possible that I had overlooked so much character and intellect ? As the cotillon closed , she was again in my neighborhood , and her partner led her in my direction . I was rising painfully from my chair , when Bob Leroy pushed me down again , whisked another seat from somewhere , planted it at my side , and there she was ! She knew who was her neighbor , I plainly saw ; but instead of turning towards me , she began to fan herself in a nervous way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew impatient . " Miss Danvers ! " I said , at last . " Oh ! " was all her answer , as she looked at me for a moment . " Where are your thoucrhts ' ? asked . Then she turned , with wide , astonished eyes , coloring softly up to the roots of her hair . My heart gave a sudden leap . " How can you tell , if I can not ? " she asked . " May I guess ? " She made a slight inclination of the head , saying nothing . I was then quite sure . " The second ravine , to the left of the main drive ? " This time she actually started ; her color became deeper , and a leaf of the ivory fan snapped between her fingers . " Let there be no more a secret ! " I exclaimed . " Your flowers have brought me your messages ; I knew I should find you " - Full of certainty , I was speaking in a low , impassioned voice . She cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was both angry and alarmed . Fisher , of Philadelphia , jostling right and left in his haste , made his way towards her . She fairly snatched his arm , clung to it with a warmth I had never seen expressed in a ball-room , and began to whisper in his ear . It was not five minutes before he came to me , alone , with a very stern face , bent down , and said - " If you have discovered our secret , you will keep silent . You are certainly a gentleman . " I bowed , coldly and savagely . There was a draft from the open window ; my ankle became suddenly weary and painful , and I went to bed . Can you believe that I did n't guess , immediately , what it all meant ? In a vague way , I fancied that I had been premature in my attempt to drop our mutual incognito , and that Fisher , a rival lover , was jealous of me . This was rather flattering than otherwise ; but when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , no Miss Danvers was to be seen . I did not venture to ask for her ; it might seem importunate , and a woman of so much hidden capacity was evidently not to be wooed in the ordinary way . So another night passed by ; and then , with the morning , came a letter which made me feel , at the same instant , like a fool and a hero . It had been dropped in the Wampsocket post-office , was legibly addressed to me and delivered with some other letters which had arrived by the night mail . Here it is ; listen ! " NoTo IGNOTA ! - Haste is not a gift of the gods , and you have been impatient , with the usual result . I was almost prepared for this , and thus am not wholly disappointed . In a day or two more you will discover your mistake , which , so far as I can learn , . has done no particular harm . If you wish to find me , there is only one way to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should run the risk of losing you , - that is , I should preclude the manifestation of a certain quality which I hope to find in the man who may - or , rather , must - be my friend . This sounds enigmatical , yet you have read enough of my nature , as written in those random notes in my sketch-book , to guess , at least , how much I require . Only this let me add : mere guessing is useless . " Being unknown , I can write freely . If you find me , I shall be justified ; if 262 September , // not , I shall hardly need to blush , even to myself , over a futile experiment . " it is possible for me to learn enough of your life , henceforth , to direct my relation towards you . This may be the end ; if so , I shall know it soon . I shall also know whether you continue to seek me . Trusting in your honor as a man , I must ask you to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover my mistake , as the Unknown promised . There had been a secret betrothal between Fisher and Miss iDanvers ; and singularly enough , the momentous question and answer had been given in the very ravine leading to my upper dell ! The two meant to keep the matter to themselves , but therein , it seems , I thwarted them ; there was a little opposition on the part of their respective families , but all was amicably settled before I left Wampsocket . The letter made a very deep impression upon me . What was the one way to find her ? What could it be but the triumph that follows ambitious toil , - the manifestation of all my best qualities , as a man ? Be she old or young , plain or beautiful , I reflected , hers is surely a nature worth knowing , and its candid intelligence conceals no hazards for me . I have sought her rashly , blundered , betrayed that I set her lower , in my thoughts , than her actual self : let me now adopt the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my tasks , and , following my own aims vigorously and cheerfully , restore that respect which she seemed to be on the point of losing . For , consciously or not , she had communicated to me a doubt , implied in the very expression of her own strength and pride . She had meant to address me as an equal , yet , despite herself , took a stand a little above that which she accorded to me . I came back to New York earlier than usual , worked steadily at my profession and with increasing success , and began to accept opportunities ( which I had previously declined ) of making myself personally known to the great , impressible , fickle , tyrannical public . One or two of my speeches in the hall of the Cooper Institute , on various occasions - as you may perhaps remember- gave me a good headway with the party , and were the chief cause of my nomination for the State office which I still hold . ( There , on the table , lies a resi0nation , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 talk of it , afterwards . ) Several months passed by , and no further letter reached me . I gave up much of my time to society , moved familiarly in more than one province of the kingdom here , and vastly extended my acquaintance , especially among the women ; but not one of them betrayed the mysterious something or other - really I ca n't explain precisely what it was ! - which I was looking for . In fact , the more I endeavored quietly to study the sex , the more confused I became . At last , I was subjected to the usual onslaught from the strong-minded . A small but formidable committee entered my office one morning and demanded a categorical declaration of my principles . What my views on the subject were , I knew very well ; they were clear and decided ; and yet , I hesitated to declare them ! It was n't a temptation of Saint Anthony - that is , turned the other way - and the belligerent attitude of the dames did not alarm me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How could I best please her ? It flashed upon my mind , while Mrs. - was making her formal speech , that I had taken no step for months without a vague , secret reference to her . So , I strove to be courteous , friendly , and agreeably non-committal ; begged for further documents , and promised to reply by letter , in a few days . I was hardly surprised to find the well-known hand on j*he envelope of a letter , shortly afterwards . I held it for a minute in my palm , with an absurd hope that I might sympathetically feel its character , before breaking the seal . Then I read it with a great sense of relief . " I have never assumed to guide a man , except towards the full exercise of his powers . It is not opinion in ac 18T4. 263 // tion , but opinion in a state of idleness or indifference , which repels me . I am deeply glad that you have gained so much since you left the country . If , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will frankly say that , to that extent , you have drawn nearer . Am * mistaken in conjecturing that you wish to know my relation to the movement concerning which you were recently interrogated ? In this , as in other instances which may come , I must beg you to consider me only as a spectator . The more my own views may seem likely to sway your action , the less I shall be inclined to declare them . If you find this cold or unwomanly , remember that it is not easy ! * Yes ! I felt that I had certainly drawn much nearer to her . And from this time on , her imaginary face and form became other than they were . She was twenty-eight - three years older ; a very little above the middle height , but not tall ; serene , rather than stately , in her movements ; with a calm , almost grave face , relieved by the sweetness of the full , firm lips ; and finally eyes of pure , limpid gray , such as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , thus , much more attractive than with the dark eyes and lashes , - but she did not make her appearance in the circles which I frequented . Another year slipped away . As an official personage , my importance increased , but I was careful not to exaggerate it to myself . Many have wondered ( perhaps you among the rest ) at my success , seeing that I possess no remarkable abilities . If I have any secret , it is simply this - doing faithfully , with all my might , whatever I undertake . Nine tenths of our politicians become infiat&amp;d and careless , after the first few years , and are easily forgotten when they once lose place . I am a little surprised , now , that I had so much patience with the Unknown . I was too important , at least , to be played with ; too mature to be subjected to a longer test ; too earnest , as I had proved , to be doubted , or thrown aside without a further explanation . Growing tired , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . A carefully-written " Personal , " in which Ignotus informed Ignota of the necessity of his communicating with her , appeared simultaneously in the Tribune , Herald , World , and Times . I renewed the advertisement as the time expired without an answer , and I think it was about the end of the third week before one came , through the post , as before . Ah , yes ! I had forgotten . See ! my advertisement is pasted on the note , as a heading or motto for the manuscript lines . I do n't know why the printed slip should give me a particular feeling of humiliation as I look at it , but such is the fact . What she wrote is all i need read to you : - " I could not , at first , be certain that this was meant for me . If I were to explain to you why I have not written for so long a time , I might give you one of the few dews which I insist on keeping in my own hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as a woman may judge ) upright , independent , wholly manly : in your relations with other men I learn nothing of you that is not honorable : towards women you are kind , chivalrous , no doubt , overflowing with the usual social refinements , but - Here , again , I run hard upoa the absolute necessity of silence . The way to me , if you care to traverse it , is so simple , so very simple ! Yet , after what I have written , I can not even wave my hand in the direction of it , without certain self-contempt . When I feel free to tell you , we shall draw apart and remain unknown forever . " You desire to write ? I do not prohibit it . I have heretofore made no arrangement for hearing from you , in turn , because I could not discover that any advantage would accrue from it . But it seems only fair , I confess , and you dare not think me capricious . So , three days hence , at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will call at your door . If you have anything to give her for me , the act of giving it must be the sign of a compact on your part , that you will allow her to leave // immediately , unquestioned and unfollowed . " You look puzzled , I see : you do n't catch the real drift of her words ? Well , - that s a melancholy encouragement . Neither did I , at the time : it was plain that I had disappointed her in some way , and my intercourse with , or manner towards , women , had something to do with it . In vain I ran over as much of my later social life as I could recall . There had been no special attention , nothing to mislead a susceptible heart ; on the other side , certainly no rudeness , no want of " chivalrous " ( she used the word ! ) respect and attention . What , in the name of all the gods , was the matter ? In spite of all my efforts to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather *nuddled state of mind . I had so much to say ! sixteen folio pages , I was sure , would only suffice for an introduction to the case ; yet , when the creamy vellum lay before me and the moist pen drew my fingers towards it , I sat stock dumb for half an hour . I wrote , finally , in a half-desperate mood , without regard to coherency or logic . Here s a rough draft of a part of the letter , and a single passage from it will be enough : - " I can conceive of no simpler way to you than the knowledge of your name and address . I have drawn airy images of you , but they do not become incarnate , and I am not sure that I should recognize you in the brief moment of passing . Your nature is not of those which are instantly legible . As an abstract power , it has wrought in my life and it continually moves my heart with desires which are unsatisfactory because so vague and ignorant . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest friendship : you would laugh if I were now to offer more . " Stay ! here is another fragment , more reckless in tone : - " I want to find the woman whom I can love - who can love me . But this is a masquerade where the features are hidden , the voice disguised , even the hands grotesquely gloved . Come ! I 265 will venture more than I ever thought was possible to me . You shall know my deepest nature as I myself seem to know it . Then , give me the commonest chance of learning yours , through an intercourse which shall have both free , should we not feel the closing of the inevitable bond ! " After I had written that , the pages filled rapidly . When the appointed hour arrived , a bulky epistle , in a strong linen envelope , sealed with five wax seals , was waiting on my table . Precisely at six there was an announcement : the door opened , and a little outside , in the shadow , I saw an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come in ! " Isaid . " The letter ! " answered a husky voice . She stretched out a bony hand , without moving a step . " It is for a lady - very important business , " said I , taking up the letter ; " are you sure that there is no mis-take ? " She drew her hand under the shawl , turned without a word , and moved towards the hall door . " Stop ! " I cried : " I beg a thousand pardons ! Take it - take it ! You are the right messenger ! " She clutched it , and was instantly gone . Several days passed , and I gradually became so nervous and uneasy that I was on the point of inserting another " Personal " in the daily papers , when the answer arrived . It was brief and mysterious ; you shall hear the whole of it . " I thank you . Your letter is a sacred confidence which I pray you never to regret . Your nature is sound and good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no real right to refuse . In the one respect which I have hinted , I may have been unskillful or too narrowly cautious : I must have the certainty of this . Therefore , as a generous favor , give me six months more ! At the end of that time I will write to you again . Have patience with these brief lines : another word might be a word too much . " Who was She2 // You notice the change in her tone ? The letter gnve me the strongest impression of a new , warm , almost anxious interest on her part . My fancies , as first at Wampsocket , began to play all sorts of singular pranks : sometimes she was rich and of an old family , sometimes moderately poor and obscure , but always the same calm , reposeful face and clear gray eyes . I ceased looking for her in society , quite sure that I should not find her , and nursed a wild expectation of suddenly meeting her , face to face , in the most unlikely places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all was patience , - patience for six months . There s not much more to tell ; but this last letter is hard for me to read . It came punctually , to a day . I knew it would , and at the last I began to dread the time , as if a heavy note were falling due , and I had no funds to meet it . My head was in a whirl when I broke the seal . The fact in it stared at me blankly , at once , but it was a long time before the words and sentences be-. came intelligible . " The stipulated time has come , and our hidden romance is at an end . Had I taken this resolution a year ago , it would have saved me many vain hopes , and you , perhaps , a little uncertainty . Forgive me , first , if you can , and then hear the explanation ! " You wished for a personal interview : you have had , not one , but many . We have met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , the opera , toilettes , Queechy , Aurora Floyd , Long Branch and Newport , and exchanged a weary amount of fashionable gossip ; and you never guessed that I was governed by any deeper interest ! I have purposely uttered ridiculous platitudes , and you were as smilingly courteous as if you enjoyed them : I have let fall remarks whose hollowness and selfishness could not have escaped you , and have waited in vain for a word of sharp , honest , manly reproof . Your manner to me was unexceptionable , as it was to all other women : but there lies the Who was Sheg September , source of my disappointment , of - yes , - of my sorrow ! " You appreciate , I cannogdoubt , the qualities in woman which men value in one another , - culture , independence of thought , a high and earnest apprehension of life ; but you know not how to seek them . It is not true that a mature and unperverted woman is flattered by receiving only the general obsequiousness which most men give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strives with her , she discovers a truer interest , a nobler respect . The empty-headed , spindle-shanked youths who dance admirably , understand something of billiards , much less of horses , and still less of navigation , soon grow inexpressibly wearisome to us ; but the men who adopt their social courtesy , never seeking to arouse , uplift , instruct us , are a bitter disnppointmt*nt . " What would have been the end , had , you really found me ' ? Certainly a sincere , satisfying friendship . No mysterious magnetic force has drawn you to me or held you near me , nor has my experiment inspired me with an interest which can not be given up without a personal pang . I am grieved , for the sake of all men and all women . Yet , understand me ! I mean no slightest reproach . I esteem and honor you for what you are . Farewell ! " There ! Nothing could be kinder in tone , nothing more humiliating in substance . 1 was sore and offended for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more clearly , that she was wholly right . I was sure , also , that any further attempt to correspond with her would be vain . It all comes of taking society just as we find it , and supposing that conventional courtesy is the only safe ground on which men and women can meet . The fact is - there s no use in hiding it from myself ( and I see , by your face , that the letter cuts into your own conscience ) - she is a free , courageous , independent character , and - I am not . But who was she ? Bayard Taylor . // A VISION OF LOST SOULS . THE woman stood within The Golden City 's pale , And heard across the gulf Her lover 's mournful wall Among the lost , sound on The white-winged evening gale . Then to her loving ken Was all the place grown dim , And empty were the songs Of gold-robed cherubim ; She hid her face , and wept And cried for love of him . Though yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hushed Was all their music sweet , Till , gathering near , they stood Or knelt down at her feet , They hindered not her prayer , But wondered and were dumb - For there , until that day , Had never sorrow come ; And though it was in heaven Tears wet the eyes of some . The lofty gates swung wide Withouten sound or jar ; Seen from this earth , her ifight Shone like a falling star , And soon the realms of death Were near and heaven was far . And then , beyond the void That skirts the changeless spheres , Amid the plains whereon The cloud of doom appears , She washed her lover 's hands And feet with her warm tears . " Father , " the woman prayed , " Hear what my bosom saith ! Wilt thou not for love 's sake Unloose the bonds of death ? Dear Lord , wilt thou not hear The pleadings of my breath ?                    @
