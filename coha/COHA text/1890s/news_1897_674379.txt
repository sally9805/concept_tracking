txt Controller PALMER of Brooklyn says that he is going to sue Mr. EDWARD M. SHEPARD for slander because of what the latter said of his official conduct in the interview published in THE TIMES on Thursday . With the personal issue between the two gentlemen we have no concern , but If it shall lead to a suit , in the course of which Mr. SHEPARD shall be called on to justify his statements , we shall not be sorry , because the more light there is thrown on the subject of the administration of the civil service in cities the better it must be for the citizens . The people of Brooklyn , like the American people generally , are honest and sensible , and they want the best servitai they can get for their money . When they are thoroughly informed as to the workings of polities in the civil service they will put an end to it . Mr. PALMER 'S threatened suit would help to inform them . But Mr. PALMER must make no mistake as to the requirements of the Constitution on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State . It declares : " Appointments and promotion in the civil service of the State and of all the civil divisions thereof , including cities and villages , shall be made according to merit and fitness . " That is the fundamental requirement . It absolutely excludes the consideration of politics in all appointments . Mr. PAL:gprt , if he has made appointments for political reasons since the 1st of last January , has violated the Constitution . Even if he has chosen honest and capable men , because they belong to one ' party rather than another , he has still violated the Constitutipn . He can not evade the point , or obscure it . He must meet it . The method of " ascertaining " merit and fitness is defined by the Constitution and is important , but it is subordinate to the requirement that these qualifications and these alone shall be the reasons for appointments . The Constitution says that they are " to be ascertained , so far as practicable , by examinations , which , so far as practicable , shall be competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but merit and fitness can be considered . The intrusion of politics vitiates the appointment .
