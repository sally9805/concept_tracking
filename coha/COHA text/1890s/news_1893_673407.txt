txt The competition for furnishing 10,000 pounds of smokeless powder to the army has brought out four bids , with the prospect of an award on satisfactory terms . In spite of the drawbacks to the use of chemical powders , they have been adopted by nearly every European power , so that our own army ought to be able to procure one ' for its new magazine rifle . Gen. FLAGLER , the Chief of Ordnance , in one of his reports , speaks of trying a sample of the famous French BN powder and . finding its performance poor , through imperfect combustion ; and also of trying German powder , which performed much better , and.yet , after a year 's keeping in a sealed case , , gave fully one-third less velocity . This last fault is better , perhaps . than the opposite one of acquiring an enormous increase of , dangerous pressure and violent explosive power , as is sometimes the case under changes of temperature . But the point is that , in spite of those objections . Gen. FLAGLER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . We find , in fact . that France has her powder for her Lebel rifle , Germany her Nobel powder , Italy her ballistite , Austria her Schwab-Rubin , England her cordite , Sweden her apyrite , and Switzerland , Denmark , Russia , and other countries also their smokeless powders . Years ago they were employed in field artillery in the mancsuvres at Hanover and elsewhere . Undoubtedly , too , when a suitable smokeless powder is found for our country it will be employed in field pieces and in the batteries of war ships . But its immediate need is far the new infantry rifles . It is true that magazine guns have often employed the familiar black powder ; but there is so intimate a relation between the small calibre rifle and smokeless powder that for a long time the lack of the latter put an end with us to progress in acquiring the former . At last , as is well known , the army authorities refused to wait longer , and adopted the present modification of the Krag-Jorgensen arm , using cartridges We recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-protected manufacturers are sending up against the Wilson bill . DOLGE is nominally a manufacturer of felt , but his real occupation is that of making stiff partisan arguments for the Republican Party and protection . In this business DOLGE brandishes his alleged felt works in the most reckless fashion , closing and opening them or threatening to do so early and often in every Congressional and Presidential campaign . DOLGE now declares that if the Wilson bill passes he will feel obliged to take his felt business to Europe . probably to establish it there on a freetrade basis ; but at any rate he will shut down indefinitely on December 15 . There is a close and striking likeness between the antics of Gov . WAITE of Colorado . who proposed last Summer to wade in blood up to the collar of his horse in the effort to prevent the repeal of the Sherman silver act . and the present performances of such persons as DOLGE and the proprietors of the Miller Cutlery Works of Connecticut in their attempts to arouse public sentiment against the Wilson bill . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely due to the tactics these favored protectionists employ . The producers of iron in Alabama who are opposing the removal of the duty on iron ore will regard with some surprise the complaint of the Baltimore American that " iron ore is placed on the free list to enable a small district in Alabama to undersell the rest of the United States . " On the other hand , the Richmond Dispatch says : There is not a blast furnace in operation in all New-England . Southern enterprise has made their fires cold . Now with free Nova Scotia coal and ores obtained in foreign parts they propose to ' blow out ' their competitors in the South . " The ironmakers of Alabama and Tennessee are already exporting their iron , and it is admitted that the cost of production is lower there than in any other part of the world . Whatever may be the action of Congress with respect to the duty on iron ore , they will see very little pig iron made in New-England . Many persons will be interested in the announcement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " popularly known as the " Harvard Annex , " is to give up its clumsy official title and get rid of its undignified sobriquet , and is to become Radcliffe College , just as soon as the Massachusetts Legislature shall sanction the change of title of the existing corporation . It is then to confer regular degrees instead of granting certificates of proficiency , and its diplomas are to be countersigned by the President of Harvard University and to bear the seal of that institution , which has all along set the standard of requirements and furnished the instruction and examinations for the " Annex . " This has just been authorized by the Corporation and Overseers of Harvard . and it is believed that this action will be followed by the actual absorption of Radcliffe College by the university when the necessary legislation has been obtained . This has been understood to depend - upon the raising of an endowment fund for the woman 's college , which is reported to be virtually accom ? plished . The Bishop of Chester , England , has re ? ceived the adherence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on intemperance in the person of Judge THOMAS HUGEIES the " Tom " of Rugby fame .
