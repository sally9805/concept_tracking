txt That old-fashioned calamity known as getting hoist with your own petard has lately befallen the two leading opponents of actual , genuine underground rapid transit . The Manhattan Elevated Railway , which is the most formidable opponent of the tunnel project , asked the Rapid Transit Commission to allow it to construct a tunnel road under the Boulevard , consti- ' tuting one of its proposed extensions . On the instant that request was made a towering mass of laboriously constructed arguments against underground rapid transit crumbled into nothingness . We have had it dinned into our ears that tunnels are dank , damp , noisome , filled with smoke , and reeking with deadly gases ; that they are the scenes of the most awful accidents known to railroading ; and that no prudent human being would go down into the bowels of the earth to travel . But here come the Manhattan people praying that they may be allowed to construct and operate a hole-in-the-ground Our esteemed contemporary The Sun , which has been the most obstreperous opponent of underground rapid transit , in proposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it less objectionable to Gov . BLACK , makes this interesting statement of fact : " A. committee of more or less wealthy Mugwumps , appointed by the City Club sic ; our neighbor means the Citizens ' Union to defend the Mugwump scheme , is backed by the Central Labor Union on the ground that the millions required to build the tunnel would be so much benefit to labor . " When the millionaires and the workingmen put their shoulders to the wheel in joint effort the wheel is prete2 apt to move ahead , and any obstructive person who lies in its way gets crushed . Opponents of rapid transit who understand the full significance of this union of interests will not make the mistake of sneering at it . They will deny its existence or get out of its way . The ' workingmen are right . It is for their interest that the underground road be built . The work of construction would give them employment , the finished road would take them quickly , cheaply , and comfortably to homes in the North End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rates that prevail in the tenementhouse districts . They show that they are awake to their own needs when they oppose the infamous Ellsworth bill , gotten up by PLATT and CROK.Ell to destroy the present- Rapid Transit Commission and put the control of that great and urgent work Into their hands . Unspeakable villainy of motive and corruptness of purpose underlie this Ellsworth bill . It is a liars ' bill , because its authors charge that the present commission is expensive , dawdling , and incompetent . It is a thieves ' bill , because its responsible backers want to get the work into their control for loot and plunder . It is a bill to be resisted by all the force that the Chamber of Commerce , the up-town local organizations , the real estate interests , the labor unions , and reform bodies can muster against it . The legislators must be made to understand at to-day 's hearing that this is a dangerous bill  --  dangerous to them if it is not at once abandoned . Mr. HEWITT is right . " If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to express it . "
