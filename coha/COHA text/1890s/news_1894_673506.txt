txt The Pension act of June 27 , 1890 , is plain and explicit in its terms . To all soldiers who served ninety days or more , and who suffer from a mental or physical disability " which incapacitates them from the performance of manual labor in such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support , " this act grants , on their " making due proof of the fact , " a pension " not exceeding- $12 a month and not less than $6 per month , proportioned to the degree of inability to earn a support . " Now , when a pensioner receiving the maximum amount under this act is found to be a man of robust appearance , performing hard manual labor every day . and receiving full wages for his work , it becomes evident that a fraud has been perpetrated upon the Government , that money is unlawfully taken from the Federal Treasury to pay this man 's pension , and that every honest wage earner in the country and every taxpayer has just reason to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Times has discovered scores of such pensioners in that part of the State of New-York where it has carried on its investigations . We have already described some of the cases in Ogdensburg and Gouverneur . In Watertown and Potsdam there are instances nu less striking of gross abuses of the law . One pensioner receiving the maximum sum of $12 per month is a trolley car conductor ; another is a hardworking carpenter and builder ; another is a ditch and cellar digger ; several are steadily engaged in trades requiring constant and fairly hard work ; and one is a farm laborer of such exceptional bodily strength and robustness that last Summer he demanded $52 a month for labor in the hayfield , which is the hardest of all farm labor . These cases are typical of an immense number of fraudulent pensions granted under the much-abused act of 1890 and under Commissioner Raum 's illegal order broadening its scope . Every intelligent citizen of every town , village , or city in the land knows of such cases . It is at any time a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury unlawfully for the benefit of private persons . But when this unlawful use of the public money continues from year to year , is promoted as a party policy , and swells the pension expenditure of the country by millions every year , until the monstrous annual total of $160 , - 000,000 is reached , the evil becomes one that calls urgently for a remedy if national bankruptcy is to be averted . At a time when all private individuals and corporations and business enterprises in the country are economizing in every practicable way it is imperative upon the Government to institute economies in its own expenditures . We are convinced that if there is any one Government policy upon which the sensible men of both parties , upon which the great majority of the voters of the country are entirely agreed and of one mind , it is upon the imperative need of pension reform . The people are disgusted with the frauds of the system , with the pauperism it engenders , with the lies and perjuries which the rascally pension agents encourage , with the demagogic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their efforts to swell the polluted stream , and , above all , they are appalled at the immensity of the cost . The servants of the people at Washington can engage in no undertaking so certain of overwhelming popular approval as an honest , resolute attempt to purify the pension roll of the fraudulent entries that disgrace it .
