FARQUHAR , THE INCONSTANT , AND THE SURVIVAL OF OLD PLAYS . A PREFACE . BY WILLIAM WINTER . THE plays that survive from the past are the plays that are not , in their spirit , their character , their essential vitality , restricted to the particular fashion of the periods in which they were written . Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare wrote side by side ; but while Jonson 's plays are no longer acted those of Shakespeare still keep the stage . " The Alchymist " would not be accepted now , except , perhaps , for a night or two , by an audience of scholars and as a curiosity . That comedy contains , indeed , in the character of old Mammon , the dramatic ancestor of Sir Sampson Legend and Sir Anthony Absolute , and some of the speeches in it are wonderfully vigorous , ornate , and eloquent . Its object , however , was satire of a local and contemporaneous mania  --  the practice of astrology and the quest for the wonderful philosopher 's stone that would transmute worthless metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared also the vitality of the satire upon it . " As You Like It , " on the other hand , and " Much Ado About Nothing , " because they are comedies dealing faithfully and powerfully with the elemental facts of human nature , are as much alive to-day , and as significant and welcome upon the stage as they were when first presented in Shakespeare 's time . The dramatic author who portrays representative types of humanity rather than the ephemeral eccentricities of the hour in which he lives is recognized by mankind , in all periods , as being the bearer of a significant and interesting message . Farquhar , to some extent , dealt with the permanent and abiding facts of human nature , and that is one reason why he survives as a dramatist and pleases the public of to-day . The auxiliary reasons are his abundant flow of animal spirits , his droll humor , his nimble invention , his skill in raillery , and his graceful art in making sprightly language the spontaneous expression of gallant , mirthful , amorous , adventuous character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coquetry , and men who turn all life to a feast of roses and revel in its fragrance . George Farquhar was born in 1678 , at Londonderry , Ireland , and was educated at that place and at Trinity College , Dublin . He was the son of a clergyman and he proved to be a wild youth . He was entered at Trinity , as " a sizar , " on July 17 , 1694 , and he left it in 1695 . In college he was considered a dull fellow , and one account of him says that he was expelled for an irreverent jest , relative to one of the miracles recorded in the New Testament ; while another relates that he left the university on account of the death of his patron , Dr. Wiseman , Bishop of Dromore . On leaving college he joined the Dublin Theatre , then managed by Ashbury , and made his first appearance as an actor , choosing the part of Othello . This was in 1695 . He remained on the stage only one season . His memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his person good ; but his voice was feeble and he could never quite control a nervous tendency to stage fright . The immediate cause of his retirement from the stage , however , was an accident . He had the misfortune to inflict a dangerous wound upon a stage antagonist , when acting in Dryden 's play of " The Indian Emperor , " and the thought that he had come near killing a fellow creature so impressed his mind that he resolved to quit forever the profession of an actor . Such is the story ; but this sensitive disposition did not prevent him from becoming , subsequently , a soldier . He left Dublin , for London , in 1696 , in the society of that brilliant actor Robert Wilks , and on reaching the capital of the British Kingdom he speedily made a pleasant impression in society , and presently was fortunate enough to win the favor of the Earl of Orrery , who made him a lieutenant in his own regiment and sent him , on service , into Ireland and elsewhere , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is recorded that he was invariably upright in his conduct and noted for his quiet courage . Wilks , who early discerned Farquhar 's talent and perceived the drift of his mind , urged him to write for the stage , and in 1698 was brought out his first comedy  --  made in compliance with the wish of this good friend  --  " Love and a Bottle . " He afterward wrote " The Constant Couple ; or a Trip to the Jubilee ; " " Sir Harry Wildair ; " " The Inconstant , or the Way to Win Him ; " " The Twin Rivals ; " " The Stage Coach ; " " The Recruiting Officer ; " and " The Beaux ' Stratagem . " In " The Constant Couple " the character of Sir Harry Wildair first occurs  --  a part in which Wilks was conspicuously brilliant , and which came to be intimately associated with the shining name of Peg Woffington . Wilks acted in every one of his plays and Anne Oldfield in two of them . " The Twin Rivals " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has not survived in equal repute with " The Inconstant " or " The Recruiting Officer , " or even " The Beaux ' Stratagem ; " for the first two of these pieces are still acted , and the last , on account of the dashing character of Archer , long kept its place upon the stage , even in the theatre of America . " The Recruiting Officer , " it will be remembered , contains the sprightly part of Captain Plume and is a comedy of piquant reminiscence of Farquhar 's own experience and observation while on duty in the storied old city of Shrewsbury . It was the habit of this author to sketch himself in his wild and gallant characters , and he has aptly indicated his own ideal of the bright original , in a string of expressive adjectives descriptive of Young Mirabel , whom he indicates , in the preface to " The Inconstant , " as " a gay , splendid , generous , easy , fine young gentleman . " Farquhar had a short life but a merry one , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was he who discovered and first recognized the talent of Anne Oldfield , whom he found in the Mitre Tavern , in St. James 's Market ; and it was under his influence and that of Sir John Vanbrugh that this brilliant girl was introduced upon the stage , in 1699 , by Rich , at the King 's Theatre . Anne was only sixteen and Farquhar only twenty-one at this time , and for a while they were lovers ; but in 1703 the gentleman got married , and four years later , in April , 1707 , he died  --  aged twenty-nine . The marriage was a mercenary one , on his part , and he appears to have been properly rewarded by finding that his wife had no fortune whatever . It is recorded , though , that he took the disappointment in a philosophical spirit and treated his connubial partner with all possible chivalry . Toward the last he sold his military commission , in order to pay his debts , and presently sunk into despondency and death . His final effort was " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor remained active and salient to the last . When he was dead Wilks found among his papers a forlorn little note which sadly and simply said : Dear Bob , I have not anything to leave thee to perpetuate my memory but two helpless girls : Look upon them sometimes and think of him that was , to the last moment of his life , thine , George Farquhar . The story of this brief and bright life seems a fit introduction to the sparkling play of " The Inconstant , " in which it is easy to perceive the author 's ideal of himself , together with all the essential characteristics of his mind and temperament . This piece , like all his works , has to be cut and altered a little , in order that it may be represented , for he did not scruple sometimes to write in a licentious vein and to use expressions which in these days would offend the audience . It is surprising , however , to consider how well this comedy bears being freed from the taint of that sensual warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , and how much excellent substance remains . Mirabel is the type of many young fellows who may be met with in society everywhere . He rejoices in his youth and strength , in gallantry and adventure , and he will keep his freedom . He loves Oriana , at heart , but having been contracted to her he shies from matrimony . The course of events is too methodical . Conventionality makes it insipid , and therefore he breaks away and is inconstant . Such a temperament inclines to value not what it can have but what is denied to it ; yet presently it can be awakened by peril and touched by devotion and made to realize that life and love are very serious matters . Oriana , devotedly fond of him , but likewise skilful in coquetry , employs various wiles in order to subdue this errant cavalier , and the movement of the piece is the rapid and continually shifting encounter of their wits , in these stratagems of love . The flow of intrigue , the variety of incident , the sparkle of language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and piquancy of character , the occasional touches of sentiment , the flexibility of action , and the absorbing interest of the climax  --  at which a feeling of almost agonized suspense is sustained with superb skill  --  are living virtues in a play ; and they make this one as significant and valuable and enjoyable to the world now as it was in the romantic days of good Queen Anne . The closing scene of it , which has always been much admired , is said to have been partly based upon an incident in the experience of the author . The entire piece is founded on " The Wild Goose Chase , " written by John Fletcher and produced in 1621 . " I took the hint , " says Farquhar , in his preface , " from Fletcher 's ' Wild Goose Chase , ' and to those who say that I have spoiled the original I wish no other injury but that they would say it again . " Something more than a hint was , in fact , taken from the elder dramatist ; yet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially it lives and glows with the characteristic spirit of impulsive , impetuous sprightliness and wanton mirth which is essentially Farquhar 's nature . When first produced this comedy was encumbered with a miserable prologue of 34 lines , written by a Mr. Motteux and crammed full of similies drawn from the cook 's kitchen . Also it was furnished with an epilogue by the Poet Laureate , Nicholas Rowe , announcing the moral of the piece to be that " With easy freedom and a gay address A pressing lover seldom wants success , Whilst the respectful , like the Greeks , sits down , And wastes a ten years ' siege before one town . " " The Inconstant " made its advent upon the American stage on January 1st , 1759 , at the old Theatre on Cruger 's Wharf , New York . In June , 1795 , a three-act version of it , made by the reigning favorite Hodgkinson , was produced at the Theatre in John Street , with Hodgkinson as Young Mirabel . In 1829 this old comedy was given at the famous Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1832 , at the same theatre , the piece was represented with a distinguished cast of the characters , including Charles Kemble as Young Mirabel , Henry Placide as Old Mirabel , Mr. Simpson as Duretete , Mrs. Sharp as Oriana , and Fanny Kemble as Bisarre . Murdock first acted Young Mirabel in New York , in 1857 at Burton 's Theatre . Neither of the Wallacks appears to have played Mirabel . Among the representatives of that part , in old times , were Gifford , 1744 ; Palmer , 1751 ; Smith , 1753 ; Wrougton , 1779 ; Farren , 1780 ; Pope , 1787 ; C. Kemble , 1811 ; and Rae , 1817 . Those performances occurred at Drury Lane or Covent Garden , in London . Garrick , at Goodman 's Fields Theatre , played Duretete , and this performance he repeated , for Kitty Clive 's benefit , at Drury Lane , in 1761 . The younger Bannister took Duretete in 1798 . Oriana has been acted , among others , by Peg Woffington , the pretty Mrs. Davies , wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessingham , and Sally Booth . Kitty Clive played Bisarre , and so did Mrs. Abington . Mr. Daly has pruned the text of " The Inconstant , " discarded the scene of the monkish masquerade , restored the passage portraying Duretete 's rage and comic pugnacity at the end of act third , and compressed the piece into four acts ; and a few lines by the present writer have been added , by way of epilogue , to be spoken by Oriana  --  who ends the play . The custom of naming this piece " Wine Works Wonders " ( in allusion to the incident of the red Burgundy marked one thousand , in the last scene ) originated many years ago , but that title was unknown to the time of Farquhar . Young Mirabel has been played by many dashing light comedians of the last hundred years and more , from the time of Robert Wilks to the time of Charles Kemble ; but upon the American stage the part is inseparably entwined with the name and fame of that glittering comedian of other days , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several years after Mr. Murdoch ceased to act in it , when , on November 7 , 1872 , Mr. Daly restored it to the stage , at his theatre , the Fifth Avenue , in Twenty-fourth Street . Mr. George Clarke played Young Mirabel , Miss Clara Morris was the Oriana , and Miss Fanny Davenport appeared as Bisarre ; while Old Mirabel was enacted by Mr. G. H. Griffiths and Duretete by Mr. B. T. Ringgold . Comment on that performance , made in print at that time by the present writer , suggested that the serious side of Young Mirabel 's nature ought always to be made earnest and sweet , because an undisturbed belief in his inherent manliness and generosity is needful to the full enjoyment of his superficial insincerity and his manifold pranks . Reference was made to Mr. Clarke 's uncommon capacity for playfulness , banter , and dashing deviltry , and to the airy ease of his manner as an effluence of joyous spirits and a free mind . It is interesting now to remember that Miss Clara Morris , playing Oriana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capricious , and full of piquancy , and that her acting in the mad-scene  --  by the simulation of beauty in piteous wreck , by sweet tenderness of voice , and by rapid alternations of tender and lightsome mood  --  made a deep impression . Miss Davenport 's performance of Bisarre was remarkable for a certain boisterous and comic levity , and Mr. Griffiths as Old Mirabel pleased by his humorous senile softness . One general observation then made by the present commentator may well be repeated here  --  that this play of " The Inconstant " is one of those fanciful pieces that are entitled to be viewed through a haze of unreality , which makes ideal pictures grateful to the mind and which allows an innocent forgetfulness of the moralities .

Dugard Well , sister , I need not ask you how you do , your looks resolve me ; fair , tall  --  you 're almost grown out of my remembrance . Ori . Oriana Why , truly , brother , I look pretty well , thank nature and my toilet ; I eat three meals a day , am very merry when up , and sleep soundly when I 'm down . Dug .

Ori . Oriana Look ye , brother , you were going a-rambling , and ' t was proper , lest I should go a-rambling , too , that somebody should take care of me . Old Monsieur Mirabel is an honest gentleman , was our father 's friend , and has a young lady in his house whose company I like , and who has chosen him for her guardian as well as I. Dug . Dugard Who , Mademoiselle Bisarre ? Ori . Oriana The same ; we live merrily together , without scandal or reproach ; we make much of the old gentleman between us , and he takes care of us ; we eat what we like , go to bed when we please , rise when we will .

Dug . Dugard Ay , but , sister , the people say  --  Ori . Oriana Pshaw ! hang the people ; their court of inquiry is a tavern , and their informer claret ; they think as they drink , and swallow reputations like beer ; a lady 's health goes briskly around with the glass , but her honor is lost in the toast .

Dug . Dugard Crosses R. Well , sister , I wo n't pretend to understand the engagements between you ; I expect , when you have need of my counsel or assistance , you will let me know more of your affairs .

Dur . Duretete Ah , Mirabel , Italy , I grant you . Mir . Young Mirabel Ha , Roma la Santa ! Italy for my money  --  the paradise of the world ! Dur . Duretete Ah , but if you talk of the plump , what d'ye think of a Dutch woman ? Mir . Young Mirabel A Dutch woman 's too compact ; nay , everything among them is so ; a Dutch man is thick , a Dutch woman is squab , a Dutch horse is round , a Dutch dog is short , a Dutch ship is broad bottomed ; and , in short , one would swear the whole product of the country were cast in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , Mirabel , you have forgot our own ladies . Mir . Young Mirabel Our own ladies would be excellent , did they not take such insufferable pains to ruin what nature has made so incomparably well . But come , Duretete , let us mind the business in hand . The wars are over , and ' t is time to settle down to the pleasures of peace , with beauty and loveliness to help us enjoy it : and if we are competently diligent , we shall find in Paris those who 'll match some Italians , I 'll warrant , from top to toe . Dur . Duretete Ay , Mirabel , you will do well enough , but what will become of your friend ? you know I am so plaguy bashful , so naturally an ass before women , that  --  Mir .

No , hang it , ' twill never do .  --  Oons , what did my father mean by sticking me up in a university , or to think that I should gain anything by my head , in a nation whose genius lies all in their heels ?  --  Well , if ever I come to have children of my own , they shall have the education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can walk , and be taught to sing before they can speak .

Crosses L. Ori . Oriana Oh , my dear , were there no greater tie upon my heart than there is upon my conscience , I would soon throw the contract out o ' doors ; but the mischief o n't is , I am so fond of being tied that I am forced to be just , and the strength of my passion keeps down the inclination of my sex .

Old Mirabel But which will you marry ? MIRABEL goes round both as before . Well , you rogue ! which  --  which will you marry ? Mir . Young Mirabel Neither ! Holds DURETETE before him to keep his father off . O. Mir . Old Mirabel Neither ! neither ! Do n't make me angry now , Bob ; pray do n't make me angry . Lookye , sirrah ! if I do n't dance at your wedding to-morrow , I shall be very glad to cry at your grave . Mir . Young Mirabel That 's a bull , father . Crosses to him . O. Mir . Old Mirabel C.

Young Mirabel Pshaw ! what does the old fellow mean by mewing me up here with a couple of green girls ? Come , Duretete , will you go ? He takes DURETETE 'S arm and is going off , when ORIANA , who has chafed somewhat at her treatment , while BISARRE has only laughed , now faces him , coming forward , while BISARRE goes up C. and pretends to be absorbed looking out of the window . Ori . Oriana I hope , Mr. Mirabel , you ha' n't forgot  --  Mir .

Young Mirabel She was coming full mouth upon me with her contract . Would I might despatch t' other . Dur . Duretete Aside to MIRABEL . Mirabel , that lady there , observe her  --  she 's wondrous pretty , faith , and seems to have but few words . I like her mainly . Speak to her , man ; pr'ythee speak to her for me . Mir .

Young Mirabel And so , madam , not doubting but your ladyship may like him as well as he does you , I think proper to leave you together . As he is going , DURETETE holds him . Dur . Duretete Hold ! hold ! Why , Bob  --  friend ! you wo n't be so barbarous as to leave me alone with her . MIRABEL remains beside DURETETE , pushing him toward BISARRE , laughing . Pr'ythee , speak to her , as if it were for yourself . As he is pushed close up to BISARRE . Lord ! Lord ! That a French soldier should want impudence . Breaks away as he approaches her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by MIRABEL , who now advances to BISARRE , who has not taken the slightest notice of either of them , and speaks very loud to her . Mir .

ORIANA intercepts him , and , after one or two efforts to escape her , he says : Well , madam , why do you follow me ? Ori . Oriana L. Well , sir , why do you shun me ? Mir . Young Mirabel ' T is my humor , madam , and I 'm naturally swayed by inclination . Ori . Oriana Have you forgot our contract , sir ? Mir . Young Mirabel All I remember of that contract is , that it was made some three years ago , and that 's enough in conscience to forget the rest o n't . Ori .

Young Mirabel Lookye , madam , as for my generosity , ' t is at your service , with all my heart : I 'll keep you a coach and six horses , if you please , only permit me to keep my honor to myself . There 's honor required of us by our friends , and honor due to our enemies , and they return it to us again ; but I never heard of a man that left an inch of his honor in a woman 's keeping , that could ever get the least account o n't .

Well , sir , even all this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your travels have improved your talent of talking , but they are not of force , I hope , to impair your morals . Mir . Young Mirabel Morals ! Why , there ' t is again now . Do n't you know , that of all commerce in the world there is no such cozenage and deceit as in the traffic between man and woman ? We study all our lives long how to put tricks upon one another . No fowler lays abroad more nets for his game , nor a hunter for his prey , than you women do to catch poor innocent men . Why do you sit three or four hours at your toilet in the morning ? Only with a villanous design to make some poor fellow a fool before night . What d'ye sigh for ? What d'ye weep for ? What d'ye pray for ? Why , for a husband . That is , you implore Providence to assist you in the just and pious design of making the wisest of his creatures a fool , and the head of creation a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers quickly . Sir , I am proud of my power , and am resolved to use it . Mir . Young Mirabel Hold , hold , madam , not so fast . As you have variety of vanities to make coxcombs of us , so we have vows , oaths , and protestations , of all sorts and sizes , to make fools of you . And this , in short , my dear creature , is our present condition . And since we are both disappointed , let us make a drawn battle , and part clear on both sides . Ori . Oriana With all my heart , sir ; give me up my contract , and I 'll never see your face again . Mir . Young Mirabel Indeed I wo n't , child . Ori . Oriana You wo n't .

Oriana No , sir , you shall find me cunning enough to do myself justice ; and since I must not depend upon your love , I 'll be revenged and force you to marry me out of spite . Mir . Young Mirabel Then I 'll beat thee , out of spite ; and make a most confounded husband . Rises in a temper . Ori . Oriana Oh sir , I shall match ye : a good husband makes a good wife at any time .

They repeat these lines , each striving to have the last word . Exit ORIANA R. He calls after her and flings himself in a chair in triumph , when she puts her head in the doorway , and calls out , " A separate maintenance ! " and exit quickly as he starts up in a rage . Mir .

Mir . Old Mirabel Lookye , Mr. Dugard , good words go furtherest . I will do your sister justice , but it must be after my own rate ; nobody must abuse my son but myself . For although Bob be a sad dog , yet he 's nobody 's puppy but my own . Bis . Bisarre Crosses to O. MIR . Ay , that 's my sweet-natured , kind old gentleman . Wheedling him . We will be good then , if you 'll join us in the plot . O. Mir . Old Mirabel Ah , you coaxing young baggage ! What plot can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bisarre A plot that sixty-three is only good for , to bring other people together , sir ; a Spanish plot , and you must act the Spaniard , ' cause your son will least suspect you , and if he should , your authority protects you from a quarrel , to which Oriana is unwilling to expose her brother . O. Mir . Old Mirabel And what part will you act in the business , madam ? Bis . Bisarre Myself , sir . My friend is grown a perfect changeling ; these foolish hearts of ours spoil our heads presently ; the fellows no sooner turn knaves than we turn fools .

You must know , sir , that the intrigue lay folded up with his master 's clothes ; and when he went to dust the embroidered suit , the secret flew out of the right pocket of his coat , in a whole swarm of your crambo songs , short-footed odes , and long-legged Pindarics . O. Mir . Old Mirabel Impossible ! Pet .

Duretete Nay , I shall match her in philosophical ogles , faith ; that 's my talent ; I can talk best , you must know , when I say nothing . Pet . Petit But d'ye ever laugh , sir ? Dur . Duretete Laugh ! Wo n't she endure laughing ? Pet .

Bisarre With a book  --  walks across the room as if reading ; then throws herself in a chair ; then closes the book impatiently and rises . Pshaw ! hang books ; they sour our temper , spoil our eyes , and ruin our complexions . Throws away the book .

Young Mirabel He dodges under her arm . Tune , all ye spheres , your instruments of joy , and carry round your spacious orbs the happy sound of Oriana 's health ; her soul , whose harmony was next to yours , is now in tune again ; the counterfeiting fair has played the fool .

How d'ye like the play we 've just seen and which the town 's raving over ? Mir . Young Mirabel Pshaw ! a trifle . But I was amazingly taken with the company in front . That lady , the rich beauty in the front box , had my attention . Ah , to my thinking , the audience , not the play , is the centre of poetry , because it 's the region of beauty . The ladies , methinks , have a more inspiring , triumphant air in the playhouse than anywhere else ; they sit commanding on their thrones with all their subject slaves about them ; their best clothes , best looks , shining jewels , sparkling eyes , the treasure of the world in a ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first night of a new play .

Duretete But you have owned to me that , abating Oriana 's pretentions to your hand , you loved her passionately ; then how can you wander at this rate ? Mir . Young Mirabel I longed for a partridge t' other day off the king 's plate ; but d'ye think , because I could not have it , I must eat nothing ? Enter ORIANA , in boy 's clothes , with a letter , L.

Lookye , sirrah ! if ever you would rise by a great man , be sure to be with him in his little actions ; and , as a step to your advancement , follow your master immediately . Ori . Oriana Sir , I fly to obey ! Exit R. Dur . Duretete Now would I sooner take a cart in company of the hangman than a coach with that woman . What a strange antipathy have I against these creatures ; a woman to me is aversion upon aversion , a cheese , a cat , the squalling of children , the grinding of knives , and the snuff of a candle .

He goes up , and brings forward two chairs , one of which he offers to LAMORCE , who sits . The other BRAVOES sit , R. and L. , except the first , who plumps into MIRABEL 'S seat as he is about to sit in it himself . MIRABEL , after a moment 's pause , goes up for another chair , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRAVO , while the first BRAVO stretches his legs forward , and places his feet on the chair . MIRABEL laughs , and brings forward a third chair . Next the lady , pray , sir . All are seated . Lam . Lamorce Well , sir , and how d'ye like my friends ? Mir . Young Mirabel Oh , madam , the most finished gentlemen ; I never was more happy in good company in my life . Lam . Lamorce Laughs . Sir , you have got the prettiest ring upon your finger there  --  Mir . Young Mirabel Ah , madam ! ' t is at your service , with all my heart . Lam . Lamorce Oh , my dear sir  --  a family ring . I could n't think of depriving you . Takes it . The BRAVOES laugh brutally . Mir . Young Mirabel No matter , madam . Aside . Seven hundred pounds , by this light . 2d Bra . 2nd Bravo Pray , sir , what 's o'clock ? Mir . Young Mirabel Hum ! Sir , I have left my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I saw the string of it just now . Mir . Young Mirabel Ods my life , sir , I beg your pardon ; here it is  --  but it do n't go . Puts it up . Lam . Lamorce Oh dear , sir , an English watch , I presume ? Mir . Young Mirabel D'ye like it , madam ? No ceremony , ' t is at your service , with all my heart and soul . Hands her the watch . 1st Bra . 1st Bravo But , sir , above all things I admire the fashion and make of your sword-hilt . Mir . Young Mirabel I 'm mighty glad you like it , sir . 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Will you part with it , sir ? Mir . Young Mirabel I wo n't sell it . 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Not sell it , sir ? All start up threateningly . Mir . Young Mirabel Sell my sword , no , sir ! But I 'll bestow it with all my heart . Offers it . Bravoes . Ah ! ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , we rob you . Mir . Young Mirabel Aside . That you do , I 'll be sworn . Aloud . I have another at home , sir . Gentlemen , you 're too modest ; have I anything else that you fancy ? Sir , will you do me a favor ? To the FIRST BRAVO . I am extremely in love with that hat which you wear ; will you do me the favor to change with me ? 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Lookye , sir , this is a family hat he twists it around admiringly , and I would not part with it ; but if you like it  --  Mir . Young Mirabel Sir , your most humble servant . They change hats . 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Madam , your most humble slave . Goes up foppishly to the LADY , and salutes her , raising his hat and bowing very low with mock courtesy  --  then swaggers back to his place . 3d Bra . 3rd Bravo Aside to others . The fellow 's very liberal ; shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no ; I want but a handsome pretence to quarrel with him , for you know we must act like gentlemen . Aloud . Here , some wine . Wine brought by a PAGE who places it on table C. and exit . All the BRAVOES get wine and return to their seats . MIRABEL is leaning over LAMORCE 'S chair speaking with her , when the FIRST BRAVO taps him on the shoulder . He pays no attention . The BRAVO slaps him heavily on the back . He turns . BRAVO clinks glasses with him . Sir , your good health ! At which MIRABEL throws the wine in his face ; and the BRAVO seizes him by the nose and throws him to the corner . MIRABEL , enraged , seeks his sword and finds it gone , as he makes a dash for the rascal . All the BRAVOES start up , and MIRABEL then realizes his position , and gradually works himself into a laugh . Mir . Young Mirabel Ah ! ha , ha ! That 's what you call a joke ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! sir , your most humble servant ; a pleasant frolic enough , to drink a man 's health and pull him by the nose ; ha , ha , ha ! the pleasantest , pretty-humored gentleman . Lam . Lamorce Help the gentleman to a glass . SECOND BRAVO helps MIRABEL , and , unseen , he tosses the wine over his shoulder . 1st Bra . 1st Bravo How d'ye like the wine , sir ? Mir . Young Mirabel Very good o ' the kind , sir . But I tell ye what ; I find we 're all inclined to be frolicsome , and , egad , for my own part I was never more disposed to be merry ; let 's make a night o n't , ha ! This wine is pretty , but I have such Burgundy at home ! Lookye , gentlemen , let me send for half a dozen flasks of my Burgundy ; I defy France to match it ; ' twill make us all life , all air , pray gentlemen . 3d Bra . 3rd Bravo Eh ! shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , faith , we 'll have all we can get . Here , call up the gentleman 's servant . Aside . What think you , Lamorce ? Lam . Lamorce Aside . Yes , yes . Aloud . Your servant is a foolish country-boy , sir ; he understands nothing but innocence . Mir . Young Mirabel Ay , ay , madam . Here , page ! Enter ORIANA , C. L. Take this key , and go to my butler ; order him to send me half a dozen flasks of the red Burgundy , marked a thousand ; and be sure the BRAVOES start as he says " be sure , " very pointedly ; and after smiling at them he continues you make haste . I long to entertain my friends , here , my very good friends . Omnes . Ah , dear sir ! 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Here , child , take a glass of wine . Your master and I have changed hats , honey , in a frolic . Where had you this pretty boy , honest Mustapha ? Ori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder in caution . Mir . Young Mirabel Out of Picardy  --  this is the first errand he has made for me , and if he does it right I 'll encourage him . Ori . Oriana The red Burgundy , sir ? Mir . Young Mirabel The red , marked a thousand ; and be sure same business here as before you make haste . Ori . Oriana I shall , sir . Exit C. L. 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Sir , you were pleased to take my hat ; have you any fancy for my coat ? Lookye , sir , it has served a great many honest gentlemen very faithfully . Slaps MIRABEL familiarly on the shoulder . He almost allows his anger to get the best of him . The BRAVOES laugh . Mir . Young Mirabel Aside . The insolence of these dogs is beyond their cruelty . Lam . Lamorce You 're melancholy , sir . Mir . Young Mirabel Only concerned , madam , that I should have no servant here but this little boy ; he 'll make some confounded blunder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be disappointed of my wine for the universe . Lam . Lamorce He 'll do well enough , sir . A PAGE appears in doorway at R. But supper 's ready ; will you please to eat a bit , sir ? Mir . Young Mirabel Oh , madam , I never had a better stomach in my life . Lam . Lamorce Come , then , let me lead you . Mir . Young Mirabel Madam , I attend you with pleasure . Exit , handing the LADY out , preceded by the PAGE , R. , and followed by two of the BRAVOES. 2d Bra . 2nd Bravo Shall we despatch him ? I think he knows me. 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Ay , ay , dead men tell no tales . Let me but see the outer door quite safe , and then we 'll do the right thing by our gentleman . I ha' n't the confidence to look a man in the face after I have done him an injury , so we 'll cut his throat to spare his feelings . Exeunt BRAVOES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , looking after the BRAVOES . Mir . Young Mirabel Cutthroats , murderers , hounds ! I overheard you ! Was not I , two hours ago , the happy , gay , rejoicing Mirabel ? Life courted me with all the charms of vigor , youth , and fortune : and to be torn away from all my promised joys is more than death ; the manner , too  --  by villains ! Oh , Oriana ! this very moment might have blessed me with thy happy smile ! Confusion ! they come . I must dissemble still . Enter the four BRAVOES ; they advance , two on each side , in a manner surrounding him . No news of my wine , gentlemen ? 1st Bra . 1st Bravo No , sir ; I believe your country-booby has lost himself , and we can wait no longer for't . True , sir , you 're a pleasant gentleman , but I suppose you understand our business ? Mir . Young Mirabel Sir , I may go near to guess at your employments : you , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physician ; you , a scrivener ; and you , a stock-jobber . Aside . All cutthroats , egad . 4th Bra . 4th Bravo Sir , I am a broken officer ; I was cashiered at the head of the army for a coward ; so I took up the trade of murder to retrieve the reputation of my courage . 3d Bra . 3rd Bravo I am a soldier too , and would serve my king ; but I do n't like his cause of quarrel , and I have more honor than to fight in a bad cause . 2d Bra . 2nd Bravo I was bred a gentleman , and I have no estate ; but I must have my frolic and my bottle , through the prejudice of education . 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Sir , I am a ruffian , plain and simple as you see me : by the prejudice of education I was bred a butcher . In short , sir , if your wine had come , we might have trifled a little longer . Come , sir , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draws . 2d Bra . 2nd Bravo Or mine ? Draws . 3d Bra . 3rd Bravo Or mine ? Draws . 4th Bra . 4th Bravo Or mine ? Draws . Mir . Young Mirabel I scorn to beg my life , but to be butchered thus ! As each ruffian speaks , pleased at his own wit , he turns up the stage a little ; so , at the end , all are at R. H. in a cluster , and now advance a step , and at the end all make a rush at MIRABEL , but are arrested by a knocking , now heard outside . The wine , the wine ! Gentlemen ! Aside. ! Recoils down stage . The wine , child ? Faintly . Ori . Oriana Coming up , sir . Stamps . The BRAVOES rush on MIRABEL , who dashes up C. , when DURETETE enters at C. with his sword drawn , followed by the musketeers , who present their pieces . The ruffians shrink into L. corner , and drop their swords . MIRABEL throws himself into DURETETE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delirium of joy . ORIANA goes off , R. The soldiers recover arms at a signal from DURETETE . Mir . Young Mirabel The wine ! the wine ! the wine ! Youth , pleasure , fortune , days and years are now my own again ! Ah ! my dear friends , did not I tell you this wine would make me merry ? Dear captain , these gentlemen are the best-natured , facetious , witty creatures that you ever knew . To 1st BRAVO . Really , sir I beg your pardon , but I 've taken quite a fancy to your hat . BRAVO gives it up . Oh , I fear I rob you . Bravo . Do n't mention it . Enter LAMORCE , R. Lam . Lamorce Is the wine come , sir ? Mir . Young Mirabel Oh , yes , madam , the wine is come  --  see there . The red Burgundy , marked a thousand ! Pointing to the SOLDIERS . Your ladyship has got a very fine ring upon your finger . Lam . Lamorce Sir , ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! is it so ? Thou dear seven hundred pounds , thou'rt welcome home again , with all my heart . Replacing ring on his own finger . Ads my life , madam , you have got the finest built watch there ! English , I presume ? Lam . Lamorce Sir , you may wear it . Mir . Young Mirabel Oh , madam , by no means ; ' t is too much . To rob you of all ! Takes it from her . Good time , dear time , thou'rt a precious thing ; I 'm glad I have retrieved thee . Puts it up . What , my friends , neglected all this while ? Gentlemen , you 'll pardon my complaisance to the lady . How now ? is it civil to be out of humor at my entertainment , and I so pleased with yours ? Captain , you 're surprised at all this ; but we 're in our frolics , you must know . Some wine . Come , captain , this worthy gentleman 's health . Takes wine , and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , at which he roars . Captain , you must understand that 's a joke in this house  --  to drink a man 's health , and then pull him by the nose . But now , where  --  where 's my dear deliverer  --  my boy , my charming boy ? 1st Bra . 1st Bravo I hope some of our crew below stairs have cut his throat . Mir . Young Mirabel Villain , what say'st thou ? I 'll have ye all tortured , racked , torn to pieces alive , if you have touched my boy ! Here , page ! page ! page ! Exit , C. R. , quickly . Dur . Duretete Here , gentlemen , be sure you secure those fellows . 1st Bra . 1st Bravo Yes , sir , we know you , and your guard will be very civil to us . Half the SOLDIERS march down and force the BRAVOES off , L. Dur . Duretete Now for you , madam . Snapdragon ! Hands LAMORCE off , L. , followed by remaining SOLDIERS . A cart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one woman at last . Enter OLD MIRABEL , followed by BISARRE and DUGARD , C. L. O. Mir . Old Mirabel Bob ! Bob ! where 's my Bob ? Where 's my boy ? Re-enter MIRABEL . O. Mir . Old Mirabel Ah , my dear Bob , art thou safe , man ? Runs and embraces him . Mir . Young Mirabel No , no , sir , I 'm ruined ! the saver of my life is lost ! O. Mir . Old Mirabel R. C. No , he came and brought us the news . Mir . Young Mirabel But where is he ? O. Mir . Old Mirabel It is n't a he , it 's a she ! Mir . Young Mirabel What d'ye tell me ? OLD MIRABEL goes to C. and calls . O. Mir . Old Mirabel Come in , you baggage ! Re-enter ORIANA , C. L. Mir . Young Mirabel Oriana ! my preserver ! Oriana  --  my page ! Ori . Oriana In that disguise I resolved to follow you abroad , counterfeited the letter that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange turn of fate , I became the instrument of your preservation . Dur . Duretete Mirabel , you 're caught . Mir . Young Mirabel Caught ! I scorn the thought of imposition ! Caught ! No , ' t is my voluntary act ; here , on my knees , I humbly beg my fair preserver 's pardon : my thanks are needless , for myself I owe . And now forever do protest me yours . O. Mir . Old Mirabel Tall all di dall . Sings . Kiss me , daughter . Well , Bisarre , what say you to the captain ? Bis . Bisarre I like the beast well enough , but I do n't understand his paces so well as to venture him in a strange road . To DURETETE . But come ! come ! Dur . Duretete There 's but one thing should make me thy husband  --  I could marry thee to-day for the privilege of beating thee to-morrow . O. Mir . Old Mirabel Come , come , you may agree for all this . Mr. Dugard , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if I thought it might secure your son 's affection to my sister , I would double her fortune . Mir . Young Mirabel Fortune ! has she not given me mine  --  my life , my estate , my all , and , what is more , her loyal self ? EPILOGUE . Spoken by ORIANA . Not yet ! For what if Oriana choose The crown of all your rapture to refuse ? Through many a maze of frolic , yet of pain , Her faithful heart has felt your gay disdain ! Shall she not triumph  --  now the strife is o'er  --  And punish him who vexed her so before ? No ! Take her hand . Her heart has long been yours . True love in trouble all the more endures ! She 'll cling the closer for the risk she braved And cherish all the more the life she saved . There 's naught a loving woman will not do When once she feels her lover 's heart is true . Back matter CURTAIN .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
