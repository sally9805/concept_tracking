txt Referring to the political situation , the Impartial ( independent ) remarks : " Sefior Sagasta 's Government finally struck the Spanish note yesterday , the result being a reunion of the Government and the people . To-day we are all Spaniards , we forget party lines , and we are united around the State . " The Globo ( Liberal ) severely censures the Carlist manifesto , saying it considers it " not patriotic , out revolutionary , " and adding : " The Government requires no spur to defend the rights of the nation . It will not strike first , but it will return a blow . " The Liberal approves the " energetic measures adopted by the Government yesterday , " remarking : " Only through Parliament can all which the nation should know be made known . " The Liberal advises the press to " confine itself to fanning the warlike enthusiasm , " adding : " No new discussion is possible while Spain 's sovereignty in Cuba is challenged . " The Epoca , ( Conservative , ) considering that war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthening alike the public spirit and the hands of the Government . It compliments the Queen Regent on her generous subscription to the navy fund , denounces severely the Congressional references to the Maine disaster , highly approving the decision of the Government thereupon , and says that " the world now knows American humanitarianism spells hypocrisy . " The Epoca says also it is glad that Sefior Polo y Bernabe has orders for withdrawal from Washington should an official act sanction American intervention in Cuba . The world , it declares , already possesses plenty of proof . of Spain 's patience and moderation , though , as the cessation of diplomatic relations is a step toward war , it ( the Epoca ) could wish that the initiative had been left to America . The Ministerial El Correo calls attention to the fact that the United States Senate has not yet voted , though the paper believes a vote will be taken to-day , or at the latest , to-morrow . It says : " Even supposing that the resolutions adopted by the two Chambers are different , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he only the briefest discussion . What will be the President 's conduct , supposing that the Senate agrees with the resolutions adopted by the House of Representatives ? He will remain armed with the authority he requested in his message to Congress , namely , the authority to intervene and solely that . " Clearly the President will not give independence , seeing that he excludes that idea from his message , to the disgust a:ike of the New York Junta and the insurgents . What government , then , will President establish that will ' conform to American interests and the principles of humanity ? ' It is not logical to suppose that President refers to the Autonomous Government now existing in Cuba ; and , therefore , he must look for it to the United States , seeking annexation and caring nothing for the independence of the Cuban people . Consequently , his message was purely negative , rejecting alike Spanish and Cuban government . Will this self-styled Christian and humanitarian nation plunge into the horrors of war ? No wonder all Europe will rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice and right will be on the side of Spain . "
