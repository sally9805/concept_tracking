txt IN August , 1857 , the long-cherished ambition of my father was realized . There was a vacancy in the corps of pages which I could fill before I had got beyond the age to which admission was limited , and I was taken to St. Petersburg and entered the school . Only a hundred and fifty boys - mostly children of the nobility belonging to the court - received education in this privileged corps , which combined the character of a military school endowed with special rights and of a court institution attached to the imperial household . After a stay of four or five years in the corps of pages , those who had passed the final examinations were received as officers in any regiment of the guard or of the army they chose , irrespective of the number of vacancies in that regiment ; and each year the first sixteen pupils of the highest form were nominated jpages de chambre ; that is , they were personally attached to the several members of the imperial family , - the Emperor , the Empress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered , of course , a great honor ; and , moreover , the young men upon whom this honor was bestowed became known at the court , and had afterward every chance of being nominated aides-de-camp of the Emperor or of one of the grand dukes , and consequently had every facility for making a brilliant career in the service of the state . Fathers and mothers of families connected with the court took due care , therefore , that their boys should not miss entering the corps of pages , even though entrance had to be secured at the expense of other candidates who never saw a place opening for them . Now that I was in the select corps my father could give a free flight to his ambitious dreams . The corps was divided into five forms , of which the highest was the first , and the lowest the fifth , and the intention was that I should enter the fourth form . However , as it appeared at the examinations that I was not sufficiently familiar with decimal fractions , and as the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty had been mustered for the fifth form , I was enrolled in the latter . I felt extremely vexed at this decision . It was with reluctance that I entered a military school , and now I should have to stay in it five years instead of four . What should I do in the fifth form , when I knew already all that would be taught in it ? With tears in my eyes I spoke of it to the inspector ( the head of the educational department ) , but he answered me with a joke . " You know , " he remarked , " what C*sar said , - better to be the first in a village than the second in Rome . " To which I warmly replied that I should prefer to be the very last , if only I could leave the military school as soon as possible . " Perhaps , after some time , you will like the school , " he remarked , and from that day he took a liking to me . To the teacher of arithmetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of honor that I would never cast a glance into his textbook ; " and nevertheless you will have to give me the highest marks . " I kept my word ; but thinking now of this scene , I fancy that the pupil was not even then of a very docile disposition . And yet , as I look back upon that remote past , I can not but feel grateful for having been put in the lower form . // Having only to repeat during the first year what I already knew , I got into the habit of learning my lessons by merely listening to what the teachers said in the classroom ; and , the lessons over , I had plenty of time to read and to write to my heart 's content . When I reached the higher " special " forms , I was better prepared to master the variety of subjects we had to study . All children , I now think , would be benefited very much if serious teaching did not begin for them before they have reached a certain development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that age they learn veryquickly , and far better , what would have taken them years to master when younger ; and those early years could be so well utilized in many other ways . Besides , I spent more than half of the first winter in the hospital . Like all children who are not born at St. Petersburg , I had to pay a heavy tribute to " the capital on the swamps of Finland , " in the shape of several attacks of local cholera , and finally one of typhoid fever . When I entered the corps of pages , its inner life was undergoing a profound change . All Russia awakened at that time from the heavy slumber and the nightmare of the terrible years of Nicholas I. 's reign . Our school also felt the effects of that revival . I do not know , in fact , what would have become of me , had I entered the corps of pages one or two years sooner . Either my will would have been totally broken , or I should have bcen excluded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the transition period was already in full sway in the year 1857 . The director of the corps was an excellent old man , General Zheltiiikhin . But he was the nominal head only . The real master of the school was " the Colonel , " - Colonel Girardot , a Frenchman in the Russian service . People said he was a Jesuit , and so he was , I believe . His ways . at any rate , were thoroughly im bued with the teachings of Loyola , and his educational methods were those of the French Jesuit colleges . Imagine a short , extremely thin man , with dark , piercing , and furtive eyes , wearing very short clipped mustaches , which gave him the expression of a cat ; very quiet and firm ; not remarkably intelligent , but exceedingly cunning ; a despot at the bottom of his heart , who was capable of hating - intensely hating - the boy who would not fall under his fascination , and of expressing that hatred , not by silly persecutions , hut , unceasingly , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gesture , a smile , an interjection . His walk was more like gliding along , and the exploring glances he used to cast round without turning his head completed the illusion . A stamp of cold dryness was impressed on his lips , even when he tried to look well disposed , and that expression became still more harsh when his mouth was contorted by a smile of discontent or of contempt . With all this there was nothing of a commander in him ; you would rather think , at first sight , of a benevolent father who talks to his children as if they were full-grown people . And yet , you soon felt that every one and everything had to bend before his will . Woe to the boy who would not feel happy or unhappy accord5ng to the degree of good will shown toward him by the Colonel . The words " the Colonel " were continually on all lips . Other officers went by their nicknames , but no one dared to give a nickname to the Colonel . A sort of mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere present . True , he spent all the day and part of the night in the school . Even when we were in the classes he prowled about , visiting our drawers , which he opened with his own keys . As to the night , he gave a good portion of it to the task of inscribing in certain small books , - of which he had quite a lihrary , - in separate col // umns , by special signs and in inks of different colors , all the faults and virtues of each boy . Play , jokes , and conversations stopped when we saw him slowly moving along through our spacious rooms , hand in hand with one of his favorites , balancing his body forward and backward ; smiling at one boy , keenly looking into the eyes of another , casting an indifferent glance upon a third , and giving a slight contortion to his lip as he passed a fourth : and from these looks every one knew that he liked the first boy , that to the second he was indifferent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he disliked the fourth . This dislike was enough to terrify most boys , - the more so as no reason could be given for it . Impressionable boys had been brought to despair by that mute , unceasingly displayed aversion and those suspicious looks ; in others the result had been a total annihilation of will , as one of the Toistoys - Theodor , also a pupil of Girardot - has shown in an autobiographic novel , The Diseases of the Will . The inner life of the corps was miserable under the rule of the Colonel . In all boarding - schools the newly entered boys are subjected to petty persecutions . The " greenhorns " are submitted in this way to a test . What are they worth ? Are they going to turn " telltales " ? And then the " old hands " like to show to newcomers the superiority of an established brotherhood . So it goes in all schools and in prisons . But under Girardot 's rule these persecutions took on a harsher aspect , and they came , not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first form , - the pages de chambre , who were non-commissioned officers , and whom Girardot had placed in a quite exceptional , superior position . His system was to give them carte blanche ; to pretend that he did not know even the horrors they were enacting ; and to *inaintam through them a severe discipline . of a Revolutionist. 763 To answer a blow received from a page de chambre would have meant , in the times of Nicholas I. , to be sent to a battalion of soldiers ' sons , if the fact became public ; and to revolt in any way against the mere caprice of a page de chambre meant that the twenty youths of the first form , armed with their heavy oak rulers , would assemble in a room , and , with Girardot 's tacit approval , administer a severe beating to the boy who had shown such a spirit of insubordination . Accordingly , the first form did what they liked ; and not further back than the preceding winter one of their favorite games had been to assemble the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nightshirts , and to make them run round , like horses in a circus , while the pages de chambre , armed with thick india - rubber whips , standing some in the centre and the others on the outside , pitilessly whipped the boys . As a rule the " circus " ended in an Oriental fashion , in an abominable way . The moral conceptions which prevailed at that time , and the foul talk which went on in the school concerning what occurred at night after a circus , were such that the least said about them the better . The Colonel knew all this . He had a perfectly organized system of espionage , and nothing escaped his knowledge . But so long as he was not known to know it , all was right . To shut his eyes to what was done by the first form was the foundation of his system of maintaining discipline . However , a new spirit was awakened in the school , and only a few months before I entered it a revolution had taken place . That year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . It contained a number of young men who learned splendidly , and read a good deal ; some of them became , later , men of mark . My first acquaintance with one of them - let me call him von Schauff - was when he was reading Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason . Besides , // they had amongst them some of the strongest youths of the school . The tallest member of the corps was in that form , as also a very strong young man , K6shtoff , a great friend of von Schauff . They could not bear the yoke of the pages de chambre with the same docility with which it had been endured up to that time ; they looked with disgust upon what was going on ; and in consequence of an incident , which I prefer not to describe , a fight took place between the third and the first form , with the result that the pages de chambre got a very severe thrashing from their subordinates . Girardot hushed up the affair , but the authority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never more were they put to use . The circuses and the rest became things of the past . That much was won ; but the lowest form , the fifth , composed almost entirely of very young boys who had just entered the school , had still to obey the petty caprices of the pages de chambre without murmuring . We had a beautiful garden , filled with old trees , but the boys of the fifth form could enjoy it little : they were forced to run a roundabout , while the pages de chambre sat in it and chattered , or to send back the balls when these gentlemen played ninepins . A couple of days after I had entered the school , seeing how things stood in the garden , I did not go there , but remained upstairs . I was reading , when a page de chambre , with carroty hair and a face covered with freckles , came upon me , and ordered me to go at once to the garden to run the roundabout . " I will not ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anger disfigured his already unpleasant face . He was ready to jump upon me . I took the defensive . He tried to give me blows on the face with his cap . I fenced as best I could . Then he flung his cap on the floor . " Pick it up . " of a Revolutionist . " Pick it up yourself . " Such an act of disobedience was unheard of in the school . Why he did not beat me unmercifully on the spot I do not know . He was much older and stronger than I was . Next day and the following days Ireceived similar commands , but obstinately remained upstairs . Then began the most exasperating petty persecutions at every step , - enough to bring one to despair . Happily , I was always of a jovial disposition , and answered with jokes , or took little heed of them . Still , my younger comrades were so vexed that they asked the third form to interfere , but received the wise reply that it would be impossible to engage in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , began to show us in various little ways its friendly disposition ; with von Schauff we had many points of contact . Moreover , all this soon came to an end . The weather turned rainy , and we spent most of our time indoors . In the garden the first form smoked freely enough , but when we were indoors the smoking club was " the tower . " It was kept beautifully clean , and a fire was always burning there . The pages de chambre severely punished all others whom they caught smoking , but they themselves sat continually at the fireside chattering and enjoying cigarettes . Their favorite smoking time was at night , after all were supposed to have gone to bed at ten ; they kept their club till half past eleven , and , to protect themselves from an unexpected interruption by Girardot , they ordered us to keep watch . The small boys of the fifth form were taken out of their b*ds in turn , two at a time , and they had to loiter about the staircase till half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel . We decided to put an end to these night watches . Long were the discussions , and the higher forms were consulted as to what was to be done . At last the decision came : " Refuse , all of // you , to keep the watch ; and when they begin to beat you , which they are sure to do , go , as many of you as can , in a block , and call in Girardot . He knows it all , but then he will be bound to stop it . " The question whether that would not be " reporting " was settled in the negative by experts in honor matters : the pages de chambre did not behave toward the others like comrades . The turn to watch fell that night to a Prince Sh , an old hand , and to S , a newcomer , an extremely timid boy , who even spoke in a girlish voice . Sh was called upon first , but refused to go , and was left alone . Then two pages de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ; as he refused to obey , they began to flog him brutally with heavy leather braces . Sh woke up several comrades who were near at hand , and they all ran to find Girardot . I was also in bed when th' two came upon me , ordering me to take the watch . I refused . Thereupon , seizing two pairs of braces , - we always used to put our clothes in perfect order on a bench by the bedside , braces uppermost , and the necktie across them , - they began to flog me . Sitting up in bed , I fenced with my hands , and had already received several heavy blows , when a command resounded , - " The first form to the Colonel ! " The fierce fighters became tame at once , and hurriedly put my things in order . " Do n't say a word , " they whispered . " The necktie across , in good order , " I said to them , while my shoulders and arms burned from the blows . What Girardot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but next day , as we stood in the ranks before marching downstairs to the dining-room , he addressed us in a minor key , saying how sad it was that pages de chambre should have fallen upon a boy who was right in his refusal . And upon whom ? A newcomer , and so timid a boy as 5-was . The school were simply disgusted at that Jesuitic speech . of a Revolutionist. 765 No need to say that that was the end of the watch-keeping , and that it gave a final blow to the worrying of the newcomers : it has never been renewed . It surely was also a blow to Girardot 's authority , and he resented it very much . He regarded our form , and me especially , with great dislike ( the roundabout affair had been reported to him ) , and he manifested it at every opportunity . During the first winter I was a frequent inmate of the hospital . After suffering from typhoid fever , during which the director and the doctor bestowed on me a really parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks . Girardot , as he made his daily rounds of the hospital , seeing me so often there , began to say to me every morning , half jokingly , in French , " Here is a young man who is as healthy as the New Bridge , and loiters in the hospital . " Once or twice I replied jestingly , but at last , seeing malice in this constant repetition , I lost patience . Frequently boys pretended to be ill and went to the hospital when they did not know their lessons ; but there was no necessity for me to do so , and , as I never could bear a suspicion of deceit , I grew very angry . " How dare you say that ? " I exclaimed . " I shall ask the doctor to forbid your entering this room , " and so on . Girardot recoiled two steps his dark eyes glittered , his thin lip be*ame still thinner . At last he said , " I have offended you , have I ? Well , we have in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't make jokes , and I tell you that I shall bear no more of your insinuations , " I continued . He did not repeat his joke , but regarded me with even more dislike than before . Happily enough , there was little opportunity for punishing me . I did not smoke ; my clothes were always hooked // and buttoned , and properly folded at night . I liked all sorts of games , but , plunged as I was in reading and in a correspondence with my brother , I could hardly find time to play a lapta match ( a sort of cricket ) in the garden , and always hurried back to my books . But when I was caught in fault , it was not I that Girardot punished , but the page de chambre who was my superior . Once , for instance , at dinner , I made a physical discovery : I noticed that the sound given out by a tumbler depends on the amount of water it contains , and at once tried to obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and without saying a word to me he ordered my page de chambre under arrest . It so happened that this young man was an excellent fellow , a third cousin of mine , who refused even to listen to my excuses , saying , " All right . I know be dislikes you . " His comrades , though , gave me a warning . " Take care , naughty boy ; we are not going to be punished for you , " they said ; and if reading had not been my all-absorbing occupation , they probably would have made me pay dearly for my physical experiment . All the comrades and officers spoke of Girardot 's dislike for me ; but I paid no attention to it , and probably increased it by my indifference . For full eighteen months he refused to give me the epaulet , s , which were usually given to newly entered 1*oys after one or two months ' stay at the school , when they had learned some of the rudiments of military drill ; but I felt quite happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the best teacher of drill in the school , a man simply enamored of drill - volunteered to teach me ; and when he saw me performing all the tricks to his entire satisfaction , he undertook to introduce me to Girardot . The Colonel refused again , twice in succession , so that the officer took it as a personal offense ; and when the director of the corps once asked him why I had no epaulets yet , he bluntly answered , " The boy is all right ; it is the Colonel who does not want him ; " whereupon , probably after a remark of the director , Girardot himself asked to reexamine me , and gave me the epaulets that very dny . But the Colonel 's influence was rapidly vanishing . The whole character of the school was changing . For twenty years Girardot had realized his ideal , which was to have the pages nicely combed , curled , and girlish looking , and to send to the court pages as refined as courtiers of Louis XIV . Whether they learned or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes-baskets were best filled with all sorts of nail-brushes and scent bottles , whose " private " uniform ( which could be put on when we went home on Sundays ) was of the best make , and who knew how to make the most elegant salut oblique . Formerly , when Girardot had held rehearsals of court ceremonies , wrapping up a page in a striped red cotton cover taken from one of our beds , in order that he might represent the Empress at a baisernctin , the boys almost religiously approached the imaginary Empress , seriously performed the ceremony of kissing the hand , and retired with a most elegant oblique bow ; but now , though they were very elegant at court , they would perform at the rehearsals such bearlike bows that all roared with laughter , while Girardot was simply raging . Formerly , the younger boys who had been taken to a cou*rt levee , and had been curled for that purpose , used to keep their curls as long as they would last ; now , on returning from the palace , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of the curls . An effeminate appearance was laughed at . To be sent to the palace to stand as a decoration at a levee was now considered a drudgery rather than a favor . And when the small boys who were occasionally taken to the palace to play with the little grand dukes remarked that one of // the latter used , in some game , to make a hard whip out of his handkerchief , and use it freely , one of our boys did the same , and so whipped the grand duke that he cried . Girardot was terrified , while the old Sebastopol admiral who was tutor of the grand duke only praised our boy . A new spirit , studious and serious , developed in the corps of pages , as in all other schools . Informer years , the pages , being sure that in one way or another they would get the necessary marks for being promoted officers of tfie guard , spent the first years in the school hardly learning at all , and only began to study more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower forms learned very well . The moral tone also became quite different from what it was a few years before . Oriental amusements were looked upon with disgust , and an attempt or two to revert to old manners resulted in scandals which reached the St. Petersburg drawing-rooms . Girardot was dismissed . He was only allowed to retain his bachelor apartment in the building of the corps , and we often saw him afterward , wrapped in his long military cloak , pacing along , plunged in reflections , - sad , I suppose , because he could not but condemn the new spirit which rapidly developed in the corps of pages . II . All over Russia people were talking of education . As soon as peace had been concluded at Paris , and the severity of censorship had been slightly relaxed , educational matters began to be eagerly discussed . The ignorance of the masses of the people , the obstacles that had hitherto been put in the way of those who wanted to learn , the absence of schools in the country , the obsolete methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite themes of discussion in educated circles , in the press , and even in the drawing-rooms of the aristocracy . The first high schools for girls had been opened in 1857 , on an excellent plan and with a splendid teaching staff . As by magic a number of men and women came to the front who not only have since devoted their lives to education , but have proved to be such remarkable practical pedagogists that their writings would occupy a place of honor in every civilized literature , if they were known abroad . The corps of pages also felt the effect of that revival . Apart from a few exceptions , the general tendency of the three younger forms was to study . The head of the educational department , the inspector , Winkler , who was a well-educated colonel of artillery , a good mathematician , and a man of progressive opinions , hit upon an excellent plan for stimulating that spirit . Instead of the indifferent teachers who formerly used to teach in the lower forms , he endeavored to secure the best ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach the very beginnings of a subject to the youngest boys . Thus , to teach the elements of algebra in the fourth form he invited a first-rate mathematician and a born teacher , Captain Sukh6-nin , and the form took at once to mathematics . By the way , it so happened that this captain was a tutor of the heir of the throne ( Nikolai Alexdndrovich , who died at the age of twenty-two ) , and the heir apparent was brought once a week to the corps of pages to be present *t the algebra lessons of Captain Sukh6nin . Empress Marie Alexdndrovna , who was an educated woman , thought that perhaps the contact with studious boys would stimulate her son to learning . He sat amongst us , and had to answer questions like all the others . But he managed mostly , while the teacher spoke , to make drawings very nicely , or to whisper all sorts of droll things to his neighbors . He was exceedingly goodnatured and gentle in his behavior , but rather superficial in learning as in his affections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable men . He entered our classroom , one day , quite radiant , and told us that we should have a rare chance . Professor Klas6vsky , a great classical scholar and expert . in Russian literature , had consented to teach us Russian grammar , and would take us through all the five forms in succession , shifting with us every year to the next form . Another university professor , Herr Becker , librarian of the imperial ( national ) library , would do the same in German . Professor Klas6vsky , he added , was in weak health that winter , but the inspector was sure that we would be very quiet in his class . The chance to have such a teacher was too good to be missed . He had thought aright . We became very proud of having university professors for teachers , and although there came voices from the Kamch*itka ( in Russia , the back benches of each class bear the name of that remote and uncivilized peninsula ) to the effect that " the sausage-maker " - that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , public opinion in our form was decidedly in favor of the professors . " The sausage - maker " won our respect at once . A tall man , with an immense forehead and very kind , intelligent eyes , not devoid of a touch of humor , came into our class , and told us in quite good Russian that he intended to divide our form into three sections . The first section would be composed of Germans , who already knew the language , and from whom he would require more serious work ; to the second section he would teach grammar , and later on German literature , in accordance with the established programmes ; and the third section , he concluded with a charming smile , would be the Kamchi*tka . " From you , " he said , " I shall only require that at each lesson you copy four lines which I will choose for you from a book . The four lines copied , you can do what you like ; only do not hinder the rest . And I promise you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German literature . Now , who joins the Germans ? You , Stackelberg ? You , Lainsdorf ? Perhaps some one of the Russians ? And who joins the Kamch*tka ? " Five or six boys , who knew not a word of German , took residence in the peninsula . They most conscientiously copied their four lines , - a dozen or a score of lines in the higher forms , - and Becker chose the lines so well , and bestowed so much attention* upon the boys , that by the end of the five years they really knew something of the language and its literature . I joined the Germans . My brother Alexander insisted so much in his letters upon my acquiring German , which possesses so rich a literature and into which every book of value is translated , that I set myself assiduously to learn it . I translated and studied most thoroughly one page of a rather difficult poetical description of a thunderstorm , and learned by heart , as the professor had advised me , the conjugations , the adverbs , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for learning languages . Becker advised me , moreover , to subscribe to a cheap illustrated weekly , and its illustrations and short stories were a continual inducement to read a few lines or a column . I soon mastered the language . Toward the end of the winter I asked Herr Becker to lend me a copy of Goethe 's Faust . I had read it iu a Russian translation ; I had also read Turgu6neff 's beautiful novel , Faust ; and I now longed to read the great work in the original . " You will understand nothing in it ; it is too philosophical , " Becker said , with his gentle smile ; but he brought me , nevertheless , a little square book , with the pages yellowed by age , containing the immortal drama . He little knew the unfathomable joy that that small square book gave mc . I drank in the sense and the music of every line of it , beginning with the very // first verses of the ideally beautiful dedication , and soon knew full pages by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the lines in which he speaks of his understanding of nature , " Thou Not only cold , amazed acquaintance yield'st , But grantest that in her profoundest breast I gaze , as in the bosom of a friend , " simply put me in ecstasy , and till now it has retained its power over me . Every verse gradually became a dear friend . And then , is there a higher aesthetic delight than to read poetry in a language which one does not yet quite thoroughly understand ? The whole is veiled with a sort of slight haze , which admirably suits poetry . Words , the trivial meaning of which , when one knows the language colloquially , sometimes interferes with the poetical image they are intended to convey , retain but their subtle , elevated sense ; while the music of the poetry is only the more strongly impressed upon the ear . Professor Klas6vsky 's first lesson was a revelation to us . He was a small man , about fifty years of age , very rapid in his movements , with bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high forehead of a poet . When he came in for his first lesson , he said in a low voice that , suffering from a protracted illness , he could not speak loud enough , and asked us , therefore , to sit closer to him . He placed his chair near the first row of tables , and we clustered round him like a swarm of bees . He was to teach us Russian grammar ; but , instead of the dull grammar lesson , we heard something quite different from what we expected . It was grammar ; but here came in a comparison of an old Russian folklore expression with a line from Homer or from the Sanskrit Mahabharata , the beauty of which was rendered in Russian words ; there , a verse from Schiller was introduced , and was followed by a sarcastic remark about some modern society prejudice ; then solid grammar again , and then some wide poetical or philosophical generalization . Of course , there was much in it that we did not understand , or of which we missed the deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies lie in that they continually open up to us new , unsuspected horizons , not yet understood , which entice us to proceed further and further in the penetration of what appears in vague outlines , only , at the first sight ? Our hands placed on one another 's shoulders , some of us leaning across the tables of the first row , others standing close behind Klas6vsky , our eyes glittering , we all hung on his lips . The more his voice fell , toward the end of the hour , the more breathlessly we listened . The inspector opened the door of the classroom , to see how we behaved with our new teacher ; but on seeing that motionless swarm he retired on tiptoe . Even Daiiroff , a restless spirit , stared at Klas6vsky as if to say , " That is the sort of man you are ? " Even von Kleinau , a hopelessly obtuse Circassian with a German name , sat motionless . In most of the others something good and elevated simmered at the bottom of their hearts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Upon me Klas6vsky had an immense influence , which only grew with years . Winkler 's prophecy , that , after all , I might like the school , was fulfilled . In western Europe , and probably in America , that type of teacher - " the teacher of literature " - is unknown ; but in Russia there is not a man or woman of mark , in literature or in political life , who does not owe the first impulse toward a higher development to his or her teacher of literature . Every school in the world ought to have such a teacher . Each teacher in a school has his own subject , and there is no link between the different subjects . Only the // teacher of literature , guided by the general outlines of the programme , but left free to treat it as he likes , can bind together the separate historical and humanitarian sciences that are taught in a school , unify them by a broad philosophical and humane conception , and awaken higher ideas and inspirations in the brains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary task falls quite naturally upon the teacher of Russian literature . As he speaks of the development of the language , of the contents of the early epic poetry , of popular songs and music , and , later on , of modern fiction , of the scientific , political , and philosophical literature of his own country , and the divers aesthetical , political , and philosophical currents it has reflected , lie is bound to introduce that generalized conception of the development of human mind which lies beyond the scope of each of the subjects that are taught separately . The same thing ought to be done for the natural sciences as well . It is not enough to teach physics and chemistry , astronomy and meteorology , zo*Aogy and botany . The philosophy of all the natural sciences - a general view of nature as a whole , something on the lines of the first volume of Humboldt 's Cosmos - must be conveyed to the pupils and the students , whatsoever may be the extension given to the study of the natural sciences in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of all the exact sciences , and an inspired conception of the life of nature must make part of education . Perhaps the teacher of geography might provisionally assume this function ; but then we should require quite a different set of teachers of this subject , and a different set of professors of geography iii the universities would be needed . What is now taught under this name is anything you like , but it is not geography . uproarious form in a quite different manner . It was the teacher of writing , the last one of the teaching staff . If the " heathen " - that is , the German and the French teachers - were regarded with little respect , the teacher of writing , Ebert , who was a German Jew , was a real martyr . To be insolent with him was a sort of chic amongst the pages . His poverty alone must have been the reason why lie kept to his lesson in our corps . The old hands , who had stayed for two or three years in the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but by some means or other he had made an agreement with them " One frolic during each lesson , but no more , " - an agreement which , I am afraid , was not always honestly kept on our side . One day , one of the residents of the remote peninsula soaked the blackboard sponge with ink and chalk and flung it at the cahigraphy martyr . " Get it , Ebert ! he shouted , with a stupid smile . The sponge touched Ebcrt 's shoulder , glanced into his face and down on his white shirt , covering both with ink and chalk . All saw it , and were sure that this time Ebert would leave the room and report the fact to the inspector . But he only exclaimed , as lie took out his cotton handkerchief and wiped his face , " Gentlemen , one frolic , - no more today ! " " The shirt is spoiled , " he added in a subdued voice , and continued to correct some one 's book . We looked stupefied and ashamed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought at once of the agreement ! All feelings turned in his favor . " What you have done is stupid , " we reproached our comrade . " He is a poor juan , and you have spoiled his shirt ! Shame ! " somebody cried . The culprit went at once to make excuses . " One must learn , " was all that Ebert said in reply , with sadness in his Another teacher conquered our rather voice . // All became silent after that , and at the next lesson , as if we had settled it beforehand , many of us wrote in our best possible handwriting , and took our books to Ebert , asking him to correct them . He was radiant ; he felt happy that day . This fact deeply impressed me , and was never wiped out from my memory . To this day I feel grateful to that remarkable man for his lesson . With our teacher of drawing , who was named Ganz , we never came to live on good terms . He continually reported those who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie had no right to do , because he was only a teacher of drawing , but especially because he was not an honest man . In the class he paid little attention to most of us , and spent his time in improving the drawings of those who took private lessons from him , or paid him in order to show at the examinations a good drawing and to get a good mark for it . Against those comrades who did so we had no grudge . On the contrary , we thought it quite right that those who had no capacity for mathematics or no memory for geography , and had but poor marks in these subjects , should improve their total of marks by ordering from a draughtsman a drawing or a topographical map for which they would get " a full twelve . " Only for the first two pupils of the form it would not have been fair to resort to such means , while the remainder could do it with untroubled consciences . But the teacher had no business to make drawings to order ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ought to bear with resignation the noise an ( l the tricks of his pupils . That was our ethics . Instead of this , no lesson passe ( l without his lodging complaints , and each time he grew more arrogant . As soon as we were moved to the fourth form , and felt ourselves naturalized citizens of the corps , we decided to tighten the bridle upon him . " It is your own fault , " our elder comrades told us , " that he takes such airs with you ; we used to keep him in obedience . " So we decided to bring him into subjection . One day , two excellent comrades of our form approached Ganz with cigarettes in their mouths , and asked him to oblige them with a light . Of course , that was only meant for a joke , - no one ever thonght of smoking in the classrooms , - and , according to our rules of propriety , Ganz had merely to send the two boys away ; but he inscribed them in the journal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We decided to give him a " benefit night . " That meant that one day all the form , provided with rulers borrowed from the upper forms , would start an outrageous noise by striking the rulers against the tables , and send the teacher out of the class . However , the plot offered many difficulties . We had in our form a lot of " goody " boys who would promise to join in the demonstration , but at the last moment would grow nervous and draw back , and then the teacher would name the others . In such enterprises unanimity is the first requisite , because the pun . ishment , whatsoever it may be , is always lighter when it falls on the whole class instead of on a few . The difficulties were overcome with a truly Machiavellian craft . At a given signal all were to turn their backs to Ganz , and then , with the rulers laid in readiness in the desks of the next row , they would produce the required noise . In this way the goody boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bnt the signal ? Whistling , as in robbers ' tales , shouting , or even sneezing would not do : Ganz would be capable of naming any one of us as having whistled or sneezed . The signal must be a silent one . One of us , who drew nicely , would take his drawing to show it to Ganz , and the moment he returned and took his seat , - that should be the time ! // All went on admirably . Nes*doff took up his drawing , and Ganz corrected it in a few minutes , which seemed to us an eternity . He returned at last to his seat ; he stopped for a moment , looking at us ; he sat down . . . . All the form turned suddenly on their seats , and the rulers rattled merrily within the desks , while some of us shouted amidst the noise , " Ganz out ! Down with him ! " The noise was deafening ; all the forms knew that Ganz had got his benefit night . He stood there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran in , - the noise continued ; then the sub-inspector dashed in , and after him the inspector . The noise stopped at once . Scolding began . " The elder under arrest at once ! " the inspector commanded ; and I , who was the first in the form , and consequently the elder , was marched to the black cell . That spared me seeing what followed . The director came ; Ganz was asked to name the ringleaders , but he could name nobody . " They all turned their backs to me , and began the noise , " was his reply . Thereupon the form was taken downstairs , and although flogging had been completely abandoned in our school , this time the two who had been reported because they asked for a light were flogged with the birch rod , under the pretext that the benefit night was a revenge for their punishment . I learned this ten days later , when I was allowed to return to the class . My name , which had been inscribed on the red board in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indifferent ; but I must confess that the ten days in the cell , without books , seemed to me rather long , so that I composed ( in horrible verses ) a poem , in which the deeds of the fourth form were duly glorified . Of course , our form became now the heroes of the school . For a month or so we had to tell and retell all about the affair to the other forms , and received congratulations for having managed it with of a Revolutionist. such unanimity that nobody was caught separately . And then came the Sundays - all the Sundays down to Christmas - that the form had to remain at the school , not being allowed to go home . Being all kept together , we managed to make those Sundays very gay . The mammas of the goody boys brought them heaps of sweets ; those who had some money spent it generously , and mountains of pastry - substantial before dinner , and sweet after it - were absorbed , while in the evenings the friends from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Ganz gave up inscribing any one ; but drawing was totally lost for us . No one wanted to learn drawing from that mercenary man . III . My brother Alexander was at that time at Moscow , in a corps of cadets , and we maintained a lively correspondence . As long as I was at home that would have been impossible , because our father considered it his prerogative to read all letters addressed to our house ; he would have soon put an end to any but a commonplace correspondence . Now we were free to discuss in our letters whatever we liked . The only difficulty was to get money for stamps ; but we soon learned to write in such fine characters that we could convey an incredible amount of matter in each letter . Alexander , whose handwriting was beautiful , contrived to get four printed pages on one single page of note paper , and his microscopic lines were as legible as the best small type print . It is a pity that these letters , which he kept as precious relics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their raids , robbed him even of these treasures . Our first letters were mostly about the petty things of my new surroundings , but our correspondence soon took a more serious chara*cter . My brother could not write about trifles . Even in society he became animated only when some sen // ous discussion was engaged in , and he complained of feeling " a dull pain in the brain " - a physical pain , as he used to say - when he was with people who cared only for small talk . He was very much in advance of me in his intellectual development , and all the time he urged me forward , raising new scientific and philosophical questions one after another , and advising me what to read or to study . What a happiness it was for me to have such a brother ! - a brother who , moreover , loved me passionately . To him I owe the best part of my development . Sometimes he would advise inc to read poetry , and would send me in his letters quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . " Read poetry , " he wrote : " poetry makes men better . How often , in my after life , I realized the truth of this remark of his ! " Read poetry : it makes men better . " He himself was a poet , and had a wonderful facility for writing most musical verses ; indeed , I think it a great pity that he abandoned poetry . The reaction against art , which arose among the Russian youth in the early sixties , and which Turgu6neff has depicted in Bazi*roff ( Fathers and Sons ) , induced him to look upon his verses with contempt , and to plunge headlong into the natural sciences . I must say , however , that my favorite poet was none of those whom his poetical gift , his musical ear , and his philosophical turn of mind made him like best . His favorite Russian poet was Yenevftinoff , while mine was Nekr*soff , whose verses were very often unmusical , but appealed most to my heart by their sympathy for " the downtrodden and offended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " he wrote me once . " Without an aim , without a purpose , life is not life . " And he advised me to get a purpose in my life worth living for . I was too young then to find one ; but something undetermined , vague , " good " altogether , already rose under that appeal , even though I could not say what that " good " would be . Our father gave us very little spending money , and I never had any to buy a single book ; but if Alexander got a few rubles from some aunt , he never spent a penny of it for pleasure , but bought a book and sent it to me . He objected , though , to indiscriminate reading . " One must have some question , " he wrote , " addressed to the book lie is going to read . " However , I did not then appreciate this remark , and can not think now without amazement of the number of books , often of a quite special character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the domain of history . I did not waste my time upon French novels , since Alexander , years before , had characterized them in one blunt sentence : " They are stupid and full of bad language . " The great questions concerning the conception we should form of the universe - our Welt anschauung , as the Germans say - were , of course , the dominant subjects in our correspondence . In our childhood we had never been religious . We were taken to church ; but in a Russian church , in a small parish or in a village , the solemn attitude of the people is far more impressive than the mass itself . Of all that I ever had heard in church only two things had impressed me : the twelve passages from the Gospels , relative to the sufferings of the Christ , which are read in Russia at the night service on the eve of Good Friday , and the short prayer condemning the spirit of domination , which is recited during the Great Lent , and is really beautiful by reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rendered it into Russian verse . Later on , at St. Petersburg , I went several times to aRoman Catholic church , but the theatrical character of the service and the absence of real feeling in it shocked me , the more so when I saw there with what simple faith some re* // tired Polish soldier or a peasant woman would pray in a remote corner . I also went to a Protestant church ; but coming out of it I caught myself murmuring Goethe 's words - " But you will never link hearts together Unless the linking springs from your own heart . " Alexander , in the meantime , had embraced with his usual passion the Lutheran faith . He had read Michelet 's book on Servetus , and had worked out for himself a religion on the lines of that great fighter . He studied with enthusiasmn the Augsburg declaration , which he copied out and sent me , and our letters now became full of discussions about grace , and of texts from the apostles Paul and James . I followed my brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had recovered from the typhoid fever I had taken to quite different reading . Our sister H6kne , who was now married , was at St. Petersburg , and every Saturday night I went to visit her . Her husband had a good library , in which the French philosophers of the last century and the modern French historians were well represented , and I plunged into them . Such books were prohibited in Russia , and evidently could not be taken to school ; so I spent most of the night , every Saturday , in reading the works of tim encyclop*edists , the philosophical dictionary of Voltaire , the writings of the Stoics , especially Marcus Aurelius , and so on . The infinite immensity of the universe , the greatness of nature , its poetry , its ever throbbing life , impressed me more and more ; and that never ceasing life and its harmonies gave me the ecstasy of admiration which the young soul thirsts for , while my favorite poets supplied me with an expression in words of that awakening love of mankind and faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impress man for all his life . Alexander , by this time , had gradually come to a Kantian agnosticism , and the " relativity of perceptions , " " perceptions in time and space , and time only , " and so on , filled pages and pages in our letters , the writing of which became more and more microscopical as the subjects under discussion grew in importance . But neither then nor later on , when we used to spend hours and hours in discussing Kant 's philosophy , could my brother convert me to become a disciple of the K*inigsberg philosopher . Natural sciences - that is , mathematics , physics , and astronomy - were my chief studies . In the year 1858 , before Darwin had brought out his immortal work , a professor of zotilogy at the Moscow University , Roulier , published three lectures on transformism , and my brother took up at once his ideas concerning the variability of species . He was not satisfied , however , with approxmmat&amp; proofs only , and began to study a number of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his letters the main facts , as well as his ideac and his doubts . The appearance of The Origin of Species did not settle his doubts on several special points , but only raised new questions and gave him the impulse for further studies . We afterward discussed - and that discussion lasted for many years - various questions relative to the origin of variations , their chances of being transmitted and being accentuated ; in short , those questions which have been raised quite lately in the Weismaun-Spencer controversy , in Galton 's researches , and in the works of the modern Neo-Lamarckians . Owing to his philosophical and critical mind , Alexander had noticed at once the fundamental importance of these questions for the theory of variability of species , even though they were so often overlooked then by many naturalists . I must also mention a temporary cxcursion into the domain of political economy . In the years 1858 and 1859 every // one in Russia spoke of political economy ; lectures on free trade and protective duties attracted crowds of people , and my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variability of species , took a lively though temporary interest in economical matters , sending me for reading the Political Economy of Jean Baptiste Say . I read a few chapters only : tariffs and banking operations did not interest me in the least ; but Alexander took up these matters so passkn. ately that he even wrote letters to our stepmother , trying to interest her in the intricacies of the customs duties . Later on , in Siberia , as we were re-reading some of the letters of that period , we laughed like children when we fell upon one of his epistles in which he coalplained of our stepmother 's incapacity to be moved even by such burning questions , and raged against a greengrocer whom he had caught in the street , and who , " would you believe it , " he wrote with signs of exclamation , " although he was a tradesman , affected a pig-headed indifference to tariff matters ! " Every summer about one half of the pages were taken to a military camp , with the other military schools , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from joining the camp , and I spent the first two summers at Nik6lskoye . To leave the school , to take the train to Moscow , and there to meet Alexander was such a happy prospect that I used to count the days that had to pass till that glorious one should arrive . But on one occasion a great disappointment awaited me at Moscow . Alexander had not passed his examinations , and was left for another year in the same form . He was , in fact , too young to enter the special classes ; but our father was very angry with him , nevertheless , and would not permit us to see each other . I felt very sad . We were not children any more , and had so much to say to each other . I tried to obtain permission to of a Revolutionist. 775 go to our aunt Sulima , at whose house I might meet Alexander , but it was absolutely refused . After our father remarried we were never allowed to see our mother 's relations . That spring our Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms were flooded with lights , the band played , the confectioner was busy making ices and pasti-y , and card-playing went on in the great hall till a late hour . I strolled aimlessly about in the brilliantly illuminated rooms , and felt unhappy . One night , after ten , a servant beckoned me , asking if I would come out to the entrance hail . I went . " Come to the coachmen 's house , " the old major . domo Frol whispered to me . " Alexander Alex6ievich is here . " I dashed across the yard , up the flight of steps leading to the coachmen 's house , and into a wide , half-dark room , where , at the immense dining-table of the servants , I saw Alexander . " S*sha , dear , how did you come ? " and in a moment we rushed into each other 's arms , hugging each other and unable to speak from emotion . " Hush , hush ! they may overhear you , " said the servants ' cook , Prask6-via , wiping away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your mother were only alive " - Old Frol stood , his head deeply bent , his eyes also twinkling . " Look here , P6tya , not a word to any one ; to no one , " he said , while Pmsk6via placed on the table an enrthenware jar full of porridge for Alexander . He , glowing with health , in his cadet uniform , already had begun to talk about all sorts of mattei-s , while he rapidly emptied the pormidge pot . I could hardly make him tell me how he came there at such a late hour . We lived then near the Smol6nsky boulevard , within a stone 's throw of the house where our mother died , and the corps of cadets // was at the opposite outskirts of Moscow , full five miles away . He had made a doll out of bedclothes , and had put it in his bed , under the blankets ; then he went to the tower , descended from a window , came out unnoticed , and walked the whole distance . " Were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your corps ? " I asked . " What had I to fear ? Only lots of dogs were upon me ; I had teased them myself . To - morrow I shall take my sword with me . " The coachmen and other servants came in and out ; they sighed as they looked at us , and took seats at a distance , along the walls , exchanging words in a subdued tone , so as not to disturb us ; while we two , in each other 's arms , sat there till midnight , talking about nebuhe and Laplace 's hypothesis , the structure of matter , the struggles of the papacy under Boniface VIII . with the imperial power , and so on . From time to time one of the servants would hurriedly run in , saying , " P&amp; tinka , go and show thyself in the hall ; they may ask for thee . " I implored S*sha not to come next night ; but he came , nevertheless , - not without having had a scrimmage with the dogs , against whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste , when , earlier than the day before , I was called once more to the coachmen 's house . Stfsha had made part of the journey in a cab . The previous night , one of the servants had brought him what he had got from the card-players and asked him to take it . S*sha took some small coin to hire a cab , and so he came earlier than on his first visit . He intended to come next night , too , but for some reason it would have been dangerous for the servants , and we decided to part till the autumn . A short " official " note made me understand next day that his nocturnal escapades had passed unnoticed . How terrible would have been the punishment , if they had been discovered ! It is awful to think of it : flogging before the corps till he was carried away unconscious on a sheet , and then dismissal to a soldiers ' sons ' battalion , - anything was possible , in those times . What our servants would have suffered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our father 's ears , would have been equally terrible ; but they knew how to keep secrets , and not to betray one another . They all knew of the visits of Alexander , but none of them whispered a word to any one of the family . They and I were the only ones in the house who ever knew anything about it.
