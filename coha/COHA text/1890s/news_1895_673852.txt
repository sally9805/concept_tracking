txt The United States is to be represented at the Kiel celebration , Tune 19 , by the finest American fleet that has visited European waters since the civil war , headed by the armored cruiser New-York as flagship , and the triplescrew flier Columbia , which will be detached . for this purpose from Admiral Meade 's fleet , with the addition of the San Francisco and Marblehead , now in the Levant . Admiral Kirkland , in charge of the European station , will command the squadron . The fleet will impress European nations with the progress accomplished in rebuilding the American Navy . The New-York has no superior for offensive and defensive purposes , combined with speed , and the Columbia excels all vessels except the Minneapolis in speed and staying power . There will be greater battle ships than those possessed by this country at the celebration , but their efficiency on the high seas is declared to be problematical . The Minneapolis will be fitted up at Norfolk as the flagship of Admiral Meade during the absence of the New-York in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attached to the order sending the New-York and Columbia to the North Sea and through the new canal into the Baltic , where the last American warship appeared on a mission of mercy , carrying corn for the starving peasants of Russia . Extremely unusual are the visits of American warships to German ports and the Scandinavian coast , and heretofore the Baltic has been practically a sealed sea to them . The detachment of these two effective vessels , the New-York and the Columbia , from the home squadron , is taken as an additional indication of the confidence of the Administration that the United States is in no danger of being involved in trouble over the affairs of American republics , and that the Cuban and Nicaraguan disturbances will be settled without our intervention , unless diplomatic only .
