txt While the High-ay Commissioners of Newtown and Flush-m ? were holding a joint meeting yesterday Cternoon to investigate the condition of trong 's Bridge , which spans Flushing reek , and which connects the southerly ortiorz of this village with the town of fewtown , the bridge suddenly collapsed , Joking further inquiry unnecessary . The Commissioners were having a disussion of the matter in Mayer 's Hotel , rhich stands at the Newtown end of the ridge . Suddenly they were startled by a rash and a sound like the breaking of imbers . A glance out of the window reealed a startling state of affairs . The long plank and timber approach on he Newtown side of the bridge had been ' arced up from underneath until it resemled a huge letter " A. " The heavy timers , each twelve inches by twelve inches , napped like toothpicks . Simultaneously rith the upheaval of the approach a , big trip of the causeway filling , extending as ar as the hotel shed , commenced to sink , . nd while the Commissioners were watch-rig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then slumped toward the reek . About the same time the filling beneath he hotel and the wide plank walk in ront of it began to sink , an ominous creakng sound from the timbers of the house Harmed the Commissioners , and they ' tithed for the door . The house had then ; ettled so that the door could not be mened , and another exit was tried , with ietter success . The excited men lost no ime in reaching a place of safety , and Mr. Vlanwaring , the proprietor of the hotel , iuickly followed suit . All expected to see ; he house fall down with a crash , but after few seconds the settling ceased . The wreck of the approach to the bridge gas complete . A peddler was crossing the bridge just as the approach began to setae . He did not realize his danger until the commissioners shouted to him . He whipped Lip his horse , and got across just in time . the draw of the bridge can not be opened , and the road is impassable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine feet in depth . The front of the hotel is a foot lower than the rear , and the foundation is entirely gone from under the barroom wing next the creek . TAMMANY 'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE Special Meeting Will Adopt a Vote of Confidence in Mr. Sheehan . A call for a special meeting of the Executive Committee of Tammany , to be held to-morrow night , will probably be issued to-day . The stated purpose of this meeting is to receive the report of the special sub-committee on the dinner given to Richard Croker , at the Hotel Savoy , last Saturday night . The sub-committee will make its report and will be discharged . The real business of the meeting will come up after this . It will have to do with the question asked at the dinner by ex-Register John Reilly as to who made ex-Police Comtnissioner John C. Sheehan leader of Tammany Hall . Mr. Sheehan 's friends insist that Mr. Reilly , by asking this question , has left a cloud on Mr. Sheehan 's title to the leadership . and that the Executive Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some sort of a vote of confidence will be adopted at the meting of the Executive Committee . Just what form the vote will take could not be learned last night . Mr. Sheehan absolutely declined to talk about the matter , saying that he did not know that anything , would be done at the meeting except to close up the accounts of the dinner . The trouble at present brewing in Tammany goes deeper than the scar that was exposed by Mr. Reilly 's interruption at the Savoy dinner . The fight is now really between John C. Sheehan and Henry D. Purroy , and upon these lines it must be fought out . County Clerk Purroy does not want Mr. Sheehan for leader . Mr. Sheehan knows this , and he must either conquer Mr. Purroy , or Mr. Purroy will conquer him . The speech that Mr. Purroy made at the last meeting of the Committee on Organization , and in which he said that Mr. Croker would , in his opinion , resume active and open affiliation with Tammany Hall , was the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this speech , Mr. Purroy clearly served notice on Mr. Sheehan that he would not follow his leadership , nor would he acknowledge it . Mr. Sheehan 's friends now want every member of the Executive Committee of Tammany Hall to sign awritten indorsement of Mr. Sheehan as Chairman of the Finance Committee , which is the place formerly occupied by Richard Croker . If all the leaders are ready to do this there will be no trouble at to-morrow night 's meeting . If they are not , then this meeting will be the liveliest held in Tammany Hall in the last dozen years . If the conflict between Messrs . Sheehan and Purroy breaks out in its full force at the meeting , and the test is made , Mr. Sheehan , with Richard Croker back of him , will win the fight . LORD DUNRAVEN HEARD FROM A Cable Message Received at the Neu -- York . Yacht Club Yesterday . A cablegram was received from Lord Dun-raven at the New-York Yacht Club yesterday . It will be read to the members of the club at the annual meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers of the club knows the contents of the cablegram , but it is understood that it merely notifies the club that a communication from Lord Dunraven is on its way . Whether this will delay any action that may be contemplated by the club on the investigating committee 's report remains to be seen . Some of the members think that Lord Dunraven has had ample time in which to reply to the report of the committee . He received a copy of that report at the same time that it was presented ' to the club , on the evening of Jan. 31 . The next mail from England closed the next day , Feb. 1 , and was delivered here last Monday . Lord Dun-raven hardly had time to consider what he would do and reply in time to catch that mail . The next mall left on Wednesday , Feb. 5 , and is not due here until to-day , on the steamer Germanic . It is possible that a letter is coming in this mail .
