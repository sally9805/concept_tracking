Main text I MR . AND MRS . EDWARD ROBERTS MRS . ROBERTS , MRS . ROBERTS , looking in upon her husband from the door of the library in their apartment at Hotel Beltingham : " Well , you 've got rid of him , Edward . " Roberts : Roberts : " Yes , at last , thank Heaven ! " He continues writing at his table , without looking up , as he answers his wife . " But I thought he never would go , at one time . He is n't a bad kind of fellow , for an Englishman , and if I had n't been so busy with this paper . I should n't have minded his staying . Of course he was nationally English , but personally he was rather nice . Still it was a terrible interruption , just at this moment . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Why did n't you hint to him , somehow , to go away ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Well , I could n't do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very amiable . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Oh , his being amiable is no excuse . You 're amiable yourself , Edward  --  too amiable , if anything . I do n't call it amiable to take up almost a full hour of your precious time . I should think any one who came in and saw how busy you were , now , would go away if he had a heart of stone . No , I ca n't believe he was truly amiable ; and I must really do something to protect you from these constant interruptions . How do you think I 'd better do it ? " Roberts , Roberts , writing : " Do what ? " Mrs. Roberts , Mrs. Roberts , sinking into a chair , and folding her hands in her lap : " Protect you from these interruptions . " Roberts , Roberts , writing : " Protect who ? " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " You , Edward . My heart bleeds for you , to see you so driven with your work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to you . I must stop it . " Roberts , Roberts , writing : " Oh yes . Stop what ? " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " These perfectly killing interruptions . I should think you would go crazy . " Roberts , Roberts , writing : " Who ? " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Why you , you poor thing . I think it 's worse than cruelty to animals . " Roberts , Roberts , writing : " Worse than cruelty to animals . Worse  --  Why , what nonsense is this you 've made me write , Agnes ? " He looks up at her in a daze . " What do you want , Agnes ? And do state it succinctly , my dear ! " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Why , I did n't know but you 'd asked him to stay to lunch . " Roberts , Roberts , writing again : " No ; I did n't really feel that I could give the time . I should have liked to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the least he could have expected . " He continues writing . " But I 've done the next best thing . I 've given him a letter of introduction to Uncle Philip , and he will glut him with all kinds of hospitality when he gets to New York . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Yes . " After a moment . " Do you think it was quite right , Edward ? " Roberts , Roberts , looking up : " Right ? What right ? " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " To put him off on your uncle , if you did n't like him yourself ? " Roberts : Roberts : " But I did like him . I liked him as well as it 's possible to like any Englishman on short notice . You have to know an Englishman several days before you 're sure you like him ; but this one was really very pleasant , and I told Uncle Philip he would probably find him so , unless I was greatly deceived . But now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Surely , Edward , you did n't put that into a letter of introduction ? " Roberts , Roberts , laughing : " That I would have to leave open for him to read ? Well , I 'm not quite so bad as that , Agnes . I wrote a letter to Uncle Philip , to go through the post , and I told him that as soon as he got through the crust of a rather insular manner , and a most unaccountable enthusiasm for Americans , I 'd no doubt he 'd find my Englishman charming . You could n't suppose I 'd put all that in a letter of introduction ? " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Of course not . But you know you are so absent-minded , my dear , and I could n't help being a little afraid  --  " Roberts : Roberts : " Your fears come too late , my dear . The Englishman is gone , and both the letters with him . Now you must let me finish this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in amazement : " Both the letters with him ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Yes ; I knew he would pass the letter-box on the corner , and I asked him to drop Uncle Philip 's letter in it . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Was n't that rather peculiar , Edward ? " Roberts , Roberts , with vexation : " Peculiar ? No ! What was peculiar about it ? " The Voices , The Voices , in the anteroom , without , of Mr. and Mrs. Willis Campbell :  --  He : He : " In the library ? Well , we 'll just push right in on them . " She : She : " And Mrs. Roberts is there too ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Oh , good heavens ! Go out , Agnes , and stop them ! Take them into the parlor a moment , do , till I get this  --  " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " You know I ca n't do that , Edward ! " To Mrs. Campbell , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm so glad to see you . " The ladies kiss , and Campbell follows his wife in . II MR . AND MRS . CAMPBELL ; THE ROBERTSES Campbell : Campbell : " And so is Roberts ; but he does n't look it . Hope I do n't interrupt you , Roberts , as people say when they know they do . " Roberts , Roberts , who has pushed away his writing , and risen to greet the intruders with forced gayety : " How do you do , Amy ? No ; I was just getting to the end of my morning 's work , Willis . " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , it 'll do you good to break off before you reach the very tip , then . Keep you from having that tired feeling , you know . What you need is a little dynamite to blast you out of your chair , here , every morning at half past twelve . If you keep on writing close up to lunch , you 'll spoil your digestion . " Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . I 've had an Englishman here for the last hour , and I feel as if I could digest almost anything . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Why , it must have been your Englishman , then , whom we met at the corner , as we came here ! There , Willis ! I told you it was an Englishman ! " Campbell : Campbell : " I could n't believe it : he was so confoundedly agreeable , and he had so much of that English brogue , when he spoke , that I thought he must be a New Yorker . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Why , how came he to talk with you ? " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , he was hanging round a telegraph pole , trying to post a letter in the fire-alarm box . He said he 'd been asked to post it by a gentleman who had told him there was a letter-box at the first corner , and the fire-alarm looked like it . I had to take him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green box on the lamp post . He did n't seem to like the way it opened its mouth at the top like a dying frog , but he risked his letter in it , anyway . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " There , Edward ! " Campbell : Campbell : " Hello ! Where does Roberts come in ? " Mrs. Roberts maintains a reproachful silence , and Campbell turns to Roberts : " Look here , Roberts , what have you been doing ? It was n't you who gave that poor young Englishman that letter to post ? " Roberts , Roberts , trying to put a bold face upon it : " Nonsense ! Certainly I did . I had given him a letter of introduction to Uncle Philip  --  he thinks he may go on to New York to-night , by the boat  --  and I asked him to post the letter I wrote to advise Uncle Philip of his coming . That 's all . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Of course it was all right . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Campbell : Campbell : " Did you make your uncle the usual little confidences about the introducee , in your letter of advice ? " Roberts : Roberts : " I told him I knew he would like him after he had got through his insular manner . " Campbell : Campbell : " And then you got him to post the letter ! Well , it was something like seething the kid in its mother 's milk , Agnes . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " What a disgusting idea ! Mr. Roberts , do n't mind him ! He is n't worth it . His one idea is to tease . " Roberts : Roberts : " I see what you mean , Campbell . But of course he could n't know what was in it , and it seemed very simple and natural to get him to drop it in the box . " Campbell : Campbell : " It was simple , and it was very natural . A less absent-minded man 's wife might have told him it was n't exactly delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in it . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " And in you it would have been indelicate ; but with Mr. Roberts it 's a very different thing . " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh yes ; I know ! Absent-mindedness . Well , Roberts , you 'll get yourself into an awful mess with your absent-mindedness some day . How do you know he did n't know what was in the letter to your uncle ? " Roberts , Roberts , with some scorn : " Why , simply because I sealed it before I gave it to him . " Campbell : Campbell : " And did you seal the letter of introduction ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Of course not ! " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , you did n't ! Then how do you know that you did n't seal up the letter of introduction , and give him the letter of advice to carry with him ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Because I know I did n't . " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you swear you did n't ? Suppose you were on the witness stand ! " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " No , do n't suppose it , Mr. Roberts . Do n't suppose anything of the kind . " Campbell , Campbell , without regarding her : " This sort of thing is done every day . People are always getting letters mixed , and shuffling them into the wrong envelopes . Amy did something of the kind herself down at the Shore , last summer and nearly broke off the engagement between young Welling and Miss Greenway . And if she had n't been the most sensible kind of a girl , Amy would have done it , too . And as it was , I had to do some of the tallest lying this side of the Pacific slope . Perfect sequoias  --  made our place , down there , look like the Yosemite Park , when those fables began to tower up . " Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , faltering : " It 's true , Agnes . I told you about it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I know . But that does n't prove that Edward  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , does n't it ! If Amy , who has her few wits always about her , could do such a thing , it stands to reason that Roberts , whose multitudinous mind is always off somewhere else when it 's wanted , would do it nine times out of ten . Think how absent-minded he is ! Remember how he got aboard the sleeping-car that night , and went prying round in all the berths to find you ? " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Do n't be offensive , Willis ! " Campbell : Campbell : " I 'm simply veracious ! And then think how he left his watch in his room , and thought poor old Bemis was a garroter that had taken it from him , and ran after him on the Common , and grabbed Bemis 's watch from him , and nearly killed him . And then his going to meet a cook that he 'd never seen at the Albany depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " That was my fault , Willis . I sent him ; and I ought to have remembered that he 'd never seen the cook . " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh ! And what ought Roberts to have remembered ? I tell you , he 's put that Englishman 's letter of introduction into the sealed envelope , and the letter of advice into the open one , beyond the shadow of a doubt . " Roberts , Roberts , with rising alarm : " Oh , pshaw ! You know you do n't think so , Willis . " Campbell : Campbell : " Think so ? I know it ! Where was he sitting ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Where you are now . " Campbell : Campbell : " In this chair ? When you wrote the letters , which did you finish first ? " Roberts : Roberts : " The letter of introduction , I think . " Campbell : Campbell : " You think ! He ca n't even remember that ! Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts : Roberts : " No , I ca n't ; but it must have been the letter of introduc  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " Did you put both letters in their envelopes before you gave them to him , or did you hand him first one and then the other ? " Roberts : Roberts : " I 'm sure I ca n't say ! But my impression is  --  " Campbell , Campbell , waving his conjecture scornfully aside : " Agnes , you see how thoroughly mixed up he is . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Yes , and you 've mixed him up . I declare  --  " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Yes , Willis . " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , very well , then ! If I 've mixed him up , I 'll let him unmix himself . Then he ca n't complain . If he did n't blunder with the letters , I suppose my merely asking him wo n't create the fact . I did n't make him do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it . " Campbell : Campbell : " He ought to know . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " And you do know , do n't you , Edward ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Why , of course . But anything 's possible . And now that Willis has suggested it , why , I ca n't take my oath  --  " Campbell , Campbell , to the ladies : " You see ! " Roberts : Roberts : " What  --  what can I do , Willis ? The mere supposition of such a thing  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , I do n't know . Go after the Englishman , I suppose , and try to run him down before he reads your letter of advice . " He bursts into a loud , unfeeling laugh , while Roberts begins to walk the floor in agitation . " Can you recall any of the expressions you used ? Perhaps they were n't so bad . " Roberts , Roberts , pausing and rubbing his forehead : " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insular manner ; that he was necessarily offensive as an Englishman ; but that he seemed to have a great many good qualities , and was quite American in some of his feelings and ideas , and had an enthusiasm for us worthy of a better cause . I said I had only met him once , but I had no doubt he would prove worthy of any kindness that was shown him . " Campbell : Campbell : " Patronizing and insulting to the last degree ! Well , you 've done it , Roberts ! " Roberts : Roberts : " I know  --  I see ! But I did n't mean to be offensive . The fact is , I wrote very hastily ; I wanted to get rid of him ; my mind was half on my article , here  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " And it was in the same divided condition when you put the letters into their envelopes ! What could you expect ? " Roberts : Roberts : " Look here , Willis ! Could n't you  --  " Campbell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing that I can interfere in . If it were a case for ground-and-lofty lying , you might call me in ; but where it 's principally tact that 's needed , I 'd better leave it to you , my dear fellow . " He claps Roberts on the shoulder , and breaks down in another laugh . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Now look here , Willis ! This is perfectly outrageous . You have n't the slightest proof in the world that Mr. Roberts has mixed the letters , and it 's just your wicked teasing that makes you say he has . If you have any feeling at all , you will stop . I think it 's gone beyond a joke . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " And I do , too , Amy . Of course I think Edward was wrong to send the man to his uncle just to get rid of him ; but that 's no reason Willis should torment him so . " Roberts : Roberts : " No , no ! There 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens ! What shall I do about it ? " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , if I might venture a little suggestion without being denounced as a heartless reprobate  --  " Roberts : Roberts : " I have n't denounced you , Willis ! " Campbell : Campbell : " My wife and sister have in your interest , and just when I had thought how to help you out . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Oh , how , Willis ? " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Tell it , instantly , Willis ! " Campbell : Campbell : " You 'd better look him up at his hotel , and pretend you thought you gave the wrong address on the letter to your uncle . " Roberts : Roberts : " That 's all very well , but I do n't know where he 's stopping . " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , that does rather cut the ground from under us . " A ring at the door is heard . " Ah , there he is now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's read that letter of advice , and he wants to know what it means . We must go , Roberts . I 'm sorry to leave you in this fix , but  --  " III BELLA ; THE CAMBELLS ; THE ROBERTSES Bella , Bella , the maid , coming in with a card for Roberts : " The elevator boy brought it up . The gentleman is waiting below , sir . " Roberts , Roberts , glancing at the card : " Merciful powers ! Willis is right ! It is the man himself ! " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Oh , Edward , what do you suppose he wants ? But do n't be alarmed , dearest ! I do n't agree with Willis in his pessimistic views . I know you can easily explain it . " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , can he ? Well , I think I 'll just wait , then , and hear his explanation . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Willis ! You must advise him what to do . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you ! I do n't deny that I 'm pretty ingenious , and all that ; but what you want here is the invention of a Thomas A. Edison . Nothing short of it will ever get Roberts out of this scrape . " Roberts , Roberts , trying to pluck up courage : " But I deny that there is any scrape . The whole affair is purely hypothetical . There 's nothing in the world to prove that I 've mixed up the letters , and I deny that I did . The man has simply come back because he 's forgotten something , or wishes to make some little inquiry , or  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " Then why do n't you have him up at once , instead of letting him cool his heels down there in your front hall ? Have him up ! It 's uncivil to keep him waiting . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " No , no . " To the maid : " Stop , Bella ! No , Willis ; we must provide for contingencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he did n't mix the letters up ; but ought n't we to guard against any chances , Willis ? " Campbell : Campbell : " I should say you ought . And you 'd better ring for a policeman to do it . He 's an awfully athletic-looking fellow . Those Englishmen often are . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Then , Bella , you must tell the boy to say that Mr. Roberts has just gone out ; and that Mrs. Roberts is very sorry  --  " Roberts : Roberts : " No , Agnes , that wo n't do , my dear . I ca n't allow that . If I 've done this thing , I must face the consequences . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Yes , that 's what I say . We must provide for contingencies . " Campbell : Campbell : " He may want to fight you , Roberts , like McIlheny , you know , when you asked his wife whether she was a cook . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Of course . If he 's very  --  boisterous , you must n't have anything to say to him ; but if he 's pleasant , or if he 's merely cold , or hurt , in his manner , why , I suppose you must ask him to lunch . And Willis and Amy can stay , and help make it go off . " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , thank you , Agnes ! The Roberts family seems to have a gift for patronizing offensiveness ; I do n't mind it myself , but if I was an Englishman that Roberts had told to his face that he was nationally detestable  --  " Roberts : Roberts : " Told to his face ? " Campbell : Campbell : " It 's the same thing  --  it would take a good deal more than lunch to pacify me . I should want dinner , and not merely a family dinner , a snap-shot , accidental thing , but a regular formal affair , with the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The least you can do , Roberts , is to send for this Englishman 's baggage , and make him stay a fortnight with you . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " I had thought of that , Willis . " Campbell : Campbell : " You said  --  lunch . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " But our flat is so small , and the children are in the guest-chamber  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " And in the mean time , the Englishman is waiting below in the select society of the janitor . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Oh , my goodness , I forgot all about him ! " Roberts : Roberts : " Yes . We must have him up at once , and then act accordingly . " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh yes ; you must n't give yourself away . If you do n't happen to have mixed the letters up , you do n't want to begin apologizing . You will have to judge from his manner . " Roberts : Roberts : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic about us , I 'm afraid we ca n't tell from his manner . " Campbell : Campbell : " You must draw him out , specifically . Did you ask him how he liked America ? " Roberts : Roberts : " No ; I was ashamed to ask him when he told me he had just arrived this morning . " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , then , Amy can ask him . She is n't ashamed to ask anything . And if he begins to abuse us , up hill and down dale  --  " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " He had better not abuse us ! I should n't allow it . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Oh yes , Amy ; bear anything ! We must try to pacify him somehow . " Campbell : Campbell : " And Roberts had better go out , and meet him in that anteroom of yours  --  it 's as dark as a pocket  --  and make him take off his overcoat  --  he must n't allow any refusal  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've received him at the door here , and search his overcoat pockets . Very probably he 's put the letter into one of them . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Do you think that would be very nice , Willis ? " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , I do n't know : about as nice as having Amy truckle to his abuse of the country . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " It is n't at all the same thing . " Campbell : Campbell : " It 's exactly the same thing . " A ring at the door summons Bella away . " He 's getting impatient . Well , I should n't like to be kept waiting so long myself . " Bella , Bella , returning : " It 's the gentleman below , ma'am . The boy says he 'd like to know if you got his card . " Campbell : Campbell : " I thought so . You must let him come up , or you must send word that you 're not at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " No , Agnes , you ca n't , really ! " Roberts : Roberts : " We must decide , my dear ! " Mrs. Roberts , Mrs. Roberts , desperately : " Well , then , tell the janitor to send him up , Bella ! " As Bella goes : " And we have n't thought at all how we shall act ! " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , I know one thing : if Roberts lets his knees knock together , so as to be heard , I wo n't stand it . I 'll leave the house . It 'll be too disgraceful . Courage , Roberts ! I would n't miss seeing how you 'll carry this thing off for any money ! I know you 're a perfect moral hero on all ordinary occasions , but in a predicament like this I do n't envy you . And the worst of it is , that if the fellow 's a gentleman  --  and he looked like one , in the English way  --  you wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have to grope your way in the dark , and  --  There he is ! " A ring is heard . " Now let 's all look unconcerned , as if we were not expecting any one . Amy , you be turning over those photographic views of the White Mountains , in your pretty , careless way . Agnes , you be examining some object with the microscope . Here , Roberts , you sit down to your writing again . And I 'll be tuning up the family phonograph . That 'll give him an idea of a cultivated Boston family , at home with itself , and at peace with the whole human family . And we must all be extremely deferential and  --  complimentary  --  so 's to take the bad taste of Roberts 's letter out of his mouth . " Campbell delivers these instructions in a rapid whisper . As Bella opens the door to admit the stranger to the anteroom , he continues in a loud , didactic voice : " As you very justly observed , in our present uncertainty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are marine canals , or merely magic-lantern displays of the Martians to attract the attention of the telescope man on Boston Common  --  " Bella , Bella , announcing the Englishman at the library door : " Mr. Westgate . " IV MR . WESTGATE ; THE CAMPBELLS ; THE ROBERTSES Westgate , Westgate , to Roberts : " Ah , I beg your pardon ! It 's really very ridiculous , and I 'm quite ashamed to trouble you again , Mr. Roberts . Your letter  --  " Roberts , Roberts , coming eagerly forward : " Oh , I 'm so glad to see you again , Mr. Westgate . You 're just in time for lunch ; and I hope you can sit down with us . Mrs. Roberts , Mr. Westgate . My wife had n't the pleasure of  --  ah  --  meeting you before , I think . Let me take your overcoat . You 'll find it very hot in our American houses , I 'm afraid . " Westgate : Westgate : " Oh , not at all ! I 'm sure I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your furnaces ! But I only came back a moment to show you a little mistake  --  if it is a mistake  --  " Mrs. Roberts , Mrs. Roberts , eagerly : " I 'm so sorry we 've only steam heat , and ca n't show you a furnace ; but you 'll find it quite hot ; and you must take off your coat . " Westgate : Westgate : " Why , you 're very good , I 'm sure . But only for a moment . " Roberts : Roberts : " Allow me ! " He possesses himself of Westgate 's hat and coat , and rushes out into the anteroom with them . Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Let me introduce you to my sister , Mrs. Campbell ; and my brother , Mr. Campbell , Mr. Westgate . " Westgate bows to the lady , and then shakes hands with Campbell . Westgate : Westgate : " Ah ! how do you do ? I 'd no idea  --  I 'm very glad to meet you , I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter Mr. Roberts intrusted to me  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , that was nothing . I saw that you were on the point of doing something desperate , and I just stepped in . There 's nothing I like better than saving human life ; and as I 've often tried to post my wife 's letters in the fire-alarm box , at two o'clock in the morning , and never succeeded yet , I had a fellow-feeling for you . " Westgate : Westgate : " H 'm ! Yes ! You see your post-boxes are so very different to ours  --  " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , your London post-boxes are simply delightful ! They 're just like posts  --  fat ones ; and they take in whole packages . But  --  I hope you like America , Mr. Westgate ! " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " Yes , we are always so glad when your countrymen  --  " Campbell : Campbell : " We aim to please .

I 've never seen it more overcast at home . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " That is true . It 's going to snow , I think . I 'm afraid you wo n't like our snow ! " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , perhaps , we might have some with the chill off . " Westgate , Westgate , regarding him fixedly for a moment : " Ow ! Ah ! I see ! Very good ! Ah , ha , ha , ha ! Ha , ha , ha ! And  --  ha , ha , ha ! Ah , ha , ha !  --  you meant , coming home from the club ! I had n't understood your American humor , at first . I fancy there 's no hope of any good Samaritan to show you to the post-box at two o'clock in the morning hour ! Ah , ha , ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been scolding my husband for troubling you with that letter , Mr. Westgate ! " Westgate : Westgate : " No , really ? But I always heard the American ladies were so amiable , you know . " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , we are , Mr. Westgate ! But we have to maintain discipline in the family , you know . " Westgate : Westgate : " Of course . But "  --  to Campbell  --  " what did you mean exactly , by having snow with the chill off ? Such a delightful expression . " Campbell : Campbell : " Well , I do n't know . Some sort of joke , I suppose . " Westgate : Westgate : " I was sure you did ! Ah , ha , ha ! Your countrymen are so delightfully humorous  --  so funny , you know . You know we think you 're such fun . " Campbell : Campbell : " Do you think so ? I do n't think we 're half so funny as Englishmen . " Mrs. Campbell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny as we are , Mr. Westgate . " Westgate : Westgate : " Ow , but really , now ! " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " I do n't know how we should have done without your Mr. Gilbert . " Westgate : Westgate : " But is n't he rather exaggerated ? I much prefer your Joshua Billings . And your after-dinner speakers ! Mr. Depew , for instance ! " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " But the Prince of Wales , you know . " Westgate : Westgate : " Ow ! Do you regard him as a humorist ? He says some neat things , occasionally . But your California humor , now : we 've nothing like that , you know ! " Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " I 'm afraid you will make my husband intolerably conceited . " Westgate : Westgate : " Really ? Is Mr.  --  ah  --  Campbell a Californian ? How very delightful ! And is that peculiar dialect used by your California writers spoken in the cities ? I should so much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite get the right accent in reading it . " Campbell : Campbell : " You 'd hear it everywhere in California . I 'm a little out of practice now , myself ; I speak Bostonese , at present ; but I recollect very well how the ladies in San Francisco used to say , ' Well , I got the dead wood onto you , that time , ' and ' How 're you makin ' it , pard ? ' and ' You bet , ' and ' You git ! ' You mean that sort of thing ? " Westgate : Westgate : " Exactly . How delightful ! So very picturesque , you know . So imaginative ! " Campbell : Campbell : " Yes , I suppose there 's more imagination to the acre in California than you 'll find anywhere else in the United States .

There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a shrinking , deprecatory little misgiving as to the existence of the outside universe , I think Mr. Westgate will find that Boston takes the cake . In California people do n't know they 're modest , but in Boston they do . That 's the difference . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " I hope Mr. Westgate will stay with us long enough to find out that everything you say is a wicked slander , Willis . Why must you rush off to New York at once , Mr. Westgate ? " Westgate : Westgate : " You 're very good , I 'm sure . But I 'm afraid  --  Ha , ha , ha ! Ha , ha , ha ! " To Campbell : " That was a very amusing expression of yours ! Imagination to the acre ! As if it were some kind of crop ! Very good ! Capital ! Ah , ha , ha ! And would you be kind enough to explain that expression , ' take the cake ? ' " Campbell : Campbell : " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Westgate : Westgate : " Ow ! " Campbell : Campbell : " Yes .

Do n't stop him ! It 's quite what I came to America for  --  those delightful expressions ! I do n't know why you 're all so shy of using them when you come over ! We get them in print , but we seldom hear them . " Campbell : Campbell : " You should go to a ladies ' lunch here ! You would n't hear anything else . " Westgate : Westgate : " Ow ! And just what is a ladies ' lunch ? " Campbell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . The race is running to girls so , in Massachusetts , that they 've got to having these lunches without asking men , so as to see how it will feel when there are no men to ask . Often it 's merely a hen feed , where they would like to have men it they could get them ; just as a stag dinner is a good time that women would like to come to if they could . Sometimes it 's a virtue , sometimes it 's a necessity . But it 's always a joke . " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " You must n't believe him , Mr. Westgate .

We think you 're such jokers . But really , you know , I think that some people who do that kind of thing , you know , and have Americans a great deal , do n't see the point of their jokes at all times ; or not at once .

" Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : " But we much prefer English pictures , Mr. Westgate . You have so much more technique than the French , so much more school . I adore Tadema , myself . " Westgate : Westgate : " But  --  yes  --  ah  --  I think he 's Dutch , though ?

Roberts : Roberts : " Is he gone ? " Mrs. Roberts : Mrs. Roberts : " ' Sh ! No . He 's in the parlor , with Amy . She 's showing him the pictures .

" Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , without : " Well , no . But we 've a very large school of non-resident Boston artists . Our painters all have to go to New York to get a living .

You and Uncle Phil have kept it up long enough . And I think you owe Mr. Westgate an apology . The joke 's on Uncle Phil , of course ; but you ought to see that it 's rather embarrassing to Mr. Westgate to find himself the bearer of an empty envelope instead of a letter of introduction . Come , now , you must explain ; and we 'll all apologize for you . " Roberts waits with a foolish face of deprecation , turning to horror , at the suggestion of an explanation . " Come !

And these things are so tiresome , you know , when they happen to fall flat . I hope you wo n't think me importunate if I say I should like to know just where the laugh comes in on a thing of that kind ? " Campbell : Campbell : " Out with it , Roberts !
