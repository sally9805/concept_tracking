Miller , Joaquin , 1837-1913 : Stay Hand , Gold Tories ! from Joaquin Miller 's Latest and Best ( 1896 ) My country , has it come to pass That British greed and British gold Have won where sword and blazing brass Won not in daring days of old ? Dare Wall-street Arnolds walk abroad Where stands old Wall-street 's Washington , And taunt us ? In the name of God , What have we done ? What have we done ? What have we done but toil and bleed And battle down the border lands And widen worlds for Wall-street greed With dauntless hearts and horny hands ? I think the time has come to say , Stay hand , you Tories , Arnolds , stay . Stay hand , stay tongue , stay brazen throat ; And if brave Britain is more dear To Tories there than Patriots here , Why , Tories , Traitors , take the boat ! Who made this land ? Who hewed the way From Alleghany 's stony steeps To where Sierra 's pine-tops play , And plunge to Balboa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew Such daring as shall never die ; Such daring as the dauntless few Who smote your British hip and thigh . While you , you sat and gathered gold Or passed your cunning years abroad , And , taunting , sneering , bought and sold The very blood that drenched our sod . My God ! And now what more would you , Thrice Judas , Arnold , nomad Jew ? Your hands from off the Nation 's throat , And we will raise God songs of praise And gratitude for fairer days , Nor miss you in a single note . You have your gold . Be satisfied , And tempt not fate too far to-day . Take up your gold . The world is wide ; But we are here , and here to stay . You want our silver ? Want our lands ? Want British law and British spoil , While we in chains , bound feet and hands , Toil on and on as peasants toil ? This land is Freedom 's land for aye ! Free land ! Free silver ! And FREE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Free men have died , and may again ! An if , by chance , your gold has won , Beware ! The war has but begun : The war of ballots for the grace To coin our moneys , keep our laws , To clip old England 's reaching paws , And laugh her lion in the face . El Dorado , Cal. , October 24 , 1896.
