DAYS WITH MRS . STOWE . FLORENCE , the city of charms and flowers , was the spot where I first met Mrs. Stowe . She was delighting herself in the fascinations of that lovely place . Not alone every day , but every second as it passed , was full of eager interest to her . She could say with Thoreau , " I moments live who lived but years . " We had both been invited to a large reception , one evening , in one of the old palaces on the Arno . There were music and dancing , and there were lively groups of ladies and gentlemen strolling from room to room , contrasting somewhat strangely in their gayety with the solemn pictures hanging as the walls , and a sense of shadowy presence which seems to baunt those dusky interiors . A certain discrepancy between the modern company and the surroundings , a weird mingling of the past and the present , made any apparition appear possible , and left room only for a faint thrill of surprise when a voice by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a moment she approached and I was presented to her , and after a brief pause she passed on . All this was natural enough , but a wave of intense disappointment swept over me . Why had I found no words to express or even indicate the feeling that had choked me ? Was the fault mine ? Oh yes , I said to myself , for I could not conceive it to be otherwise , and I looked upon my opportunity , the gift of the gods , as utterly and forever wasted . I was depressed and sorrowing over the vanishing of a presence I might perhaps never meet again , and no glamour of light , or music , or pictures , or friendly voices could recall any pleasure to my heart . Meanwhile , the unconscious object of all this disturbance was strolling quietly along , leaning on the arm of a friend , hardly ever speaking , followed by a group of traveling-companions , and entirely absorbed in the gay scene around her . She was a small woman , and her pretty curling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming occupied in what interested her until she forgot everything else for the time , all these I first began to see and understand as I gazed after her retreating figure . Mrs. Stowe 's personal appearance has received scant justice and no mercy at the hand of the photographer . She says herself , during her triumphal visit to England after the publication of Uncle Tom : " The general topic of remark on meeting me seems to be that I am not so bad looking as they were afraid I was ; and I do assure you , when I have seen the things that are put up in the shop windows here with my name under them , I have been lost in wondering imagination at the boundless loving-kindness of my English and Scottish friends in keeping up such a warm heart for such a Gorgon . I should think that the Sphinx in the London Museum might have sat for most of them . I am going to make a collection of these portraits to bring home to you . There is a great variety of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's guide-board which showed ' where // the road did not go . ' " I remember once accompanying her to a reception at a well-known house in Boston , where , before the evening was over , the hostess drew me aside , saying , " Why did you never tell me that Mrs. Stowe was beautiful ? " And indeed , when I observed her in the full ardor of conversation , with her heightened color , her eyes shining and awake , but filled with great softness , her abundant curling hair rippling naturally about her head and falling a little at the sides ( as in the portrait by Richmond ) , I quite agreed with the lady of the house . Nor was that the first time her beauty bad been revealed to me , but she was seldom seen to be beautiful by the great world , and the pleasure of this recognition was very great to those who loved her . She was never afflicted with a personal consciousness of her reputation , nor was she trammeled by it . The sense that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more humble , and her shy , absent-minded ways were continually throwing her admirers into confusion . Late in life ( when her failing powers made it impossible for her to speak as one living in a world which she seemed to have left far behind ) she was accosted , I was told , in the garden of her country retreat , in the twilight one evening , by a good old retired sea-captain who was her neighbor for the time . " When I was younger , " said he respectfully , holding his hat in his hand while he spoke , " Tread with a great deal of satisfaction and instruction Uncle Tom 's Cabin . The story impressed me very much , and I am happy to shake hands with you , Mrs. Stowe , who wrote it . " " I did not write it , " answered the white-haired old lady gently , as she shook the captain 's hand . " You did n't ? " he ejaculated in amazement . " Why , who did , then ? " " God wrote it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictation . " " Amen , " said the captain reverently , as he walked thoughtfully away . This was the expression in age of what lay at the foundation of her life . She always spoke and behaved as if she recognized herself to be an instrument breathed upon by the Divine Spirit . When we consider how this idea absorbed her to the prejudice of what appeared to others a wholesome exercise of human will and judgment , it is not wonderful that the world was offended when she once made conclusions contrary to the opinion of the public , and thought best to publish them . Mrs. Stowe was a delightful talker . She loved to gather a small circle of friends around a fireside , when she easily took the lead in fun and story-telling . This was her own ground , and upon it she was not to be outdone . " Let me put my feet upon the fender , " she would say , " and I can talk till all is blue . " It was my good fortune to be in Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to face with an exhibition of the general feeling of reverence and gratitude towards herself . We had gone together to the rooms of the brothers Castellani , the world-famous workers in gold . The collection of antique gems and the beautiful reproductions of them were new to us . Mrs. Stowe was full of enthusiasm , and we lingered long over the wonderful things which the brothers brought forward to show . Among them was the head of an Egyptian slave carved in black onyx . It was an admirable work of art , and while we were enjoying it one of them said to Mrs. Stowe , " Madam , we know what you have been to the poor slave . We are ourselves but poor slaves still in Italy : you feel for us ; will you keep this gem as a slight recognition of what you have done ? " She took the jewel in silence , but when we looked for some response , her eyes were filled with tears and it was impossible for her to speak . When the hours of her European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for returning home in the steamer // with those who had become dear to her , and in one of her notes of that period she wrote to me : " On the strength of having heard that you were going home in the Europa June 16 , we also have engaged passage therein for that time , and hope that we shall not be disappointed . . . It must be true ; we ca n't have it otherwise . . . . Our southern Italy trip was a glory - it was a rose - it was a nightingale - all , in short , that one ever dreams ; but alas ! it is over . " It was a delightful voyage in every sense ; and at that period a voyage was no little matter of six days , but a good fourteen days of sitting together on deck in pleasant snmmer weather , and having time enough and to spare . Hawthorne and his family also concluded to join the party . Mrs. Hawthorne , who was always the romancer in conversation , filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we looked upon her as a second Scheherazade , and the day the head was to be cut off was the day we should come to shore . " Oh , " said Hawthorne , " I wish we might never get there . " But the good ship moved steadily as fate . Meanwhile , Mrs. Stowe often took her turn at entertaining the little group . She was seldom tired of relating stories of New England life and her early experiences . When the ship came to shore , Mrs. Stowe and her daughters went at once to Andover , where Professor Stowe had remained at his post during their long absence in Europe . She went also with equal directness to her writing-desk , and though there are seldom any dates upon her letters , the following note must have been written shortly after her return : - " My DEAR Mm FIELDs , - Agnes of Sorrento was conceived on the spot , - a spontaneous tribute to the exceeding loveliness and beauty of all things there . " One bright evening , as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl sitting in its shadow selling oranges . She was my Agnes . Walking that same evening through the sombre depths of the gorge , I met Old Elsie , ' walking erect and tall , with her piercing black eyes , Roman nose , and silver hair , - walking with determination in every step , and spinning like one of the Fates glittering silver flax from a distaff she carried in her hands . " A few days after , our party being weather-bound at Salerno had resort to all our talents to pass the time , and songs and stories were the fashion of the day . The first chapter was my contribution to that entertainment . The story was voted into existence by the voices of all that party , and by none more enthusiastically than by one young voice which will never be heard on earth more . It was kept in mind and expanded and narrated as we went on to Rome over a track that the pilgrim Agnes is to travel . To me , therefore , it is fragrant with love of Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wanted to write something of this kind as an author 's introduction to the public . Could you contrive to print it on a fly-leaf , if I get it ready , and put a little sort of dedicatory poem at the end of it ? I shall do this at least in the book , if not now . " In the autumn of 1862 a plan for leaving Andover altogether was finally matured . She wrote : " You have heard that we are going to Hartford to live , and I am now in all the bustle of houseplanning , to say nothing of grading , underdraining , and setting out trees around our future home . It is four acres and a half of lovely woodland on the banks of a river , and yet within an easy walk of Hartford , - in fact in the city limits ; and when our house is done , you and yours must come and see us . I would rather have made the change in less troublous times , but the duties here draw so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to live on less and be in a place of our own , and with no responsibilities except those of common gentlefolk. " // The war , the enlistment of her second son , the eldest having already died , filled her heart and mind afresh with new problems and anxieties . She wrote the following hurried note from Hartford in 1862 , which gives some idea of her occupations and frame of mind : " I am going to Washington to see the heads of departments myself , and to satisfy myself that I may refer to the Emancipation Proclamation as a reality and a substance , not to fizzle out at the little end of the horn , as I should be sorry to call the attention of my sisters in Europe to any such impotent conclusion . . - - I mean to have a talk with Father Abraham ' himself , among others . " Mrs. Stowe lost no time , but proceeded to carry out her plan as soon as practicable . Of this visit to Washington she says little in her letters beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion here not only that the President will stand up to his proclamation , but that the Border States will accede to his proposition for emancipation . I have noted the thing as a glorious expectancy ! To-day to the home of the contrabands , seeing about five hundred poor fugitives eating a comfortable Thanksgiving dinner , and singing , Oh , let my people go ! ' It was a strange and moving sight . " It was left for others to speak of her interview with President Lincoln . Her daughter was told that when the President heard her name he seized her hand , saying , " Is this the little woman who made the great war ? " He then led her apart to a seat in the window , where they were withdrawn and undisturbed by other guests . No one but those two souls will ever know what waves of thought and feeling swept over them in that brief hour . Afterwards she heard these words pronounced in the Senate Chamber in the Message of President Lincoln ; it was in the darkest hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouragement had followed the Union armies and all hearts were trembling with fear : " If this struggle is to be prolonged till there be not a home in the land where there is not one dead , till all the treasure amassed by the unpaid labor of the slave shall be wasted , till every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be atoned by blood drawn by the sword , we can only bow and say , Just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints ! The following year was made memorable in Mrs. Stowe 's life by the marriage of her youngest daughter . Again I find that no description can begin to give as clearly as the glimpses in her own letters the multifarious responsibilities which beset her . She says : " I am in trouble , - have been in trouble ever since my turtle - doves announced their intention of pairing in June instead of August , because it entailed on me an immediate necessity of bringing everything out of doors and in to a state of completeness for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lawn graded , harrowed , rolled , seeded , and the grass up and growing , stumps got out and stumps and trees got in , conservatory made over , belts planted , holes filled , - and all by three very slippery sort of Irishmen who had rather any time be minding their own business than mine . I have back doorsteps to be made , and troughs , screens , and whatnot ; papering , painting , and varnishing , hitherto neglected , to be completed ; also spring house-cleaning ; also dressmaking for one bride and three ordinary females ; also and and s wardrobes to be overlooked ; also carpets to be made and put down ; also a revolution in the kitchen cabinet , threatening for a time to blow up the whole establishment altogether . " And so the letter proceeds with two more sheets , adding near the end : " I send you to-day a Chimney Corner ' on Our Martyrs , which I have written out of the fullness of my heart . - - It is an account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Andover , who died of starvation and want in a Southern prison on last Christmas Day . " With her heroic nature she was always ready to lead the forlorn hope . The child no one else was willing to provide for , the woman the world despised , were brought into her home and cared for as her own . Unhappily , her delicate health at this time ( though she was naturally strong ) , her constant literary labors , her uncertain income , her private griefs , all united , caused her to fall short in ability to accomplish what she undertook : hence there were often crises from sudden illness and non-fulfillment of engagements which were very serious in their effects , but the elasticity of her spirits was something marvelous and carried her over many a hard place . In the autumn of 1864 she wrote : " I feel I need to write in these days , to keep from thinking of things that make me dizzy and blind , and fill my eyes with tears so that I can not see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where our heroes are dying as Shaw died . It is not wise that all our literature should run in a rut cut through our hearts and red with our blood . I feel the need of a little gentle household merriment and talk of common things , to indulge which I have devised the following . " Notwithstanding her view of the need and her skillfully devised plans to meet it , she soon sent another epistle , showing how impossible it was to stem the current of her thought : - November 29 , 1864 . M* DEAR FRIEND , - I have sent my New Year 's article , the result of one of those peculiar experiences which sometimes occur to us writers . I had planned an article , gay , sprightly , wholly domestic ; but as I began and sketched the pleasant home and quiet fireside , an irresistible impulse wrote for me what followed , - an offering of sympathy to the suffering and agonized whose homes have forever been darkened . Many causes united at once to force on me this vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be denied , - will make itself felt . Just before I went to New York two of my earliest and most intimate friends lost their oldest sons , captains and majors , - splendid fellows physically and morally , beautiful , brave , religious , uniting the courage of soldiers to the faith of martyrs , - and when I went to Brooklyn it seemed as if I were hearing some such thing almost every day ; and Henry , in his profession as minister , has so many letters full of imploring anguish , the cry of hearts breaking that ask help of him . . It was during one of Mrs. Stowe s visits to Boston in the ensuing year that she chanced to talk with greater fullness and openness than she had done with us before on the subject of Spiritualism . In the simplest way she affirmed her entire belief in manifestations of the nearness and individual life of the unseen , and gave vivid illustrations of the reasons why her faith was thus assured . She never sought after such testimony , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit with others who were interested , but her conclusions were definite and unvarying . At that period such a declaration of faith required a good deal of bravery ; now the subject has assumed a different phase , and there are few thinking people who do not recognize a certain truth hidden within the shadows . She spoke with tender seriousness of " spiritual manifestations " as recorded in the New Testament and in the prophets . From his early youth her husband had possessed the peculiar power of seeing persons about him who could not be perceived by others ; visions so distinct that it was impossible for him to distinguish at times between the real and the unreal . I recall one illustration // which had occurred only a few years previous to their departure from Andover . She had been called to Boston one day on business . Making her preparations hurriedly , she bade the household farewell , and rushed to the station , only to see the train go out as she arrived . There was nothing to do but to return home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be disturbed , she quietly opened a side door and crept noiselessly up the staircase leading to her own room , sitting down by her writing-table in the window . She had been seated about half an hour when Professor Stowe came in , looked about hini with a preoccupied air , but did not speak to her . She thought his behavior strange , and amused herself by watching him ; at last the situation became so extraordinary that she began to laugh . " Why , " he exclaimed , with a most astonished air , " is that you ? I thought it was one of my visions ! " It may seem a singular antithesis to say of the writer of one of the greatest stories the world has yet produced that she has not been a student of literature . Books as a medium of the ideas of the age , and as the promulgators of morals and religion , were of course like the breath of her life ; but a study of the literature of the past as the only true foundation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her occupations , and for the larger portion of her life outside of her interest . During the riper season of her activity with the pen , the necessity of studying style and the thoughts of others gained a larger hold upon her mind ; but she always said , with a twinkle of amusement and pride , that she never could have done anything without Mr. Stowe . He knew everything , and all she had to do was to go to him . Of her great work she has written , in that noble introduction to the illustrated edition of Uncle Tom : " The story can less be said to have been composed by her than imposed upon her . The book insisted upon getting itself into being , and would take no denial . " It is easily seen that it was neither a spirit of depreciation of knowledge nor lack of power to become a student which made her fail to obtain adjuncts indispensable to great writers , but her feet were led in other paths and her strength was needed for other ends . Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its publication : " If its judges , possessed with the love of what they call artistic work , ' find unskillful treatment in the book , look well at them to see if their eyes are dry when they are reading this or that chapter . . . . I can not say that Mrs. Stowe has talent , ns one understands it in the world of letters , but she has genius , as humanity feels the need of genius , - the genius of goodness , not that of the rules of letters , but of the saint . " At this period , as she had an accessible home in the pleasant city of Hartford , strangers and travelers often sought and found her . In one of her familiar notes of 1867 she wrote : " The Amberleys have written that they are coming to us to-morrow , and of all times , accordingly , our furnace must spring a leak . We are hoping to make all right before they get here , but I am really ashamed to show such weather at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother expose herself by a fit of ill temper before strangers . . . . Do , I beg , write to a poor sinner laboring under a book . " And again , a little later : " The book is almost done - hang it ! but done well , and will be a good thing for young men to read , and young women too , and so I 11 send you one . You 11 find some things in it , I fancy , that I know and you do n't , about the times before you were born , when I was Hush , hush , my dear - ing ' in Cincinnati . . . . I smell spring afar off - sniff - do you ? Any smell of violets in the distance ? I think it comes over the water from the Pamfili Doria. " // A new era opened in Mrs. Stowe 's life when she made her first visit to Florida , in the winter of 1867 . She was tired and benumbed with care and cold . Suddenly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , herself , and see what the stories were worth which she was constantly hearing about its condition . In the mean time , if she could , she would enjoy the soft air , and find retirement in which she might continue her book . She says in one of her letters : - " Winter weather and cold seem always a kind of nightmare to me . I am going to take my writing-desk and go down to Florida to F s plantation , where we have now a home , and abide there until the heroic agony of betweenity , the freeze and thaw of winter , is over , and then I doubt not I can write my three hours a day . Meanwhile , I have a pretty good pile of manuscript . The letters I have got about blossoming roses and loungers in linen coats , while we have been frozen and snowed up , have made my very soul long to be away . Cold weather really seems to torpify my brain . I write with a heavy numbness . I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had all through the story abundant clairvoyance , and see just how it must be written ; but for writing some parts I want warm weather , and not to be in the state of a froze and thawed apple . ' . . . The cold affects me precisely as extreme hot weather used to in Cincinnati , - gives me a sort of bilious neuralgia . I hope to get a clear , bright month in Florida , when I can say something to purpose . " I did want to read some of my story to you before I went . I have read it to my husband , and though one may think a husband a partial judge , yet mine is so nervous and so afraid of being bored that I feel as if it were something to hold him ; and he likes it , - is quite wakeful , so to speak , about it . All I want now , to go on , is a good frame , as father used to say about his preaching . I want calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . Love to dear A , whom I so much want to see once more. ** Unhappily , she could not get away so soon as she desired . There were contracts to be signed and other businesses to arrange . These delays made her visit southward much shorter than she intend-* ed , but it proved to be only the introduction , the first brief chapter as it were , of her future winter life in Florida . Before leaving she wrote as follows to her publisher : - " I am so constituted that it is absolutely fatal to me to agree to have any literary work done at certain dates . I mean to have this story done by the 1st of September . It would be greatly for my pecuniary interest to get it done before that , because I have the offer of eight thousand dollars for the newspaper use of the story I am planning to write after it . But I am bound by the laws of art . Sermons , essays , lives of distinguished people , I can write to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a flower , sometimes will and sometimes wo n't , like a pretty woman . When the spirits will help , I can write . When they jeer , flout , make faces , and otherwise maltreat me , I can only wait humbly at their gates , watch at the posts of their doors . " This story grows even when I do not write . I spent a month in the mnountains in Stockbridge composing before I wrote a word . " I only ask now a good physical condition , and I go to warmer climes hoping to save time there . I put everything and everybody off that interferes with this , except Pussy Willow , which will be a pretty story for a child 's series . At last she sailed away , about the 1st of March , 1867 , and with that delightful power of knowing what she wanted , and being content when she attained her end , // which is too rare , alas ! Her letters glowed and blossomed and shone with the fruit and flowers and sunshine of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary work could actually reach the printers ' hands under these circumstances as rapidly as if she had been able to write at home : therefore it was with no sense of surprise that we received from her , during the summer of 1868 , what proved to be a chapter of excuses instead of a chapter of her book : " I have a long story to tell you of what has prevented my going on with my story , which you must see would so occupy all the nerve and brain force I have that I have not been able to write a word except to my own children . To them in their needs I must write chapters which would otherwise go into my novel . " About this period she found herself able to come again to Boston for a few days ' visit . There were often long croonings over the fire far into the night ; her other - worldliness and abstractions brought with them a dreamy quietude , especially to those whose harried lives kept them only too much awake . Her coming was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own delightful presence , and she asked nothing more than what she found in the companionship of her friends . The visits to Florida had now become necessary to her health , and before long she perceived that to pass the entire winter there , and to surrender her large house in Hartford , was the next step for her to take . She wrote from Florida : " I am leaving the land of flowers on the 1st of June with tears in my eyes , but having a house in Hartford , it must be lived in . I wish you and - would just come to see it . You have no idea what a lovely place it has grown to be , and I am trying to sell it as hard as a snake to crawl out of his skin . Thus on , till reason is pushed out of life . There s no earthly sense in having anything , - lordy massy , no ! By the bye , I must delay sending you the ghost in the Captain Brown House till I can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give it to you hot . " Her busy brain was again at work with new plans for future books and articles for magazines . " Gladly would I fly to you on the wings of the wind , " she says , " but I am a slave , a bound thrall to work , and I can not work and play at the same time . After this year I hope to have a little rest , and above all things I wo n't be hampered with a serial to write . We have sold out in Hartford . " All this routine of labor was to have a new form of interruption , which gave her intense joy . " I am doing just what you say , " she wrote , " being first lady-inwaiting on his new majesty . He is very pretty , very gracious and good , and his little mamma and he are a pair . . . . I am getting to be an old fool of a grandma , and to think there is no bliss under heaven to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same subject : " You ought to see my baby . I have discovered a way to end the woman controversy . Let the women all say that they wo n't take care of the babies till the laws are altered . One week of this discipline would bring all the men on their marrow-bones . Only tell us what you wt*nt , they would say , and we will do it . Of course you may imagine me trailing after our little king , - first granny-inwaiting . " In the summer of 1869 there was a pleasant home at St. John 's Wood , in London , which possessed peculiar attractions . Other houses were as comfortable to look at , other hedges were as green , other drawing-rooms were gayer , but this was the home of George Eliot , and on Sunday afternoons the resort of those who desired the best that London had to give . Here it was that George Eliot told us of her admiration and deep regard , her affection , for Mrs. Stowe . Her reverence and love were expressed with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her love for our friend . iM*tny letters had already passed between Mrs. Stowe and herself , and she confided to us her amusement at a fancy Mrs. Stowe had taken that Casaubon , in Middlemarch , was drawn from the character of Mr. Lewes . Mrs. Stowe took it so entirely for granted in her letters that it was impossible to dispossess her mind of the illusion . Evidently it was the source of much harmless household amusement at St. John 's Wood . I find in Mrs. Stowe 's letters some pleasant allusions to this correspondence . She writes : " We were all full of George Eliot when your note came , as I had received a beautiful letter from her in answer to one I wrote from Florida . She is a noble , true woman , and if anybody does n't see it , so much the worse for them , and not her . " In a note written about that time Mrs. Stowe says she is coming to Boston , and will bring George Eliot 's letters with her that we may read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination , and was never carried out . Her own letter to Mrs. Lewes , written from Florida in March , 1876 , may be considered one of the most beautiful and interesting pieces of writing she ever achieved . This friendship was one that greatly enlisted Mrs. Stowe 's sympathies and enriched her life . Her interest in any woman who was supporting herself , and especially in any one who found a daily taskmaster in the pen , and above all when , as in this case , the woman was one possessed of great moral aspiration half paralyzed in its action by finding itself in an anomalous and ( to the world in general ) utterly incomprehensible position , made such a woman like a magnet to Mrs. Stowe . She inherited from her father a faith in the divine power of sympathy , which only waxed greater with years and experience . Wherever she found a fellow mortal suffering trouble or dishonor , in spite of hindrance her feet were turned that way . The genius of George Eliot and the contrasting ele ments of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisterly solicitude . Her attitude , her sweetness , her sincerity , could not fail to win the heart of George Eliot . They became loving friends . It was the same inborn sense of fraternity which led her , when a child , on hearing of the death of Lord Byron , to go out into the fields and fling herself , weeping , on the mounded hay , where she might pray alone for his forgiveness and salvation . It is wonderful to observe the influence of Byron upon that generation . It is on record that when Tennyson , a boy of fifteen , heard some one say , " Byron is dead , " he thought the whole world at an end . " I thought , " he said one day , " everything was over and finished for every one ; that nothing else mattered . I remember that I went out alone and carved Byron is dead ' into the sandstone . " From this time forward Mrs. Stowe was chiefly bound up in her life and labors at the South . In 1870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , she said : " I am writing as a pure recreative movement of mind , to divert myself from the stormy , unrestful present . . . . I am being chdtelaine of a Florida farm . I have on my mind the creation of a town on the banks of the St. John . The three years since we came this side of the river have called into life and growth a thousand peachtrees , a thousand orange-trees , about five hundred lemons , and seven or eight hundred grapevines . A peach orchard , a vineyard , a lemon grove , will carry my name to posterity . I am founding a place which , thirty or forty years hence , will be called the old Stowe place . . . . You can have no idea of this queer country , this sort of strange , sandy , half-tropical dreamland , unless you come to it . Here I sit with open windows , the orange buds just opening and filling the air with sweetness , the hens drowsily cackling , the men planting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . // We keep a little fire morning and night . We are flooded with birds ; and by the bye , it is St. Valentine 's Day . . . . I think a uniform edition of Dr. Holmes 's works would be a good thing . Next to Hawthorne he is our most exquisite writer , and in many passages he goes far beyond him . What is the dear Doctor doing ? If you know any book good to inspire dreams and visions , put it into my box . My husband chews endlessly a German cud . I must have English . Has the French book on Spiritualism come yet ? If it has , put it in . . . . I wish I could give you a plateful of our oranges . We had seventy-five thousand of these same on our trees this year , and if you will start off quick , they are not all picked yet . Florida wants one thing , - grass . If it had grass , it would be paradise . But nobody knows what grass is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months later she wrote : " I hate to leave my calm isle of Patmos , where the world is not , and I have such quiet long hours for writing . Emerson could insulate himself here and keep his electricity . Hawthorne ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida . You have no idea how small you all look , you folks in the world , from this distance . All your fusses and your funiings , your red-hot hurrying newspapers , your clamor of rival magazines , - why , we see it as we see steamboats fifteen miles off , a mere speck and smoke . " It was a strange contrast , and one at variance with her natural taste , which brought her before the public as a reader of her own stories in the autumn and winter of 1872-73 . She was no longer able to venture on the effort of a long story , and yet it was manifestly unwise for her to forego the income which was extended to her through this channel . She wrote : " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyceums of different towns were making up their engagements , and that if I were going into it I must make my engagements now . It seems to me that I can not do this . The thing will depend so much on my health and ability to do . You know I could not go round in cold weather . I feel entirely uncertain , and , as the Yankees say , did n't know what to do nor to do n't . ' My state in regard to it may be described by the phrase Kind o ' love to - hate to - wish I did n't - want ter . ' I suppose the result will be I shall not work into their lecture system . " In April she wrote from Mandarin : " I am painting a Magnolia grand*flora , which I will show you . . . . I am appalled by finding myself booked to read . But I am getting well and strong , and trust to be equal to the emergency . But I shrink from Tremont Temple , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should like to begin in Boston . " And in August she said : " I am to begin in Boston in September . . . . It seems to me that is a little too early for Boston , is n't it ? Will there be anybody in town then ? I do n't know as it s my business , which is simply to speak my piece and take my money. ** Her first reading actually took place in Springfield , not Boston , and the next day she unexpectedly arrived at our cottage at Manchester-by-the-Sea . She had read the previous evening in a large public hall , had risen at five o'clock that morning and found her way to us . Her next readings were given in Boston , the first in the afternoon , at the Tremont Temple . She was conscious that her effort at Springfield had not been altogether successful , - she had not held her large audience ; and she was determined to put the whole force of her nature into this afternoon reading at the Tremont Temple . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror , with her short gray hair , which usually lay in soft curls around her brow , brushed erect and standing stiffly . " Look here , my dear , " she said : " now I am exactly like my father , Dr. Lyman Beecher , when he was going to preach , " and she // held up her forefinger warningly . It was easy to see that the spirit of the old preacher was revived in her veins , and the afternoon would show something of his power . An hour later , when I sat with her in the anteroom waiting for the moment of her appearance to arrive , I could feel the power surging up within her . I knew she was armed for a good fight . That reading was a great success . She was alive in every fibre of her being : she was to read portions of Uncle Tom 's Cabin to men , women , and children who could hardly understand the crisis which inspired it , and she determined to effect the difficult task of making them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration they could not fail to understand what her words had signified to the generation that had passed through the struggle of our war . When her voice was not sufficient to make the audience hear , men and women rose from their seats and crowded round her , standing gladly , that no word might be lost . It was the last leap of the flame which had burned out a great wrong . From this period , although she continued to write , she lived chiefly in the retirement of the Florida orange grove , which she always enjoyed . Her sympathy was strong with the new impetus benevolent work in cities had received , and she helped it from her " grotto " in more ways than one . Soinetimes she would write soothing or inspiriting letters , as the case might demand , to individuals . Meanwhile , the comfort she drew in from the beauty of nature and the calm around her seemed yearly to nourish and renew her power of existence . Questions which were difficult to others were often solved to her mind by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question as to where they should look to supply labor for the South . " Why , " she remarked once , " there was a negro , one of those fearfully hot days in the spring , who was digging muck from a swamp just in front of our house , and carrying it in a wheelbarrow up a steep slope , where he dumped it down , and then went back for more . He kept this up when it was so hot that we thought either one of us would die to be five minutes in the sun . We carried a thermometer to the spot where he was working , to see how great the heat was , and it rose at once to one hundred and thirty-five degrees . The man , however , kept cheerfully at his work , and when he went to his dinner sat with the other negroes out in the white sand without a bit of shade . Afterward they all lay down for a nap in the same sheltered locality . Toward evening , when the sun was sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to this man . Martin , ' said I , you ye had a warm day 's work . How do you stand it ? Why , I could n't endure such heat for five minutes . ' Hah ! hah ! No , I s'pose you could n't . Ladies ca n't , missus . ' But , Martin , are n't you very tired ? ' Bress your heart , no , missus . ' So Martin goes home to his supper , and after supper will be found dancing all the evening on the wharf near by ! After this , when people talk of bringing Germans and Swedes to do such work , I am much entertained . " Many were the pleasant descriptions of her home sent forth to tempt her friends away from the busy North . " Here is where we read books , " she said in one of her letters , written in the month of March . " Up North nobody does , - they do n't have time ; so if - will mail his book to Mandarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inwardly digest . ' We are having a carnival of flowers . I hope you read my Palmetto Leaves , for then you will see all about us . . . . Our home is like a martin-box . . . . I can not tell you the quaint odd peace we have here in living under the oak . Behold she dwelleth under the oak at Mamre . ' All that we want is friends , to whom we may say that solitude is sweet . We have some neighbors , however , who have made // pretty places near us . Mr. Stowe keeps up a German class of three young Ladies , with whom he is reading Faust for the nine hundred and ninety-ninth time , and in the evening I read aloud to a small party of the neighbors . We have made up our home as we went along , throwing out a chamber here and there , like twigs out of the old oak . . . . The orange blossoms have come like showers of pearl , and the yellow jessamine like golden fleeces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This glorious , budding , blossoming spring , and we have days when merely to breathe and be is to be blessed . I love to have a day of mere existence . Life itself is a pleasure when the sun shines warm , and the lizards dart from all the shingles of the roof , and the birds sing in so many notes and tones the yard reverberates ; and I sit and dream and am happy , and never want to go back North , nor do anything with the toiling , snarling world again . I do wish I could gather you both in my little nest . " She is like her father , Dr. Lyman Beecher , in many things . The scorching fire of the brain seemed to devour its essence , and she has endured , as he did before her , some y ears of existence when the motive power of the brain has almost ceased to act . She has become " like a little child , " wandering about , pleased with flowers , fresh air , the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the busy , inspiring spirit is asleep . Gradually she is fading away , shrouded in this strange mystery , hovered over by the untiring affection of her children , sweet and tender in her decadence , but " absent . " At the moment when this brief memorial was receiving a final revision before going to the press , the news reached me of the unloosing of the last threads of consciousness which bound Mrs. Stowe to this world . A great spirit has performed its mission and has been released . The world moves on unconscious ; but the world*s children have been blessed by her coming , and they who know and understand should praise God reverently in her going . " As a teil tree , and as an oak , whose substance is in them , when they cast their leaves : so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof . " " My sword shall be bathed in heaven . "
