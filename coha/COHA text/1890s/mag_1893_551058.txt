By Julius E. Olson . ON EACH recurring 17th of May , the Norwegian people gather , as we do on the Fourth of July , to celebrate their national independence , - the day on which their ancestors , in 1814 , adopted a free constitution . Norway 's struggles in winning her independence and maintaining the integrity of it in her union with Sweden , constitute a long chapter of her modern history . The constitution of Norway guarantees complete liberty to the people , but this the various sovereigns of the dual monarchy have not always been willing to recognize in practice , and as a consequence , the Storthing , or National Assembly , has been forced more than once to present a bold front to the king , and to wring from him their rights by a resort to the most rigid methods of procedure that the constitution provides . At times royalty has gained temporary advantages , but , on the other hand , Norway has won some very decided victories , and , on the whole , made steady gains along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under seeming defeat , any of her constitutional rights , although obliged at various times to hold them in abeyance . The political crisis that Norway has just passed through is but one of a series of combats that have been waged between Norwegian democracy and its various opponents . Norway has not yet complete right of free action . She has one more shackle to break . For this task she has steeled herself , and the first strategic movement of the final struggle has been made . Norway has complete control of her domestic affairs , but Sweden and Norway have the same diplomatic and consular service , under the supervision of a minister for foreign affairs , an official who represent both countries , but who hitherto has always been a Swede , and in no way responsible to the Norwegian government . This fact has given the world a wrong idea of Norway 's relation to Sweden . Norway is jealous of her rights , and is anxious to have the world understand her true position in the union between the two countries . And this desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride : she has suffered real injustice . By virtue of the present arrangement her big Swedish brother is often tempted to pose as her guardian . She has resolved to remove the temptation . The casual student of Scandinavian affairs inclines to the belief that the people of Norway and Sweden , on account of geographical position , racial affinity and supposed linguistic identity , ought to amalgate politically and become one nation in sentiment and aim . The experience of three quarters of a century , however , shows that there is no likelihood of this being done . The two nations are to-day farther apart in every way than ever before since the union was formed . This union was the result of political exigencies , and offered no conditions for a common social organization , and hence the social , and intellectual forces of the two countries have followed independent lines . Their literatures , for instance , are entirely separate and individual . As stated , the union was formed in 1814 . Norway went into it with a free constitution of her own making , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the decrees of the great powers of Europe , is an interesting chapter in the history of political liberty . It is , indeed , astonishing that she was able to accomplish what she did , when we consider , not only her powerful opponents , but the fact that for over four hundred years the country had been under the rule of Danish kings . During this long union of four centuries the Norsemen had maintained a sturdy personal independence that even Danes did not possess , due to a system of udal or freehold tenure of land . On account of these udal rights , to which the Norse peasantry persistently clung , the Danish nobles did not succeed in introducing Danish serfdom into Norway . The Norsemen claimed their land by the same right that the king claimed // his crown , and any encroachment upon this right was boldly resented . Secure in the possession of their estates , the people had , strangely enough , lost their interest in national affairs . These udalers or freeholders were not mere peasants , in the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hereditary aristocracy : - the heirs of men who had , in that heroic past of several centuries embalmed in the Old Norse sagas , made Norway one of the great powers of Europe . It would be interesting to show the importance of Norway 's udal system to her national regeneration in 1814 , if space would permit , for it proved to be the solid rock on which it became possible to build national independence . Healthy signs of a revival in national spirit , nourished by a study of the rich saga literature of the classical period , appeared in the latter half of the 18th century . This desire for national freedom was vitalized during the stirring times of the French revolution ; and in Scandinavia it was the Norsemen , not the the Danes or Swedes , who became the apostles of the new political gospel . From this time on there was a steady growth , of national feeling , and when , in 1814 , the opportunity came for Norway to assert herself ; she was not slow to act . Had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eventful days of 1814 , and had not this sentiment had the underpinning of the peasant 's personal independence , the Norwegian constitution would simply have been a paper constitution . It would surely have been swept away by the great reaction emanating from the Holy Alliance , whereas it was the only constitution among the many to which the French revolution had given birth that survived the storms of that period . It is necessary at this point to inquire into the origin of the present union between Norway and Sweden . Jn the year i8io , Marshall Jean Bernadotte of France was elected crown prince of Sweden , Charles XIII . being childless . Bernadotte proved unfaithful to Napoleon , and joined the allied forces against him , demanding as his reward the cession of Norway to Sweden as indemnification for the Baltic province of Finland , which Russia had recently taken away from Sweden . After Napoleon 's fatal Russian campaign and his defeat at the battle of Leipsic , Bernadotte forced Frederick VI . of Denmark , by the treaty of Kiel , January , 1814 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation in Norway . There were influential men there who had desired a union with Sweden , on account of geographical position , but no one could endure the thought of being sold outright . The Norsemen contended that the union with Denmark had been a voluntary one , and that the king of Denmark might sever the union , but had no authority to treat Norway as a chattel . By his act Norway reverted , in their opinion , to the constitutional condition that obtained before the union was formed . It has been indicated that the Norsemen were not altogether prepared for this crisis . The sagas of the kings of Norway had been translated fram the old Norse , and were extensively read . These were filled with the proud achievements of her own independent kings ; and this proud past , together with the impetus that came from the French Revolution , inspired a school of patriotic poets , who so persistently sang the praises of Norway and her people that the Danes almost unwittingly joined the chorus . These national songs were often childishly bombastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way , their authors became the founders of a state . Moreover , the country had , since 1618 , had a national army that had on more than one occasion distinguished itself ;  --  had , indeed , faced and felled no less a foe than Charles XII . In fact , the country was fairly well defended , and this gave the people courage . Under these circumstances , the people in convention assembled declared , February *6th , 1814 , that the cession of Norway to Sweden could not be recognized . An address was sent to the Swedish king saying : " The nation has arisen to defend its freedom and independence . We offer Sweden peace and defensive alliance , if she will relinguish her claim ; otherwise we declare war . " Hereupon Christian Frederick , a Danish prince who had determined // to cast his lot with the Norsemen , was elected prince regent . A convention was called for establishing a permanent government , and on the 17th of May ( 1814 ) , a constitution was adopted , and Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only say here that it is generally conceded to be one of the freest and most democratic in existence . As its prototypes , the constitution of the United States , the French constitution of 1791 , and the Spanish of 1812 , it is a clear reflection of the sovereignty of the people . Royalty and nobility as suck had not dictated a word in it . It was not a constitution drawn up by a conqueror for the conquered . The next thing to be done was to face Bernadotte , backed by his allies ,  --  Russia , England , Prussia and Austria . The Norsemen had acted with faith in the justice of their cause , and seemed to hope that something would intervene to prevent the powers from enforcing the decrees of the treaty of Kiel . But the horizon was dark . Napoleon had been sent to Elba , and victorious Bernadotte was approaching Norway 's borders like a dark thunder-cloud . Norwegian ambassadors had been despatched to England to seek her support , but her ministry refused them a hearing . Norway found able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of a majority that felt that the ministry had to be supported . And so Norway was forced to stand alone . The die had been cast , and war was inevitable . Ambassadors , that were in reality warheralds , arrived to inform the king of Norway that he must submit . To openly defy the great powers meant sure defeat . Diplomacy alone could accomplish anything at this juncture . It was necessary to gain time . Fortunately the Norwegian king made a very favorable impression upon the ambassadors . He told them he could give no definite reply without the advice of the Storthing , and to convene this body required three months , during which time the country must have peace and open ports . The ambassadors looked favorably upon this , and hastened to Sweden to urge upon Bernadotte the granting of Norway 's request . He was very angry on account of their action in treating with the king of Norway , whose government they had thereby recognized . During the meeting , he lost his temper , and asked the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend the Norwegian constitution . Bernadotte was unwilling to make any concessions , thinking he had before him an easy task of conquest . He did not believe that people who had been under the lash of a more absolute power than the Sultan 's ( as he expressed it ) , had such thirst for political rights that they would stake everything upon the preservation of a constitution . He would teach the rebellious Norwegians a lesson in obedience . So the war began . The Norwegian king had been a success as an organizer . As a general he was not . Under fire he lost courage . On one important occasion he ordered a retreat , under the most vehement protest of his officers . Some of his generals , however , won victories that caused Bernadotte to halt and consider . He was , in fact , as anxious to have hostilities cease as Christain Frederick . His Swedish army was not large enough to carry the war to a successful issue , and he had begun to fear that his allies would fail him , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the princes of Europe were not kindly disposed toward him . Moreover , during the campaign against Napoleon , he is said to have entertained hopes of becoming his successor , and with that end in view had not marched his Swedish troops upon French soil . This had been viewed with suspicion , which later found open utterance at the council of Vienna . And beside this Bernadotte was keenly sensitive of his military reputation , and he saw the fatal consequences to him at Vienna of a prolonged campaign . Moreover , to his credit as a statesman be it said , he knew that a union forced upon the Norwegians would lack that element of strength necessary to make it of value to him or to either country . And so , without alluding to the treaty of Kiel , he proposed an armistice and a convention to which the Norwegians agreed . Thus Charles John , ( Bernadotte 's title as // crown prince , ) recognized the political existence of the Norwegian Storthing , something that previously to that time the Swedish government had refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway , August 14th , ( 1814 ) , when the Norwegians , having lost faith in their own king , declared themselves willing to form a union with Sweden on one condition , , namely , that they should be allowed to retain their constitution , making only the necessary verbal changes , and that Norway 's equality in the union should be unconditionally recognized . Feeling that it was imperative to restore peace as soon as possible , in order to check the design of his royal opponents , Charles John accepted these terms , and Norway gained a position that the most valiant defence might not have attained . He was in fact so anxious for an immediate settlement of difficulties that he had instructed the commissioners who were to treat with the Storthing , not to hesitate to make concessions ; these he said they could undo at some future session of the Storthing . A constitutional provision or so was nothing serious in the eyes of this disciple of Napoleon . And so on the fourth of November , ( 1814 ) Norway was declared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united with Sweden under one king . " Sweden had thus failed to enforce the decrees of the treaty of Kiel ; for the negotiations plainly show that the union was a voluntary one , formed in accordance with Norway 's demands . This view is corroborated by the events of the ensuing year , when a bond of union was framed . The need of such an instrument was stated by the king to his Swedish diet , and the point of perfect equality particularly dwelt upon . This document , which was framed by representatives of both governments , and adopted in the summer of 1815 , is known as the Act of Union . It is more of the nature of an international compact than of a fundamental law . It recognizes Norway 's independence , and states that the union was formed , not by force of arms , but through free conviction , and that it ought and shall be maintained through the mutual recognition of each nation 's legal rights for the defence of their united thrones . According to its provisions the two countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection , in case of a new dynasty , both nations have an equal voice . Norway has her own national assembly , the Storthing , her own cabinet , her own judiciary , monetary system , finances , tariff system , administration , and her own army and navy . The king is the only representative of the union , and then only as an individual , not in his executive acts , ( except in declaring war , ) for from a constitutional point of view there is a Swedish king and a Norwegian king , - two separate thrones and two separate governments . This dual monarchy is therefore quite unlike that of AustriaHungary . In a work entitled The State , Woodrow Wilson says : " Very interesting and important differences of law and organization separate Austria-I-Iungary from its northern analogue , Sweden-Norway . The union of Austria and Hungary is much more complete than that hetween Sweden and Norway . The southern state has what the northern state has not , a common legislative authority , namely , and common departments of administration . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly eighty years of experience , is duly thankful . From what has been said , I think , it will be plain that the union between Sweden and Norway was formed on the basis of perfect equality between the two states . But this principle of equality was not honestly put into practice . As a matter of fact , when the Swedes learned of the terms upon which their long-headed crown-prince had concluded peace , they were disappointed . He received no compliments for his really shrewd work . The old king said it was " a union to weep over . ' And so , to appease the Swedes , and to conciliate the Holy Alliance , Charles John resolved to inaugurate a policy of retrenchment in dealing with Norway . But he was not the first to assume the offensive . At its first session , the Storthing passed a measure to abolish nobility . This was promptly vetoed , but it was passed by two successively elected Storthings , and became a law , in 1821 , in spite of the royal protest . Charles John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postponement of this measure out of regard to the Holy Alliance , but in vain . During the same session ( 1821 ) the king proposed no less than thirteen changes in the constitution , all calculated to increase his powers , ( one of which was the right of absolute veto ) , and to gain favor for the promotion of these measures , the crown prince , instead of a Swede , was appointed viceroy . This pleased the Norwegians , but the changes proposed were nevertheless unanimously rejected . In spite of this rebuff , the same propositions were laid before a succeeding session of the triennial Storthing , ( 1827 ) but to no purpose . About this time Charles John tried to prevent the Norwegians from celebrating the 17th of May , the day on which the constitution had been adopted , but his attitude only increased their demonstrations . The Storthing continued to be aggressive . An appanage was refused , and the salary of the viceroy and of some high officials was reduced . Other things , too , were done , indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy , of defence ,  --  acts which not only thoroughly enraged Charles John , but also incurred the displeasure of the Holy Alliance , which exhorted him to check these democratic aberrations . He found the session of 1836 especially aggravating . All officials , even military men , appeared in the Storthing in civil dress , conduct by which Charles John thought they meant to express that they could not fulfill their duties to the king and the Storthing at the same time . Royal propositions for constitutional amendments were very summarily disposed of . The Russian government now stepped in and urged the king to dissolve the Storthing , - a power that the Norwegian constitution does not grant the king . Hitherto the cabinet had always proved faithful to the Storthing , but at this time the prime minister ( Lovenskiold ) agreed with the king in the wisdom of Russia* s advice . This minister was promptly impeached and fined . And so the conflict continued , the king looking upon his Swedish subjects with anything but kindly eyes , until trouble in his Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christiania , where he received many proofs that the people , especially those who had opposed him most bitterly , really loved him personally , although they did not approve of his constitutional amendments . In 1844 , Charles John was succeeded by his son Oscar I. Fears were entertained in Norway that he might continue his father 's policy , but they were groundless . All of the Charles John 's successors , including the present king , have been disposed to yield to Norway 's demands for equality , but they have usually been restrained by the intervention of Swedish opinion . From the beginning of the union the Norwegians had never liked the constitutional provision that the king might appoint a Swede as his viceroy or s/a/holder . It smacked too much of provincial subordination . During the first fifteen years of the union , the presidency of the king 's Norwegian cabinet was held by Swedish-born viceroys . The last one of this period , Count Platen , who came with the avowed purpose of " incorporating the Norwegians with the faithful Swedes , " experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are said to have hastened his death . After this the position was not filled for seven years , and was never afterwards occupied by a Swede . But even when occupied by a Norwegian , it continued to be odious , and it was vacant at various intervals , until , after various attempts that caused bitter discussions in the press of both countries , it was finally abolished in 1873 by the present king , Oscar II . Previously to this time ( as it has since also ) , the " flag question " had more than once put the people of both countries into a passion , but it is a long story and I pass on to a far more interesting one , the " veto conflict , " as it is called . It began in 1872 . Up to this time the Storthing and the ministery had practically been a unit in combat with the king ; but the veto question precipitated a struggle between the Liberty party on the one side , and the king , the ministry and the conservative party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century of // the union , the majority of the members of the Storthing belonged to the official class . Gradually , however , the peasant proprietors increased in number , and formed the nucleus of an opposition party , now known as the Left , or Liberals . In i8*i , this party found an able leader in the late John Sverdrup , to whose skilful guidance the country is largely indebted for the many reforms of the succeeding forty years . In 1872 , the Liberals brought in a bill , carried by a vote of 8o to 29 , to enact that the members of the cabinet should take part in the proceedings of the Storthing . The conservative ministry advised the king to veto this . It was correctly surmised that the measure virtually meant the introduction of the English parliamentary system of responsibility to the majority party , and the members of the conservative cabinet did not propose to sign their own deathwarrants . They received a vote of censure for their advice , but the king expressed his confidence in them , and refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appoint and keep whatever ministers he pleased . Charles XV . died the same year ( 1872 ) and when Oscar II . ascended the throne , he promised to give this question careful consideration . And so at the session of 1874 , his cabinet laid a royal proposition before the Storthing for the admittance of the ministers to seats in that body , but this was to be accompanied by other changes of the nature of Charles John 's retrenchment measures . The royal propositions were rejected , and a new cabinet bill was passed . This was carried by three successively elected Storthings , ( the last time in i 88o by a vote of 93 against 20 , ) which made it a law , as the constitution provides that the king has only a suspensive veto , twice effective . But it was feared that the king would claim an absolute veto in constitutional amendments . This is what his ministers urged him to do , basing their advice upon a legal opinion from the department of justice , that in amendments to the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed in the fundamental law , was " beyond all doubt . " This opinion was later confirmed by the law faculty of the University , but nevertheless , on the 9th of June i88o , ( a second 17th of May to the Liberals ) , a resolution was passed declaring the bill a law without the royal sanction . As the executive still refused to recognize the validity of the law , the members of the cabinet were impeached before the High Court of the Realm , and convicted . Some were deprived of office , and others only fined . During those exciting days of 1883-84 , public feeling ran very high . A coup d ' c/al seemed imminent . As an indication of this , it was found that 20,000 muskets in one of the Norwegian arsenals had been deprived of their locks . Throughout the whole land patriotic speeches were made , exhorting the people to stand firm in support of the Storthing . The poet Bjornson , whose manly voice is always heard in the hour of danger , had the courage to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the monarchy can not give up an absolute veto , then you must boldly answer that in that case the Norwegian people must give up the monarchy . " The king at first denied the High Court 's jurisdiction in the case , and refused to comply with its decrees ; but he nevertheless found it expedient , " Under Ike circums/ances , " as he put it , to ask the Selmer ministry to retire , whereupon he appointed a new ministry of the same tenor as the old , instead of one in sympathy with the majority party . This new cabinet was informed that unless it complied with the Storthing 's resolution , impeachment proceedings would immediately be begun , - information that effected the retirement of this " April ministry , " as it was called . After some attempts in the direction of a compromise-ministry , the king at last invited Sverdrup , the leader of the opposition to form a cabinet . And thus another victory was scored for the people , this time against , not only the king , but also against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of which , during the veto conflict , had looked askance across the borders for the moral support of Sweden , in their desire to exchange // some of Norway 's independence for a firmer union and a more effective royal power . But opinion in Sweden was divided . The Swedish liberals declared that the " veto war " in Norway did not concern Sweden . They saw then , and see now , that the fight Norway is waging against royalty , is paving the way for their own democratization . As a recent Swedish editorial puts it : " The refractory attitude of the Norwegian does not imply animosity to the Swedish people , but to their antiquated institutions . They refuse to be set back in their development . " It has been said that mentioning the poet l3jdrnstjerne Bjdrnson ' s name is equivalent to hoisting the pure Norwegian flag . For over thirty years he has been in every political or literary combat that the country has had . And these have been numerous . His national songs have supplanted the old bombastic songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done more than any other one man to arouse the political conscience of his people . A word in his defense . His Norwegian opponents , marching in royal processions , singing the patriotic words of his famous national song , denounce him as a traitor , and his enemies across the border accuse him of inciting the Norwegian people to hate the Swedes . Nothing could be farther from the truth . Bjdrnson is a philanthropist . He loves not only Norway , but Sweden , and all the world . He is , it is true , a political agitator , but an agitator for human rights ,  --  secure conditions for universal peace . In literature , Bjornson is an optimistic realist . His optimism knows no bounds . His abiding faith in humanity stimulates and strengthens . Being a poet , he may not always be a safe political pilot , but as some one has said , we do not look to poets for finalities . Enthusiastic foreign newspaper correspondents sometimes herald him as the first president of the Norwegian republic , which he has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but poets never become presidents . The question that at present is engaging the attention of the Norwegian people is an important and interesting one . I refer to the demand of the Liberal party for a separate consular service , and , eventually , a complete diplomatic representation of its own , or , at any rate , such an adjustment of foreign relations as to make officers of this branch of the public service in some way responsible to the Norwegian people , and not alone to the king and his Swedish minister for foreign affairs . This question must soon be adjusted to the satisfaction of the Norwegian Storthing , its supporters insist , or it will result in a separation of the two peoples . The union must ultimately be recognized as , what it in law is , a personal union ,  --  a defensive alliance for the mutual protection of the independence of the two nations , or even that bond will be broken . In all previous struggles the indissolubleness of the union has not been seriously questioned . But in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of many Norwegian patriots . Whenever the Liberals have attempted to make encroachments on royal prerogatives , their opponents have hastened to warn the people that the success of their measures meant the annihilation of the monarchy and the introduction of republican institutions ,  - -  a threat repeated so often that the people have looked into the history of republics , and find them not at all to be dreaded . The question has been discussed not a little even among the peasantry . In discussing the present political situation , the question naturally arises : How is it that Norway , which the constitution calls a free and independent state , did not obtain its own diplomatic and consular service when the union was formed ? We must remember that this was done in turbulent times ,  --  in 1814 . Norway had declared her independence and established a government , but this government and its representatives the great powers had refused to recognize . So when she entered the union she had no diplomatic service . Important foreign relations needed immediate attention , and these were adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a make-shift became a settled practice . But protests were made as early as x8i8 and 1821 , and a slight concession // was made in 1835 , when the still prevailing practice began of admitting a Norwegian minister of state to the diplomatic council . This official 's function , however , is simply advisory . This was not satisfactory to Norway , and the next Storthing ( 1837 ) , complained to the king of the way diplomatic matters were conducted , Norway having in one case , through the mismanagement ( to use a mild expression ) of the Swedish minister for foreign affairs , been obliged to pay an entirely unjust and outrageous indemnity of over $ioo , ooo , besides suffering very humiliating treatment . The Storthing 's address to the king resulted in the appointment of a joint committee to revise the Act of Union . This committee recommended that the minister for foreign affairs shbuld be either a Norwegian or a Swede , and be responsible to both legislative bodies , but the report was buried in a Swedish department of , the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contests , after which , in i88*-86 , new attempts were made , when both parties agreed that foreign affairs should be conducted by a joint council consisting of an equal number of ministers from each country , but the negotiations again stranded on the minister for foreign affairs . At this time an ex-minister ( I3j6rnstjerna ) declared in the Swedish diet : " On the basis of the agreements entered into when the union was formed , Norway has no right whatever to take part in the discussion of diplomatic questions , much less a right to complete equality . " And as late as January , 1891 , the Swedish ministry , in a joint council , insisted that " neither the Act of Union or any other union law gives Norway the right to take part in the discussion of diplomatic affairs . " It has been suggested that the conservative Norwegian ministers who were members of the joint council might have replied that neither the Act of Union nor any other union law gives Sweden the right to control Norway 's foreign affairs . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote of cen sure from the Storthing that effected their resignation , whereupon the present liberal cabinet , with Steen as prime minister , came into power . Thus all past attempts at a solution of this difficulty have failed . Having by accident , as it were , obtained control of the diplomatic relations of both countries the Swedish government has insisted , of late years more strenuously than ever before , that this control was one of the implied conditions of the union , and it has been in a position to maintain its claims from the vantage ground of actual possession . It should be stated , however , that the diplomatic as well as the consular officers , except the minister for foreign affairs , may , according to the practice that now obtains , be either Swedes or Norwegians . Norwegians have filled some of the best diplomatic positions ; but in law they are officers of Sweden , and responsible to the Swediah minister for foreign affairs . The case is certainly unique . The Norwegian Liberals consider it an abnormity , - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . In previous controversies they have contended that the minister for foreign affairs should be either a Swede or a Norwegian , ( once even proposing that it should not be specified , but left to the discretion of the king , ) but they now demand , as has already been stated , a separate minister for foreign affairs , and their own diplomats and consuls . A recent and well known Swedish writer , A. Hedin , a member of the Diet , has said on this question : " The ruling wisdom in Sweden has let three quarters of a century pass without learning that , as a result of opposition to legitimate demands , small difficulties grow to great ones , and these suddenly change to impossibilities . This wisdom has brought the question to such a point that it may cause a dissolution of the union . That a radical demand for an independent diplomatic service would eventually be made by the Norwegians , presented , too as a principal measure of a majority party , it has not been difficult to foresee by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present situation is the natural result of such stupid politics . " And what is the present situation ? Since the unsuccessful attempts of i886 and 1891 , the Liberals have urged Norway 's // absolute right to a separate diplomatic and consular service . All attempts at negotiation for this right having failed , they have determined to lake it . As the Swedes are in actual possession of the disputed territory , the Liberals began to move cautiously , not desiring to be stigmatized as rebellious . First they had a conservative party at home to contend with , men whose extreme anxiety for the welfare of their country has caused them to put the union first and national independence second . In recent years this party has played the classical role of the good hen mother clucking nervously on the bank , while the ducklings , which she had heedlessly hatched , were plunging merrily into the stream of modern reform . Besides this opposition at home , the Liberals were in doubt of the attitude the king would assume , and so concluded not to attempt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some time ago a commission was appointed by the government to inquire into the feasibility of this move . A very favorable report having been made , the Liberal party , in the fall of 1891 , went before the people on this issue . The Liberal cabinet was already a unit on the question , but it desired , if possible , an increased majority in the Storthing before taking any aggressive steps . This majority it received , and when the Storthing convened last January , the first bugle note of warning to the Swedish government was the introduction of resolution , declaring that the matter of establishing a separate consular service was exclusively a Norwegian question , to be decided by the Norwegian authorities and the king , and that only the methods and terms of separation would be considered in joint council . Thereupon a bill was introduced , establishing an independent consular service . This bill after a long series of debates , was passed on the ioth of last June , and funds were appropriated with which to arrange preliminaries with Sweden . Under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to be expressed by his ministry . His cabinet is a shield to receive the arrows of popular disapproval . But on account of the Swedish power behind the Norwegian throne , there was considerable anxiety as to how the king would view the new move . After a discussion of the matter with him , his Liberal Norwegian ministry ascertained that , out of regard to his Swedish cabinet , he had decided to veto the measure . Here was a dilemma . The Constitution says : " The king 's person is holy . He can neither be blamed nor accused . Responsibility rests with his cabinet . " But the cabinet was not willing to be responsible for a veto . The members were all in sympathy with the majority party in the Storthing . The somewhat doubtful possibility of a minority ministry , meant a crisis . A delay in the formation of such a ministry would leave the country without any cabinet at all . But the Liberal cabinet feeling that under a parliamentary system the king was morally and politically bound to sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned before any oftfcial action was taken . That is , they did not give the king an opportunity of a veto , to which they would have had to add their protests , followed by their resignations , thus leaving neither the king , the protesting cabinet , or a possible minority cabinet responsible to the Storthing . After the cabinet had resigned , the Storthing , on the 3oth of June , sent the following address to the king : " With deep regret we have learned of your Majesty 's refusal to comply with the Storthing 's resolution of the soth of June , concerning the establishment of a separate consular system , and that the Norwegian government , having the confidence of the Storthing has felt obliged to resign . We consider it our duty to indicate to your Majesty that the resulting political situation may have far-reaching consequences , detrimental not only to the country but also to the monarchy and the union . We therefore respectfully request your Majesty to forestall these possibilities by complying with the resolution in question , and thereby preventing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retirement of a ministry , which at present is the only one that can secure the confidence of the Storthing . " In his reply the king defended his conduct , and censured the cabinet for resigning , but conceded that the consular question should be settled in a Norwegian council of state . // Demonstrations in honor of the king and the Steen ministry by their respective supporters and sympathizers were now the order of the day . Both sides claimed victory . Great excitement prevailed in Christiana . Characteristically enough , the poet ilenrik Ibsen stood a keen observer from his hotel window , while Bj6rnson , laurel-crowned chieftain of the people that he is , marched in the Liberal procession with his wife on his arm . A ringing speech by Bj6rnson gave the watchword of the future : " None but Norsemen shall rule in Norway . " The resignation of the Steen ministry had been accepted and after numerous consultations , the leader of the Conservatives , Mr. Stang , was invited to form a cabinet . To the surprise of everybody , he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Storthing 's resolution on the consular question . This the king - it is authoritatively reported - finally consented to do . But while Stang was vainly casting about for member of a cabinet , the crown prince arrived from Sweden to report the Swedish pulse , whereupon Mr. Stang was informed by the king that his condition could not be accepted . The Storthing continued in session , but refused to proceed with some bills for appropriations under consideration until the crisis was over . After another futile attempt to form a Conservative cabinet , the king was advised by Conservative leaders to retain the Liberal ministry , and to ask that compliance with the Storthings 's resolution he postponed . For various reasons the Liberals thought it unwise to prolong the deadlock . The The elections in Norway are triennial . They were held last fall ( 1891 ) , and hence a new appeal to the people on this question could not be made for two years . It was an advantage to their party for them to be in power during the interval , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , to demand a compliance whenever they should see fit . In fact , they agreed to an armistice , which they are at liberty to terminate at any time . This , it is generally understood , will be done within a year . It is interesting to note that both parties in the Storthing united in an address requesting the present ministry to withdraw their resignations . This signifies that , in reality , the views of the Conservatives on the consular question are not radically different from those of the Liberals . Norway 's constitutional rights are not questioned by the Conservatives . It is only a matter of expediency with them . This move on the part of the Conservatives has , moreover , served to indicate to the opposition that they are not quite so willing to sell their birthright for a mess of pottage as many had supposed . XVhatever position the Conservatives may take on the question of a separate minister for foreign offairs , the contest , as it now stands , has shown Sweden that she need look to neither party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . In addition to this , the contest has verified the fact that the parliamentary system is now a recognized institution in Norway , for the king has found it impossible to obtain a ministry willing to undertake to do business with a hostile majority in the Storthing , vested with such formidable powers as the right of impeachment and the absolute control of voting supplies . In the words of a prominent Swedish journal : " The Liberals in the Storthing have not capitulated to the right of a superior power , but to that spirit of moderation which bids them not to expose the country and the people to the dangers of political ventures . It is the same with the king , who has found it advisable , without any change of personal opinion , to retain a ministry , which , after all that has happened , feels that it has won a significant victor , . This same ministry has received restitution for the vexatious opposition of the Conservatives , through their willingness to join in an address asking Mr. Steen 's cabinet to remain. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can assure our Norwegian kinsmen that - no matter what boasters may have said - not a hand shall , with impunity , be raised , not a farthing appropriated , for an attack on Norway . " What the next step will be remains for the future to tell . But there can be no doubt that agitation will go on until Norway s demands for a separate diplomatic service are fairly met . The sooner a complete settlement is made the better , for every new combat has an aftermath // of bitterness , prejudicial not only to the stability of the union , but to the good fellowship of the two nationalities even in this country . And the majority party insists that there is now but one solution of the question : one that gives Norway a position of complete equality , as guaranteed by the constitution and the Act of Union . The present diplomatic and codsular system is not in accordance with fundamental law . It is a practice that has been endured until a constitutional one could be peacefully inaugurated . If Sweden had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps have been posslble , as a compromise , to introduce a system of delegations , like the one in vogue in Austria-Hungary . But in view of the increasing dissatisfaction of the Hungarians , that system no longer invites imitation . And conditions are different there . That dual monarchy consists of two countries at many points interlaced and amalgamated in history and institutional life . " Moreover , Austria has been willing to recognize Hungary 's equality . Not so in the other case . As Dr. Sigurd Ibsen puts it : " Norway may have striven ever so hard to establish her right to an honorable place in the community of nations : in official Sweden it has availed her nothing . Norway has progressed in population , prosperity and enlightenment . It avails notbing . Among sea-faring nations she has forced her way to the front rank . It avails nothing . The names which in Europe bear tidings of intellectual life in Scandinavia are almost exclusively Norwegian . It avails not . No matter to what planes of intellectual life the Norsemen may have risen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a Scandidavian of a lower class . And the phenomenon is not unique . " I need not , with the author , go into an enumeration of historical analogues . One at least will suggest itself . On account of this feeling , increasing rather than diminishing , the Liberals have resolved that the union must be restored to its constitutional basis , having only these things in common : a king , war and peace . They insist that there is no use of arguing the impossibility of an independent diplomatic service for each of two nations under one king . It must be made possible if the union is to continue . From a constitutional point of view the union between Sweden and Norway is unique , and new institutions must be created if it is to be preserved as a defensive alliance . Such an alliance the Liberals see the benefits of maintaining in their neutrality . But they are beginning to argue that the remote probability of danger in case of war is much preferable to a union where Norway 's constitutional right of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that even from a business point of view Norway should have her own consuls . While Norway has three times as large a merchant marine as Sweden , Sweden has two-thirds of the consulships . This is enough to indicate the situation between two countries that are competitors for commercial concessions . And the diplomatic service , too , is to a very great extent engaged in attending to purely business matters . Less than one case in a hundred has anything whatever to do with international politics . A separate diplomatic service may cost Norway a few more dollars than the present system ; but to the Norwegians who advocate it , this question is more than one of dollars and cents . It is one of national honor . They feel that Norway , not only on account of her past history , but also by virtue of her achievements in the forefront of modern civilization , is entitled to stand worthily by the side of Sweden . A word to show that Norway 's political aspirations are not out of tune with the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geist in a recent article on Sweden and Norway , after having indicated the desirability of an alliance between Sweden , Denmark and Norway as a necessary condition for peace and international progress , says : * But to that end it is necessary that each of these peoples shall have self-government ; for even if all three , in view of their origin , may be called Scandinavian , each of them constitutes a separate nationality . For this reason the satisfaction of that demand now made by the Norwegians , will promote harmony among the Scandinavians , instead of retarding it . Every nation that serves human progress serves itself . And the nation which in this period of economic reaction , has clung to free trade , and which during the present armed peace of Europe , has proposed international arbitration , that nation deserves not only // complete domestic freedom , but also an intellectual and moral hegemony over people that are not so competent to govern themselves , or so willing to serve and promote modern culture . For this reason I believe that the Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deserves not only unanimous approval in their native land , but also active support from the liberal opinion of Europe . " Castelar , be it remembered , has himself been a minister for foreign affairs , and yet finds Norway 's demand a reasonable one . One word more to see whether Norway , in demanding absolute individual freedom , is running counter to the general tendency of the times . What is that tendency ! Its trend has been differently read and interpreted . Franz von Holtzendorff7 , a high authority on jurisprudence , has put the generally accepted opinion into these words : " In recent centuries there has been an unmistakable tendency toward the formation of great states at the expense of smaller ones . ' ' Now is this generalization a satisfactory one ? Does it not apply better to the eighteenth century than to the nineteenth ? Has there not in this century , been a stronger tendency toward separation than toward consolidation ? During the last hundred years , going back a little into the eighteenth century , three great states have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Germany , while more than a score of minor powers have established themselves on the American continent and in Europe , - the six European ones being Norway , Belgium , Greece , Roumania , Servia , and Bulgaria , all of them , too , in the teeth of dangerous opposition . Others have not succeeded . Moreover , in the words of Dr. Sigurd Ibsen , a trained diplomat who had given this question careful attention , " It is an indisputable fact that at present there is not a single small state in which the popular sentiment favors a closer constitutional connection with one or several other states . " Now is not the same active principle , the same inner cause , to be traced in both of these phenomena of consolidation and separation , namely " an inborn desire in the hearts of men to be grouped according to national individuality ? " It was this principle of nationality that the Holy Alliance fought against - even in little Norway . And England has striven to down this national feeling within her borders . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily to subdue it . The ideal of the ruling class in England then was " that all portions of the British Islands should be reduced to a dead level of institutions , law , and order under their own rule . " To-day England has not only an Irish question , but the startling phenomena of a Welsh question , to which Parliament will doubtless soon be obliged to give serious attention . This view of a tendency toward individualism is most emphatically asserted in a recent work entitled " General View of the Political History of Europe " by Ernest Lavisse , professor at the Sorbonne . He says : " The immense development of commercial intercourse , the hundredfold increase of ways and means of communication , the medley of financial interests in the exchanges of Paris , London , and Berlin , constitute one of the phenomena of our time ; but national individualism is another , of an entirely opposite nature . Nations have become more estranged from one another , in proportion to the growth of international interests . The long evolution begun with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sentiments , ideas and customs , is in our day being completed ; national individualism is now an accomplished fact . Where individualism is of ethnographical substance it displays its irreconcilable spirit in a nilive way . Hungary is thrown into a violent passion because a flag is placed where it has no right to be . Nowhere is the Tsech willing to hear the German language , neither in the school , nor in the church , nor in the court of law . To be absorbed in one 's self , to contemplate and love one 's self , and when one is proud of one 's birth , to admire one 's selfthat is the psychological condition of a modern people . " Does not this coat fit Norway ? She has been following the promptings of this instinct of national individualism , and will not be checked by the doubtful economic advantages of a closer union with Sweden . Imbued with this spirit she has fought a prolonged strife with a kindred country , and until this spirit is recognized , it will be impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness that exalteth a nation . "
