txt " Do you decline to answer the questions because you are afraid of incriminating yourself ? " asked Attorney McCarthy . as he arose.and faced President Barber of the Diamond Match Company at the annual meeting of the stockholders of that organization this morning . This question symbolized the tone of the meeting It was the most sensational meeting in the history of Western corporations . An hour before the meeting was called there were rumors in the street that the officials of the Diamond Match Company purposed excluding the representatives of the press . No intimation of this had been given until an hour before the time set for the yearly gathering of the shareholders . This action was wholly unexpected , and for about forty-five minutes a score of reporters were busy among brokers endeavoring to secure proxies . Some of the newspaper men succeeded in procuring the valuable slip of paper that admitted them to the Secretary 's apartment on the fifth floor of the Pullman Building . Half an hour before the meeting was called to order by Mr. Barber the room selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directly in front of the Chairman 's seat was an interesting group , consisting of well-known New Yorkers , representing the Gould interests . The presence of these gentlemen was ominous to those who have followed the history of the Diamond Match Company . Four of the men were Baclay E. V. McCarty , Jared G. Baldwin , Jr. , George Erbelding , and H. D. Estabrook . Near them was J. H. Waggon= er , a former partner In the firm of M. M. Jamieson &; Co. , and now an active Wall Street man . These gentlemen were supplied with proxies , and it was evident to the initiated that they were preparing to give the officers of the Diamond Match Company an uncomfortable quarter of an hour . Ten minutes before the meeting was declared in session , President Barber stepped out of his office and entered the spacious quarter prepared for the convention of the security holders . He gave a quick , nervous glance at the Easterners , who looked calm , but very formidable . It was rather dark in. that part of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match concern . Ir . Barber noticed this , and , in order to obtain light , he lifted the curtains that shielded-the eastern window . A rather glaring refulgence was the re-suit . . The sunlight struck the visages of the New Yorkers somewhat unexpectedly . " Mr. Barber , please do n't do that , " said Lawyer McCarty , " you throw the sunlight in my eyes . " " Well , I ca n't help it , " said Barber , " my eyes are weak , and I want light . " " I think you have already thrown enough light in my eyes , " said the New York counsel , significantly . Mr. Barber flushed indignantly at the thrust , and was about to retort , when he . was called by Secretary Kranz , who , a second later , surveyed the crowd before him critically . There were present persons from ail parts of the United States  --  from New York , from Louisiana , from - Minnesota , and from California . Though the local stock market was unwontedly active , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . " Gentlemen , " said Mr. Barber , in a somewhat tremulous voice , " the meeting of the stockholders of the Diamond Match Company is now called to order . What have you to suggest ? " " I move that Mr. Walker be appointed Chairman of this meeting , " said Attorney Braid . Trouble over Organization . Mr. - McCarty was on his feet instantly . " I object , " he shouted . " I ? " " There is a motion before the house to nominate Edwin Walker Chairman of this meeting , " interrupted the President of the Diamond Match Company . " Is the motion seconded ? " The motion was immediately seconded by a half dozen shareholders . Mr. Barber 's rigidity angered the New Yorkers . They all arose and protested vociferously . " I want to know , as a stockholder , whether or not I ant to be accorded a hearing at this meeting ? " demanded Mr. McCarty . " You 'll be accorded a hearing when you are in order . All your objections will be recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected Chairman . Then came another squall when H. C. Kranz was placed in nomination for Secretary of the meeting . " Mr. Chairman , I protest again and again , " cried Mr. McCarty . " These men must not be voted for viva voce , but by stockholders according to their holdings . " You mean , " said the venerable Chairman , " that you think they should be voted for that way , not that they must be . " A shower of applause followed this reprimand . " All those in favor of Mr. Kranz will please say ' Aye . ' " The room rang with the affirmative response . " Those who are opposed to Mr. Kranz will signify their objections by saying ' No . ' " For a moment there was a thick silence . The Chairman quickly suggested that tellers be named . " No , no , " shouted the New Yorkers . This " No " was against Secretary Evans . " You are too late , gentlemen . " rejoined Mr. Walker . This stung Mr. McCarty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly highhanded and utterly devoid of legality . This room is filled with men , and it is not unlikely that many of them are not stockholders . These standing votes are illegal . I say it is a case of brutal outlawry . " Mr. Walker remained silent for a moment , then arose slowly and in a tone that betrayed suppressed anger said : " I am sorry that I can not agree with my distinguished confrere from New York . His objections will go on record , and if he wishes redress he may seek it , but his objections and protests are now overruled . Mr. ? Barber , ( turning to the President of the Diamond Match Contany , ) you may read your report . " President Barber 's Report . Mr. Barber read slowly . After a short in- troduction , he said that when it was remembered that ' 70,000,000 people in this country use matches , the amount earned by the company looked small . He then told of amicable relations ' with customers , and the admirable condition of the factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills payable from $856,666.95 in August to less than $300,000 at the present time . " We have in the Ontonagole River 125,000 feet of pine in shape of logs . We think we have an available asset in these logs of about $1,250,000 , which will be turned into money as rapidly as the Directors may deem best . We have overturns for the purchase of these logs which can not be acted on by the incoming board . " Notwithstanding the mishaps that the company has had in the last year it has been able to pay its usual 10 per cent . cash dividend , and in my opinion will continue to do so out of its earnings . " The Annual Statement . Mr. Walker then submitted the annual statement , which is as follows : ASSETS Real estate , factories , machinery , tools , teams , furniture , fixtures , &c.; Matches , , Lumber Pine stumpage Logs Miscellaneous merchandise and raw material Miscellaneous investments W.

The putting of the Moore debt of $798 , - 76 ; .17 in the assets created consternation . Some one in the rear of the room shouted : " I move that the report be accepted . " This appeared to be Mr. McCarty 's opportunity . He jumped to his feet , and , glaring at Mr. Barber , asked : " What is the Moore asset ? " " There is a motion before the house , " interposed the Chairman . " Is it secondea ? " Several seconded the motion . " Mr. Chairman , " cried McCarty , " I want to know what this Moore asset of nearly $1,000,000 means . " " Well , if you must know , that item represents the indebtedness of the Moores to the company . " " Oh , indeed ! Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the Moores write you a. letter requesting your permission to use the funds of the company with which to purchase Diamond Match on margins ? " The President did not reply . Mr. McCarty then asked : ' Do you decline to answer for fear of incriminating your-self ? " Chairman AWalker said : " The gentleman ' is out of order . There is a. question before the house ? " A man jumped upon a chair , and , saying he was a stockholder , demanded to know what had been done with the company 's money . Mr. Walker looked at him in a fatherly way and said : " I believe I recognize the voice of Mr. Louis Lombard of New York . He is the benevolent gentleman who wished to secure all stockholders against loss , provided they were willing to part with their holdings at a certain price . " " Will Mr. Barber answer my question ? " repeated McCarty . The Chairman  --  Your question is out of order and impertinent. - The report was then accepted . The dissenting voices came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Braid nominated for Directors 0 . C. Barber , J. K. Robinson , George T. Smith , George H. Webster , and Clarence Buckingham . This selection was immediately seconded by several members of the Stock Exchange . One of the New Yorkers thereupon placed these gentlemen in nomination : J. H. Waggoner , George Erbelding , H. D.
