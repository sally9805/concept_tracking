txt It is reported to be the belief of President Mc1CmILEx that when he puts his name to the Tariff bill the country will enter on at least ten years of repose from further legislation and even from effective agitation of that subject . This may well be . If Mr. MCKINLEY is re-elected , as he no doubt expects to be , no reform of the tariff will be possible before 1906 , and no agitation for reform in the face of his veto power is likely seriously to affect business calculations . Much will depend on the condition of business . If the progress . which has begun continues , it will be in despite of the tariff , not because of it , but it will nevertheless quiet opposition . Then consider what is possible in the way of opposition . The Republicans , if turned out , must be replaced What party will the country within the next three years ' accept in their place ? Three years is a period that admits of many changes . These may include the rallying of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by the Indianapolis Democratic Party . Undoubtedly that would be a great and lasting advance in rational and honest politics . He would 2 be a bald man who should say , on the face of the situation as it is , that such a change is likely . Three things we may fairly count on with reasonable certainty for four years , possibly for eight : The tariff will be made no worse . The currency will be made no worse . Whatever change takes place in either will be for the better . On this assurance every man may go to work with energy , courage , and confidence .
