txt British history repeats itself in the Benin massacre . The familiar procedures by which the blessings of civilization have been conferred upon so many other barbaric communities are here . repeated . A blackamoor monarch sits in his capital enjoying himself in his own way . He sacrifices a few prominent citizens if the weather is too cold . If it is too hot , he sacrifices twice as many . The bones of his Court favorites and other subjects whom he has eaten are scattered about the place . Human sacrifice and cannibalism are practices sanctified to him by ancestral usage , like his policy of discouraging trespass by killing all white men who approached his city . To this surly King a peaceable British expedition was sent out from Bonny , in the Niger Coast Protectorate , to ask that he remove the obstacles he puts in the way of trade with the interior . The King 's men fell upon the expedition and killed ? all but two of the Englishmen and seven of the natives . Now a British column will be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new territory will be added to her Majesty 's dominions . Undoubtedly British commercial administration will be better for the Benin country than the bloody sway it will displace , though the ravages of plague and famine both at once in her Indian Empire prove that she is not able to bestow all the benefits of civilization upon her colonial subjects . But the Benin affair was a criminal blunder , by which many valuable lives were sacrificed . Either the King should have been left unmolested or an armed force strong enough to thrash him should have been sent in the first instance . Peaceful expeditions are out of place in dealing with a savage of his temper .
