txt Mr. George W. Childs died at an early hour this morning . His illness began with vertigo , which was followed by right-sided paralysis . He had , however , regained power in the parts affected , and was thought to be improving up to a short time before his death . The world Will always remember George W. Childs best as the open-handed , kindhearted philanthropist . His business success was tremendous . From a poor , obscure boy he worked himself up until he was ranked among the great millionaires of the country , and this , too , in spite of the fact that he began early in life to give r of his means in the most prodigial manner . His unusual attainments and striking personality made him one of- the conspicuous public men of the country . From the very beginning of his career as the proprietor and editor of . The Philadelphia Public Ledger his eminence as a journalist became manifest . Gov . Hoffman of this State . speaking of him many years ago , said : " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberty of the press and the license of the press . He deals boldly with public matters , and with public men in connection with them ; but he is always careful to recollect that private character is private property , owned by that most sacred of all circles , the family circle , and that the man who needlessly assails it is as much a criminal as if he robbed the household of its dearest treasures or plucked from it , for his own base uses , its fairest flower . He understands , what I wish all editors in America understood , not only the power of the press , but its proper uses , and its great mission , and by his daily conduct and life declares his opinion that the man who George W. Childs . owns a printing press and can use a pen has no more right to indite libels and stab private reputation than the owner of a uniform and a sword has to cut and kill to please his fancies or to gratify his malice . " In all walks of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model , and his name will long be taken as the synonym of the highest type of manhood ; but after all is said of him in other directions his biographers will always mark his philanthropic disposition as the greatest characteristic of the man . His charities were world-wide almost , and his name as a public-spirited benefactor is about as well known in Europe as it is art home . And the great and shining beauty of his liberality to others lay in the fact that it was so unostentatious . Of the kind deeds he performed nor the tenth nor the twentieth were ever known . He gave with a freedom . that more conservative men spoke of as " reckless , " and the only condition of his giving was that the recipient should say nothing about the matter . " I have plenty , " he would protest , " plenty . You need It , and I do n't . Now , there is a good fellow , take it and do n't say another word . Do n't mention it to any one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of men owed to him their relief from painful situations . His benevolence began at home , among his own employes , and radiated to ever4 part of the country . To the persons engaged in newspaper work as writers and printers and in kindred employments , he was particularly kind and considerate . He insured the life of every editor , reporter , clerk , and head of department in his employ , allowed them proper vacations , and paid their salaries while away . He provided them with doctors and medicines when sick , and in every ether way looked after their welfare and their comfort . No needy newspaper man ever applied to him in vain for assistance , and the list of his charities of this character , if published , would fill a book . Several years ago he presented the Philadelphia Typographical Society with a large burial plot in Woodland , which is known as " The Printer 's Cemetery . " At the dedication of this plot Judge Lewis , among other things , said : " Mr. Childs has planted himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundations of his monument upon human benevolence . Its superstructure is composed of good and noble deeds . Its spire is the love of God which ascends to heaven . " The money which Mr. Childs spent on others so lavishly was earned by a life of hard work . He was born in Baltimore . May 12 , 1829 . In his twelfth year he began as a wage earner by taking a place in a book store in Baltimore at $2 per week . In this way he employed his vacation from school , and from his own account he well earned the money that was paid him . In the following year he entered the service of the nayy , remaining fifteen months at Norfolk . This life did not suit him , and he went to Philadelphia , where he got work in a book store . So well did he build his reputation that at the age of twenty-one a partnership was offered to him in the publishing house of R. E. Peterson &; Co. , which he accepted , the firm name being changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to each other , and their business increased rapidly . Mr. Peterson compiled a work from numerous sources , entitled " Familiar Science , " in which much valuable information was interestingly set forth . Mr. Childs pushed the sale of the book to 200,000 copies , and had it placed on the list of studies in many of the schools . It had been his ambition from boyhood to own The Public Ledger . This chance at last came to him in 1863 . The Ledger at that time was a losing property . White paper had increased in price at . that the cost of publishing a penny newspaper was larger than it could be sold for . When Mr. Childs first knew that newspaper it enjoyed great popularity . It appealed to public favor because it was cheap and because it often advocated with persistence and skill the popular side of important questions . At times it excited a good deal of opposition among the unruly , but all its losses in that respect were more than offset by friendships which it gained and cemented thereby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Copperhead policy . This was an offense in loyal Philadelphia , hardly to be forgiven even in a family breakfast companion . The publishers lost heavily by it . They were also reluctant to advance the price , for fear that the Philadelphia public which had been paying only a penny for its newspaper , would desert it . Both labor and material having doubled in price . the publishers found themselves losing money daily . It was estimated that each issue cost $480 more than was received for it , and the annual loss was figured at $150,000 . This rate of loss discouraged the publishers , and Mr. Childs was not long in learning that they were anxious to dispose of the property . Upon consulting his friends in regard to its purchase , Mr. Childs was advised to let it alone . The ownership of the paper , however , lay too near his heart to be thrown aside when he had the chance to acquire it , and in December , 1864. he bought the property , paying for it , it was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the property on its feet , he induced his lifelong friend , Anthony J. Drexel , to assist him , for a share in the enterprise . His belief was that The Ledger was too well intrenched in the affections of the Philadelphia public to suffer materially if it were managed on a basis that would allow a fair profit . The first thing he did was to swing the paper editorially into the loyal line . This appeal to public favor proved effective . Then , again , despite the protests of his friends , he doubled the price and increased the advertising rates . Of course such a change was felt at first . but the justice of what he had done appealed to the public , and , as many families regarded the paper as a necessity , his readers soon returned , and along with them came new ones . In a short time the paper was established on a paying basis . Mr. Childs gave personal supervision to all the departments of his property . Nothing , from the pressroom to the composing room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was his firm intention to elevate the tone of the paper , and he made a rule that no advertisement having the slightest taint should appear in his columns . This rule lost the paper a business that had been paying it about $15,000 per year , but , on the other hand , it spurred the ingenuity of Mr. Childs to devise advertisements for the people which were read almost as eagerly as news . These advertisements included Wants , boarding , for sale and to let notices , notices of meetings of secret societies , and religious announcements . While exercising careful supervision of the advertising columns , Mr. Childs did not neglect the news and editorial departments . His rule in regard to reading matter in the paper was that nothing should appear to wound needlessly the feelings of any person , and that all attempts at sensation should be carefully avoided . The effect of his management was seen in constantly-increasing business and circulation . The building at Third and Chesnut Streets became too small - for the paper , and in 1866 the property at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built what at that time was considered the finest newspaper office in the country . Interesting ceremonies opened the new building , and in them some of the most prominent men in the country participated . His income from The Ledger from the time that it became entirely established has been estimated at from $400,000 to $500 , - 000 per year . Mrs. Childs is a granddaughter of Judge John Bouvier , a distinguished jurist who was born In Codogno , Italy , in 1787 . His family , all of whom were Quakers , settled in Philadelphia in 1802 . He published , in 1814. a newspaper called The American Telegraph . Soon after he began the study of law , and in 1818 was admitted to the bar in Unionville , Penn . Until 1820 he published The Genius of Liberty and the American Telegraph . Three years later he began the active practice of his profession in Philadelphia . He acquired a well-deserved reputation as a lawyer of deep learning and integrity , and in 1836 was chosen Recorder of Philadelphia . In 1838 he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published " A Law Dictionary Adapted to the Laws and Constitution of the United States , " ( 2 vols. , Philadelphia , 1839. 15th edition , revised 1886 . ) On this work he expended great research and labor , and it was highly commended by Chief Justice Story , Judge Greenleaf , and others of acknowledged standing . In 1841 he began a new edition of Bacon 's " Abridgment of the Law , " in the octavo volumes , and this laborious task he completed in four years . Two months before his death he published his greatest work , the " Institutes of American Law . " This was published in Philadelphia . in 1851 , and a new edition , in two volumes , by D. A. Gleason , was issued in 1870 . Mrs. Childs 's mother was the wife of Charles J. Peterson . the publisher of Peterson 's Magazine . She possessed stronglymarked literary tastes , and wrote several treatises on astronomy , which were praised even by such great astronomers as Sir John Herschel and Lord Rosse.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
