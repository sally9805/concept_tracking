txt It seems here to-night , from investigations made by several prominent Chattanooga attorneys , that Gov . Buchanan has made a Pad break in ordering out the militia to quell the miners ' riot at Briceville . Whether the Tennessee militia or the Coal Creek miners are a mob is a fine legal question . At the same time the Governor makes himself liable to indictment for treason for declaring Tennessee - in a state of rebellion on account of a few lawless miners . It seems certain , from the authorities on the subject , that if any soldier at Coal Creek kills a miner he is a legal murderer and must answer to the charge . Article III. , Section 5 of the Tennessee Constitution , adopted in 1870 , says the militia shall not be called into servloe except in case of rebellion or invasion , and then only when the General Assembly shall declare by law that the public safety requires it . The adoption of this was caused by Tennessee 's experience under the famous Gov . Brownlow . The State code of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws are still in force as there has been no repealing clause as far as is known here . Furthermore , the General Appropriation bill , Chapter 129 , act of 1891 , passed March 30 , which is the only appropriation bill passed , makes no provision for calling out the militia and for paying its expense . There is groat indignation here to-night among parents , relatives , and friends of the two Chattanooga companies at Briceville , because the handful of boys would stand little show against several hundred equally well armed miners . The soldiers have no blankets and little food , as the Governor made no preparations for their comfort .
