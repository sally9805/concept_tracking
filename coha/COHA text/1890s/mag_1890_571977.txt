ARTICLE 11. - HOW IT HAS COME ABOUT THAT THE AMERICAN FARMERS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE OF NEW ENGLAND ARE TREATED WITH DISRESPECT BY THE WRITERS IN OUR NEWSPAPERS . THE " decline " of farming in New England has been discussed in the public press from three points of view-the economic , the political , and the social . In the last number of the NEW ENGLANDER AND YALE IREVIEW , I considered the economical aspect , and showed that there is not a decline in actual production , although there is unquestionably great depression . I showed that this depression was not more severe in New England than elsewhere , and was not a local phenomenon , but part of that great agricultural depression that now prevails throughout Christendom . I should have added that the depression in the East has probably reached its lowest limit . The public lands of the West have now been given away , and good homesteads can no longer be supplied gratuitously to unlimited emigration , and no portion of the older States will feel the reaction more quickly or more surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been obviously a great change in the rural population as compared with that of cities , due largely to the migration of the country professional men , merchants , and mechanics to the towns , reducing the density of the population in the rural districts and making it more purely agricultural . Coincident with this change in the composition of the rural population , there has been a more rapid growth of social refinement , of business methods , and of intellectual cnlture in cities than in the country . This change in the relative progress of city and rural communities has bcen discussed by the city press as if it was an actual decline in the social status and the intellectual activity of New England farmers as a class , rather than a local phase of that widespread change in the relative progress of city and country communities . The country obviously has not kept up with the cities in these matters , and New England and the Middle States // are probably snffering more in this respect than any other region of the earth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil are steadily rising in the social scale , and are as a whole relatively progressing faster than the city populations . In the region embracing New England and the Middle States , the reverse is tine , and the cities have progressed in culture and political influence very much faster than the country , and this difference of progress looks like a decline in the condition of the farmers . This relative or apparent decline has been greatest in New England , where it has been made much more prominent by being worked up by newspaper writers having pet political theories to advocate or religions prejudices to gratify . The same relative decline has taken place in the Middle States , more particularly in their older and eastern portions , but has not been so zealously written np . The widespread misapprehension in the popular mind as to the nature of this decline , to which we propose to call attention , is owing largely to the fact that during the last few years there has been a great change among the writers in the city newspapers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conntry population in general and towards farmers in particular . So it has come to be regarded by a large and increasing number of city people that farmers constitute a " class ; " and more than that , a socially and intellectually inferior class . Several causes have contributed to this result , which will be very differently rated as to their relative value according to the education , the place of birth , the wealth , and vocation of the observer . Some of the causes are economic , some political , some grow out of the new methods of acquiring wealth , some from a changed sentiment incident to popular education in our city schools , but I believe the greatest to be the enormous increase in our foreign population within the last thirty or forty years . Some millions of emigrants from western Europe have conic amongst us , bringing with them the sentiments and social prejudices prevailing in the Old World in respect to the tillers of the soil . // The economic factors in the alleged " decline " have been in part discnssed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' incomes have greatly decreased relatively to the incomes in most other kinds of business requiring capital , skill , and ability . As matters were , down to within a few years ago , there were no very rich people in the United States , and a relatively smaller proportion than now were living entirely upon their daily or monthly wages . The middle class , considered in respect to wealth , was vastly greater than in any other conntry , and along with this a relatively greater nniformity in the means of indulging in luxury and display . Therefore , the conditions depending purely upon wealth and upon income were vastly more uniform during the whole previous history of our conntry than during the last twenty-five years . Under the stimulus of steam transportation and the enormous broadening of commerce , new lands have been opened np , new methods of cultivation devised , science has introduced new means of fertilization of the soil , and invention of new methods of harvesting and preparing the crops for market , until the old conditions of competition have been entirely changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population has . Hence , although the number of persons to be fed has increased , and people as a whole are better fed , yet the price of agricultural products has greatly fallen , and the relative values of farm land as contrasted with other working capital have also fallen . The economic aspects of the vocation have changed , both as regards the capital employed , the crops produced , and the prices obtained . The capital that was employed in farming twenty-five years ago has not increased as other capital has . Profits have decreased , and that means decreased incomes to farmers , while the incomes of mechanics , and " working men " have doubled or trebled , and men in other vocations have been growing richer . This is an unfortunate condition in its social bearings , in this country , where business success is rated so high as a social factor . The man who makes money rises in the social scale . If he becomes very rich then he is great , and his views on any subject are // of more importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sounder , and he is perhaps made a Senator . Farmers have certainly not made much money of late , and this alone is enough to bring upon them a sort of suspicion of inferiority , of lack of business enterprise , and with their smaller income their relative social importance has doclined greatly in the eyes of the cheaper writers for the public press . The pecuniary distress incident to the economic factors is greater in Old England than in New England , but in that country there is no alleged corresponding decline going on in the social status of farmers . Political causes and social sentiments have , however , a greater importance in a Republic like ours . The political fa* .. tors are now receiving sufficient attention ; whether wisely directed or not the future will tell . That legislation has been directed in such a way as to make agriculture in New England less attractive to young men of good breeding and ability , and manufactures and trade relatively more attractive , there can be no question whatever . The actual force of this factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerted by zealous political writers with hobbies to ride . But while the political factors have received , perhaps , too much attention , the social factors are receiving too little . In fact , the greatest danger to our political institutions may be apprehended from the change in the city sentiment towards farmers which foreign emigration has so promoted . To understand the growing change in sentiment in this matter , it may be well to glance at some of the elementary historical facts regarding the social status of farmers in those countries from which we derive our culture and our blood . In ancient Greece , Rome , and Palestine agriculture was honored , theoretically at least , and no social disgrace was prominently attached to the tiller of the soil as distinguished from other workingmen . Then , as now , wealth had its advantages and brought its luxuries . Doubtless some of the wealthier inhabitants of cities looked upon those of the country as of inferior social rank , but if this feeling existed it was not prominent , and agriculture , theoretically at least , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central and Western Europe . Whatever may have been the status of the tiller of the soil before , feudalism put him at the bottom of the social structure , and kept him there so long as it prevailed . Under this oppressive system , those who actually tilled the soil belonged to an especially oppressed class . Feudalism shaped agriculture all over Western and Northern Europe , and there this conservative vocation still preserves within itself the history of by-gone social sentiments , even where the legal restraints have totally and entirely passed away . It was a maxim down to the last century that " between the lord and his tenants there is no judge but God . " It is a great social law that any class which is long unjustly oppressed becomes socially and morally low . In those long centuries of oppression and wrong , the land belonged to a privileged class , and those who actually tilled it were at the bottom of the social scale . They could own r*o land , and were either tenants at will or serfs , and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant could not hold or enjoy the fruits of his labor as a right , and when the legal restraints were removed the social customs and class traditions remained . As feudalism gradually passed away and some of the land came to be owned by untitled men its ownership still continued to have a social value , and the land lord long held political rights denied the tenant . As a consequence , there is not a country in Europe to-day , where the farmer is socially respected in the sense in which he has hitherto been respected in this country . The vocation was so degraded and the class so demoralized by centuries of political and social oppression that it produced a relatively greater proportion of ciime and pauperism than even the lower classes of the cities , until well into the present century . Many words in our language indicate the social opprobrium which was once attached to the vocation of the farmer-churl , villein , peasant , incivility , and various other words tell us of the contempt in which people of the country in general and farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . Consequently , everywhere in Europe the inhabitants of cities consider farmers as belonging to a lower social // class , and that is one of the causes which have sent so many thrifty peasants to this country . The settlers of the original thirteen colonies , and most of the emigrants during the first half century of the Republic , came chiefly from the middle classes of the various countries of northwestern Europe . Physically they belonged to the same race ; politically and socially , they represented neither the aristocracy above nor the dependent laborers beneath . They belonged to the thrifty class , which included the better artisans , tradesmen , farmers , and mechanics , a hardy , strong , independent , industrious class of men . The religious element , which was everywhere a factor in the settlement of the original colonies , tended to bring here men with noble aims and of especially high moral character . The political , as well as the religious influences , which sent them here aided in inciting habits of intellectual activity . By a kind of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emigrate , made them more uniform in their social position , moral worth , religious faith , industrial habits , and in the hereditary excellence of their families , than were the inhabitants of any other civilized country . It was a selection made from various nationalities , reasonably uniform in race and exceptionally uniform in its high industrial , intellectual , and moral character . It was the foundation of a wonderful breed of men . As the times then were and under the policy which the mother countries then extended to their colonies , there could be no manufactures and but limited commerce . Agriculture became of necessity the chief vocation of the colonists . In planting a new civilization , they abandoned many old things . Feudalism was intimately associated in their minds with the State Churches they had fled from . In all its features , it was odious to them . In this country , the farmers became the owners of the land they tilled . The men who digged in the field were both land owners and laborers and represented the best elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and for the first time in the history of our Christian civilization , the agricnltural laborer was respected in fact as well as in theory . // This was the stock of men who were to work out a great political problem in the New World , and such were the political and social causes which produced ou the farms of the colonies the men who built a new republic and made the rural districts a breeding place for the statesmen who guided it through the first century of its existence , the most troubled century the world has yet seen . The Revolutionary War was waged by farmers , and the Constitution of the Republic established by them . Putnam left his plough in the furrow when he started for Bunker Hill . Washington went from his farm to lead the armies of the struggling colonies ; he was recalled from the farm to be our first President ; and when this service ended , he returned to his farm . The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States were written by a farmer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1789 contrasted with the French Revolution of the same year and its results , is largely owing to the difference between the American farmer and the European peasantry . During our whole colonial period and during the first century of the republic , the great majority of our statesmen came from farms . I once took much pains to look up the history of the childhood of all the Presidents of this Republic . Of a few I could get no information , but at least seventeen out of the twenty-three Presidents of the United States have been born and reared on farms , or their fathers were . Some of the others are not those of whom the nation is most proud . The farmer 's son , Daniel Webster , working on the farm by day and studying the Constitution of the new Republic by the fireside in the little farmhouse ; Abraham Lincoln , in the log cabin pursuing his studies by the light of the fire , are but typical examples of what American farmers have been . This is not the story of a peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new class of farmers , who have spread out over the fertile lands of the West , and who are to a less extent beginning to occupy the farms of the older States . They certainly belong to a lower class socially and intellectually than did our earlier emigration , and by dilution are lowering the standard of rural intelligence . In // some of the Western States persons of foreign birth or parentage constitute a majority of the farming population ; but , in New England , there are fewer foreigners engaged in farming than in any other large business . In New England they have settled more largely in the towns and cities , but they have brought with them the traditions , the prejudices , and social sentiments of the old world regarding the social and intellectual status of the peasantry . They have taken to politics in the cities , and they are abundantly represented , directly or indirectly , in the political newspapers . These newspapers have gradually become more and more imbued with foreign sentiments , and are steadily educating their readers to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing clubs " to educate the farmers. ** For several years I have made a study of the attitude of the political newspapers towards the farmers , considered from the nationality of the controlling spirits among their contributors and prominent writers . That their attitude towards farmers has materially changed no one will dispute who studies this question . It shows itself in many ways ; one of the most suggestive being the increase in the number and the character of the witticisms , so-called , which are aimed at the farmers as a class , the point of which is their stupidity . The farmer is more and more held up to the citizens of our cities as the European peasant is held up to the view of the better classes in European cities . Many years ago a clown in a foreign circus , who had a wide and brilliant reputation , describ*d to me some of the secrets of his calling and commented on the political and social subjects most fruitful for " hits* ' among the audiences before which he had performed . He told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " ouse of Lords , " on the police , would always take with the audiences , but that*it would never do to allude in this way to the Queen . He said that in France the best " hits ' * were at the expense of some conspicuous spendthrift nobleman , some well known actor , or the demi-monde , but ( at that time ) never on the Empire . I asked him if there was any one subject which was sure to raise a laugh in all parts von . xvi . 27 // of Germany ,  --  which was then constituted of many States . He replied , " Oh , yes , we must never joke about the government or the police anywhere in Germany ; but everywhere the stupidity of the peasantry furnishes our best hits . " All at once it dawned upon me as it never had before , what a continual source of humor this was in the German comic papers . The stupidity of the peasantry is the one perennial source from which the professional wits draw when all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other European countries . Hodges of England , Patrick of Ireland , Jacques of France , as well as Michael of Germany , all belong to the country rather than the town . This legacy of the feudal times is now being rapidly transferred to this country . No one can have failed to notice the enormous increase in the number of jokes , " grinds , " and " funny " paragraphs in the daily and comic press of our cities , the only point of whose humor is the greenness , ignorance , and stupidity of the American farmer . The sayings of Farmer Hayseed , of Joshua Greengrass , of Miss Pumpkin , and Mrs. Wayback may be seen daily ; and it takes but a little while to collect a large scrap-book of American jokes , which are thoroughly foreign in their sentiments and in their point . Heretofore the farmers of this country have not constituted a class ; but the foreign writers for our city newspapers are rapidly educating the public into a belief that they are a class , and a peasant class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the organizations which they control with their formidable political power , contribute to the same result . I have watched our illustrated comic papers for several years , the large proportion of whose cuts and cartoons are the work of persons of foreign birth or foreign education . The typical " workingman " is always one of nature 's noblemen in face and feature , the farmer a miserable caricature or Yankeelled peasant . If any one will make a study of this , he will be surprised to find how common this has come to be the case . It extends even to illustrations in papers not intended to be comic , and is even seen where one would least expect to find it . For example , I once called the attention of the editor of a leading illustrated agricultural paper published in one of our largest cities , to the peasant character of the // farmer in his illustrations , both as to the men , their dress , and implements . After he had looked over one volume of the paper and saw his American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suaths , and so on , this citybred man remarked that every dranghtsman on the paper was a German , but that he " had not had his attention called " to that feature of the illustrations , which have since been more carefully watched . The alleged decline in the social status and intellectual culture of the New England farmer is mostly a decline in the education of city bred people . They are being educated by this foreign sentiment , which is steadily trickling through our newspapers . This has been lately so steadily and extensively served out to them that many , particularly the younger class , have come to believe that it represents an actual fact . It has already gone so far that ill have heard an eminent city clergyman , who " honored an agricultural convention with his presence " ( that was the very term used by the city press ) in a neat little speech at the close of the proceedings , most patronizingly compliment the farmers on the excellence of the English they spoke , and he intimated that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their rhetoric as good as if they lived in the cities and had not come from the farms . And this was in the State which produced that farmer 's boy , Noah Webster ! This is no fancy sketch . At the very last farmers ' convention I attended in this State , I could not but note the character of the information sent out through the political newspapers as compared with what it would have been had it been a convention of any other kind . A joke got off by one speaker , a criticism on a public officer got off by another , were circulated more extensively than any other items , and one of the largest New York newspapers , which prides itself on its " information for farmers , " had as its representative there a reporter who did not even know that grass grew from seed . This man was expected to educate the many thousands of readers of that popular paper in agricultural matters . Ten or fifteen millions of the present population of the United States are of foreign birth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed more largely in the cities , and what // the city politics have become is a matter palpably notorious . There was a time when it was an honor to represent one 's own city in its councils ; many question if that is true now . In the West , this horde has spread out over the land , and constitutes in large regions the majority of the farmers . Here and in those States of the South where are the poor whites , the nearest representatives of a native peasant class in this country , have been the locations for the wilder political theories of American farmers , and of " granger legislation . " In these districts " The Farmers ' Alliance , " " The Wheel , " and other political organizations are now rising , to the serious concern of those who wish well to our country . All these things taken together have undoubtedly lowered the social status of American farmers as a whole , when compared with what it was formerly , and the farmers of New England have to suffer the double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of the change of sentiment with regard to them going on in the cities . The native New England farmer has not actually declined . The farms of New England and the Middle States as compared with the cities of these States will continue to produce their full quota of men who become eminent in business and in intellectual culture . From New England went the idea of the the establishment of colleges for technical and scientific educa. tion . Mr. Morrell in the Senate , and Amos Brown out of it , were the fathers of that great movement . In the New England States began the Agricultural Experiment Stations , which have now been introduced info every State and Territory , and it is conceded by every one who has looked into the matter , that New England farmers use the applications of science more intelligently as a whole than do the farmers of any other portion of the Union . Regarding the home life of New England farmers , it is comfortable , and even luxurious as compared with that of many of the newer regions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proximity of the larger towns with their schools and various means of culture , are great as compared with the new regions . There is also-we can not but think - a religious factor which has had something to do with the depreciatory accounts // which are being spread abroad about the decline of New England farming . This I will allude to , but do not care to discuss . All the world knows that New England was settled by English Puritans . The men who have since come to our shores from other countries know little of our early history , neither do they appreciate the true perspective of history . In the light of the nineteenth century , they look upon the Puritans as a narrow , illiberal sect , forgetting that they were the men of progress of their day . In many of our newspapers allusions to the so-called illiberality of the Puritans have been so long made , that even descendants of the Puritans are to be found who suppose that their ancestors were more illiberal than the churches which drove them out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to witchcraft in Salem in 1692 has been made so much of , that there are multitudes of people-particularly the young-who to-day honestly believe that its manifestations were worse in New England than in the various countries of Europe . The truth is that these delusions pervaded the whole Christian Church , and trials for witchcraft continued in England threequarters of a century after the trials in New England ceased . All that was done here was as nothing compared with what was done in every country of Europe . Modern liberals have derived a rich store of comfort from the failings and " hard doctrines " of the men who laid the foundations of this nation . All this has contributed a certain piquancy to the discussions connected with the decline of the rural districts of New England . But surely a decline in the importance now attached to certain things in Puritanism which are not essential does not involve a decline in agriculture , although we have been sometimes tempted to infer from much that has been published on this subject that there are writers who really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , that New England farming is not on a decline as compared with agriculture in other portions of the United States . Its prospects are to-day as bright , and its future as hopeful as in the regions having the more favored soil of the West .
