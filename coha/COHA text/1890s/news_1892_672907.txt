txt Senator DAVID B. HILL is exhibiting violent symptoms of that form of madness with which the gods inspire those whom they would destroy . In the desperate arrogance with which he is trying to exercise the power of a party " boss " at Albany he is surpassing his own remarkable record . His proper place is in the Senate at Washington , whither he was sent by last year 's Legislature to represent the interests of the State of New-York . Ho showed a contempt for common decency in holding the office of Governor for ten months after his term in the Senate began , and he left his seat in that body vacant for more than a month after the session of Congtess opened . He used that time in carrying out the infamous scheme for stealing a majority in the State Senate , and afterward secured the elevation of his most subservient and useful tool in the performance to the bench of the Court of Appeals , thus putting a dark stain upon the judiciary of the State . Since he took his oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , and has taken no 11 useful part in any of its proceedings . He showed himself intent only upon selfish political schemes of his own . He tried to bully a committee of the House into making a report favorable to retaining one of his devoted henchmen in the seat to which ho was plainly not entitled . Then he wont off on a trip to the South , the sole object of which was to drum up delegates for himself to the Democratic National Convention . That hunt was a dismal failure and only resulted in exposing to the Southern people his lack of principle and courage and turning them against him . After his return from the South he betook himself to Albany to dictate the course of the investigation of MAYNARD 'S conduct , which has thus far been characterized only by attempts to browbeat members of the Bar Association committee , upon whose report the investigation was directed . Now he is at Albany again , playing the meddler in legislation . He insults Gov . FLOWER by taking possession of the Executive Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing therefrom his behests to his lickspittles in the Senate and Assembly , the liokspittle in chief being the Lieutenant Governor of the State . In a public interviow he has derided Gov . FLOWER for not employing his own former tactics in holding local bills in which Democratic members are interested as clubs to force them to the support of party measures of which they do not approve . He has sneered at those Democratic members who presume to show independence of his machine , and openly declares that he is at Albany to force the Legislature to do something . He assumes to be its master and is determined to run it , while utterly neglecting his own duty in the meantime as a national legislator . It is an amazing exhibition of arrogance which would have put MATT QUAY to the blush in his palmiest days as a Republican " boss " in Pennsylvania . But it was made plain yesterday that at least two Democratic Senators have been driven into rebellion by Senator HILL 'S mischievous meddling and his efforts to extinguish the spi ? it of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His theory of Democracy seems to be , not that the people rule , nor that legislators represent the people , or even that part of the people who make up their own party , but that " bosses " rule and that legislators must do their bidding and have no minds of their own . The break has conic on the Congressional Reapportionment bill , one of the most important measures of the session from a Democratic point of view . A bill was prepared under the advice and direction of Gov . FLOWER which was as nearly fair as a party measure could be expected to be . There was no Democratic opposition to it , and the Republicans had only the mildest and most perfunctory objections to make . It could have been easily passed , and would probably have given the Democrats at least nineteen districts out of thirty-four . But HILL must needs meddle and dictate changes which his spaniel-like menials were ready to adopt . Yesterday Senators BROWN and WALKER , smarting under the lash of Min 's whip , joined With the Republicans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had already helped to pass , and , failing in that , to secure its recall from the Assembly . They acted not so much from disapproval of the measure , though they claimed to have been misled in voting for it , as from resentment of Midis meddling , and of his aspersions of their motives in showing independence in other matters . There are other Senators who secretly sympathize with their resentment , and there are Assemblymen who are likely to join in the rebellion if HILL does not leave Albany and attend to his own business . The chafing under his tyranny is becomings painful and will not be long endured if there is any self-respect left in the Democrats at the State capital . Unless he speedily leaves Albany there will be a spread of the revolt and a defiance of his dictation , and the session will end in a general wreck of party measures . HILL 'S rod of iron is broken and his arm is paralyzed . He is showing the desperation of a baffled " boss , " and every blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape from the tyranny he has exercised so long .
