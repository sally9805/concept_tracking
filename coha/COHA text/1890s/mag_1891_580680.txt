RICHARD GRANT WHITE . THE whole life of Richard Grant White was passed in *4ew York . He was born there and he died there , and in all the intervening years his absences from the town were few and brief . He was already a man of fifty-five when , for the first and only time , he crossed the ocean to make a visit of three months to England exclusively* Eight years before , he had defended his right to call himself a Yankee by saying that " for more than two hundred years my f orefathers , on both sides , have been New England men ; and , besides , not one of us , myself included , has ever been across the water . " His knowledge of his own country from personal observation was also unusually limited for an American of any condition . Yet , long as he lived in New York , he never conceived any real affection for the great commercial capital . He was as a stranger in a strange city . New York , as he viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adventurers seeking fortune only ; and out of such material the construction of a tolerable society seemed to him impossible . " Living in New York , " he used to say , after the building of the elevated railways , " is like living in a boiler factory , with rattle and roar above and below . " He had no sympathies in common with its prevailing spirit , and few social ties outside of his immediate family . " I can hardly say that I knew this accomplished man of letters , " wrote Mr. Richard H. Stoddard soon after Mr. White 's death , " though I was acquainted with him for a quarter of a century and upward . " Yet the homes of the two were separated by two streets only . Even Mr. Stedman , who was his next - door neighbor in Tenth Street , might have made the same remark , pleasant as the relations between them were . Mr. George William Curtis and he were literary workers side by side , in their earlier days , but their contact was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as contemporaries in New York , Bryant , Bigelow , Godwin , Greeley , Dana , Bayard Taylor , Willis , Fitz James O'Brien , Edgar Allan Poe , and other men of letters who gave distinction to the period , and nearly all of them of about his own age , and workers with him for newspapers and magazines ; but he was not on terms of intimacy with any one of the number . From first to last he had no intimates among the writers of his day . Until the establishment of the Authors ' Club , a short time before his death , he belonged to none of the associations of his craft . He was not of the company of writers and artists whom Mrs. Botta and the Cary sisters gathered at frequent receptions , and he was unknown to the Bohemian crowd over whom Henry Clapp presided in the beer cellar of Pfaff on Broadway . He lived wholly apart from the ways and the sympathies of the literary class around him . He went to them neither for applause nor for intellectual stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such support , for throughout his life he was strong in his self-reliance , and felt capable of estimating properly his own abilities . He was not subject to moods of self-depreciation , when he craved the encouragement of his fellows , but , with perfect bodily health and thoroughly sound nerves , his intellect moved with the precision and certainty of a well-balanced machine ; as he had need that it should work , for of necessity Mr. White was a laborious man during all his career , and the more so as he disdained to use arts which might have lightened his load . He was keenly sensitive about the dignity of his profession and the conduct // March , becoming a gentleman . He prided himself on never having been an applicant for any place or favor . He would not elbow his way to a superior seat ; for , of all God 's creatures , the being now described as a " hustler " was most odious in his eyes . When , in 1866 , he was applied to for information as to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , edited by the Duyckincks , he responded thus decidedly and even contemptuously : " I particularly desire that , should the authors of the Cyclopiedia have intended to do me the honor of noticing me in their work , they will not do so . I neither claim nor desire a place in American literature , ' so called , and I would rather be omitted . " Of course , this might imply only that , if he were to have a place in literature at all , he wanted it to be a literature not circumscribed by the boundaries of a single country , and limited to a mere branch of the English race ; but the answer exhibits also a carelessness of literary distinction which was more than whimsical . Many years before , at the time when he won his first recognition as a Shakespearean critic , he declared to Dr. Allibone that he would not write a single page to achieve all the reputation of all the Shakespearean critics that ever lived . He received the distinction that was infinitely more grateful to him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the best bred man that America had sent to England within the memory of the present generation ; " and when it was said of him there that he " spoke like an Oxford man , and looked like a guardsman . " He was also pleased with the description of him published at the beginning of his literary career , as " evidently a thoroughbred man of the world . " In other words , he prized more highly recognition of the distinction in himself , in his character and individuality , than any distinction conferred by mere literary reputation . In 1881 , his friend , Mr. Chandler Wayland , of New York , having written to President Arthur suggesting his appointment as a foreign consul , Mr. White made haste to assure Mr. Arthur , with whom he had served in the New York custom house , that he " never was an applicant for anything . " Yet he desired the appointment greatly . Nearly thirty years before , when he was a young man connected with the New York Courier and Enquirer , his delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in praise of his article on Shakespeare in Putnam 's Magazine ; and accordingly he wrote to the editor , begging that " the paper shall never laud me or my doings while I am part of it and above ground . " In 1878 , when the Evening Post included him among those applying to be appointed librarian of the Astor Library , as successor to Mr. Carson Brevoort , he assured the editor that he had " never at any time made application in any quarter for any position whatever , public or private . " Yet that Mr. White was sensible of the practical advantages of professional publicity is shown in his reply to a proposition from Henry J. Raymond that he should come upon the editorial staff of the New York Times , then only recently established . " I should expect , " he said , " that my connection with the Times would be announced and my position acknowledged . I think this right in the case of any person , and particularly in mine , as I have suffered and am still suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the Courier and Enquirer . The public regards me as one whose chief object in life is to write musical reports , puff conjurers , and the like . I need not tell you , " he added , " that I am thus placed in a false and injurious position ; " for he had worked with Raymond on the Courier and Enquirer , and though generally supposed to be confined to musical criticism , was also the author of many // of the most important leading articles on subjects of politics and international relations . At the same time he wrote to General Watson Webb , the proprietor of the Courier and Enquirer , asking that , " at a proper time and in a proper manner , my connection with it shall be acknowledged on just terms . I do not ask for praise of my abilities , I do not wish indorsement of my character , " he explained , " but merely such an announcement as will give the public a correct idea of my position and the nature of my occupation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is of vital importance to me . " He wanted his exact professional standing to be made known to everybody ; for be was not a shy and retiring man , by any means , and he resented then and always afterwards any classification of him with the ordinary run of writers . He had stepped at once into a high place in journalism while yet a very young man , and the anonymity of the newspaper had not altogether swallowed up his individual reputation . Because of that difference of fortune , too , he stood apart from many of the writers about him , for they were still struggling to escape from such submersion . The Bohemian , happy-go-lucky lives so frequent among them he knew nothing about from personal experience . He had been brought up after the straitest and most conventional fashion , and the serious struggle of life had come to him early , with burdens that repressed extravagant tendencies . He had neither convivial tastes nor the easy-going habits favorable to the formation of quick intimacies . Therefore Mr. White was looked upon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conventional man , starched , affected , and supercilious , incapable of other emotion than self-admiration , - vain , conceited , and a coxcomb . This impression was strengthened by the formality of his manners , the precision of his speech , and the sug gestion in the cut of his garments and the character of his utterance that he was an Anglomaniac , who felt himself above his calling and his colleagues . As he was two inches upward of six feet in height , and carried himself with remarkable erectness , he did overtop them physically . Hence some of the bright young fellows of the newspapers took delight in stinging him with little arrows of witticism , to " take him down ; and they found their opportunity in occasional slips into inaccuracy , natural enough in a writer so voluminous and treating of so large a variety of subjects . But the shafts penetrated his thin skin ; for he was a sensitive man withal , and perhaps proportionately to his self-esteem . Why those irreverent youngsters singled him out for annoyance he could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirth and malice , and thereby showed that he was not the self-conscious and affected man they supposed him to be . He was incapable of malice himself , - as incapable as he was of jealousy ; - and though he had a keen sense of humor , as he demonstrated very conspicuously , he never resorted to its use as a cloak for envy and malignity . He could not accuse himself of any lack of courtesy to those with whom he came in contact , for he was always courteous and considerate to the last degree . If he never permitted obtrusive familiarity , neither did he himself fail in showing due regard for others . However much he might hold himself above the mere crowd of money-grubbers , he had a sincere and hearty respect for the men of his own calling , and he was quick to discover their ability , and generous in estimating and acknowledging it ; all the more so because he could never look upon himself as a competitor with anybody or a rival of anybody . The peculiarities of Mr. White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inheritance , though they were intensified by his manner // of life . He had not rubbed them off in the rough friction of the world , but had brought down the formal courtesy and courtliness of the past to a generation which sometimes carries real or affected simplicity of manner to the verge of positive ungraciousness . His carriage and his speech and address were the outward indications of an interior quality ; and hence they were natural to him . In 1821 , at the birth of Grant White ( as he was called in England , and preferred to be called ) , his father was a prosperous though not affluent South Street merchant , and one of the aristocracy of New York commerce in the days before the decay of our American shipping . White was brought up amid surroundings of the strictest conventionality and greatest conservatism . His father was careful in his regard for all the proprieties of life , a rigid Episcopalian of the Low Church school , punctilious in his deportment , fastidious in his dress , tenacious of his dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Episcopal Church was so strong and his standing as a layman so high that he sat in the Diocesan Convention of New York year after year ; and as he was one of the main pillars of the Evangelical party , his house was frequented by clergymen in sympathy with his views . These were the home influences under which White grew up . It was not a household to develop spontaneity of mai*-ner , though it cultivated the graces of courtesy and consideration . The great object of his admiration , in both his youth and maturity , was his grandfather , the Rev. Calvin White , a stiff-necked Connecticut Tory , to whom be bore a striking resemblance in some of his own most marked characteristics . In 1884 , or not long before White died , he wrote a biographical sketch of this remarkable old gentleman , intended for private circulation , but never printed ; and in dedicating it to his two sons , Richard Mansfield White awl Stanford White , he described the paper as a " brief memorial of their great - grandfather , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which I hope they may emulate . " The Rev. Calvin White was a descendant , in the fifth generation , of John White , who came from London to Cambridge , in Massachusetts , in the year 1632 , and founded a family of some distinction in both the Massachusetts and Connecticut colonies . He was born at Middletown , in Connecticut , in 1762 ; and as he lived to the great age of ninety-one years , the span of his life stretched from the period before the Revolution to within a few years of the civil war . Yet during all that time he remained an implacable Tory and a rigid aristocrat , in his boyhood , his youth , and his age . He never voted , and he never performed any act which recognized the lawfulness of the new government except the unavoidable obligation of paying taxes . As late as the year 1850 , when he was driving with some friends in the vicinity of Orange , in New Jersey , and a place through which he was passing was pointed out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution that it was still called Tory Corners , the old man uncovered his head and bowed in reverence . For him the sole sovereign was still the sovereign of England . The sovereignty of the American people was usurpation only , in his eyes , no matter how successful it might have been . The Rev. Calvin White was graduated at Yale in 1786 . He entered the Congregational ministry , but soon passed over to the Episcopal Church . In 1822 he made a further and a final change , and landed in the Church of Rome , whither he was led logically by his devotion to authority . It was an almost unheardof step in the New England of those days , and it astounded his neighbors as much as if he had gone into downright heathen idolatry . But he was not a man to commit his conscience to other // people 's keeping , and he was always straightforward and uncompromising in what@ver he did . He was no more afraid of becoming a Roman Catholic in opposition to the sentiment prevailing about him than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George before the cowboys of the Revolution . Yet he was a studious , refined , and courteous man , who did not obtrude his new faith even on his own family , for they continued to worship in the Episcopal Church . He went over to Roman Catholicism simply through the action of his own mind and his independent considerations of the facts of ecclesiastical history . Though he was a man of sixty years at the time , in the full vigor of his intellect , and the Roman Catholics would have been glad to make much of him , he declined every proposal for his advancement in their ranks . He remained at his Connecticut home ever after he was displaced from the Episcopal ministry , a simple layman . He never weakened in his new faith . He had sacrificed to it his position , his prospects , all his worldly interests , but he would not draw back . Something of the character of this stubborn old Tory is rather amusingly revealed by his experience as rector of Grace Church at Jamaica , on Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been there long he began to complain bitterly of the dilapidation of the rectory . Instead of remedying the evil , the vestry put off the repairs to a more convenient time , and then they proceeded to give utterance to their own complaints . They found fault with him as an uncompanionable man , haughty and exclusive . He " neglects visiting his people in a friendly way , " they said , " and more so in visiting the sick . " As the terms of the settlement were that it should last only " during such time as both parties live in good fellowship and peace , " and because he deemed the criticism of him impertinent , the Rev. Mr. White left Jamaica abruptly . He would endure no offense against his dignity ; " for , " as his grandson says of him , " with great simplicity of character , and a kindness of heart that won the loving respect of all who knew him , he had in a very marked degree one trait which may possibly be out of place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-minded gentleman . " Elsewhere in the same memorial White declares that he had never seen " in any country his equal in the combined simplicity , grace , and courtliness of his manners ; " and the respect he gave to others he demanded from them in return . " Throughout his long career he would have nothing to do with those who treated either him or others without proper respect and consideration . With such persons his intercourse ceased abruptly and at whatever cost . " This description of the grandfather fits equally the grandson ; for in many respects White was his grandfather over again . He was not a Tory , like him , but only because he came at a later and a different period . He was no more in sympathy with the prevailing sentiment of his day than his grandfather had been , and he was no less uncompromising . He did not even vote at elections after he was thirty years of age , though from that time onward the republic passed through the ordeal of the slavery agitation , the civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England descent , both he and his grandfather were far away from New England convictions and influences . They looked more admiringly on England than on their own country ; and they were proud of their English descent rather than of their American citizenship . This does not imply that the younger White was disloyal to the Union , for he proved his hearty loyalty by his " Yankee " letters to the London Spectator during our civil war , and by his enthusiastic devotion to the cause of the Union from first to last . By those letters , as the Spectator said // without exaggeration , after his death , " he did as much as any single man to prevent the cultivated public of this country England from drifting into hopeless error concerning the true issues involved in that momentous controversy . " Yet White 's sympathies were not democratic ; they were altogether aristocratic . He cared no more for the opinion of the majority than his grandfather had cared before him . He preferred to be in the minority , even if it consisted of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from the elder White , whose change of faith was to him incomprehensible . " I can not understand , " he says in his memorial , " how an intelligent ; educated man , capable of discourse of reason , ' can go from Protestantism to the Church of Rome ( a very different matter from a resting in that religion , or any other , into which he has been born , and in which he has been bred ) . " He seems to have agreed with John Van Buren that it is " unbecoming in a gentleman to change either his religion or his politics . " Therefore , when White himself passed into agnosticism , he made no outward break with the Church in which he had been reared . He kept the religion of his fathers as an inheritance of which he was proud , though he had ceased to believe in it . In his early life he conformed strictly to Church usages . While he was still a lad , his family crossed the East River , and took up their residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was also as village-like in the ways and tone of its society as if it had been in the centre of agricultural New England instead of a suburb of bustling New York . The prevailing influences were strongly religious . Not until many years afterwards were there any public amusements in the town . Church-going , little " teas , " a few dances of the most unobjectionable sort , choir-meetings , sewing-circles , and the various gatherings which church ac tivity calls out furnished the staple and substantially the only social relaxations . It was a sober and God-fearing 4 community , very conservative , intelligent , though possibly tinged with Philistinism , Puritanical , with no great wealth , but much comfort and no little self-complacency . The only means of communication with Manhattan Island were the ferries ; slow and inconvenient as compared with those of this day . Hence Brooklyn was totally distinct from New York socially , though its population was made up chiefly of people who spent their days in the activities of the greater town , and their nights only in Brooklyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to church on Sunday , and observe all the proprieties were the prevailing rules of conduct among the good people in whose society White passed the years from youth to early manhood . In the morning he crossed the river to New York to attend Dr. Anthon 's famous grammar school , and , as he grew older , to attend the university in Washington Square , and at night he returned to Brooklyn . Naturally , as he had a taste for music and a good bass voice , he sang in the choir of St. Ann 's Church ; but as he wore his hair long , with the auburn locks falling over his shoulders , and was looked upon as a genius by the simple community , the steady-going Brooklyn people were a little shy of his eccentricity and doubtful of his future . His father 's severe notions as to the gravity of life were shocked by the boy 's devotion to music . Singing in the choir of St. Ann 's was proper enough , in the paternal opinion ; but when his son went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumental performer , and even essayed musical composition , he was much troubled in spirit . At that time , and not in Brooklyn only , by any means , a fiddler was regarded as a trifling sort of fellow , of unmanly tastes and useless for serious affairs ; . and young White was a fiidler . His father was // the more distressed because his ambition for his son was that he should become a clergyman , and these tastes seemed to him worldly , unprofitable , and unbefitting the dignity of a youth destined for the holy profession . Young White was obstinate in following out his natural tendency . He clung to his music with increasing persistency ; his friendships were based on harmony of tastes with reference to it , and he found his most delightful association and occupation in an amateur string quartette in Brooklyn , which he joined when he was a college lad . The first violin of this quartette was Mr. M. H. Meyer , the father of Mrs. Jeannette Meyer Thurber ( who has won so much deserved distinction by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American music ) ; the second violin was a brother of Bishop Cleveland Coxe ; a Mr. Rankin played the violoncello , and Mr. White the viola , or tenor . It was a very earnest company , and a very rare one of its kind , at that period especially . These enthusiasts undertook the interpretation of a high class of musical compositions . White also studied the art and science of music with a thoroughness unusual for an American of his day and for a youth of his years ; and he acquired a certain facility as a composer himself . Some of these early compositions of his still remain ( a circumstance that shows the interest he retained in them , for he was remarkably careless about preserving his writings ) ; but the great bulk of them were destroyed by him when his critical ability became keener and his taste more fastidious . Mr. Meyer speaks of him as having been a player of much promise , in those early days , - patient , cheerful , earnest , and untiring . He describes him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his careful regard for the feelings of others , - qualities which are sorely tried by the experiences of an amateur quartette . This is the tribute to him of his musical friends geiierally . Among them he had his closest intimacies , so far as he had any intimacies at all , and to them he revealed himself as very different from the man he was supposed to be even by most of the people who thought they knew him well . He was unusually susceptible to beauty in woman or in art , and his delight in it was almost boyish in the enthusiasm of its manifestations . Underneath his external formality was a charming n&amp;ivet6 , which remained to the very last , but which he exhibited only to those to whom he was drawn by congeniality of tastes or temperament . He was quickly interested in people , or was utterly indifferent to them . The knowledge of music , upon which his father and his associates generally looked with so much contempt , soon proved of substantial value to him ; and it was the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His early passion determined his career . After having entered upon the study of medicine , its practice became distasteful to him , and he took up the law , and was admitted to the bar in 1845 . Shortly before that time his father died , after having hopelessly wrecked his fortune . White therefore was forced to earn his own living ; and as he had two sisters dependent upon him , he required a more immediate income than it was possible for hini to get from his profession . Happily , Henry J. Raymond , then the manager and editor of the Courier and Enquirer , had heard of his musical ability , and invited him to become the musical critic of that journal . White 's criticisms commanded attention at once . They were more intelligent and more thorough and independent than any which had appeared before in this country . They even provoked comment abroad ; and soon he was a conspicuous man in New York , for his authorship of the criticisms could not be long concealed . This was before he was twentyfive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable personage . While he was a writer on this journal Preston Brooks made his assault upon Charles Sumner , in May , 1856 . The Courier and Enquirer , in a leading article written by White , denounced the outrage in terms of the greatest severity . Thereupon Brooks demanded the name of the author from General Watson Webb , who was then in Washington . Webb telegraphed : " Will the writer of the leader in Monday 's C. and E. hold himself personally responsible for that article , and respond by meeting Mr. Brooks , or am I to assume the responsibility ? " White , without hesitation , replied thus to Brooks directly : - COURIER AND ENQUIRER OFFICE , Nnw YORK , May 27 , 1856 . Sm , - Having learned that you have made the leading article in the Courier and Enquirer of Monday the subject of inquiry addressed to General Webb , I beg to say that that article was written by me , and that I am responsible for it . Your obedient servant , B. G. WHITE . White remained unperturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolinian . Like nearly all New York writers , whatever their distinction , White pursued his literary career amid the distractions of exacting journalistic labors and actual participation in business affairs . From 1854 to 1859 he was regularly on the staff of the Courier and Enquirer , a daily newspaper . Then he was associated with the New York World for a year after its first establishment . From 1861 to 1878 he held the place of head of the revenue marine bureau in the New York custom house ; and it was no sinecure . It called for the constant exercise of the method and administrative skill which marked him to an unusual degree . These qualities were also displayed by him when he did arduous voluntcer service as the secretary of the famous Metropolitan Sanitary Fair in New York , the great bazaar kept open for three months , and which earned nearly two millions of dollars for the sick and wounded of the war . During all this time he was also at work on magazine papers , reviews , and books ; and his literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1845 , was a pamphlet containing a close legal argument against the suspension of Bishop Onderdonk , and it is interesting as suggesting White 's concern about religious affairs at that period of his life . The same year , also , he sat as a delegate in the Diocesan Convention at St. John 's Chapel . In 1846 his first magazine article was published in the American Magazine . It was on Beethoven , and was remarkable as being the first critical estimate of the great composer that had appeared in this country , and it was really the most notable discussion of the subject that had yet appeared in the English language . Its style shows marks of youth occasionally , for White was then in his twenty-fourth year only , but it has the directness and perspicuity which afterwards distinguished him . His articles on Shakespeare in Putnam 's Magazine followed in 1853 , his first book , Shakespeare 's Scholar , in 1854 , and his critical edition of Shakespeare 's works during the years 1857-63 . Then came his four years ' series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Gospel of Peace ( which earned more money for him , with its sale of more than one hundred thousand copies , than all the rest of his books combined ) , his Words and their Uses , and other volumes . Yet meanwhile journalistic and custom-house duties required from him an amount of labor which alone seemed to be enough for his energies ; and it would have been enough for a man of ordinary capacity and endurance . Besides // all this , he wrote steadily for magazines . Even after he ceased to be connected with any particular newspaper , he was a frequent contributor to journals ; and he was distinguished throughout his career for the punctual performance of his literary engagements , and also for his freedom from the irascibility and touchiness sometimes displayed by his craft . He was never on the lookout for slights , for he could not conceive it possible that anybody would slight him . For more than thirty years after the breaking up of the stringed quartette in Brooklyn White was obliged to cast aside his musical instruments entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , bitter as the deprivation was to him ; but , chancing to meet Mr. Meyer in Printing House Square one day , the old passion was aroused in him anew , and he proposed at once that they should get up a new quartette . The result was that in December , 1877 , the quartette was formed ; and it began weekly practice , which lasted almost without interruption , save in the summer , until March , 1885 , or until within a few days of White 's death . It consisted of Mr. Meyer as first violin ; Mr. Chandler Wayland , second violin ; Mr. D. T. Wade , viola ; and Mr. White , violoncello . With few exceptions , its meetings were on Thursday , and at Mr. White 's house . They afforded him the occupation in which he took his intensest delight and found his most satisfying resource . " If any disappointment or vexation comes up during the day , " he used often to remark , " I think , Ah , well ! we shall have our quartette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was so urgent about punctuality that the other members usually arrived at the door at almost the same moment , eight o'clock exactly . Then music began promptly , for White had everything prearranged , with his customary method , and it continued until half past ten , when the company left as promptly as they came , well knowing that their host 's working hour had come ; for his writing was done almost wholly late at night . The programme of the evening was two quartettes , as a rule , beginning with a Haydn or a Mozart , and ending with one of the first six of Beethoven . Mozart was White 's favorite among composers ; a heaven-inspired and true musician , as he described him , with less of his own personality in his music than any other . He felt and admired the rugged power and grandeur of Beethoven , but to him they seemed to be more colored by the sadness of the life , and the irritable disposition and the physical defects of the man . White found never ceasing delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , can be played with much facility by amateurs . His idea of Wagner was a little like the Frenchman 's , - that his music is still the music of the future . He respected Wagner 's ability and his scholarship , but mourned his lack of rhythm ; White 's fancy being more for the music of complete rhythm and cadences . The new fashions in music never took hold of him . He believed thoroughly in form and a rigidly conventionalized style , and therefore was altogether outside of the influence of Wagner . Of course , the work of amateurs is trying to 4ie patience . It must be gone over again and again , for it is always more or less tentative ; but White 's patience and gentleness were inexhaustible . " Never mind , gentlemen , " he would say ; " it will go better next time . " When he enjoyed a passage especially , his countenance would take on a rapt expression , and he would be entirely unconscious of his surroundings . As a player , he was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up the violoncello comparatively late in life . He had studied earnestly under the tuition of Frederick Bergner , // the well-known violoncello virtuoso , and his knowledge of music was precise and extensive . Literature was his work , music his pleasure and his passion . He was also fond of tinkering at musical instruments , and their history and mechanism had a curious interest for him . He had a workshop for their repair at his house . Here he delighted to tinker at violins . He would take them to pieces , to see whether , by some little alterations , he could not improve their tone ; and when he was puzzled as to what to do , he would bring violin makers and experts into consultation , or would go to them himself with huge violoncellos in his arms . Hardly a day passed that he was not in their shops . They were his favorite resorts . It was amusing to see this tall and stately man taking the wounded parts of instruments in a big green violoncello case to a violin doctor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape observation . Everybody in New York who had anything to do with the making or repairing of violins knew Richard Grant White , and had an affection for him . It was a scene for a great picture to see him take a violin in his hands and study it intensely , to discover the secret of its tonejproducing capacity . Usually , when the quartette sat down to play , he had by him his whole collection of five favorite violoncellos , and be changed from one to the other at different movements , with a view to studying and comparing the peculiar qualities of each . Among them were an Amati , a Bergonzi , and a Gagliano . The meetings of the quartette continued until late in March , 1885 ; and White died on the 8th of the next month . He was not willing that tbey should cease because of his illness , but craved them all the more for that very reason . He played himself when the mark of death was already on his features . He sat by his much - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the vitality of his absorbing passion . The late Joseph W. Drexel was an equally enthusiastic violoncello performer , and he organized another string quartette of amateurs , which met at his house during part of the same period . When he , too , was mortally ill , a few years after , and death was close at hand , as his fellow-players could see by unmistakable signs , he was wheeled in by his servant to take his post at the cello . The great banker and the hard-worked man of letters each turned to music for comfort in his dying hours . Not the touch of death itself could chill that passion . White 's correspondence with Mr. Chandler Wayland , who is a man of fortune and of affairs , was frequent ; but it was of the most informal kind , consisting usually of brief reminders of the meetings of the quartette , perhaps with some humorous remark added , or a grateful acknowledgment of a courtesy extended . If the letter reached any length , it almost invariably concerned White 's hobby of tinkeringviolins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter written in May , 1883 : - " Of course you are curious to see , or rather to hear , the result of my manipulation of your fiddle ; and so am I. But that sort of thing is not to be hurried . I shall , however , send you the fiddle in a day or two ; telling you nothing about it , and leaving you to discover what the change is , if any has been accomplished . I hope for the best , or at least for a betterment of the quaint , dainty old thing . We shall see . " You must , however , no longer call it your Amati , for its authorship has been discovered , positively and without the slightest doubt . You will remember that I told you that it puzzled me ; but that I was sure it was an old Italian work , of the Cremona school , and more like that of the eldest Amati ( Andreas ) than that of any other maker known to me , but that the Nicolas Amati label // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves to be by Pamphilon , a maker little known , and whose violins are very rare . He is reckoned by some as an English maker , and by others as Italian ; the fact being , I think , that he was a Frenchman , who learned his trade with the Ainatis at Cremona , whence he got the secret ( or rather receipt , for it was no secret ) of the varnish , and who , after making violins somewhere in Italy , went to London , and set up business on old London Bridge , when the bridge was really a cross-river street , with houses and shops on each side of it . He imitated Andreas Amati ; and hence , you will see , my conclusion . Your violin was made about 1670 to 1680 , and probably before he went to London . It is as surely by Pamphilon as my great cello is by Carlo Bergonzi , and as my pet cello is not by any one of the Amatis . Possess your soul ( and your fiddle ) in patience ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a few months afterwards , he says : " I hear that Wiffen praises Tubbs a violin maker highly for the improvement in your fiddle . Do n't undeceive him . " In August , 1880 , writing to Mr. Wayland , who was then abroad , he gives his estimate of Adelina Patti in a very striking way : - " The pleasure of both of us was in the passage about the Scotch Sah-batli keepers ; their approval of the criticism of 4delina Patti . I have not heard Patti since I was a young fellow , and she was a little girl running about behind the scenes in short clothes , chirping and running roulades like a little canary bird . She and her elder sister ( a swarthy hussy ) had , as you say she has now , voices like a flute , with no more soul , no more vibration ; and their style was merely that of highly finished vocalism , - not the first indication of the grand style . This was the more remarknble as their mother was a great artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , who would sing a grand cantabile or declamatory passage in a way that would lift you right out of your boots . I heard her sing Romeo in one of the old Italian operas . Phnbus , how she did make love ! and such legs ! I shall never forget it . These girls got their voices and their style from their father , a piping tenor named Patti , of course . When he got fat I called him Patti de foie gras , at which people laughed . The joke was afterwards stolen from me , and appropriated by a set of writers for the press of New York , who said that I was a surly , uncompanionable fellow , without any humor , which perhaps I am . " What you say about the tone of the violins in England is true , too . The tone is richer and fuller there . I am glad to see that you have been enjoying your trip . Europe is a great place , - great all over , and great in spots . Would that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continent , which I have never seen ! " In the February before his death he writes : " Do come to see a poor fellow . I have become imbecile , - feel like an invalid oyster , or a new-born baby feebly fumbling its way toward an individual consciousness. ** White 's correspondence was not great , and none of it consisted of the letters to friends which so many obliging persons of his standing compose for the benefit of their biographers , and to go down to history as a part of their literary remains . He made no preparation whatever for his biographer . He does not seem to have thought about that functionary at all . He left no papers concerning his personality . The views and opinions he had had to express for the public he had published himself . Few men of his distinction die leaving so little evidence of a desire to court posthumous fame . But his music and his violoncellos , his bows and the tools of his workshop as a violin mender , were watched and kept with loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man whose individuality stood out prominently among American writers , - a man of force and distinction . His literary style represents and expresses his true character in its virile strength and its simplicity and perspicuity . There is no affectation about it . It is the style of a writer who has no other aim than to make clear his thought and to elucidate his subject ; to inform and influence his reader rather than to display himself . If he put his personality forward , as he did sometimes under the provocation of criticism , it was done boldly and frankly , and not through literary trick and artifice . He was also a thoroughly independent thinker ; and he wrote invariably with a serious purpose , never for the mere exhibition of literary dexterity . His work has no trace of imitation in it ; his style is wholly his own , formed by his individuality and shaped and colored by the peculiarities of his own mind , not modeled after any other .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
