BY HENRY LOOMIS NELSON . IN 1832 De Tocqueville wrote these words , which within a few months were signally shown to be false : " The Union is a vast body which presents no definite object to patriotic feeling ; " and these : " If the sovereignty of the Union were to engage in a struggle with that of the States at the present day , its defeat may be confidently predicted ; and it is not probable that such a struggle would be seriously undertaken . As often as steady resistance is offered to the Federal government , it will be found to yield . " The supreme test came in 1861 , and the Federal goverfiment encountered and overcame the active armed hostility of not one but eleven States , and secret , dangerous , and powerful enmity in several more . At the time when De Tocqueyule wrote , every great leader in the war of the rebellion had been born . Within sixteen years occurred a war with a foreign power for a political purpose opposed to the moral sentiments of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - nine States ; and yet no one in all those States endeavored to give aid and comfort to the foreign enemy of the Federal government . It is true that the controlling party in some of the Northern States was the party of the administration , but no influential individual among the citizens whose conscientious scruples and material interests were trampled upon by the armies that invaded Mexico advocated forcible resistance to the Federal government . The truth is that the direction in which the powers of government in the United States have always tended is opposite to that fancied by De Tocqueville . In the very year in which he wrote , the State of South Carolina was threatening secession and undertaking nullification . A brief delay in publishing Democracy in America would have demolished the French philosopher 's chapter on the weakness of the Federal government and the overshadowing power of the States . The history of the Federal government is one of growing strength and influence . The difference between the intention of the founders of the system and of the existing fact is nearly as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the first organization of the government to the present time there has been almost a steady advance towards centralization . This advance has been both aided and retarded by the Supreme Court ; but in the legislative branch of the government and in the popular mind the proportions of the Federal government have constantly grown larger . It has not been the tendency of the people of the republic to strengthen the local government at the expense of the general government . On the contrary , the general government has grown at the cost of the States , and within a very few months a measure was passed by the House of Representatives , and was barely prevented from passing in the Senate by a compact between Democrats and Republican advocates of the free coinage of silver , which would have interfered with the political rights of the towns , and of the individual . In the war of 1812 , New England was passively disloyal to the Union . As Jefferson said , in a letter to Lafayette , " During that war four of the Eastern States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies to living men . " The Union had not so impressed itself upon the imaginations of the citizens of the States , it had not become so much an essential part of their idea of the government under which they lived , that it appealed to their patriotism . At that time De Tocqueville might have been justified in making the assertion that " the Union is a vast body which presents no definite object to patriotic feeling , " but he was far from right in 1832 , as South Carolina discovered . It was in 1801 that John Marshall was made Chief Justice , and immediately began to announce the series of decisions interpretative of the Constitution , which enlarged and extended the Federal jurisdiction far beyond the bounds which were fixed by Jefferson and his party . Marshall , more than any other public man of his day , declared the sovereignty of the Union , but he would doubtless have been astonished , and perhaps disturbed , if at the end of his long and famous career he could have foreseen all the results of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this late day , nor his rule of interpretation by which every grant of power to the Federal government is construed broadly . Courts can not stand permanently in the way of the growth of a government . They may retard it or they may assist it , and Marshall materially assisted the growth of the power of the Union by bringing it nearer to the individual citizen . When it was determined that a United States certificate must be on board of every steamboat navigating waters that communicated between two or more States , the sovereignty of the Federal government was present with the citizen whenever he made a journey . When it was judicially and authoritatively announced that a State could not tax the securities of the Federal government , the citizen was defended by the Federal sovereignty against the tax-collector of his own commonwealth . It is unnecessary to dwell at length upon De Tocqueville 's error . It is one that should not have been made by any political writer . The Federal sovereignty was present everywhere-in the post offices , in the harbors , in the customhouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ambitious public men worked through service for the State for promotion to Washington . Moreover , the government which was organized as the common agent for the thirteen States which created it , and upon which were bestowed certain powers essential to the conduct of the business between the States and with foreign powers , soon came to be a creator of States . Pioneers were pressing into the vast territory west of the fringe of ancient colonies along the Atlantic seaboard , and they and their descendants were to look some day upon the Federal government not as something existing through concessions of power by them , but as the power which had clothed them with Statehood . And it required not a great deal of wit and prescience in 1832 to realize that the day was coming when the States that derived their sovereignty from would greatly overbalance the States that had bestowed sovereignty upon the Federal government . And when that day came , other things being equal , the perpetuity of the Union was assured . In 1832 there were twenty-four States in the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old community . Kentucky was organized in 1792 , from territory ceded by Virginia . Tennessee was organized in 1796 , from territory ceded by North Carolina . Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois were the States that had then been formed from the Northwest Territory . Maine was the offspring of Massachusetts . The other new States had been organized from territory acquired by purchase from France and Spain . Vermont and Maine were in no wise different in spirit and in habits of thought from the people of the neighboring State . Notwithstanding its nearness to New York , and the long struggle of that State for the Green Mountain district , Vermont belonged , so far as its institutions of local self-government were concerned , to New England . The town , and not the county , was the basis of representation in the more numerous branch of the Legislature . The settlers of the other States were mainly adventurous or restless spirits , or persons who sought to better themselves in new lands , amid new surroundings . They carried with them , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England took relatively a very small part in the early emigration westward . Most of the settlers of Kentucky went from Virginia and Tennessee ; most of those who settled Tennessee went from North Carolina and Virginia . The new Southern States obtained their population from their own section of the country . In 1850 Ohio had 66,000 New-Englanders among its inhabitants , while 84,000 of its population came from New York , 201,000 from Pennsylvania , and 86,000 from Virginia . The spirit of absolute local independence which makes New England the preserver in this country of the finest and most fundamental of Teutonic institutions was never the happy possession of the majority of the people of the Northwest Territory . To be sure , there is the town meeting in Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin as it exists in New York ; but the town meeting which does not perform all the legislative functions of the town is an emasculated institution often productive of more evil than good . As I have endeavored to show in a former article , the only town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is that which exists in New England . From the very first the people of the new Territories and the new States leaned // on the central authority at Washington . Mr. Garfield used to speak of this fact in order to account for the greater reverence felt for the Federal power in the Western than in the Eastern States . During the Territorial period the people received their laws from Congress , while the administrative and judicial officers were appointed by the President . And when they obtained the right to make their own laws , to choose their own executive officers , to select their own judges , to govern themselves , it was from the Federal government that they received these gifts , and consequently the Federal government impressed itself upon their imaginations very strongly , and came to be regarded both by Americans , upon whom it had conferred the dignity and power of Statehood , and by the swarms of foreigners who subsequently made their way to the West from the monarchies of continental Europe , as the source of all power in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessings . The Confederacy was very modest when it established its first ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory , and yet by that act it came directly in contact with the individual citizen in a way impossible in the States , either for it or its successor , the Union . It was the central authority , even in the time of the weak Confederacy , that guaranteed the citizen from molestation on account of his worship or religious sentiments , that conferred upon him the right to the writ of habeas corpus and to bail for all except capital offences , and that defended him from cruel or unusual punishments . There was an essential difference , however , between that early ordinance and modern statutes governing Territories . Instead of bestowing upon the Confederate Congress the power to enact laws , it provided that the Governor and the judges , or a majority of them , should " adopt and publish in the district such laws of the original States , civil and criminal , as may be necessary and best suited to the circumstances of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , which laws shall be in force in the district until the organization of the General Assembly therein , unless disapproved by Congress . " The report was made to Congress in its executive capacity , not as a legislative body . When the Constitution was adopted , the ordinance was amended to conform with it , and the President was substituted for Congress . In the later enabling acts , Congress provided more minutely for the government of the Territories which it organized . It came more closely in contact with the individual . It limited the jurisdiction of judicial officers , and made certain provisions concerning the application of the public lands to educational purposes . All this was in harmony with the growing importance of the Federal power . It showed clearly enough that the tendency of government was in the direction of centralization , and that the longer it lived , and the more populous the great West became , the less it would have to fear from the States . No one questions the right of the United States government to impose conditions upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Congress has insisted , in admitting a new State , that it shall adopt a certain policy , but the extent to which the right is now exercised is very much greater than was dreamed of by the Federal legislators of the early days of the republic . Instead of the enabling act , like that admitting Kentucky , simply consenting to the admission of the new State , we have now an elaborate law undertaking to limit the power of the people over their Constitution . At first this preliminary restraining act was confined to provisions setting aside lands and townships for schools , universities , and roads , but recently there was passed an enabling act which denies the franchise to all people who profess belief in Mormonism . And while these laws can not be binding upon the people of the States , and can not prevent their amendment of their Constitutions in direct contravention of the enabling acts , they indicate a state of popular opinion concerning the relation of the Federal government to the States , a general acceptance of the idea that the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist that a Territory seeking Statehood shall possess certain qualifications and make certain pledges before it can be permitted to become a member of the Union . And there is no doubt that a very large number of people would consider the subsequent adoption of a constitutional amendment opposed to the provisions of the enabling act as a breach of faith . Indeed , within // a very short time there has been a dispute as to whether the State of Mississippi has the right to limit the suffrage by the imposition of an educational qualification . All this is very different from the spirit which animated the original thirteen States , for in the day when they were supreme there dwelt hardly a man within the borders of the Union who would not have resented the faintest suggestion that Congress might impose any conditions upon the people 's right to frame I their own State Constitutions . The Federal Constitution , with its limited grant of powers , alone restrained the States . But the country grew , and popular opinion grew with it . The States that owed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1832 the new States , counting Vermont and Maine as old , had only 67 Representatives in a House of 240 , and 18 of the 48 Senators . In 1850 the 67 had increased to 103 in a House of 237 . In 1860 the new States had 121 members , and the old States 122 . In 1870 the new States had 160 , and the old , 133 . The majority of the people of the country lived in States that were created by the Federal government . Moreover , these new States had a majority of the Senate in 1850 . The influence of these facts upon the relative importance of the Federal government has been very great . It can not be overestimated . At the very beginning of the Union the people of the frontier States sought the assistance of the United States , while the manufacturers obtained the consent of the government to the formation of a quasi-official copartnership . Internal improvements were at once entered upon . Ohio was admitted to the Union in 1802 , and in 1806 Congress passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to connect it with the State of Maryland . Jefferson favored the project , but he was jealous for the rights of the States , and insisted that the consent of those through which the road was to run should be obtained before its construction was begun . The Cumberland Road for many years regularly made its appearance in Congress , and gradually there grew up an opposition to internal improvements , of which Martin Van Buren was eventually the leader . It is a significant fact that hostility to the expenditure of Federal money for the benefit of citizens engaged in the business of transportation was not based on economic considerations . The developing system was resisted on the ground that the Constitution did not bestow upon the United States the power to expend money for such works . The suggestion was made more than once that the Constitution should be amended in order that Congress might legally possess the power it had usurped . Even Martin Van Buren , whose early political distinction was won by his struggles against internal works , who instructed Jackson himself in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of such a constitutional amendment , and in 1825 asked in the Senate for a committee to prepare a draft . President Monroe , who in 1822 vetoed a bill appropriating money for toll-gates on the Cumberland Road , expressed himself as strongly in favor of the construction of internal improvements by the Federal government . His opposition to the bill was based entirely on his view of the Constitution . Yet , notwithstanding the constitutional objections to the system , whose champion presently was Henry Clay , the Federal government 's grants to roads , canals , and other similar projects became more numerous . The demand that the Union should " build up the great West " was made very early in its history , and it was a demand that was not to be carelessly ignored by any statesman whose ambition was to shine in the large field of national politics . Mr. Van Buren voted for the toll-gate bill which Monroe vetoed , and when , six years later , he apologized for this apparent inconsistency with his almost constant position on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member when he gave the vote , he was always very desirous of aiding the West . Both he and Benton voted to repair the Cumberland Road , apparently forgetting that if the road should not have been built by the Federal government , it could not be constitutionally repaired by it . It is strange that the increasing intimacy of the Federal power with the daily vocations of the citizens of the State did not impress itself upon De Tocqueville . While he was writing of the feebleness of the general government , that government was growing to be the dependence // of the then new part of the country , now much the larger part , for intercornmunication . New York built its own Erie Canal . The Atlantic seaboard States began their independent existence with a habit of mind acquired by the practice of looking after their own affairs , and of depending upon their own resources for better means of intercourse , for education , or for whatever was deemed proper for the public to do for the individual . The explorers of the Western forests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results which the old States had attained through two centuries of development , and there was no power that could gratify that desire except the general agent of all the States , at Washington . That was the power to which the States had ceded the great Northwestern domain , and the territory south of the Ohio River . That was the power which had purchased Louisiana of the French Emperor and given to the country the control of the Mississippi River ; which secured Florida from Spain , and thus extended the Southern coast line of the United States from the Atlantic Ocean to Mexico . It was the power which , finally , had created the States in which dwelt the people out of whose necessities grew the demand for internal improvements . The Federal government continued to build roads , to improve rivers , to make canals , notwithstanding the constitutional objections . There were propositions advanced in Congress to loan the public funds to private corporations ; there were investments made in the stock of canal companies . The public lands tempted the beneficiaries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing for the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of those lands . Some members of Congress favored the distribution of the proceeds and of all the surplus funds of the United States among all the States , while there were some who urged that the money be bestowed upon the new and needy States of the West . Mr. Edward M. Shepard , in his life of Martin Van Buren , speaking of the vote , in 1828 , of public land for the benefit of Kenyon College , Ohio , says , " there was plainly intended to be no limit to Federal beneficence. ' * In 1817 , Calhoun , assisted by Clay , secured the passage through both Houses of Congress of a bill providing for the creation of a permanent fund , which should be expended for the construction of " roads and canals , " and for " improving the navigation of watercourses . " Jackson had on several occasions shown favor to the popular system , but in 1830 , Congress having appropriated money for the Maysville Road , which was entirely within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thenceforth opposition to internal improvements became a Democratic shibboleth . But party lines have never been strictly drawn . The work went steadily on . The beneficences demanded of and granted by the Federal government became both more numerous and more extravagant . The war interrupted the construction of United States works within the States . But the steady growth of the principle that the Federal government has a supervision over the general welfare of the country was not checked for a moment . The Pacific railroads were built . The public lands were given away to private corporations , and in aid of educational institutions within the States . The war ended , , and with the return of the rebellious States to their allegiance to their Union , and to their share in its power , the movement for Federal interference became stronger , and the cry for largess louder . The rivers and harbors of the South were to be cleaned for interState navigation , and when the reign of the " carpet-baggers " was over , and the old - fashioned Southern Democrats returned to Congress-those old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to go into the war which demonstrated the physical supremacy of the Federal power-it was soon discovered that their ante bellum hostility to " internal improvements " had been lost in the conflict . There was hardly a stream in the Southern States for which an appropriation was not asked and obtained . So often and scandalous were many of the items of the annual river and harbor bill , and so earnest and intense were the Democratic Senators from the South in the pursuit of Federal money to be expended within the war-impoverished States , that Mr. Thurman , in 1881 , being on the eve of his retirement from the Senate , addressed to his Southern colleagues a warning against the abandonment of their principles against that dependence upon the Federal treasury which // involved a surrender to the Federal power . But the country knows that Mr. Thurman 's warning , and the angry protests of Eastern newspapers , availed absolutely nothing . The expenditures for " internal improvements " not only went on , but increased enormously . The pretence that the money was appropriated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in opposition was less frequently heard , and the members of Congress who occasionally uttered them were regarded as old-fashioned objects of contempt . " Internal improvements " furnished the highway along which the Federal power advanced . The States were naturally more willing to surrender a jurisdiction the exercise of which entailed enormous expenditures , because the surrender not only relieved them of expense , spreading the cost of public works within their borders over the whole country , but because by it expenditures at the place where the work was in progress were actually increased beyond the amounts that the localities could afford . The Federal government was lavish in its expenditures . With the spread of Federal beneficence came naturally and inevitably the strengthening of the Federal power and the Federal influence . Against this advancing power has stood one branch of the government . The Judiciary of the United States has done its utmost to keep the central authority within the bounds set by the Constitution . Its greatest recent service to the principle of local selfgovernment was its resistance to the theory that the Fourteenth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizen in the ordinary relations of life . But even the *ourts have yielded to popular opinion , and , as in the legal tender cases , have assented to the doctrine that the United States have the right to issue unlimited amounts of paper money either in time of war or peace ; while , as in the Iowa liquor case , they have invaded the police powers of the State . There is no government in the civilized world , except possibly Russia , which is not to some extent under the domination of popular opinion . The present Emperor of Germany is the most virile monarch in Europe , but he dare not oppose too grievously the will * , of his subjects . If there is any written instrument of government powerful beyond all other laws , it is our own Constitution , for it is the rule of action prescribed by the people for the guidance and control of their agents . But the history of the Federal power shows that there is a power above the Constitution , and that is the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution has not stood in the way of the people 's will . Even the Supreme Court will change its mind if the people are persistent . It has not been always necessary for popular opinion to demand the breaking or flexion of the Constitution ; it is only necessary that it should approve what has been done . The purchases of Louisiana and Alaska , and the many instances of executive and legislative acts during the war of the rebellion that were clearly beyond the constitutional grants of power , are cases in point which will occur to any one who is at all familiar with our constitutional history . It is not in the books of decisions nor in the letter of the law that the real extent of the Federal power will be found . The statutes and the bills introduced in Congress more accurately reflect the popular conception of the Federal power , of the duties which it owes to the States , of the jurisdiction which it possesses over them and their citizens . The courts and the letter of the Constitution will restrain and guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in the first place , essentially powerful by reason of its now well-established implied powers , and , in the second place , the Supreme Court will bend the letter when the pressure from without is strong enough , as it undoubtedly did when it sustained the reconstruction acts . From very early days it has been the habit of American statesmen to rebel against the restraints of the Constitution if the fundamental law seemed to stand in the way of what they conceived to be the general welfare . In 18113 , Henry Clay , in explaining his change of position from opposition to support of a United States Bank , stated this truth concerning constitutional interpretation in the United States : " The Constitution , it is true , never changes ; it is always the same ; but the force of circumstances and the lights of experience may evolve , to the fallible persons charged with its administration , the fitness and necessity of a particular exercise of constructive power today which they did not see at a former period . " VOL . LXxxv. - No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal government to do anything that can possibly be brought within the wide range of the implied powers , and especially within that ancient plea of " general welfare " which sustained the conscience of Henry VIII . in extorting benevolences from his subjects . This growth of the Federal power may or may not have been in opposition to the Constitution . As the Supreme Court is the tribunal of last resort in questions involving the meaning of that instrument , its decision alone can determine whether any particular statute or executive act is within the intention of the fundamental law . It has sometimes determined against what seemed to be popular opinion , but no one familiar with its history can believe that it will stand against such a pressure of popular opinion as that which sustained Jefferson 's purchase of Louisiana , or condemned the Alien and Sedition acts . However that may be , it is apparent that most measures of doubtful constitutionality will never be presented for adjudication . Certainly no one in Wisconsin would raise the issue as to a canal maintained by general taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in the truth of the broad principle that everybody 's business is nobody 's business . The fact that is interesting and important is that since the central agent of the States began the erection of new States the Federal power has marvellously developed . This result was inevitable . From the beginning until to-day the advance has not only been unchecked , but it has been stimulated by a great war , in which the Federal power demonstrated its physical supremacy , and by every sectional controversy in which the new States have overcome the old . And the fact that this advance has gone on in spite of the opposition of the strict constructionists contains an eminently practical lesson for those who are charged with the tasks of government . It does not show by any means that the strict constructionists have been wrong . On the contrary , many of the results of this development of power indicate that they were wise . But whether they were right or wrong is a controversial question which does not properly come within the contemplation of this article . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the discussion of proposed legislation in Congress should be on its merits , and that unless a measure is flagrantly unconstitutional , the legal subject may be better avoided . Mr. James Bryce , in the American Commonwealth , says that one consequence of the habit of American legislators to confine discussion to the constitutionality of measures under consideration is that " legal issues are apt to dwarf and obscure the more substantially important issues of principles and policy , distracting from these latter the attention of the nation as well as the skill of Congressional debates . " Judge Hare , in his Lectures on Constitutional Law , enlarging on the same point , says that in this country " the question primarily is one of right , and in the refined and subtle discussion which ensues right is too often lost sight of , or treated as if it were synonymous with might . It is taken for granted that what the Constitution permits it also approves , and that measures which are legal can not be contrary to m orals2 ' This is the most important conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular opinion , and even of popular assent , when the Constitution seems to stand in the way . If the large mass of laws by which the United States have assumed jurisdiction over what were originally supposed to be local concerns had been thoroughly debated on their merits , many of them could never have been enacted . By the growth of the Federal power there has followed a loss of local responsibility , and consequently of local political activity and skill , similar to that which differentiates the small municipalities existing under the county system of the rest of the Union from the communities possessing the town-meeting system of New England . Congress has overshadowed the State Legislatures to that extent that they have become inapt in dealing with those intimate and scientific subjects of social and domestic concern the possession of jurisdiction over which ought to make the State Legislatures bodies of the first importance . At the same time Congress has assumed many powers that were not within the contemplation of the founders of the government , and has undertaken tasks which have enormously ii*creased its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . These tasks are of local and sectional rather than of general importance , and it is to their assumption more than to any other cause that the existing Congressional paralysis may be attributed . Congress can not attend to the general welfare , because custom has made the general welfare consist of an accumulation of special and local interests . Private claims , public buildings , internal improvements , land grants , subsidies-all these and more interfere with and prevent the transaction of business in which the whole country is interested . In this way not only are the general interests neglected , but sectionalism is encouraged . The newer part of the country has been always demanding aid , and the older States as often resisting , until the debates in Congress are filled with that spirit of jealousy which must animate rival claimants on the Treasury surplus . The public works carried on by the Federal government are marked by wasteful extravagance , and often by corruption . This also is inevitable , because the work is always carried on by a government representing millions of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cost is borne by so many that it is as nothing to the people whose city is adorned by a public building , or whose shallow stream is deepened . The effect of the growth of the Federal power on the character of Federal legislation is one of the most patent evils attending the departure from the standard of the founders . It is an evil with which newspaper readers are kept constantly familiar , for now , as always , the proceedings of the general government are of wider and more general interest than those of States and municipalities . When the Federal government was first organized , and for many years afterwards , most of its laws were general , and the sessions of Congress were comparatively fruitless , if we are to measure the results of legislative activity by mere bulk . But the times have changed , and the contents of the statute - book have changed with them . The present view of public men concerning the extent of the Federal power may best be illustrated by a reference to the titles of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among them are bills providing for the establishment of a national university ; for the establishment and temporary support of common schools ; for the prevention of the adulteration of food . There are bills providing for the construction of macadam roads , which will necessarily be under the supervision of local authorities ; for the boring of artesian wells in the State of Montana ; for preventing aliens from en gaging " in certain business " within the State . There is a bill defining lard ; also imposing a tax upon and regulating the manufacture , sale , importation , and exportation of compound lard . There are bills against trusts ; to prevent the spread of contagious diseases ; bills providing for Federal supervision of the health of men and cattle ; for the suppression of vice ; for the regulation of traffic . These bills are in addition to the measures introduced and passed for the encouragement of shipbuilding and railroad construction , and for the protection of other industries by taxation . People who desire to build a canal which is to lie entirely within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of the United States . In view of the extent to which the Federal power has impressed itself upon the imagination of the people of the country , it is hardly to be wondered at that the farmers , especially those of that part of the country which has derived its right of self-government from the United States , should form a scheme for turning the Treasury into a loan office where they may borrow money on their crops . During the Fifty-first Congress 2106 private bills and 1874 general bills were passed , and many of the former resulted from the Federal government 's departure from its original purpose . The final adoption , for example , of the policy of making internal improvements has not only added enormously to the number of persons in the employment of the general government , and involved the expenditure of many millions of dollars , but it has led to the abandonment of the controlling principle in pursuance of which these works were first undertaken . The Federal government is now , and for a long time has been , engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come within the contemplation of those who first insisted on the construction and maintenance of the Cumberland Road . There are other // subjects coming ostensibly within Federal jurisdiction that are nevertheless exaggerations of the admitted power of the government of the United States , and that are clearly evasive extensions of the Federal jurisdiction . The building and maintenance of highways to national cemeteries , for example , is an invasion not so much of the powers as of the essential duties and privileges of the several localities where they are situated . The absorption of duties by the United States has burdened the country with the army of office-holders that still gives an undue influence to the party of the administration , and that compelled the adoption of the reformed civil service as a measure defensive of the right of the people to choose their own legislative and executive officers , uninfluenced by the government . In Washington 's time the officeholders of the Federal government numbered 6000 , while now the government employs an army of more than 100,000 . This enormous force of office-holders includes constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statisticians ; geologists ; meteorologists ; hydrographers ; metallurgists ; astronomers ; makers of charts and maps ; schoolteachers ; railroad experts ; skilled detectives ; agriculturists ; entomologists ; botanists ; chemists ; microscopists ; gardeners ; tradesmen ; merchants ; experts in textiles , china , glass , and the thousand articles imported from foreign countries and subject to a tariff tax ; clerks of various grades and degrees of skill , from accountants to copyists ; expert machinists and mechanics ; messengers ; and a host of laborers . It is not pretended that the employment of all of these persons , adepts or otherwise , is necessarily incongruous . There are functions properly within the jurisdiction of the Federal government that demand the labors of men of science , and men who are skilled in the secrets of commerce and manufactures . But if the government had been confined to its original purpose , if it had not gone afield in strange pursuits . seeking vainly after what can be best attained through the intelligent efforts of colleges , universities , and scientific associations , the corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be one-half its present size . The public expenditures in the first years of the government 's existence were for the foreign service , the army and navy , and for the maintenance of the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of the government . These departments of the government were to be provided for in the most frugal and careful manner . In Jefferson 's first term Gallatin proposed to maintain the army and navy on a little more than a million dollars . An unexpected war made this plan futile , but the prevailing notion as to the scope of the Federal government , and of the demands which it might justly make on the resources of the people , was not changed . The sum of money expended for the foreign service was for the meagre salaries of those who represented the country abroad , and for the expenses connected with the legation offices . The expenditures for the judicial department were for the administration of justice within the narrow confines of what was first held to be the Federal jurisdiction . The total receipts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; under Jefferson , $108,238,978 . The population of the country had increased 36 per cent. , and the receipts 92 per cent. , while expenditures had advanced about 94 per cent . From the end of Jefferson 's last administration to the beginning of Abraham Lincoln 's term of office the population of the country increased from 7,000,000 to 31,000,000 , while receipts and expenditures grew fivefold greater than they were when Gallatin was at the head of the Treasury Department . In Buchanan 's time the expenditures of the government amounted to about $82,000,000 a year . In 1890 , the population and valuations in the mean time having about doubled , the expenditures were $359,000,000 , an increase of 340 per cent . These , however , are only the apparent expenditures . There are exceptional outlays which ought not to be counted as part of the ordinary cost of maintaining the government . To be fair and accurate , these extraordinary sums may be deducted and the results tabulated . We will thus compare the fiscal years 1860 and 1890 . We will deduct the payments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : // Total expenditures for 1860 $77,462,103 Paid for pensions $1,092,727 Interest and principal of public debt 17,613,628 18,706,35.5 Ordinary expenditures for 1860. $58,755,748 Total expenditures for 1890 $358,618,585 Pensions . $106,936,855 Interest on public debt . 36,099,284 143036,139 Ordinary expenditures for 1890. $215,582,446 The increase was $156,826,698 , or 267 per cent . In 1880 these ordinary expenses amounted to $115,108,209 , so that in the decade ending with 1890 the increase in the government 's expenditures was nearly 90 per cent. , while the increase of population was about 25 per cent. , and of valuations 43 per cent . It is not proper , of course , to assume that a mere increase of annual expenditure is necessarily extravagant ; but we are at least put upon our inquiry when the rate of increase is nearly 300 per cent. , while population and wealth lag far behind . As civilization advances , government is naturally more and more expensive , until the millennial point shall be reached , when the individual may be entirely trusted to take care of himself , and of his neighbor as himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country or elsewhere ; but in this republic , whether the Constitution binds and limits us or not , the intention was to leave the necessary tasks for the advancement of civilization to the individual and to the local government , confining the Federal government to the care of the joint interests of its members . If that function had been strictly adhered to , the cost of government could not have increased , as it has , so much more rapidly than population or wealth . The evident present annual expenses of the government that are not within the contemplation of the Constitution amount to nearly 20,000,000 . This sum can be counted in simply examining the superficial accounts of the Register of the Treasury . But it does not begin to represent the actual money cost of the government 's excursions beyond the limits once defined for it . As has been already shown , the population and property valuation of the country about doubled in the thirty years between 1860 and 1890 . During that generation a great war was conducted to a successful end , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been paid . In 1890 alone this debt was reduced by more than $48,000,000 , which was paid out of the ample surplus of $105,000,000 that then existed in the Treasury . But now , in a time of profound peace , twenty-five years after the close of the conflict , in the year 1890 , the actual expenditures for the maintenance of the government , deducting pensions and in ? erest charges - the legacies of the war-have grown 267 per cent . If they had but grown with the growth of the country , they would have been nearly $100,000,000 less than they were . If only 125 per cent . had been added to them , there would have been saved more than $80,000,000 . The mere money cost of the extension of the Federal power has been enormous ; and it means not only that money is thrown away on objects not originally supposed to be within the Federal jurisdiction , but that looseness of construction has led to looseness of expenditure , and that a national legislature that devotes its attention to a myriad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general public . The remedy for extravagance , of course , is prudence . There is no reason to suppose that the old ideas of constitutional limitations will ever entirely prevail . Whether the departure was right or wrong , the first step was taken at the very beginning of the government , and Jefferson himself was not wholly irresponsible for it . He advocated an extension of Federal jurisdiction through constitutional amendments that has since been attained without changing the fundamental law . The increase in the number of subjects that make demands upon the Federal Treasury is in harmony with the general expansion of the powers of the United States . Here as elsewhere is illustrated the fact , now borne in upon the consciousness of all students of our Constitution and system of government , that the Constitution does not always stand in the way of popular desires , but that it often surrenders before a well-defined and long-persisted-in line of policy . Little that is permanent can be accomplished by contending against the constitutionality of a proposed expenditure that is in the line of a popular policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have struggled on constitutional grounds against appropriations for streams that are in no sense national . In ( // spite of their efforts , the river and harbor bill which appropriated $5 , 500,000 in 1873 , $6,650,000 in 1876 , $9,575,000 in 1880 , $19 ,  - -  000,000 in 1883 , has grown to $25,000,000 in 1891 . The function of the constitutional lawyer has departed , so far as the application of our written instrument to economic measures is concerned . The practical statesmanship of the future must concern itself not with the legality , but with the advisability of measures . Congress must learn not to authorize every expenditure that it deems to be constitutional . The question whether the State or the general government shall undertake a particular public work will cease to be one of relative power and become entirely economic , and the fewer the functions exercised by the general government , and the more numerous the powers and duties of the local and State governments , the better for the cause of good government-the better morally as well as financially .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
