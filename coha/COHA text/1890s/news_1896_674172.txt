The noteworthy points in the report are the enormous percentage of adulterated specimens ( over 34 per cent. ) from Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed from Holland , and the fact that Denmark , by far the largest contributor of foreign butter products to the British market , and enjoying hitherto an almost irreproachable reputation in the butter market , should have contributed in a total of 182 specimens 8 adulterated , or nearly 5 per cent . In regard to the other countries , the presence of Argentina in the British butter market , even though , no doubt , to a very limited extent , is worthy of note . DID NOT ASK THEIR DEFENSE . Magistrate Thought Being Locked Up Without Food Enough Punishment . Magistrate Kudlich , in the Centre Street Police Court , yesterday discharged a number of pushcart men arrested Saturday afternoon and evening for standing longer than ten minutes in one spot . He did not even ask for their defense . Several of the men complained that during the entire time they had been locked up nothing to eat had been given them . In discharging the men , the Magistrate said : " It is a crying shame that these men should be compelled to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without even a single cup of coffee . They have not been proved guilty , and in the eyes of the law all men are Innocent until proved guilty , and they should not be so severely punished until their guilt is established . I discharged them because even if they were guilty they have suffered sufficiently  --  in my opinion much more than is necessary . " Six months ago I wrote to the Commissioners calling attention to the fact that prisoners in the station houses should be fed , just the same as those in the Tombs . All I ever heard of it afterward was a very polite note from tha Commissioners stating that my note had been received . It all ended with that . " A WOMAN FATALLY BURNED .

After the two engineers died , the engine-room crew was very shorthanded , and the steamer 's first mate volunteered to stand watch and watch with the second engineer . In this manner she was navigated into St. Lucia . The latter island being a garrison point , great precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the disease , and the steamer was anchored in an isolated position . It was necessary to send to Barbados for engineers . For Passing a Worthless Check . William A.
