txt By a vote of 24 to 15 the Senate has stricken out the enacting clause of a bill to incorporate the Civil Service Reform Association of New York . The chief purpose of the bill , as explained by Senator ELBERO , was to enable the association to bring suit to secure the observance of the law instead , as heretofore , of bringing suit in the name of a citizen , The avowed motive of the opponents of the bill was to render more difficult the observance of the law . The public can have little trouble in estimating the merits of the bill and of the opposition to it . The attack on the bill was led by ThomAS F. GRADY and TIMOTHY SULLI VAN , the " silver-tongued " and the " dry-dollar " Senators from this city . The Senate thought it amusing , before killing the bill , to amend it by inserting the name of Mr. GRADY among the incorporators on the motion of Mr. Sta.mvati . For this delicate pleasantry forty-one votes were recorded  --  a unanimous vote . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law a little more inconvenient , it does not render it in the least less certain . The citizens composing the association are not likely at this late date to be deterred from doing their duty as they see it by the necessity of continuing to do It under such difficulties as they have always met and generally overcome . For nearly twenty years the members of the association , busy professional and business men in all branches of occupation , have given time and labor and money , entirely unselfishly and with general good judgment and efficiency , to promote the reform of the civil service and to abolish the manifold evils of the spoils system . It is because they have been successful in a very remarkable degree that they have incurred the spite of the Gradys and Sullivans and Ellsworths and so on through the shabby list . For the same reason they have won the respect and co-operation of a great number of excellent citizens . The petty animosity of the spoilsmen will only in crease public confidence in the association . Mr. GRADY will remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We love him for the enemies he has made .
