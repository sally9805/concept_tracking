txt An attempt to rob the dwelling of Lieut . A. M. , Knight on Buchannon Row , Naval Academy , was made last night . At about 1 o'clock a domestic was aroused by the creaking of a door , and gave the alarm . Lieut . Knight armed himself with a revolver and went to the lower floor but found or heard nobody . On examination , however , a window was found open , and directly inside it a basket was found containing a quantity of silver forks , spoons , and knives , a large silver pitcher and a glass decanter , all belonging in the residence . The drawers of the sideboard which had contained the articles were found to be open , and the table linen was scattered promiscuously . The guards at the Marine Barracks were immediately notified and started on an inspection of the four entrances to . the Academy , to see if any one had entered the gates during the late hours . The three lower gates reported nobody , and at the northern entrance , which admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found at his post . Another guard was sent for and in a short time the missing one turned up and was put under arrest . He claimed to have been called away by necessity , but investigations to-day and opportunities given him to prove his claim do not substantiate his statement , A HACK WRECKED BY A CABLE CAR The Lives of Eight Persons Endangered  --  Two Sent to a Hospital . A little trial of speed between a hack driver and a gripman on a Columbus Avenue cable car last evening resulted in disaster . Car 37 was well loaded up with people in a hurry to get to church . The car was going at a lively rate from Thirty-fifth Street to Thirty-fourth Street , and the gripman was ringing his gong to give warning to some people who were alighting from a Sixth Avenue car just at the crossing . Apparently he did not see until too late a hack that was going at a fast pace ? through Thirty-fourth Street . The hack driver saw the car , but , as the man who was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would surely stop to let the Sixth Avenue car get by , and that he would have time to cross the street . Before anybody really realized what had shappened , the cable car had struck the hack squarely under the driver 's box and sent vehicle , horses , and all bowling over into the street . The car pushed the whole outfit along for nearly ten feet before it was stopped . There were four men and two children inside the carriage , and one man on the box with the driver . The shrieks of the people inside immediately attracted a crowd . The driver of the hack , John Finnerty of 437 West Thirty-seventh Street , was thrown over the backs of his horses . He fell on his head and was knocked senseless . The gripman nearly fainted from fright , thinking the hackman was killed . He was brought to his senses by one of the men who was inside the carriage , and who had climbed out through the window , with a few cuts from broken glass and badly torn clothes . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froht platform of the car and began to punish the unfortunate gripman , who was too much dazed to defend himself . The passengers interfered , and finally a policeman settled this phase of the situation by arresting the gripman and locking him up in the West . Thirtieth Street Police Station . Meanwhile bystanders had been releasing the other people in the overturned carriage , and taking the injured cabman to a drug store . The cabman 's head was bleeding profusely . A physician feared that the skull was fractured . An ambulance was called , and he was promptly sent off to the New-York Hospital . Edward McCabe of 241 East Thirty-fourth Street , who was injured in the legs , was sent there with him . The children and the other two men in the hack escaped with a few bruises . Their names were Thomas Flood of 489 Tenth Avenue , Andrew J. of 493 Tenth Avenue , Henry Schubketle of 493 Tenth Avenue , and William Brown of 448 West Twenty-seventh Street , with his two children .
