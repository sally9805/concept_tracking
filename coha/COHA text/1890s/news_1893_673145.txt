txt Two Republican Senators , at the request of Mr. SHERMAN , have been making a canvass of the Senate to ascertain - what are the chances of passing a bill through that body to stop the purchases of silver . They are said to have reached a conclusion not encouraging to the Senator from Ohio , though we are forced to admit that that gentleman has not acted as if be would be very sorry to see a repeal bill fail at this session . At any rate , it is reported that only eight Democrats were found ready to support the suspension of silver buying , while even a smaller proportion of the Republicans showed any active interest in the matter . As an example of the temper on his side of the Senate , Mr. ALDRICH is said to have declared that he would vote for a repeal bill , but he would do nothing to bring it to a vote . That is very characteristic of Mr. ALDRICH and of a considerable class of prominent men in the Republican Party . Mr. ALDRICH , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sustaining with great zeal the cause of honest money , and looking with much horror upon the dreadful Democrats who believe in silver . But when it came to voting he has never felt called upon to run the slightest risk or make the least sacrifice for the principles of which he avows himself an indispensable champion . The honor and patriotism of the Aldriches are not unlike the temperance zeal of the old tavern-keeping deacon in Maine - who was in favor of the anti-liquor law of his State , but " ag'in ' the enforcement of it . " No one knows better than the Senator from Rhode Island how safe and how futile it is for him to vaunt his devotion to sound money and to do nothing to secure it ; to say that he will vote for the repeal of the act of 1890 , but will do nothing to bring it within reach of his vote . He is a member of the majority of the Senate , and one of its most influential leaders . If he and his Republican friends wish to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . If they do not bring it to a vote , no one else can do anything about it . To say that ho will vote for a bill , while obstinately refusing to take the course required for any oue. to get a chance to vote on it , is to present a queer appearance of mingled impudence , cowardice , and . duplicity . Tree . it is a kind of cheap trickery that deceives no one . It discloses the full value of Mr. Aannicrt 's professions , and it must sensibly diminish the confidepco that business men have heretofore felt in him . The fact is that this time-serving and practically treacherous way of dealing with great , public interests . which we shall venture to call Aldricliisin , is a serious evil in our national politic ; and is directly responsible for all the trouble and peril as to silver in which we are involved . If the Republicans who believed that an inflated or depreciated currency was bad and should be n voided bad acted up 1 o their convictions fifteen years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Allison bill for the coinage of silver was a Republican invention to aeep the senators from the silvermine States from going over to the Democrats . The act of 1a:90 was another bid of exactly the same sort . It has been said that it was a compromise to prevent free coinage , but that is not so . There - was no danger of-free coinage ; there was , indeed , no possibility of it . A bill for it passed the Senate . It was rejected in the House . If it had been passed by the House , Mr. HARRISON could still have vetoed it , and that would have killed it . The Sherman bill was cooked up in conference committee , - not. to prevent free coinage , but to prevent damage to the Republican Party . That is the spirit in which such men as Mr. ALDRICH are now acting . We confess that we have much more respect for outspoken advocates of silver , though , of course , we have still more for the advocates of honest money who are not afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of the people to sustain them .
