/1* fWhe Firft Preficlent of the United States *-e by Woo drow Wi13oi* THE members of the new Congress were so laggard in coming together that it was the 6th of April , 1789 , before both Houses could count a quorum , though the 4th of March had been appointed the day for their convening . Their first business was the opening and counting of the electoral votes ; and on the 7th , Charles Thomson , the faithful and sedulous gentleman who had been clerk of every congress since that first one in the old colonial ( lays fift*en years ago , got away on his long ride to Mount Vernon to notify Washington of his election . Affairs waited upon the issue of his errand . Washington had for long known what was coming , and was ready and resolute , as of old . There had been no formal nominations for the Presidency , and the votes of the electors had lain under seal till the new Congress met and found a quorum ; but it was an open secret who had been chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Mr. Thomson reached Mount Vernon on the 14th , and found Washington ready to obey his summons at once . He waited only for a hasty ride to Fredericksburg to bid his aged mother farewell . She was not tender in the parting . Her last days had come , and she had set herself to bear with grim resolution the fatal disease that had long been upon her . She had never been tender , and these latter days had added their touch of hardness . But it was a tonic to her son to take her farewell , none the less ; to hear her once more bid him God-speed , and once more command him , as she did , to his duty . On the morning of the 16th he took the northern road again , as so often before , and pressed forward on the way for New York . The setting out was made with a very heavy heart ; for duty had never seemed to him so unattractive as it seemed now , and his diffidence had never been so distressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reprieve , " lie had written to Knox , when he learned how slow Congress was in coming together , " for in confidence I tell you that my movements to the chair of government will be accompanied by feelings not unlike those of a culprit who is going to the place of execution . " When the day for his departure came , his diary spoke the same heaviness of heart . " About ten o'clock he wrote , " I bade adieu to Mount Vernon , to private life , and to domestic felicity ; and , with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations than I have words to express , set out for New York . " He did not doubt that he was // doing right ; he doubted his capacity in civil affairs , and loved the sweet retirement and the free life he was leaving behind him . It was a grief and a foreboding which did not in the least relax his proud energy and promptness in action . He was not a whit the less resolute to attempt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play it in masterful fashion . He was only wistful and full of a sort of manly sadness ; lacking not resolution , but only alacrity . He had hoped to the last that he would be suffered to spend the rest of his days at Mount Vernon ; he knew the place must lack efficient keeping , and fall once more out of repair under hired overseers ; he feared his strength would be spent and his last years come ere he could return to look to it and enjoy it himself again . He had but just now been obliged to borrow a round sum of money to meet pressing obligations ; and the expenses of this very journey had made it necessary to add a full hundred pounds to the new debt . If the estate brought money so slowly in while he farmed it , he must count upon its doing even- less while he was away ; and yet he had determined to accept no salary as President , but only his necessary expenses while in the discharge of his official duties , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressing perplexities upon him to be thus drawn from his private business to serve the nation . Private cares passed off , no doubt , and were forgotten as the journey lengthened . But the other anxiety , how he should succeed in this large business of statesmanship to which he had been called , did not pass off ; the incidents of that memorable ride only served to heighten it . When he had ridden to Cambridge that anxious summer of 1775 , lie had been hailed by cheering crowds upon the way , who admired the fine figure he made , and shouted for the cause he was destined to lead ; but he knew himself a soldier then , was but forty-three , and did not fear to find his duty uncongenial . The people had loved him and had thronged about him with looks and words it had quickened his heart to see and hear as he made his way from New York to Annapolis to resign his commission but six years ago ; but that was upon the morrow of a task accomplished , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed him the more happily homeward . Things stood very differently now . Though he felt himself grown old , lie had come out to meet a hope he could not share , and it struck a subtle pain to his heart that the people should so trust him-should give him so royal a progress as he fared on his way to attempt an untried task . No king in days of kings ' divinity could have looked for so heartfelt a welconie to his throne as this modest gentleman got to the office he feared to take . Not only were there civil f*te and military parade at every stage of the journey ; there was everywhere , besides , a running together from all the country round about of people who bore themselves not as mere sight-seers , but as if they had come out of love for the man they were to see pass by . It was not their numbers but their manner that struck their hero with a new sense of responsibility : their earnest gaze , their unpremeditated cries of welcome , their simple joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man they perfectly trusted . He was to be their guarantee of its good faith , of its respect for law and its devotion to liberty ; and they made him know their hope and their confidence in the very tone of their greeting . There was the manifest touch of love in the reception everywhere prepared for him . Refined women broke their reserve to greet him in the open road ; put their young daughters forward , in their enthusiasm , to strew roses before him in the way ; brought tears to his eyes by the very artlessness of their affection . When at last the triumphal journey was ended , the display of every previous stage capped and outdone by the fine pageant of his escort of boats from Newark and of his reception at the feri-y stairs in New York , the demonstration seemed almost more than lie could bear . " The display of boats which attended and joined us , " he confessed to his diary , " the decorations of the ships , the roar of the cannon , and the loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked along the streets , filled my mind with sensations as painful as they are pleasing ; " for his fears foreboded scenes the opposite of these , when he should have shown himself unable to fulfil the hopes which were the burden of all the present joy . It was the 27th of April when he reached New York . Notwithstanding his executive fashion of making haste , the // THOMSON , THE CLERK OF CONGRESS , ANNOUNCING TO WASHINGTON , AT MOUNT VERNON , HIS ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY . // rising of the country to bid him God-speed had kept him four days longer on the way than Mr. Thomson bad taken to carry the summons to Mount Vernon . Three days more elapsed before Congress had completed its preparations for his inauguration . On the 30th of April , in the presence of a great concourse of people , who first broke into wild cheers at sight of him , and then fell silent again upon the instant to see him so moved , Washington stood face to face with the Chancellor of the State upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took the oath of office . " Do you solemnly swear , " asked Livingston , " that you will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will , to the best of your ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States ? " " I do solemnly swear , ** replied Washington , " that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will , to the best of my ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States ; " and then , bending to kiss the Bible held before him , bowed his head and said , " So help me God ! " in tones no man could mistake , so deep was their thrill of feeling . " Long live George Washington , President of the United States ! " cried Livingston to the people ; and a great shout went up with the booming of the cannon in the narrow streets . Washington was profoundly moved , and , with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a company of friends , the Senators and Representatives who stood about him within the Senate chamber as he read his address , after the taking of the oath . Some very old friends were there -- men who had been with him in the first continental congress , men who had been his intimate correspondents the long years through , men who were now his close confidants and sworn supporters . Not many strangers could crowd into the narrow hall ; and it was not mere love of ceremony , hut genuine and heartfelt respect , that made the whole company stand while he read . He visibly trembled , nevertheless , as he stood in their presence , strong and steadfast man though he was , " and several times could scarce make out to read " ; shifted his manuscript uneasily from hand to hand ; gestured with awkward effort ; let his voice fall *jmost inaudible ; was every way unlike himself , except for the simple majesty and sincerity that shone in him through it all . His manner but gave emphasis , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude and difficulty of the trust , " he declared , " could not but overwhelm with despondence one who , inheriting inferior endowments from nature , and unpractised in the duties of civil administration , ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies ; " and no one there could look at him and deem him insincere when lie added , " All I dare aver is , that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected . All I dare hope is , that if in executing this task I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances , or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens , and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me , my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me , and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality with which they originated . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " the smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right , which Heaven itself has ordained ; and the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty , and the destiny of the republican model of government , are justly considered as deeply , perhaps as finally , staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people . " It was , no doubt , " a novelty in the history of society to see a great people turn a calm and scrutinizing eye upon itself , " as the people of America had done ; " to see it carefully examine the extent of the evil " into which disunion and disorder had brought it ; " patiently wait for two years until a remedy was discovered ; " and at last voluntarily adopt a new order and government " without having wrung a tear or a drop of blood from mankind " ; but Washington knew that the praise deserved for such mastery amid self-possession would be short-lived enough if the new government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he himself would be chiefly responsible for its success or failure that shook his nerves as he stood there // qwq legory in which virtue was personified as addressing those whom she would make her votaries . Her power over the heart was never greater , and the illustration of her doctrine by her own example was never more perfect . " " I feel how much I shall stand in need of the countenance and aid of every friend to myself , of every friend to the Revolution , and of every lover of good government , " were Washington 's words of apl ) eal to Edward Rutledge , of South Carolina ; and he never seemed to his friends more attractive or more noble than now . The inauguration over , the streets fallen quiet again , the legislative business of the Houses resumed , Washington regained his old self-possession. and turned to master his new duties with a calm thoroughness of purpose which seemed at once to pass into the action of the government itself . Perhaps it was true , as he thought , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known him would have declared themselves of another mind . He had carried the affairs of the confederation upon his own shoulders , while the war lasted , after a fashion the men of that time were not likely to forget , so full of energy had he been , so provident and capable upon every point of policy . His letters , too , since the war ended , had shown his correspondents the country over such an appreciation of the present , so sure a forecast of the future , so masculine an understanding of what waited to be done and of the means at hand to do it , that they , at least , would have accounted him their leader in peace no less than in war . But statesmanship hitherto had been only incidental to his duties as a soldier and a did not know his own abilities , or realize how rich his experience in affairs had been . He went about Ilis new tasks with diffidence , thlerefore , but with the fullpulsed heartiness of the man who thoroughly trusts hinisehf for tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statesmanship was now his duty-his whole duty-and it was his purpose to understand and execute the office of President as lie had understood and administered the army . He knew what need there was for caution . This was to be , " in the first instance , in a considerable degree , a government of accommodation as well as a government of laws . Much was to be done by prudence , much by conciliation , much by firmness . " " I walk , " he said , " on un trodden ground . There is scarcely an action the motive of which may not be subjected to a double interpretation . There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent . " But though he sought a prudent course , lie had no mind to be timid . Thou* , h lie asked advice , lie meant to be his own master . THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL MANSION , At Pearl and Cherry Streets , New Yerk. // Washington had , no doubt , a more precise understanding of what the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man living , except , perhaps , Hamilton and Madison , the men whom he most consulted . The confederation had died in contempt , despised for its want of dignity and power . The new government must deserve and get pre-eminent standing from the first . Its policy must make the States a nation , must stir the people out of their pettiness as colonists and provincials , and give them a national character and spirit . It was not a government only that was to be created , but the definite body of opinion also which should sustain and perfect it . It must be made worth believing in , and the best spirits of the country must be rallied to its support . It was not the question simply of how strong the government should be . Its action must , as Washington said , be mixed of firmness , prudence , and conciliation if it would win liking and loyalty , as well as respect . It must cultivate tact as well as eschew weakness ; must win as well as compel obedience . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man it had chosen to preside in this delicate business of establishing a government which should be vigorous without being overbearing was a thoroughbred gentleman , whose instincts would carry him a great way towards the solution of many a nice question of conduct . While he waited to be made President , he called upon every Senator and Representative then in attendance upon Congress , with time purpose to show them upon how cordial and natural a basis of personal acquaintance he wished , for his part , to see the government conducted ; but the oath of office once taken , he was no longer a simple citizen , as lie had been during those two days of waiting ; the dignity of the government had come into his keeping with the office . Henceforth lie would pay no more calls , accept no invitations . On a day fixed he would receive calls ; and he would show himself oiice a week at Mrs. Washington 's general receptions . He would invite persons of official rank or marked distinction to his table at suitable intervals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inaccessibility . The President should be a repubbean officer , the servant of the people ; but lie would not be common . It should be known that his office and authority were the first in the land ; and this outward form of dignity , ceremony , and selfrespect should tell , as he knew it would , very wholesomely upon the imagination of the people ; should be the visible sign , which no man could miss , that there was here no vestige of the old federal authority , at which it had been the fashion to laugh , but a real government , and that the grea.test in the land . It was not that the President was not to be seen by anybody who had the curiosity to wish to see him . Many a fine afternoon he was to be seen walking , an unmistakable figure , upon the Battery , whither all persons of fashion in the town resorted for their daily promenade , his secretaries walking behind him , but otherwise unattended . Better still , he could be seen almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets . People drew always aside to give him passage wherever he went , whether lie walked or rode ; no doubt there was something in his air and bearmo ' which seemed to expect them to do so ; but their respect had the alacrity of affection , and he would have borne himself with a like figure in his own Virginia . Some thought him stiff , but only the churlish could deem him unrepubhican so evident was it to every candid man that it was not himself but his office that he was exalting . His old passion for success was upon him , and he meant that this government of which lie had been made the head should have prestige from the first . Count de Moustier , the French Minister to the United States , deeming America , no doubt , a protdg* of France , claimed the right to deal directly with the President in person , as if upon terms of familiar privilege , when conducting his diplomatic business ; but was checked very promptly . It was not likely a man bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so obvious a point of etiquette as this . To demand intimacy was , to intimate superiority , and Washington 's reply drew from the Count an instant apology . That the United States had every reason to hold France in loyal affection Washington gladly adrmiitted with all stately courtesy ; but affection became servility when it lost self-respect , and France must approach the President of the United States as every other country did , through the properly constituted . department . " If there are // rules of proceeding , " he said , quietly , " which have originated from the wisdom of statesmen , and are sanctioned by the common assent of nations , it would not be prudent for a young state to dispense with them altogether , " - particularly a young state ( his thought added ) which foreign states had despised and might now try to patronize . These small matters would carry an infinite weight of suggestion with them , as he knew , and every suggestion that proceeded from the President should speak of dignity and independence . For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters that marked its temper and its self - respect were of as much consequence as its laws or its efficient organization for the tasks of actual administration . The country evidently looked to Washington to set the tone and show what manner of government it was to , have . Congress , though diligent and purposeful enough , could linger , meanwhile , the whole sum* iner through upon its task of framing the laws necessary for the erection and organization of departments of state , for foreign affairs , of the treasury , and of war , and the creation of the office of attorney-general - a simple ad miii istrative structure to suffice for the present . In the interval the treasury board of the confederation and its secretaries of war and foreign affairs were continued in service , and the President found time to digest the business of the several departments preparatory to their reorganization . He sent for all the papers concerning their transactions since the treaty of peace of 1783 , and mastered their contents after his own thorough fashion , making copious notes arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks in office when he was stricken with a sharp illness . A malignant tumor in his thigh seemed to his physicians for a time to threaten mortification . It was three weeks before he could take the air again , stretched painfully at length in his coach ; even his stalwart strength was slow to rally from the draught made upon it by the disease , and its cure with the knife . There was deep anxiety for a little among those who knew , so likely did it seem that the life of the government was staked upon his life . He himself had looked very calmly into the doctor 's troubled face , and had bidden him tell him the worst with that placid firmness that always came to him in moments of danger . " I am not afraid to die , " he GOVERNMENT HOUSE , AT THE BATTERY , NEW YORK , 1790. // said . " Whether to-night or twenty years hence makes no difference . I know that I am in the hands of a good Providence . " A chain had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lay , to check the noisy traffic that might have disturbed him more deeply in his fever . But the government had not stood still the while . He had steadily attended to important matters as he could . T was scarcely necessary he should be out of bed and abroad again to make all who handled affairs feel his mastery ; and by the time the summer was ended that mastery was founded upon knowledge . He understood the affairs of the new government , as of the old , better than any other man ; knew the tasks that waited to be attempted , the questions that waited to be answered , the difficulties that awaited solution , and the means at hand for solving them , with a grasp and thoroughness such as made it impossible henceforth that any man who should be called to serve with him in executive business , of whatever capacity in affairs , should be more than his counsellor . He had made himself once for all head and master of the government . By the end of September ( 1789 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn his permanent advisers about him . The Federal courts , too , had been erected and given definitive jurisdiction . The new government had taken distinct shape , and was ready to digest its business in detail . Washington chose Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury , Henry Knox as Secretary of War , Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State , and Edmund Randolph as Attorney-General-young men all , except Jefferson , and lie was but forty-six . The fate of the government was certain to turn , first of all , upon questions of finance . It was hopeless poverty that had brought the confederation into deep disgrace ; the new government had inherited from it nothing but a great debt ; and the first test of character to which the new plan in affairs would be put , whether at home or abroad , was the test of its ability to sustain its financial ci-edit with businesslike thoroughness and statesmanlike wisdom . Alexander Hamilton was only thirty-two years old . He had been a spirited and capable soldier , and an astute and eloquent advocate ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration of a great governmental department , and had never handled-so far as men knew , had never studied-questions of public finance . Washington chose him , nevertheless , without hesitation , for what must very likely turn out to be the most critical post in his administration . No man saw more clearly than Washington did how large a capacity for statesmanship Hamilton had shown in his masterly papers in advocacy of the Constitution . He had known Hamilton , moreover , through all the quick years that had brought him from precocious youth to wise maturity ; had read his letters and felt the singular power that moved in them ; and was ready to trust him with whatever task he would consent to assume . Henry Knox , that gallant officer of the Revolution , had been already four years Secretary of War for the confederation ; in appointing him to the same office under the new Constitution Washington was but retaining a man whom he loved and to whom lie had for long been accustomed to look for friendship and counsel . He chose Thomas Jefferson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the young state because , John Adams being Vice-President , there was no other man of equal gifts available who had bad so much experience in the field of diplomacy . Again and again Jefferson had been chosen for foreign missions under the confederation ; he was American minister to France when Washington*s summons called him to the Secretaryship of State ; and he came of that race of Vii-ginian statesmen from whom Washington might reasonably count upon receiving a support touched with personal loyalty . Richard Henry Lee , Patrick Henry , and George Mason were homekeeping spirits , and doubted of the success of the new government ; but Jefferson , though he had looked upon its mnaking from across the seas , approved , and was ready to lend his aid to its successful establishment . In appointing Edmund Randolph to be Attorney - General , Washington was but choosing a brilliant young man whom lie loved out of a great family of lawyers who had held a sort of primacy at the bar in Virginia ever since he could rememberalmost ever since she had been called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He studiously contrived to make it everywhere felt , nevertheless , by every turn of ceremonial and behavior , that he had come not as the hero of the Revolution , but as the President of the United States . At Boston , Governor Hancock sought by cordial notes and pleas of illness to force Washington to waive the courtesy of a first call from him , and so give the executive of Massachusetts precedence , if only for old friendship 's sake . But Washington would not be so defeated of his errand ; forced the perturbed old patriot to come to him , swathed as he was in flannels , and borne upon men 's shoulders up the stairs ; received hini with grim courtesy ; and satisfied the gossips of the town once and for all that precedence belonged to the Federal government-at any rate so long as George Washington was President . Having seen him and feted him , the Eastern towns had seen and done homage to the new authority set over them . Washington was satisfied , and returned with a noticeable accession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No man stood closer to Washington in his purpose to strengthen and give prestige to the government than Hamilton , and no man was able to discover the means with a surer genius . Hamilton knew who the well - wishers of the new government were , whence its strength was to be drawn , what it must do to approve itself great and permanent , with an insight and thoroughness Washington himself could not match : for Hamilton knew Washington and the seats of his strength in the country as that self-forgetful nian himself could not . He knew that it was the commercial classes of the WASHINGTON . After the painting by Edward Savage . // country-such men as he had himself dwelt among at the great port at New York - who were bound by self-interest to the new government , which promised them a single policy in trade , in the stead of policies a half-score ; that the men who were standing to its support out of a reasoned prudence , out of a high-minded desire to secure good government and a place of consideration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals merely , to be found only in small groups here and there , where a special light shone in some minds ; that Washington was loved most for his i*ational character and purpose amongst the observant middle classes of substantial people in the richer counties of Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York , and New England , while his neighbors in the South loved him with an individual affection only , and rather as their hero than as their leader in affairs ; that both popular support and international respect were to be had most surely by giving to the government at once and in the outset a place of command in the business and material interests of the country . That policy every man could comprehend ; that policy a great body of energetic and influential men would support ; that alone could make the government seem real from the first  --  a veritable power , not an influence and a shadow merely . Here was a man , unquestionably , who had a quick genius in affairs ; and Washington gave him leave and initiative with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and equally originative could have given . Hamilton 's measures jumped with Washington 's purpose , ran with Washington 's perception of national affairs , and were with Washington 's aid put into execution with a promptness which must have surprised the friends of the new government no less than it chagrined and alarmed its enemies . Having done its work of organization during its first summer session , the Congress came together again , January 4 , 1790 , to attempt the formulation of a policy of government , and Hamilton at once laid before it a " plan for the settlement of the public debt , " which he had drawn and Washington had sanctioned . He proposed that provision should be made for the payment of the foreign debt in full -- that of course ; that the domestic debt , the despised promVOL . XcIII. - No. 558-92 ises and paper of the Confederation , should be funded and paid ; and that the debts contracted by the several States in the prosecution of the war for independence should be assumed by the general government as the debt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt must be paid in full : to that Congress agreed heartily and without hesitation . But there was much in the rest of the plan to give prudent men pause . To pay off the paper of the Confederation would be to give to the speculators , who had bought it up in the hope of just such a measure , a gratuity of many times what they had paid for it ; to assume the State debts would be taken to mean that the States were bankrupt or delinquent , that the Federal government was to be their guardian and financial providence , and that the capital of the country must look only to the government of the nation , not to the government of the States , for security and profitable employment . This was nationalizing the country with a vengeance , and was a plain bid , besides , to win the moneyed class to its support . Members whose constituencies lay away from the centres of trade looked askance at such measures , and deemed them no better than handing the government over to the money-lenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had prevailed in the adoption of the Constitution itself , and both measures were carried through the Houses  --  the first at once , the second after a close and doubtful struggle-by stratagem and barter . Jefferson had been in France when Washington called him to assume the headship of foreign affairs at home ; had not reached New York on his return voyage until December 23 , 1789 ; and did not take his place in ' Washington 's council till March 21 , 1790 . All of Hamilton 's great plan had by that time passed Congress , excePt the assumption of the State debts . Upon that question a crisis had been reached . It had wrought Congress to a dangerous heat of feeling . Members from the South , where trade was not much astir , and financial interests told for less than local pride and sharp jealousy of a too great central power , were set hotly against the measure ; most of the Northern members were as hotly resolved upon its adoption . Mr. Jefferson must have caught echoes and rumors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjust his private affairs before entering upon his duties in the cabinet . The measure had been lost at last in the House by the narrow margin of two votes ; but the minority were in no humor to submit . They declined to transact any business at all till they should be yielded to in this matter . There were even ugly threats to be heard that some would withdraw from Congress and force a dissolution of the Union rather than make concessions upon the one side or the other . It was to this pass that things had come when Mr. Jefferson reached the seat of government ; and his arrival gave Hamilton an opportunity to show how consummate a politician he could be in support of his statesmanship . The Southern members wanted the seat of the Federal government established within their reach , upon the Potomac , where Congress might at least be rid of importunate merchants and money-lenders clamoring at its doors , and of impracticable Quakers with their petitions for the abolition of slavery ; and were almost as hot at their failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to find themselves defeated upon the question of the State debts . Mr. Jefferson was fresh upon the field , was strong amongthe Southern members , was not embroiled or committed in this quarrel . Hamilton besought him to intervene . The success of the government was at stake , he said , and Mr. Jefferson could pluck it out of peril . Might it not be that the Southern men would consent to vote for the assumption of the State debts if the Northern members would vote for a capital on the Potomac ? The suggestion came as if upon the thought of the moment , at a chance meeting on the street , as the two *ien walked and talked of matters of the day ; but it was very eloquently urged . Mr. Jefferson declared he was " really a stranger to the whole subject , " but would be glad to lend what aid he could . Would not Mr. Hamilton dine with him the next day , to meet and confer with a few of the Southern members ? In the genial air of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the diners agreed to vote for the assumption of the State debts if Mr. Hamilton could secure a majority for a capital on the Potomac ; and Congress presently ratified the bargain . There was not a little astonishment at the sudden clearing of the skies . The waters did not go down at once ; hints of a scandal and of the shipwreck of a fair name or two went about the town and spread to the country . But Congress had come out of its angry tangle of factions , calm had returned to the government , and Hamilton 's plan stood finished and complete . He had nationalized the government as he wished . It was this fact that most struck the eye of Jefferson when he had settled to his work and had come to see affairs steadily and as a whole at the seat of government . He saw Hamilton supreme in the cabinet and in legislation - not because either the President or Congress was weak , but because Hamilton was a master in his new field , and both Congress and the President had accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had himself assisted at Hamilton 's triumph , had himself made it complete , indeed . He could not easily brook successful rivalry in leadership ; must have expected to find himself , not Hamilton , preferred in the counsels of a Virginian President ; was beyond measure dismayed to see the administration already in the hands , as it seemed , of a man just two months turned of thirty-three . He began erelong to declare that he had been most ignorantly and innocently made to hold the candle " to the sharp work of the Secretary of the Treasury , having been " a stranger to the circumstances " ; but it was not the circumstances of which he had been ignorant ; it was the effect of what he had done upon his own wish to play the chief role in the new government . He did not like the assumption of the State debts when lie came to a calm scrutiny of the matter ; and , what was more serious for a man of political ambition , it was bitterly distasteful to the very men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties should form . He felt that he had been tricked ; he knew that he had already been outrun in the race for leadership . What he did not understand or know how to reckon with was the place and purpose of Washington in the government . Hamilton had been Washington 's aide and confidant when a lad of twenty , and knew in what way those must rule who served under such a chief . He knew that Washington must first be convinced and won ; did not for a moment doubt that the President held the reins and was // master ; was aware that his own plans had prospered both in the making and in the adoption because the purpose they spoke was the purpose Washington most cherished . Washington had adopted the fiscal measures as his own ; Hamilton 's strength consisted in having his confidence and support . Jefferson very soon found that leadership in the cabinet was to be had , not by winning a majority of the counsellors who sat in it , but by winning Washington . That masterful man asked counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own judgment did not approve . He had chosen Hamilton because he knew his views , Jefferson only because he knew his influence , ability , and experience in affairs . When he did test Jefferson 's views he found them less to his liking than he had expected . He had taken Jefl'erson direct from France , where for five years he had been watching a revolution come on apace , hurried from stage to stage , not by statesmen who were masters in the art and practice of freedom , like those who had presided in the counsels of America , but by demagogues and philosophers rather ; and the subtle air of that age of change had crept into the man 's thought . He had come back a philosophical radical rather than a statesman . He had yet to learn , in the practical air of America , what plain and steady policy must serve him to win hard-headed men to his following , and Washington found him a guide that needed watching . Foreign affairs , over which it was Jefferson 's duty to preside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , where Jefferson 's thought was so much engaged . The Vyear 1789 , in which America gained selfpossession and set up a government soberly planned to last , was the year in which France lost self-possession and set out upon a wild quest for liberty , which was to cost her both her traditional polity and all the hopes she had of a new one . In that year broke the storm of the French Revolution . It was a dangerous infection that went abroad from France in those first days of her ardor , and nowhere was it more likely to spread than in America . " Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive ; But to be young was very heaven ! 0 times In which the meagre , stale , forbidding ways Of custom , law , and statute took at once The attraction of a country in romance ! When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights When most intent on making of herself A prime Enchantress , to assist the work Which then was going forward in her name ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty wore of promise , that which sets ( As at some moment might not . be unfelt Among the bowers of paradise itself ) The budding rose above the rose full blown . " Was not this spirit that had sprung to such sudden might in France the very spirit that had made Amei-ica free , her people sovereign , her government liberal as men could dream of ? and was not France now more than ever America 's friend and close ally against the world ? T would be niggardly to grudge her aid and love to the full in this day of her emulation of America 's great example . The Bastille was down , tyranny at an end , Lafayette the people 's leader . The gallant Frenchman himself could think of nothing more appropriate than to send the great key of the fallen fortress to Washington . But Washington 's vision in affairs was not obscured . He had not-I led revolutionary armies without a knowledge of what revolution meant . " The revolution which has been effected in France , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly realize the fact " - his calm tones ringing strangely amidst the enthusiastic cries of the time . " I fear , though it has gone triumphantly through the first paroxysm , it is not the last it has to encounter before matters are finally settled . The revolution is of too great a magnitude to be effected in so short a space and with the loss of so little blood . " He hoped , but did not believe , that it would run its course without fatal disorders ; and he meant , in any case , to keep America from the infection . She was herself but " in a convalescent state , " as he said , after her own great struggle . She was too observant still , moreover , of European politics and opinion , like a province rather than like a nation-inclined to take sides as if she were still a child of the European family , who had flung away from her mother England to cling in pique to an ancient foe . Washington 's first and almost single object , at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of the Union a veritable nation independent , at any rate , and ready to be great when its growth should come , and its self-knowledge . " Every true friend // to this country , " he said at last , " must see and feel that the policy of it is not to embroil ourselves with any nation whatever , but to avoid their disputes and their politics , and , if they will harass one another , to avail ourselves of the neutral conduct we have adopted . Twenty years ' peace , with such an increase of population and resources as w* have a right to expect , added to our remote situation from the jarring powers , will in all probability enable us , in a just cause , to bid defiance to any power on earth ; " and such were his thought and purpose from the first . " I want an American character , " he cried , " that the powers of Europe may be convinced we act for ourselves , and not for others . " He had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it should form , under his care , an independent character . It was thus he proved himself no sentimentalist , but a statesman . It was stuff of his character , this purpose of independence . He would have played a like part of self-respect for himself among his neighbors on the Virginian plantations ; and he could neither understand nor tolerate the sentiment which made men like Jefferson eager to fling themselves into European broils . Truly this man was the first American , the men about him provincials merely , dependent still for their life and thought upon the breath of the Old World , unless , like Hamilton , they had been born and had stood aloof , or , like Gouverneur Morris . had divined Europe in her own capitals with clear , unenamoured eyes . Fortunately affairs could be held steadily enough to a course of wise neutrality and moderation at first , while France 's revolution wrought only its work of internal overthrow and destruction ; and while things went thus , opinion began slowly to cool . T was plain to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work being done in France bore no real likeness at all to the revolution in America ; and wise men began to see it for what it was , a social distemper , not a reformation of government-effective enough as a purge , no doubt ; inevitable , perhaps ; a cure of nature 's own devising ; but by no means to be taken part in by a people not likewise stricken , still free to choose . At first Washington and a few men of like insight had stood almost alone in their cool self-possession . Every man of generous spirit had deemed it his mere duty to extol the French , to join clubs after their manner , in the name of the rights of man , to speak everywhere in praise of the revolution . By the time it became necessary to act , however - to declare the position and policy of the nation 's government towards France - a sober second thought had come , and Washington 's task was a little simplified . The crisis came with the year 1793 . In 1792 France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack the King 's palace , declared herself a republic , and put her monarch on trial for his life . The opening days of 1793 saw Louis dead upon the scaffold ; England , Holland , Spain , and the Empire joined with the alliance against the fevered nation ; and war , as it were , spread suddenly to all the world . Would not America succor her old ally ? Was there no compulsion in the name of liberty ? Would she stand selfishly off to save herself from danger ? There was much in such a posture of affairs to give pause even to imperative men like Washington . Those who favored France seemed the spokesmen of the country . The thoughtful men , to whom the real character of the great revolution oversea was beginning to be made plain , were silent . It would have required a veritable art of divination to make out the real sentiment of the country , upon which , after all , the general government must depend . " It is on great occasions only , and after time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held , " that the real voice of the people can be known ; " but a great risk must be run in waiting to know it . The measures already adopted by the government , though well enough calculated to render it strong , had not been equally well planned to make it popular . The power to tax , so jealously withheld but the other day from the Confederation , tIme new Congress had begun promptly and confidently to exercise upon a great scale , not only laying duties upon imports , the natural resource of the general government , but also imposing taxes upon distilled spirits , and so entering the fiscal field of the States . Not only had the war debts of the States been assumed , but a national bank had been set up ( 1791 ) , as if still further to make the general government sure of a complete mastery in the field of finance . Jefferson and Randolph had fought the measure in the cabinet , as // many a moderate man had fought it in Congress , and Washington had withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to urge . But he had sent their arguments to Hamilton for criticism , and had accepted his answer in favor of the bank . Jefferson and Randolph had challenged the measure on the ground that it was without warrant in the Constitution , which nowhere gave Congress the right to create corporations , fiscal or other . Hamilton replied that , besides the powers explicitly enumerated , the Constitution gave to Congress the power to pass any measure necessary and proper** for carrying those set forth into execution ; that Congress was itself left to determine what might thus seem necessary ; and that if it deemed the erection of a bank a proper means of executing the undoubted financial powers of the government , the constitutional question was answered . By accepting such a view Washington sanctioned the whole doctrine of " implied powers , " which Jefferson deemed the very annulment of a written and explicit constitution . No bounds , Jefferson believed , could be set to the aggressive sweep of congressional pretension if the two Houses were to be given leave to do whatever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding powers . No man could doubt , in the face of such measures , what the spirit and purpose of Hamilton were , or of the President whom Hamilton so strangely dominated . Strong measures bred strong opposition . When the First *Congress came together there had seemed to be no parties in the country . All men seemed agreed upon a fair and spirited trial of the new Constitution* But an opposition had begun to gather before its two years ' term was out , and in the Second Congress party lines grew definite - not for and against the Constitution , but for and against an aggressive use of constitutional powers . There was still a majority for the principal measures of the administration , but the minority had clearly begun to gather force both in the votes and in the debates . The reaction was unmistakable . Even Madison , Washington 's stanch friend and intimate counsellor , who had at first been his spokesman in the House , began to draw back-first doubted and then opposed the policy of the Trcasury . He had led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasy to note the course affairs were taking . It looked as if the administration were determined of set purpose to increase the expenses of the government , in order that it might add to the loans which were so acceptable to influential men of wealth , and double the taxes which made the power of the government so real in the eyes of the people . Steps were urged to create a navy , to develop an army with permanent organization and equipment , and the President insisted upon vigorous action at the frontiers against the western Indians . This was part of his cherished policy ; it was his way of fulfilling the vision that had long ago come to him , of a nation spreading itself down the western slopes of the mountains and over all the broad reaches of fertile land that looked towards the Mississippi ; but to many a member of Congress from the quiet settlements in the east it looked like nothing better than a waste of men and of treasure . The President seemed even a little too imperious in the business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook delay in the consideration and adoption of what he proposed in such matters . When things went wrong through the fault of the commanders he had sent to the frontier , he stormed in a sudden fury , as sometimes in the old days of the war , scorning soldiers who must needs blunder and fail . The compulsion of his will grew often a little irksome to the minority in Congress , and the opposition slowly pulled itself together , as the months went by , to concert a definite policy of action . Washington saw as plainly as any man what was taking place . He was sensitive to the movements of opinion ; wished above all things to have the government supported by the people 's approval ; was never weary of writing to those who were in a position to know , to ask them what they and their neighbors soberly thought about questions and policies under debate ; was never so impatient as to run recklessly ahead of manifest public opinion . He knew how many men had been repelled by the measures he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set in , that even to seem to repulse France and to refuse her aid or sympathy would surely strengthen it . The men who were opposed to his financial policy were also the men who most loved France , now she was mad with revolution . They were the men who dreaded // a strong government as a direct menace to the rights alike of individuals and of the separate States , the men who held a very imperative philosophy of separatism and revolt against too great authority . If he showed himself cold towards France , he would certainly strengthen them in their charge that the new government craved power and was indifferent to the guarantees of freedom . But Washington 's spirit was of the majestic sort that keeps a great and hopeful confidence that the right view will prevail , that the " standard to which the wise and honest will repair " is also the standard to which the whole people will rally at last , if it be but held long and steadily enough on high to be seen of all . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if in indifference to opinion . It was the outbreak of war between France and England that made it necessary he should let the country know what he meant to do . " War having actually commenced between France and Great Britain , " he wrote to Jefferson in April , 1793 , " it behooves the government of this country to use every means in its power to prevent the citizens thereof from embroiling us with either of those powers , by endeavoring to maintain a strict neutrality . I therefore require that you will give the subject mature consideration , that such measures as shall be deemed most likely to effect this desirable purpose may be adopted without delay . .... Such other measures as may be necessary for us to pursue against events which it may not be in our power to avoid or control you will also think of , and lay them before me at my arrival in Philadelphia , for which place I shall set out to-morrow . " He was at Mount Vernon when he despatched these instructions ; but it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consult his cabinet , and to issue a proclamation of neutrality whose terms no man could mistake . It contained explicit threat of exemplary action against any who should presume to disregard it . That very month ( April , 1793 ) Edmond Charles Genet , the youth still in his twenties whom the new republic over-sea had commissioned minister to the United States , landed at Charleston . It pleased him to take possession of the country , as if it were of course an appanage of France . He was hardly ashore before he had begun to arrange for the fitting out of privateers , to issue letters of marque to American citizens , and to authorize French consuls at American ports to act as courts of admiralty in the condemnation of prizes . As he journeyed northward to Philadelphia he was joyfully confirmed in his views and purposes by his reception at the hands of the people . He was everywhere dined and toasted and fated , as if he had been a favorite prince returned to his subjects . His speeches by the way rang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly mad with the sense of power , and had no conception of his realsituation till he stood face to face with the President . Of that grim countenance and cold greeting there could be but one interpretation , and the fellow winced to feel that at last he had come to a grapple with the country 's government . It was , no doubt , in the eyes of the sobering man , a strange and startlihg thing that then took place . The country itself had not fully known Washington till then  --  or its , &gt; own dignity , either . It had deemed the proclamation of neutrality a party measure , into which the President had been led by the enemies of France , the partisans of England . But the summer undeceived everybody , even Genet . Not content with the lawless mischief he had set afoot on the coasts by the commissioning of privateersmen , the mad youth had hastened to send agents into the south and west to enlist men for armed expeditions against the Floridas and against New Orleans on the coveted Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted slowly , deliberately even , with that majesty of self-control , that awful courtesy and stillness in wrath , that had ever made him a master to be feared in moments of sharp trial . One by one the unlawful prizes were seized ; justice was done upon their captors ; the false admiralty courts were shut up ; the army of the United States was made ready to check the risings in the south and west , should there be need ; the complaints of the British minister were silenced by deeds as well as by words ; the clamor of those who had welcomed the Frenchman so like provincials was ignored , though for a season it seemed the voice of the country itself ; and the humiliating work , which ought never to have been necessary , was at last made effective and complete . Towards the close of June , Washington // ventured to go for a little while to Mount Vernon for rest . At once there was trouble . A privateer was found taking arms and stores aboard in the very river at Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing Genet instead of the agents of the government ; and she was upon the point of getting to sea before Washington could reach the seat of government . Jefferson was not in town when the President arrived . " What is to be done in the case of the Little Sarah now at Chester ? " came Washington 's hot questions after him . " Is the minister of the French Republic to set the acts of this government at defiance with impunity * And then threaten the executive with an appeal to the people ? What must the world think of such conduct , and of the government of the United States in submitting to it ? Circumstances press for decision , and as you have had time to consider them , I wish to know your opinion upon them even before to-morrow , for the vessel may then be gone . " It was indeed too late to stop her ; a gross violation of neutrality had been permitted under the very eyes of the Secretary of State . Washington staid henceforth in Philadelphia , in personal control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that finally delivered Genet into his hands . Washington revoked the exequatur of one Duplaine , French consul at Boston , for continuing to ignore the laws of neutrality . Genet declared he would appeal from the President to the sovereign State of Massachusetts . Rumors of the silly threat got abroad , and Genet demanded of the President that he deny them . Washington answered with a chilling rebuke ; the correspondence was given to the public prints ; and at last the country saw the French minister for what he was . A demand for his recall had been resolved upon in the cabinet in August ; by February , 1794 , the slow processes of diplomatic action were complete , and a successor had arrived . Genet did not venture to return to his distracted country , but he was as promptly and as readily forgotten in America . Some might find it possible to love France still , but no one could any longer stomach Genet . Washington had divined French affairs much too clearly to be for a moment tempted to think with anything but contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The affairs of France , " he said to Lee , in the midst of Genet 's heyday , " seem to me to be in the highest paroxysm of disorder ; not so much from the presence of foreign enemies , but because those in whose hands the government is in trusted are ready to tear each other to pieces , and will more than probably prove the worst foes the country has . " It was his clear perception what the danger would be , should America be drawn into the gathering European wars , that had led him to accept a second term as President . It had been his wish to remain only four years in the arduous office : but he had no thought to leave a task unfinished , knew that he was in the very midst of the critical business of holding the country to the course which should make it a self-respecting nation , and consented to submit himself once more to the vote of the electors . Parties were organizin* , but there was no opposition to Washington . He received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen Vice-President . The second inauguration ( March , 1793 ) seemed but a routine confirmation of the first . But the elections to Congress showed a change setting in . In the Senate the avowed supporters of the administration had still a narrow majority , but in the House they fell ten votes short of control ; and Washington had to put his policy of neutrality into execution against the mad Genet with nothing but doubts how he should be supported . T was the insane folly of Genet , however , that saved the President serious embarrassment , made the evidence that he was right too plain to be missed by anybody , and gave the country at last vision enough to see what was in fact the course of affairs abroad , within and without unhappy France . Before that trying year 1793 was out , an attack upon Hamilton in the House , though led by Madison , had failed ; Jefferson had left the cabinet ; and the hands of those who definitely and heartily supported the President were not a little strengthened . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , than their differences of view ; but the " federalists , " who stood to the support of Washington and Hamilton , were able , none the less , to carry their more indispensable measures-even an act of neutrality which made the President 's policy the explicit law of the land . // The sober second thought of the country was slowly coming about to their aid . The air might have cleared altogether had the right method of dealing with France been the only question that pressed ; but the ill fortune of the time forced the President to seem not only the recreant friend of France , but also the too complacent partisan of England . Great Britain seemed as mischievously bent upon forcing the United States to war as Genet himself had been . She would not withdraw her garrisons from the border posts ; it was believed that she was inciting the Indians to their inroads , as the French had done in the old days ; she set herself to destroy neutral trade by seizing all vessels that carried products of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would admit American vessels to her own West Indian harbors only upon sufferance and within limits of the most jealous restriction . It gave a touch of added bitterness to the country 's feeling against her that she shpuld thus levy , as it were , covert war upon the Union while affecting to be *t peace with it , as if she counted on its weakness , especially on the seas ; and Congress would have taken measures of retaliation which must certainly have led to open hostilities , had not Washington intervened , despatching John Jay , the trusted Chief Justice , across sea as minister extraordinary , to negotiate terms of accommodation , and so given pause to the trouble . While the country waited upon the negotiation , it witnessed a wholesome object-lesson in the power of its new government . In March , 1791 , Congress had passed an act laying taxes on distilled spirits ; t was part of Hamilton 's plan to show that the federal government could and would use its great authority . The act bore nowhere so hard upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , beyond the mountains , and there the very allegiance of the people had been but the other day doubtful , as Washington very well knew . How were they to get their corn to market over the long roads if they were not to be permitted to reduce its bulk and increase its value by turning it into whiskey ? The tax seemed to them intolerable , and the remedy plain . They would not pay it . They had not been punctilious to obey the laws of the States ; they would not begin obedience now by submitting to the worst laws of the United States . At first they only amused themselves by tarring and feathering an exciseman here and there , but resistance could not stop with that in the face of a government bent upon having its own way . Opposition organized itself and spread , till the wr.its of federal courts had been defied by violent mobs , and the western counties of Pennsylvania were fairly quick with incipient - insurrection . For two years Washington watched the slow gathering of the storm , warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for action when the right time should come , letting all the country know what was afoot and preparing its mind for what was to come . It must have won him to a stern humor to learn that seven thousand armed men had gathered in mass-meeting on Braddock 's field to defy him . At last he summoned an army of militia out of the States , sent it straight to the lawless counties , going with it himself till he learned there would be no serious resistance , and taught the country what was back of federal law . Hamilton had had his way , the country its lesson . " The servile copyist of Mr. Pitt thought he must have his alarms , his insurrections and plots against the Constitution , " sneered Jefferson . " It aroused the favorite purposes of strengthening government and increasing the public debt ; and therefore an insurrection was announced and proclaimed and armed against and marched against , but could never be found . And all this under the sanction of a name which has done too much good not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The powers of the executive of this country are more definite , and better understood , perhaps , than those of any other country , " Washington had said , " and my aim has been , and will continue to be , neither to stretch nor to relax from them in any instance whatever , unless compelled to it by imperious circumstances ; " and that was what he meant the country to know , whether the law 's purpose was good or bad . The next year the people knew what Mr. Jay had done . He reached New York May 28 , 1795 , and the treaty he brought with him was laid before the Senate on the 8th of June . On the 2d // of July the country knew what he had agreed to and the Senate bad ratified . There was an instant outburst of wrath . It swept from one end of the country to the other . The treaty yielded so much , gained so little , that to accept it seemed a veritable humiliation . The northwestern posts were , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English and American territory were to be determined by commissioners ; nnrestricted commerce with England herself and a free direct trade with her East Indian possessions were conceded ; but not a word was said about the impressment of American seamen . American claims for damages for unjust seizures in the West Indies were referred to a commission , along with American debts to Englishmen ; the coveted trade with the West Indian Islands was secured only to vessels of seventy tons and under , and at the cost of renouncing the right to export sugar , molasses , coffee , cocoa , or cotton to Europe . Washington agreed with the Senate that ratifications of the treaty ought not to be exchanged without a modification of the clauses respecting the West Indian trade , and October VOL. xcm. - No. 558-93 had come before new and better terms could be agreed upon ; but he had no doubt that the treaty as a whole ought to be accepted . The opposition party in Congress had refused to vote money for an efficient navy , and had so made it impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty as better , at any rate , than war . It was hard to stand steady in the storm . The country took fire as it had done at the passage of the Stamp Act . Harder things had never been said of King and Parliament than were now said of Washington and his advisers . Many stout champions stood to his defence , none stouter or more formidable than Hamilton , no longer a member of the cabinet-for imperative private interests had withdrawn him these six months and more  --  but none the less redoubtable in the field of controversy . For long , nevertheless , the battle went heavily against the treaty . Even Washington for once stood a little while perplexed , not doubting his own purpose , indeed , but very anxious what the outcome should be . Protests against his signing the treaty poured in upon him from CONGRESS HALL , 1T90 -- 1500. // every quarter of the country , many of them earnest almost to the point of entreaty , some hot with angry comment . His reply , when he vouchsafed any , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in the past fixed him but the more firmly in his resolution to deserve it now by obeying his own conscience . " It is very desirable , " he wrote to Hamilton , " to ascertain , if possible , after the paroxysm of the fever is a little abated , what the real temper of the people is concerning it ; for at present the cry against the treaty is like that against a mad dog ; " but he showed himself very calm to the general eye , making , his uneasiness known only to his intimates . The cruel abuse heaped upon him cut him to the quick . " Such exaggerated and indecent terms , " he cried , " could scarcely be applied to a Nero , a notorious defaulter , or even to a common pickpocket . " But the men who sneered and stormed , talked of usurpation and impeachment , called him base , incompetent , traitorous even , were permitted to see not so much as the quiver of an eyelid as they watched him go steadily from step to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm cleared ; the bitter months were over ; men at the ports saw at length how much more freely trade ran under the terms of the treaty , and WASHINGTON MANSION , 190 MARKET STREET , rMiLADELPHIA. remembered that while they had been abusing Jay and maligning the President , Thomas Pinckney had obtained a treaty from Spain which settled the Florida boundary , opened the Mississippi without restriction , secured a place of deposit at New Orleans , and made cominerce with the Spaniards as free as commerce with the French . The whole country felt a new impulse of prosperity . The " paroxysm of the fever " was over , and shame came upon the men who had so vilely abused the great President as to make him wish , in his bitterness that he were in his grave rather than in the Presidency ; who had even said that he had played false in the Revolution and had squandered public moneys ; who had gone beyond threats of impeachment and dared to hint at assassination ! They saw the end of his term approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienated his great spirit forever . When he had seen parties forming in his cabinet in the quiet days of his first term as President , he had sought to placate differences , to bring Hamilton and Jefferson to a cordial understanding which should be purged of partisan bias , as he meant his own judgments to be ; had deemed parties unnecessary , and loyalty to the new Constitution the only standard of preferment to office . But lie had come to another mind in the hard years that followed . " I shall not , whilst I have the honor to administer the government , bring a man into any office of consequence knowingly , " lie declared in the closing days of 1795 , " whose political tenets are adverse to the tenets which the general government are pursuing ; for this , in my opinion , would he a sort of political suicide ; " and lie left the Presidency ready to call himself very flatly a " Federalist " - of the party that stood for the Constitution and abated nothing of its powers . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE UNITED STATES . more white , " he cried , " as to change the principle of a profest Democrat ; he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the government of the country . " Affairs fell very quiet again as the last year of his Presidency drew towards its close . Brisk trade under the new treaties heartened the country more and more the turbulent Democratic clubs that had so affected French principles and French modes of a , itation were sobered and discredited , now the reign of terror had come and wrought its bloody work in France ; the country turned once more to Washington with its old confidence and affection , and would have had him take the Presidency a third time , to keep the government steady in its new ways . But he would not have it again .

Then they and all the crowd in the streets moved after him , an immense company , going as one man , " in total silence , " his escort all the way . He turned upon the threshold of the President 's lodgings and looked , as if for the last time upon this multitude of nameless friends . " No man ever saw him so moved . " The tears rolled unchecked down Iris cheeks ; and when at last lie went within , a great smothered common voice went through the stirred throng , as if they sohbed to see their hero go from their sight forever .

He was obliged to sell no less than fifty thousand dollars ' worth of his lands in the course of four or five years to defray the great expenses he was put to in the Presidency and the cost of bringing his estate into solvent shape again . He did not try to begin things anew ; lie only set them in order , and kept his days serene . A spark of war was kindled by the new ad ministration 's deali n gs with France , and Washington was called once more to prepare for corn rnand , should the fighting leave the sea and come ashore . But formal war did not come . The flurry only kept him a little nearer the movements of politics than he cared to be . He was the more uneasy to see how the Democrats bore themselves in the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that party to places of command in the army ; approved the laws passed against aliens and against those who should utter seditious libels against the government ; showed again and without reserve how deeply his affections were eiio'ao'ed on the side of the institutions he had so labored to set up and protect ; was intolerant towards all who sought to touch or question at any point their new authority iniperious as of old iii questions of action . But it was his home that chiefly held his thought now . He had not changed towards his friends through all the years of public care and engrossing business . An old comrade , who had come in his rough frontier dress all the way from far Kentucky to Philadelphia to see the President , had been told " that Washington had become puffed up with the importance of his station , and was too much of an aristocrat to welcome him in that garb . " But the old soldier was not daunted , and went back to tell his friends how the President and his lady had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rushed to the door to draw him cordially in . " I never was better treated , " he said . " I had not believed a word against him , and I found that.he was Old Hoss ' still . " T was the same with his neighbors , and with strangers too . He was the simple gentleman of the old days . A strolling actor , riding Mount Vernon way on a day in July , stopped to help a man and woman who had been thrown from their chaise , and did not recognize the stalwart man who galloped up to his assistance till the overturned vehicle had been set up again , they had dusted each the other 's coats , and the stately stranger , saying he had had the pleasure of seeing lAm play in Philadelphia , had bidden him come to the house yonder and be refreshed . Have I the honor of addressing General Washington ? " exclaimed the . astonished player . " An odd sort of introduction , Mr. Bernard , " smiled the heated soldier ; " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so active a part in private , and without a prompter . " Those who saw him now at Mount Vei*-non thought him gentler with little children than Mrs. Washington even , and remembered how he had always shown a like love and tenderness for them , going oftentimes out of his way to warn them of danger , with a kindly pat on the head , when lie saw them watching the soldiers in the war days . Now all at Mount Ver THE OLD TOMB , MOUNT VERNON . // non looked forward to the evening . That " was the children 's hour . " He bad written sweet Nelly Custis a careful letter of advice upon love matters , half grave , half playful , in the midst of his Presidency , when the troubles with England were begin ning to darken ; she had always found him a comrade , and bad loved him with an intimacy veryfew could know . Nowsbe was to be married to his OWfl sister 's son and upon his birthday , February 22 , 1799 . She begged him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French war , at her wedding ; but he shook his head , and donned instead the worn buff and blue that had seen real campaigns . Then the delighted girl told him , with her arm about his neck , that she loved him better in that . The quiet days went by without inci ( lent . He served upon a petty jury of the county when summoned , arid was more than content to be the simple citizen again , great duties put by , small ones diligently resumed . Once and again Ii is anger flamed at perverse neglects and tasks ill done . Even while lie was President he had stornied to find his horses put to the chariot with unpolished hoofs upon a day of ceremony . But old age and the consciousness of a life-work done had added serenity now to his self-control ; and at last the end came , when he was ready . Oii the 12th of December , 1799 , he was chilled through by the keen winds and cold rain and sleet that beat upon him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening cheerfully , listening to his secretary read , but went to bed with a gath ering hoarseness and cold , and woke in the night sharply stricken in his throat . Physicians came almost at dawn , but the disease was already beyoiid their control . Nothing that they tried could stay it , and by evening the end had come . He was calm the day through , as in a time of battle , knowing what betided , but not fearing it , steady , noble , a warrior figure to the last , dying as those who loved him might have wished to see him die . The country knew him when he was dead-knew the niajesty , the nobility , the unsullied greatness of the man who was gone  --  and knew not whether to mourn or give praise . He could not serve them any more , but they saw his light shine already upon the future as upon the past , and were glad .
