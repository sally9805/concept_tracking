Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : THE GREAT BLUE HERON A WARNING from Stories and poems for children ( 1895 ) The great blue heron stood all alone By the edge of the solemn sea On a broken boulder of gray trap stone ; He was lost in a reverie . And when I climbed the low rough wall At the top of the sloping beach , To gather the driftwood great and small , Left scattered to dry and bleach , I saw as if carved from the broken block On which he was standing , the bird Like a part of the boulder of blue-gray rock , For never a feather he stirred . I paused to watch him . Below my breath " O beautiful creature , " I cried , " Do you know you are standing here close to your death , By the brink of the quiet tide ! " You can not know of the being called Man ! The lord of creation is he , And he slays all earth 's creatures wherever he can In the air or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospitable friend ! If he sees Some wonderful , beautiful thing That runs in the woodland , or floats in the breeze On the bannerlike breadth of its wing , " Straight he goes for his gun , its sweet life to destroy . For mere pleasure of killing alone He will ruin its beauty and quench all its joy Though ' t is useless to him as a stone . " Then I cried aloud , " Fly ! before over the sand This lord of creation arrives With his shot and his powder and gun in his hand , For the spoiling of innocent lives ! " Oh , stately and graceful and slender and tall The Heron stood silent and still , As if careless of warning and deaf to my call , Unconscious of danger or ill . " Fly ! fly to some lonelier place , and fly fast ! To the very North Pole ! Anywhere ! " Then he rose and soared high , and swept eastward at last , Trailing long legs and wings in the air . " Now perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sail away , Beauty , fast as you can ! Put the width of the earth and the breadth of the sea Betwixt you and the Being called Man . " Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : THE LOST BELL A LEGEND OF THE ISLAND OF RGEN IN THE BALTIC SEA from Stories and poems for children ( 1895 ) " Oh , where is my bell , " sighed the brownie , " My sweet , sweet silver bell , That tinkled and swung from my scarlet cap ; Now who in the world can tell ? " On the plain in the island of Rgen Danced the delicate fairy folk , And the tiny bell from the tiny cap Its curious fastening broke . The shepherd boy Fritz next morning , Driving his wandering sheep ' Mid the scattered stones of the Giants ' graves Saw the pretty plaything peep Sparkling among the heather , And fastened it to himself ; For how could he know that the bell belonged To an underground little elf ? But the elf was in such trouble ! Aye , wandering up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , With the tears on his cheek of brown . For while it was missing , no slumber Might visit the fairy 's eyes ; Still must he sleepless fill the air With mournful wails and cries . " Oh , who has borne off my treasure From the ground where it did lie ? Is it raven or crow or jackdaw ? Or magpie noisy and sly ? " Then he changed his shape to a beautiful bird , And over the land he flew , Over the waters of Ralov , And the fields of green Unruh . He searched the nest of all the birds , He talked with them , great and small , But never a trace of the little bell , Could the brownie find at all . To the green , green fields of Unruh Went Fritz to pasture his sheep , For the place was sunny and fair and still And the grass grew thick and deep . The bird flew over . The sheep bells , Soft tinkling , sounded low ; The wee fay thought of his talisman lost , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened : " Now what can that queer bird be ? If he thinks their bells make my cattle rich , Why , what would he think of me ? " Then he drew forth from his pocket The treasure that he had found , And the magic silver rang out clear With a keen delicious sound . The sprite in the bird 's shape heard it , And fairly shook with delight , Dropped down behind a bush near by , Hid safely out of sight . Swift drew off his dress of feathers , And took the shape of a crone Who hobbled up to the shepherd lad , And spoke in a coaxing tone : " Good-even , good friend , good-even ! What a charming bell you ring ! I ' d like such an one for my grandson  --  Will you sell me the pretty thing ? " " No , no , for there is n't another In the whole wide world so fine ; My sheep will follow its tinkle , And ask for no other sign . " Oh , listen ! Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariest hour ' t will ring away , And conquer a heart of stone . " The old dame offered him money , A glittering golden heap , But Fritz stood firm ; " Nay , nay , " he said , " My sweet , sweet bell I 'll keep . " Then a shepherd staff she showed him , Most beautiful to see , Of snow-white wood all wrought and carved ; " Take this , and the bell give me . " So long as you guide your cattle With this you will surely thrive , And all good fortune will follow Wherever your flocks you drive . " She reached him the stick . Her gesture , So mystic , bewitched him quite , So strange and lovely her dazzling smile , He was blind in its sudden light . He stretched out his hand and , " Take it , The bell for the staff , " he cried . Like a light breeze over the fields and trees The old crone seemed to glide . She was gone like the down of a thistle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny whir like a whistle thin Set all his hair on end . The staff was his , but the bell was gone , Spirited quite away ; Fritz looked at his prize with doubtful eyes  --  But who so glad as the fay ? And he kept his fairy promise , And Fortune to Fritz was kind , For all his labors prospered , And all things worked to his mind . Before he was eighteen , mark you , His flocks were his own to keep , And soon in the island of Rgen He was master of all the sheep . At last he was able to purchase A knight 's estate , and became A nobleman stately and gracious , With a loved and honored name . Now would n't you like , little people , Such a fairy treasure to find ? Pick up from the grass such a magic bell And meet with a brownie so kind ? Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : IN THE LILAC-BUSH from Stories and poems for children ( 1895 ) Oh , look , where the lilac-bush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Is hiding a robin 's nest close to the wall , Softly piled with the light white snow ! Pray you , be careful , dear little folk gay . Spare the snug house that the pretty bird made ; Do n't throw the storm of your snowballs this way , And in April your care will be more than repaid . For back with the spring your small neighbor will flit Straight to his nest in the lilac-bush tall , Here ' mid the buds on the bough he will sit And talk to his mate with sweet twitter and call . Do n't you remember his glowing red breast , And his olive brown coat and his shining black eyes ? How he works for his dinner and watches his nest , A citizen sober and happy and wise ! Just out of the window you 'll have but to peep Into the nest , such a wonder to see ! The heaven-blue eggs , lying still and asleep , So soon all astir with the birdlings to be ! Think of the joy of that beautiful sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green leaves And the rich purple flowers ,  --  a world of delight All safely shut in ' neath the sheltering eaves ! Be careful , children , and kind in your play ; Protect his dear home for the brave little bird ; Do n't charge with the storm of your snowballs this way , And when April comes back his sweet thanks will be heard . Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : A POPPY SEED from Stories and poems for children ( 1895 ) " Tell you a story , " my beautiful dear , " Of nixies , and pixies , and fairies with wings ? " Well , curl up close in the corner here , And I 'll show you more astonishing things ! I give you this small white packet to hold . " It rustles , " you say . Both the ends are sealed . Patience a moment , and you shall be told Of the hundreds of captives that lie concealed In this little paper . " What , living things ? " Yes , full of life . " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful ,  --  they have no wings , But your lightest breathing will blow them about . There , one in your warm pink palm I lay : You hardly can see it ! " Does anything hide In that wee atom of dust ? " you say . Yes , wonderful glory is folded inside ! Robes , my dear , that are fit for kings ; Scarlet splendor that dazzles the eyes ; Buds , flowers , leaves , stalks ,  --  so many things ! You look in my face with doubting surprise , And ask , " Is it really , truly true ? " No fairy story at all this time ! Do n't you remember the poppy that grew At the foot of the trellis where sweet peas climb , Last summer , close to the doorstep , where You and I loved to sit in the sun , And see the butterflies float in the air When the long bright day was almost done ? Do n't you remember what joy we had Watching that poppy grow high and higher , In its lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaks of fire , And next day  --  oh ! it was all ablaze ; Three or four flowers at once outburst In the early sun 's low , golden rays  --  And you were down at the doorstep first  --  And what magnificence met our sight ! What a heavenly time we had , we two , Just adoring it , lost in delight ! For the gray-green leaves were spangled with dew , And the flowers , like banners of silken flame Unfurled , stood each on its slender stem , While the soft breeze over them went and came , Lightly and tenderly rocking them . Dearest , do n't you remember it all ? How still it was ! Not a whisper of sound , Till a bird sang out from the garden wall , And you slid from the step and stood on the ground , And the poppy was higher than your bright head ! Gently downward one flower you bent To see in the midst of its burning red The delicate greens in a glory blent . Bronze-green pollen on glowing rays From a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our gaze ,  --  You have n't forgotten that exquisite sight ? No , indeed ! I was sure of it ! Well , All that perfection of shape and hue , That wealth of beauty no tongue can tell , Lies hid in this seed I have given to you . Just such a speck in the friendly ground I planted last May by the doorstep wide ; The selfsame marvel that then we found This atom of dust holds shut inside . You ca n't believe it ? But all are there ,  --  Leaves , roots , flowers , stalks , color , and glow ; Tell me a story that can compare With this for a wonder , if any you know ! Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : BE LOVELY WITHIN from Stories and poems for children ( 1895 ) Little Evelyn 's cheeks bloomed in delicate pink , And her clustering hair framed with tendril and curl A face so lovely you never would think She could be for a moment a cross little girl . Yet cross she was , in a constant fret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Till every one said : " Well , I never have met Such an ill-natured child in the whole of my life !

" and " I wo n't ! " that was Evelyn 's cry From morning till night , against all she was told ; While Peggy 's low voice would be saying , " I 'll try , " With a patience and hope that were good to behold . Till at last Peggy 's freckles more beautiful grew In every one 's sight than all Evelyn 's charms Of pink cheeks , golden hair , and eyes violet blue ; No one wished to fold her in affectionate arms !

Love found her wherever she went , Clasped her warm little hand and looked into her eyes , Smiled on her and blessed her with joy and content , For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind , children dear , about plainness of face , But strive all you can to be lovely within , And the beautiful spirit will clothe you with grace , And this is a joy every mortal can win . Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : THE UNBIDDEN GUEST from Stories and poems for children ( 1895 ) Oh , sweetly the robin warbled , wooing his little mate Till she twittered her joyous answer ,  --  he had not long to wait ! Oh , the air was warm and spicy , there was sunshine and soft showers ; To and fro they flitted gayly through the changeful April hours . They chose a quiet pine-tree and began to weave their nest Where a forked branch gave support on which their cosy home to rest . And happy , happy , happy , they worked from morn till night , Making the fragrant air to ring with carols of delight . With straws and sticks and twigs and threads and scraps and plastering clay , And bits of leaves and wool and shreds they worked the livelong day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in presently The lovely turquoise-colored eggs like jewels fair to see . They sought their dainty dwelling with the dawn 's first rosy light ; Oh , horror ! What was this strange thing that met their startled sight ! Their pretty woven cradle cup was filled up to the brim With a huge cold mottled tree-toad , blinking o'er its tidy rim ! So well content , so much at home his lazy toadship seemed ! While o'er him fluttered both the birds and scolded loud and screamed , And dashed at him with angry claw , and pecked with sharpened beak , Striving with all their tiny might vengeance on him to wreak . In vain , he would not budge an inch ! He liked it much too well ; So lazy , if he breathed or no , you could n't really tell . The frantic little house-builders took counsel thoughtfully , Once more they swooped with ruffled plumes upon their enemy . And strove to hoist him o'er the edge , prying with beak and head And strenuous shoulder , but he lay heavy as lump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair upon a bough they sat , And gazed down at their hated guest , so ugly and so fat , And in their sweet bird language excitedly they talked , Debating eagerly how best that big toad could be balked . At last they settled it . They swept down on the nest again , With wrath and fury in their hearts , and then with might and main , Working below it swift they tore their cunning masonry Piecemeal from underneath the toad reposing stupidly ! Crumbled the clay , outflew the shreds , the straws were scattered wide . Larger and larger grew the hole as fast their work they plied . Until at last a slip , a crash ! Down came that clammy toad Thump ! on the ground , and quawk ! quoth he , and hopped across the road , And hid him in the grass , while high above his head the birds Sang Victory ! triumphantly , as plain as human words ! But they could not bear the sight of that dear ruined home of theirs , The centre of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turned away and flew afar , and built another nest , And let us hope were spared the woe of such another guest ! Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : SIR WILLIAM PEPPERRELL 'S WELL ISLES OF SHOALS , A. D. 1790-1892 from Stories and poems for children ( 1895 ) Little maid Margaret and I , All in the sweet May weather , Roamed merrily and peacefully The island slopes together . The sun was midway in the west That golden afternoon ; The sparrow sat above his nest And sang his friendly tune . The sky was clear , the sea was calm , The wind blew from the south And touched us with a breath of balm , And kissed her happy mouth . The joyful , smiling little maid ! Her pretty hand in mine ,  --  " Look , Thea , at the flowers , " she said . " See how the eyebrights shine ! " Scattered like pearls all milky fair Where'er our feet were set , They glimmered , swayed by gentle air , For little Margaret . And here the crowfoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream-white buds with fragrance filled , And all for Margaret . I took a grassy path that led Into a rocky dell . " Come and I 'll show you , dear , " I said , " Sir William Pepperrell 's well . " In the deep shadow of the rock The placid water hid , And seemed the sky above to mock Arums and ferns amid . " Is this Sir William Pepperrell 's well ? But , Thea , who was he ? " " A nobleman , the records tell , A lord of high degree . " " And did he live here ? " " Sometimes , yes ; Yonder his house stood , dear , By all the scattered stones you 'd guess A dwelling once stood here . " There lie the doorsteps large and square , Where feet went out and in Long years ago ; a broken stair ; And here the walls begin . " " How long ago did they live here ? " Gravely the small maid spoke ; " And tell me , did you know them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A hundred years they have been dead ,  --  No , dear , we never met ! " " But , Thea , you 're so old , " she said , " You know you might forget ! " I 'm only six , I 'm very new , I ca n't remember much . " She clasped me , as she nearer drew , With light and gentle touch . " Tell me , where are they now ? " asked she . Oh , question ages old ! " That , Margaret , is a mystery No mortal has been told . " Here stood the house , there lies the well , And nothing more we know , Except that history 's pages tell They lived here long ago . " With serious eyes she gazed at me . And for a moment 's space A shadow of perplexity Flitted across her face . Then dancing down the sunlit way She gathered bud and bell , And ' mid its ferns forgotten lay Sir William Pepperrell 's well .

The earth in silent snows is bound ; Want grinds and pain oppresses ; Life 's awful problems who shall sound ? Its riddles sad who guesses ? But oh , the sky is blue , And oh , the sun is bright !

Then be careful to choose from the myriads of wonderful seeds The caskets that lock up delight , and beware of the weeds ! If you sow nettles , alas for the crop you will reap !

For days together through the trackless skies , Steadfast , without a quiver of his plumes , Without a moment 's pause for rest he flies Through dazzling sunshine and through cloudy glooms . Down the green gulfs he slides , or skims the foam , Searching for booty with an eager eye , Hovering aloft where the long breakers comb O'er wrecks forlorn that topple helplessly . He loves the tempest , he is glad to see The roaring gale to heaven the billows toss , For strong to battle with the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

She smiles with welcome sweet , She speaks in accents mild ; Enter with willing feet And the heart of a little child . So shall you treasures find Better than lands or gold , Friends that are true and kind , Love that is wealth untold . Humbly my lessons learn , So shall you wisdom gain Deep peace your soul shall earn Through the discipline of pain . Hark to the New Year 's voice With its promise of hope and cheer ! Courage , brave hearts , rejoice ! For God is always near . Skies may be dark with storm , While fierce the north wind blows , Yet earth at heart is warm , And the snowdrift hides the rose .
