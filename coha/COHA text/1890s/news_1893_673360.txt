All demonstrations on the road to-day have been sharply warned off , and special preparations , rare in Germany , have been made to secure him against fatigue and notice on the journey . I am told that there is no special ailment threatening his life , but that his own settled . moody belief in the fatal character of his illness persistently baffles and neutralizes Dr. Schweninger 's skill He has taken William 's proffered sympathy with such bad grace that any further personal demonstrations of it will be difficult , though the Emperor will through officials maintain a public show of interest in his health . While item an international point of view everybody is waiting for next Saturday 's opening sensation at Toulon , leisure is being filled up with sundry curious speculations about Spain . This sudden uproar in Morocco , as reported by the Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of garrisons in revolted Texas holding out against bewildering odds . There is nobody on the spot to give any but the Spanish side , and all that outsiders can know is that Malaga is swarming with mobilized troops , and its harbor bustling with martial and naval preparations big enough for the subjugation of the whole empire of Morocco . It is only natural that people should put this side by side with the recent rapprochement between Madrid and Paris . an d the current reception of the Russian fleet at Cadiz , and suspect that Spain will be promised a free hand in Africa if she will listen to the arguments against the triple alliance . There is another of these suspicions rife at Berlin which involves the United States . It is believed that France intends pushing the project of a ship canal between the Malay Peninsula and Siam to a swift completion , in which case the coaling station Roheainit , which she has offered to give to Russia , will become of immediate and great importance on the British sea route from Singapore and Hongkong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our joining Spain in backing her demands for the privilege of building this canal . But Berlin in these nervous days believes many queer things and suspects more . England 's African war , which now has definitely begun , will not , after all , be waged under the disadvantage of opposition at home . Up to a few weeks ago there was a powerful party here who set their faces resolutely against allowing , and much less helping , Cecil Rhodes and his titled company promoters to wage war on Lobengula , but the alleged fact that thirty of these blacks fired some scattering shots at the Bechuanaland police and then ran of into the bush has changed the whole situation here , and nobody now will say a word against wiping Lobengnla off the face of the earth . It is true that we may learn some years later that it was the police who fired the shots , or that the entire story was made up by the company agents at the Cape , who have complete control of the telegraphs and of local public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a securely settled part of the British Empire , and the way it came about will be as much ancient history as Clive 's exploits . It promises to be a bigger war , though , than that with the Zulus . Apparently there is going to be trouble in Bulgaria again , and this time of a strictly domestic origin . Prince Ferdinand 's young wife , a true type of the narrow-minded , egotistical , and bigoted Italian Bourbons , has been evoking ridicule among the simple Slavic people ever since she came to Sofia by her efforts to ape the pomp and display of a lofty imperial Court in that humble capital of pig dealers . This was foolish enough , but the indications are now that she has succeeded in fomenting mischief between her husband and Stambuloff , who , in a big , rough , and strong-handed way , is really the creator and master of Bulgaria as we know it to-day . He made Ferdinand and can unmake him again any day he likes . I think you have seen the monastic crank , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention here , and at the Church Congress of 1889 he was quite the lion of the day , winning remarkable unanimity of applause . His success seemed to reconcile him to the world , and he began at once putting on comfortable flesh and attained an almost rubicund visage . With this , however , his popularity slumped off sadly , so that he has felt the importance of making a fresh demonstration on the old lines . He attended the Birmingham Church Congress this week , clad in a cowl and a girdled gown , to denounce the principal author of " Lux Mundi . " The President would not let him speak , and after exciting scenes a policeman came in and calmed Ignatius . The only other incident of the week 's sessions at all commanding public notice was the act of this President , the Bishop of Worcester , in going out of his way yesterday to attack the Institute of Journalists for welcoming to London Zola , whom his lordship described as a man who spent his life iu defiling and corrupting the minds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This luminous judgment was greeted with roaring cheers from clerics and laity alike . Royalty was not in any form represented at Dr. Jowett 's funeral at Oxford yesterday , which , notwithstanding . was one of the most comprehensive gatherings British scholarship and public life have seen in our time . Nobody comments publicly on this regal boycotting of the Master of Balliol 's funeral , but one of the funeral guests brought down from Oxford a theory he hoard there , to the effect that the Queen was angry because Dr. Jowett tried to do something  --  just what I I do not know  --  to promote his dear friend Swinburne 's candidate for the Laureateship . This vacancy has now begun its second year , and people have ceased talking of possible nominees , it being understood that if Mr. Swinburne can not have it no one else shall . Ford Madox Brown 's death would have been a more important event thirty years ago than it is now . He clung rigidly to Pre-Raphaelitism after others deserted it , like Millais , or died , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . Big-hearted Manchester did try to be good to him in his waning years , ordering from him big frescoes in its new Town HalL He went to his grave regarding them as his noblest work , but I am bound to say that practically everybody else laughs at them ; and now he is dead the chances are that before long some other artist will have a commission to cover them over . The most striking ethnological find for many years is reported from the Lower Danube in Hungary , where a graveyard of 500 Huns of the fourth century has been unearthed . A profusion of magnificent golden ornaments , belts , hilts , and harness trappings . has been found with Roman coins which definitely fix the date of interment . The contents of the tombs have much altered existing notions of Hunnish culture of that period . Though they were savage enough to slay and bury war horses with their chiets , of whose graves there are seven , they were civilized enough to have also wax tablets and a stylus for writing . The graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the skeletons are invariably nut l ; " . to the east .
