By ! Vi7/ia ; , i Ordwai I*a ; t ; idge . . E sculptor who has added one more to the half dozen really great equestrian statues which the world possesses has done something worth while , and his name will surely be remembered . He has lived to some purpose . In this short review of the work of Thomas Ball I ask the reader to consider the life as well as the works of this eminent sculptor and what such a life means to the world and to the man who lives it . This age , in its search for truth , feels a just interest in the life of a man who produces true things . It goes behind the art creation to the artist who creates it , and it is but right that the world should do so , for in understanding the purpose and import of a man 's life we arrive at a more sympathetic appreciation and understanding of his work . It will be necessary to glance briefly at the famous equestrian statues of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one sculptor in America who , in executing the Washington equestrian statue in the Boston Public Garden , has placed American art on a parallel here with the art of the Old World . First of all in importance is undoubtedly the Colleoni statue by Verrochio , in the Piazza of San Giovanni and San Paul in Venice . This is universally conceded to be the finest work in its entirety extant ; Ruskin has declared it to be the finest equestrian statue in the world . But in perfect justice to the present , we must say that the horse and rider , considered independently of the pedestal and picturesque surroundings , would not be admitted to any well-ordered exhibition of sculpture in the world to-day . The reader may say , so much the worse for the well-ordered sculpture of the present . But not so . This age of mag-291 nificent scientific achievement demands of the sculptor as well as of the artist in other lines of work a due regard for truth ; and the Colleoni horse , while decorative in outline and monumental in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . The action is impossible , the horse 's weight resting upon two legs on the same side of the body , and not upon the diagonal legs , as the horse actually does in nature when walking , as this horse is evidently doing . To make this action correct , the horse ought to be pacing . You will notice that in Fremiet 's statue of Jeanne d'Arc , which is perhaps the second of importance in the world , while the action is much the same as in Colleoni 's statue , the statue is true to nature in this respect , while the Colleoni is not . The reader then must appreciate that the artist of today and of thirty years ago , when Mr. Ball set up his statue , has certain problems to solve which Verrochio either disregarded or was ignorant of . The action of the Ball statue is correct ; and after all criticism has been made upon it , it stands there for all time as a complete embodiment of the idea , nobly conceived and firmly executed . The horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French sculptor Fremiet brings to his work ; but it may be doubted if the latter could produce a work as monumental . Is it not better to sacrifice the almost fatal cleverness of perfect technical execution rather than the essential , all-important quality which makes a work monumental ? In our review of the great equestrian statues , we must of course mention the statue of Marcus Aurelius , on the Capitoline hill at Rome , which , while correct in action , may be criticised in point of artistic rendering and fidelity to detail in nature . Returning to the Verrochio statue for a moment , it would seem as if Verrochio must have been familiar with the statue of Marcus Aurelius , because // the decorative outline and arrangement of the masses are much the same . The well-known statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin is a dignified and monumental work , and certainly deserves a place in even this restricted category of famous equestrian statues . Boehm 's statue of the Duke of Wellington in London is criticised by the English sculptors because Boehm , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduced the great Duke 's own thoroughbred , which belittles in its delicacy of outline and finesse of modelling the figure of the Duke , and seems thin and insufficient . We may justly mention the statue of Washington in Union Square in New York by our own Brown . This is essentially monumental and decorative . Ball has certainly fulfilled the eminent French sculptor Chapu 's definition of a monumental work when he said , " It must be a piece of architecture constructed on scientific as well as resthetic lines and treated as architecture rather than as familiar portrait sculpture . " There are men who can do very clever busts , but who can not produce an ideal head or a full-length figure ; they fail utterly when put to the test . Then againy WASHINGTON . IN THE PUBLIC GARDEN , IIOSTON. // there are sculptors who go so far as to make a successful statue , medheval or modern , and place it upon a pedestal ; but most of these have shown themselves incapable of placing a man upon a horse and giving organic artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make some mention of other interesting work , and some of more or less artistic merit , coming from the hand of Thomas Bali , I shall dwell especially upon the fact that he produced , while still a young man , his noble and great equestrian statue of Washington , and that he modelled this statue with almost no study abroad and while inspired by American ideas . Mr. Ball has lived to write an autobiography at the age of three score years and ten given to conscientious , industrious work . It recalls the times of Titian and Michael Angelo , when men lived into the eighties and nineties , producing fine work until the very end of life and growing in strength and beauty till its close . Thomas Ball drew his inspiration , like most of the men of his day , from the antique ; but he had the artistic taste and discernment to fill himself with the spirit of Greek art without falling into a servile imitation of its forms , which so many of his contemporaries did . His works show a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his shortcomings lies in this very fine quality . While there is more of modern feeling in Mr. Ball 's work than in that of almost any of his contemporaries , there is not enough of it to enable us to class him with men like St. Gaudens , French and Warner , who are , for better or for worse , essentially of the present . Some one has accounted for this fact by the accident of his having lived for so many years in a foreign land under foreign influences and in a city like Florence , which , while it is the most delightful place in the world , belongs so largely to the dead past , with whatever mighty inspirations , and to the dilettante atmosphere of cities where many tourists and amateurs make their winter homes . It is a great thing to walk about those narrow streets of Florence ; to stop before the narrow , rough-built house in a street still medieval and read upon the door , " Here was born Dante , the divine poet ; " to pass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mightiest man in modern art , Michael Angelo . Indeed , one can not pass through the streets of Florence without treading out history at every step . But when we consider what made those men great in their time and generation , we shall find that it was not in contemplating for any length of time the works of the men who had preceded them or in passing away their lives in other countries . They were men devoted heart and soul to the time in which they lived . They were martyred for those times in the best sense ,  --  driven into exile and put into prison because they insisted upon being heard and in taking an active part in the problems which related to the government and to their fellow men . But we are not to discuss this philosophical question in this brief essay . One thing is sure , that Mr. Ball produced his greatest work of art after he had given less than two years to serious study abroad and at a time , it is right to say , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher has well said that schools are made for those who need schooling . To learn the truth in the word helps save an artist and a man from the pedantry which paralyzes . The wisest men learn from the world about them . One of the greatest sculptors of Greece was almost entirely self-taught ; and who indeed shall guide one so wisely and so well as the genius within him ? Mr. Ball gives a most interesting account in his autobiography of his early life and struggles in and about Boston . There is something heroic in the way in which our early artists grappled with the unhappy or , let us say , undeveloped taste of our people , and attempted to bring something beautiful out of the bare , dry , sapless New England existence . It is well for us who come after to review occasionally this past , and give proper regard and due reverence to the pioneers who have made the way possible , if not easy , for the present and the future . They were men ; and I may mention with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crawford ( the father of our Marion Crawford ) , Palmer , John // Rogers , Randolph Rogers , and many others , - men of heroic mould , men whose tools many of the youngupstarts of to-day , fresh from the claque and clamor of the Parisian schools , carry as Sancho Panza might wield the sword of Bayard . DAVID . One thing which all men of true culture must admire in Thomas Pall is his largeness of spirit , his courage and his reaching out constantly for the greater things , no matter how far they lie beyond him . It takes a great man to see forever the illimitable kingdoms before him , which are his own if his character warrant the exchange . In glancing at the life of Thomas Pall , the first thing which impresses us , and the last , is his sterling honesty . It is a pure , consistent , brave life from beginning to end . At first we meet him , a delicate , sensitive child , born in Charlestown on the third of June , 1819 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the Greek was not far wrong in holding to be the chief good . I use gentle in its essential meaning . His memories of his father are those of a generous , honest and temperate man , never unkind . There is something touching about his having stopped one day on the Cambridge bridge with the little Tom , saying to the boy in a sad , half-dreamy way : " My boy , do you think you could ever learn to paint those waves ? " - which were tinged then with the golden splendor of the setting sun . The boy of six never forgot that saying of his father . It helped to make an artist of him . Had that father come into our New England life one generation later , he would no doubt have been as great an artist as the son . There is something inexpressibly sad about these men who , like Masaccio , painted and worked that those who came after might from their humble efforts produce some worthy and enduring art for America and the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these walls that shone For Raphael and for Angelo With secrets deeper than his own Then shrank into the dark again , And died , we know not how or when . " And is this , ' mused I , all ye earned , High vaulted brain and cunning hand , - That ye to greater men could teach The skill yourselves could never reach ? " Thoughts that great hearts once hroke for we Breathe cheaply in the common air. * In any case , the older Ball did what he could to encourge a love of art in // his sensitive child . It was rather odd that he should have taken the boy to the State House to see Chantrey 's statue of Washington . Little did the boy dream that he should some day produce a statue far superior to it . Though the young Ball had a certain gift for color , which gift or instinct was no doubt brought out by seeing his father execute the simple decorative work he was called upon to do for his daily bread , he had the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sculpture , one finds as a rule that the men who have pursued it successfully-bywhich I mean have produced great work- have been men simple in their tastes , of a religious nature , thoroughly honest and without wasting passions and desires which the color gift often inspires . Thomas Ball was all this and something more , - much more than one can tell in a brief sketch like the present . In his autobiography he lays his heart bare to us with childlike naivett* . He says : " All that I have written would seem to indicate a life frittered away without any serious thought , - which emboldens me to confess that my inner life has been earnest , conscientious and prayerful . Imbued with a strong faith in a Divinity that shapes our ends , ' my prayers have been constant , but simple . I have never prayed for wealth , I have never prayed for fame ; but fervently have I prayed to he guided in all my ways , to be kept from temptation , to be delivered from evil , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait . ' There are few men to-day who would have the frankness and courage to reveal so much of their inner life , if they had such an inner life to reveal . It sounds almost like the words of Michael Angelo , as Longfellow gives them : - " Who knows ? Who knows ? There are great truths that pitch their shining tents Outside our walls ; and though hut dimly seen In the gray dawn , they will he manifest When the light widens into perfect day . " In happy hours , when the imagination Waits like a wind at midnight , and the soul Tremhles at all its leaves , it is a joy To he uplifted on its wings , and listen To the prophetic voices in the air That call us onward . " I spoke of Mr. Ball 's capacity for doing good work in color . He himself states that the three primary colors , red , blue and yellow , are among his earliest recollections ,  --  the first , in the tall plume belonging to the uniform of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member ; the second , in the cellar door of the gunhouse on the training field , near the spot where he was born , and down which he used to slide with the neighboring boys ; and the third the color of the frock which he wore about that time . In one sense trivial , this is still interesting as pointing out the boy 's THE CHICKERING MONUMENT , MOUNT AUBURN . // artistic nature and his power of selection . To these pleasant , childish hours an ( l associations must be added the tragic days of grief , hunger and l ) Overty which followed fast upon them . Yet in his happy , calm sanity , Mr. Ball looks back upon this season of distress and anguish and the time when hunger stared the household in the face and death visited it , as a time in which the benignity of God stood behind the shadow . He believes that he escaped the temptations and perils which surround boyhood because of these privations and the fervid prayers of his mother . Up to the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especial artistic gift ; yet in the same breath he tells us that he was musical , - and he developed not a little mechanical ingenuity . He made all his own playthings , and in the boats which he carved we may trace the beginnings of his Washington statue . He recalls going down to the wharves and studying the graceful lines and proportions of the ships , then hurrying home to work some small model while the impression was fresh on his memory . He would make these journeys , often going three times a day , until he had formed a clear conception of an entire ship and reproduced it in miniature , with its spars , ropes and masts . This was a most happy order of study for the young artist , although he little appreciated it as such at that time . He could hardly have worked in a better school of art or life . Indeed , most of us make a great mistake in forever looking for precedent by which to guide our future . Shall we never learn that every life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ? - that no one has a right to say to this child , Make your life like that of Washington , C*sar or Lincoln ?  - -  that no one has the right to attempt to force a new life into old moulds ? - and that in such an attempt we hurt both the old and the new ? If we continue our education on this basis , trying to make the new children like the old ones , we shall produce - thinking now of the field of art - a host of drawing masters and modellers , but no artists and sculptors . It behooves us in our schools and lives to study every child that is placed before us with as much care as we study a rare flower found on the far mountain side or in the deepest glen .

His school days came practically to a close at the death of his father , when the boy was but twelve years old . There is one incident which occurred at this time so touchingly beautiful that we must mention it here . His mother , very fond of flowers , had made a small collection during the late summer , which were all destroyed by an untimely frost , with the exception of one hardy chrysanthemum. // I knew of a great sculptor in Rome , who one day tossed his flute out of the window , saying , " Enough of you and more of sculpture " It is a mooted question , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet produced , as to how much a man loses in one art by having some idea of the sister arts . One great artist has put himself on record as having said that " an artist should know a little of everything ; " and Thomas Ball himself writes that he is not sure hut that he would have produced better sculpture if he had been a better musician . It was a kind fate which led the boy one day down Court Street to the door post of the old New England Museum , on which post was displayed on that particular day a sign indicating that a boy was wanted upstairs . Our futures turn upon very small pivots ; and the career of Thomas Ball hung largely on that bit of paper displayed in front of the old museum . He applied , was accepted for the position of boy to do all the chores about the place , such as sweeping the floors , dusting the pictures , keeping clean the glass cases , and displaying the treasures of the museum to the visitors . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of his mechanical ingenuity , that he became indispensable to him . It was here that for the first time young Ball saw Dr. Holmes , who was pointed out to him as the celebrated surgeon and funny poet . Here the boy met all kinds of human beings , - artists , lawyers , ministers and the jolly proprietor of the place , who persuaded him to keep a journal . It was a bizarre school for the young artist , very much the same as the young Shakespeare found when he came up to London from Stratford , not such a one as the average boy is trained in , but forever the greatest and best school , - the world , the only school in which genius seems to have any chance to develop . In the old museum he made his first drawings ; and here occurred a romantic incident which we ought not to omit . He met for the first time Hiram Powers , who had played the same M/e - a boy of all work - in a Cincinnati museum , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Florence , first took Thomas Ball by the hand and welcomed him as a brother sculptor . It was now that he formed a distinct idea of becoming an artist ; and telling his mother of the purpose , she insisted on his consulting the superintendent of the museum , a certain portrait painter . Tbe painter 's reply was , that he would rather see him become a bricklayer than an artist . The poor man spoke from the bitterness of his experience . There are few artists , alas who wish their sons to become artists . It it a hard road to travel , even to-day ; and then it was as difficult as the mountain path which Pilgrim climbed , with the added discouragement and deterring advice of family and friend . cINcINNATUs. // To the credit of this same adviser and portrait painter we must say , however , that when he found young Ball steadily opposed to bricklaying , he decided to assist him as far as he could in his desire to become an artist . After some experience with the painter friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about Boston , young Ball took a small studio in an attic and started out for himself ; and putting his name on a small tin sign at the door , he gave the world to understand that he was a portrait painter . Providence sent some great-hearted people to that small studio , some who left him twice the modest price he asked for his artistic efforts . He had as a companion in those days George Fuller , who was destined to work out that beautiful technique which is as subtle and poetical as that of Breton , the master of twilight . We find young Ball pursuing his profession of portrait painting with all ardor and beginning to dream of a possible trip to Italy - actually laying by every spare dollar he could earn with the trip in view . His good mother had lived only long enough to guide the boy over the dangerous quicksands of the last days of youth . His four sisters had been married ; and he felt free to start out upon the journey alone . We now approach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of the auspicious day when he entered the old Boston museum as a boy of all work . An event occurred which led him to turn his thoughts from painting to the more difficult art of sculpture . When we ask him what made him change , he replies quite frankly that it was love ; and strangely enough it was a fit of despair at a refusal of an offer of marriage which led him , after a week of moodiness when his canvases were turned to the wall , to go to a friend 's studio , borrow a few pounds of clay , hurry back to his own workshop , and set to work to try to forget his anxieties under the calm and absorbing interests of modelling . He became absorbed in the work , and his hard luck and anguish were soon forgotten . A cure was effected , and he decided to adopt sculpture for a profession . His first successful bust was that of Jenny Lind . Her rendering of " Auld Robin Gray , " the pathos and sweetness of BLAcKsTONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the exquisite rendering of the words made a deep impression upon Ball . The morning after hearing her , he collected all the photographs he could find , and made a small sketch , which was pronounced by all judges a // remarkable likeness , lie could not produce copies of this bust fast enough to supply the demand , but was soon relieved of that necessity by an Italian image vender in New York , who reproduced and flooded the market at prices much below his own . His small busts became so popular that his time was fully taken up in filling orders . He now essayed a bust of Daniel Webster , with whose face he had been familiar for a long time and for whose genius he ABBL LISZT. had the greatest reverence . While he was working at the bust from whatever photographs he could obtain , Webster made that last visit to Boston on his way to Marshfield , and Ball stood on Tremont Street as he passed and studied his face for the last time . We may now consider Mr. Ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his painting and music taken up only as a diversion . Ball found he could model busts of life size as easily as the smaller ones , and this gave him greater freedom in work . He now began to earn sufficient money to consider with all seriousness a trip to Italy and further study there . He was married to a lady whose miniature he had painted when she was quite a child , and set sail for Europe in 1854 . In Florence he at once made the acquaintance of Joel T. Hart , the sculptor , who found him a home and a , studio ; and thus began his stay in Italy . Little did he dream that the larger part of his life would be passed there . One can hardly imagine a more delightful circle of acquaintances than was to be found at Florence at that time . There was Hiram Powers and his interesting family , the Brownings , Landor , I believe , Hart , and many others now famous in literature and art . It was during this stay of two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper that a project was on foot to erect an equestrian statue of Washington in Boston . He at once began to study the anatomy of the horse , intending on his return to make a model and enter as a competitor for the statue . The fact is that the committee had decided to engage Thomas Crawford to make the statue . On the death of Crawford , however , in 1857 , the matter of the statue was given up by its original projectors . Ball still believed that the matter would come up again , and went to work courageously upon a model of half life size . When this was finished , it was shown to a number of artists in Boston , and the opinion of its merits was so favorable that resolutions were unanimously adopted by the artists to the effect that a statue of Washington should be erected in some suitable // public place in Boston , that the statue should be the work of a resident artist and should be executed and cast in Massachusetts , and that the model for an equestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colossal scale , would be an enduring honor to the city . Orders now flowed in upon the sculptor . He was called to Philadelphia to model from life a bust of the great tragedian , Edwin Forrest . At the same time he was having a studio built on the premises of Chickering and Sons , the piano manufacturers , on Tremont Street , in which to model his great Washington . He gives a most interesting description of " this big barn of a studio , " - a rough wooden shell , sixty feet by forty feet and thirty feet high , built directly over the ground , with a turn-table at the far end , such as is used on railroads for turning locomotives , and a derrick strong enough to lift the man on and off the horse when it was necessary . A few barrels of plaster , a chair or two and some clay completed his studio equipment . In fact , this is about the equipment of any sculptor 's studio : throw in a modelling stand or two , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a fair idea of the average sculptor 's studio and its simple furniture . The art has changed very little in four thousand years ; there are intaglios cut into the sides of tombs in ancient Egypt , showing a sculptor at work , and as far as we can judge from the attitude of the model , the tool in the sculptor 's hand , and the material before him , the art was pretty much the same as it is now . Is was in this studio that Ball received as a pupil the boy Martin Milmore , the future sculptor of the Soldiers ' Monument on Boston Common , to whose memory Daniel French has lately executed his beautiful has-relief , " Death and the Sculptor . " Mr. Ball entered upon his work with rare courage . His experience in sculpture was not large . I do not know that he had ever seen an equestrian statue in process of execution . But he had the good sense and foresight to model this statue in plaster instead of clay , thereby saving himself untold miseries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great ark of a studio , and the result would have been that on the first cold night of winter his clay statue would have frozen , cracked and fallen to the ground . No one who has not worked upon an equestrian statue can understand the difficulties and dangers of the work . You are working with a mass that is at best but slenderly supported , of great weight , perhaps five or six tons , and which , in spite of your best efforts , is likely , from a jar or the breaking away of some internal part of the construction , to fall with little or no warning to the ground and perhaps crush or kill the sculptor and his assistants . // To the public , who know little of the construction of equestrian statues , it will be interesting to hear Ball 's own description of the way in which he constructed the framework destined to support the huge weight of plaster from which the horse and man were to be modelled . " Screwed firmly to my platform was an iron post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and four or five inches square . A horizontal timber about the length of the body of the horse rested on the top of the iron post which entered and passed through the middle of it , the two forming a T , the timber intended to lie along just under the lowest part of the back and together with the iron post support the entire weight . I then formed of plaster a series of rough slabs , ten inches wide , three inches thick , and in the form of a half circle of the diameter of the body of the horse . As soon as they were hard I simply hung them up to the timber , a dozen on each side , their lower ends coming together under the belly , supporting each other until I could join them with plaster . Thus I had a hollow cylinder , the ends of which I closed in the same manner , forming a foundation upon which to build the barrel ' of my horse . I next drew on the floor the outlines of the legs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay in the middle of each leg . I raised them about an inch from the floor with a bit of plaster under each end , then filled in the outlines with plaster , covering the irons over and under . These irons should be long enough to project six or eight inches under the hoof and over the top to enter the plinth below and the barrel ' of the horse above . In this way I had the legs solidly roughed out with an iron exactly in the middle of each , and ready to be placed under the horse . Of course my small model told me where to place the hoofs . After this , the building up of the neck and head of the horse was a simple matter . " The sculptor goes on to say that the whole colossal group , and at least one third more plaster wasted , passed through a two-quart bowl , and he asks the reader to form an idea of how that bowl and spoon had to work . He kept his barrel of plaster at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at the other . Every bowlful was mixed with one eye on the statue and while the plaster was setting in the bowl , he had just a moment to study where that bowlful could be put on with best effect . The day after , he would go to work with rasps and scrapers and work down and carve the plaster he had thus applied to the mass . At the end of his long studio was a great folding door which he could open , and go far into the grounds and view his group at sufficient distance to judge properly of the effect of his work . The figure of the man he modelled in the same way of plaster , twisting hay about , building his soft plaster about this LOVE 'S MEMORIES . // hay , thereby keeping the mass down in weight , and making the arms , torso and head hollow . By means of his derrick he could lift the head or torso off at will , and bring it down to study it at closer range . When the statue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the ground . It seems that the well-known firm of Cheney Brothers had 1 ) uilt on the ground adjoining the studio a temporary structure for proving the strength of the rifle barrels they were manufacturing . They would lay out a battery of these barrels , two or three hundred at a time , loaded to the muzzle , and fire them off at the same instant , making a terrific explosion . At the first trial of this battery , the great studio was shaken as if by an earthquake , and every leg of the horse resting on the ground was cracked to the middle . For three years he worked away alone at his statue ; and when it was finished he threw open the doors and invited the public to come in and see his work . Many people in Boston had never seen an equestrian statue , and not more than fifty at the most had ever been in a studio where such a statue was being modelled . The children of the public schools visited the studio ; and every one seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who appreciate the size of the statue . The extreme length of the group is sixteen feet , height sixteen feet , the height of the figure of Washington twelve feet . The pedestal of Quincy granite was designed by Hammet Billings and is fifteen feet in height and eighteen feet in length . The total cost of the work was $42,000 . It was cast by Silas Mosman of the Ames Manufacturing Company at Chicopee . The reader may form some idea of its size when he knows that a tall man may stand under the barrel of the horse . To see it to advantage , one ought to be at least one hundred feet away from the statue . The statue was unveiled January 29 , 1869 . After the completion of the Washington , in the eventful year i 86* , Mr. Ball again sailed for Europe , taking with him a number of works to execute in marble . This time he found a dwelling on the third floor of the Casa Guidi , where the Brownings passed so many delightful years , and where Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two great poets on their first visit to Florence , and he missed sadly their genial welcome on his return there . He began , in one of the spare rooms of his apartment , a half life size model of the " Emancipation " group , which stands in Park Square in Boston , and which , while it has been severely criticised , is a group which is not badly composed and has much dignity and many things to recommend it to the public , even if it is not a great work of art . It was Hiram Powers who , leading Thomas Ball to walk one morning with him up the Poggio Imperiale to look at a house in process of construction on the site of a vineyard close to an old monastery , asked him what he thought of the city from that elevated position . " What do you think of this spot , " said Powers , WHISPERING zEPHyR. // " for an old man to end his days in ? " Mr. Ball replied that he thought it a delightful situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bought on good terms . It was here then that Mr. Ball decided to build the pleasant villa and studio where he now lives and where he entertains with simple , gracious courtesy the many visitors who seek him out in passing through Florence . The most striking work which the writer saw in that studio when he last visited it , six years ago , was a bust of Liszt . Liszt visited Bali in his studio and expressed himself as greatly pleased with the work , while he was in the studio sitting down and playing for the sculptor . Not long after this Mr. Ball modelled his most beautiful ideal figure , his statue of St. John the Evangelist . Powers considered this his masterpiece . A reproduction of this statue is given in these pages . The statue itself can be seen in Forest Hills Cemetery , near Boston . Mr. Ball has produced various ideal heads and reliefs , but there is no other one which I can think of to be compared to the works mentioned above . Mr. Ball has represented American art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this brief article . Courteous to the Italians , as well as to Americans and Englishmen , he is beloved of all , and the writer has never heard an artist or a layman speak unkindly of the man . Every artist does good and bad work . Some of the works even of Michael Angelo are crudely executed and badly conceived , and would not be admitted , without his name attached , to the Royal Academy in London , the Salon in Paris , or any respectable exhibition . No man doing as much work as Mr. Ball can sustain an even greatness . But let us judge him by his best work rather than by that which critics have called mediocre . lie has produced a number of fine portrait busts , one or more ideal figures of remarkable beauty , at least one standing figure of great dignity , and finally a consummate achievement in his equestrian statue of Washington . We should be content with this achievement , letting much of the work he set aside as we set aside large portions of the poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body of true art .
