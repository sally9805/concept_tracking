txt Those advocates of tariff reform who urge that there should be an extra session of the Fifty-third Congress in March next to revise the tariff do not say , as we have already pointed out , that this session would or could do more than make a few changes in the present law . They admit that a complete revision would have to be postponed until the regular session . A correspondent whose ' letter we publish this morning defends the proposition that there should be a March session , and ' urges that at this session the duties on raw materials should be removed . " While it would not do , " he says , " to take off the duties on manufactured goods before taking off those on raw materials , to reverse this is to make a logical as well as a timely beginning . " But in most cases the duties on manufactured goods are composed in part of duties imposed to compensate for the duties on the raw materials . It would not be logical to give the manufacturer free raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with his products . Nor would such legislation be satisfactory to a great majority of the people . Some of the duties on manufactured goods are now prohibitory ; they would be more so , if that were possible , if the raw materials should be put on the free list . Other duties on goods , while not prohibitory , are very burdensome ; they would become a greater burden and might become prohibitory if the raw materials should be made free and if they should at the same time undergo no change . By cutting off duties on raw materials a considerable quantity of revenue is surrendered . If at the same time the duties on goods manufactured out of these raw materials are not reduced , still more rev- , enue is lost by a decrease of the quantity imported . It is necessary now to study-very carefully the effect of new tariff legislation upon revenue . If Congress at an extra session should cut off $15,000,000 or $20,000,000 of revenue by removing the duties on raw materials , and should also cause a further reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would not only act unwisely with respect to the question of revenue , but would also expose itself to the charge that it had legislated for the benefit of the manufacturer and had forgotten the consumer . Our correspondent should know that this policy would excite great indignation in the West , if not elsewhere . The excellence of the Springer bill relating to wool and woolens is determined largely by the fact that in this bill the duties on goods are very considerably reduced . But the bill relates to imposts that yielded $41,000,000 of revenue in the fiscal year 1891 , and while we are of the opinion that it is a very good bill , still we think that it would be better to revise the wool and woolens schedule in connection with a revision of the entire tariff , because of the revenue question involved . Our correspondent would have iron ore and possibly pig iron put on the free list . But to do this would not be to make either a logical or a fair beginning , if Congress should not at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of , these raw materials. - To do this would be to give free raw material to many combinations resembling Trusts ; without affecting their power , under the high duties on manufactured goods , to exact from consumers the prices they now demand and obtain . A Democratic Congress can not afford to give free iron ore and pig iron to the Steel Rail Combination and to all the other combinations in the iron and steelindustry without at the same time scaling down the high duties by means of which these rings now exact extortionate prices . To cut off the duties on these raw materials , without revising the duties on the manufactured products would be a very serious blunder for Congress to make , either in extra or in regular session , even if the question of revenue were not an important one . The principle to'which we have directed attention in this example should be kept in view by our correspondent and others in their study of the other schedules of the tariff . We are convinced that our proposition that Congress should be called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , and is one that will commend itself to all who study the question carefully . The daily Commercial Bulletin of this city has urged that there should be a March session , and has set forth the arguments in favor of suoh a session with earnestness and ability . But it published yesterday morning the remarks of THE Timms concerning a September session and commented upon them as follows : " Concession on both sides seems to be the most prudent course . The suggestions made by Tan TIKES are a distinct move in that direction . They certainly are a great improvement upon the original proposal that the question shall remain untouched until Deoomber , 1893 , which would probably be found to mean that the new law could not take effect until October , .1894 . Provided , first , that certain preliminary work , chiefly of inquiry , were deputed to a committee which shall sit from March next until an early assembling of Congress , say , on Sept. 1 , 1893 , and , next , that the new law were made to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little reason for complaint of unnecessary delay . This we take to be about what our contemporary suggests ; and as a midway course seems to be the inevitable one , we do not see why this might not be acceptable . " Time can be saved , perils can bo avoided , and a much better revision can be made under the plan we have suggested .
