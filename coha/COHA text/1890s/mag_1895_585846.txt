txt ON occasions of oratory in this country , nothing will arouse an audience more quickly than an allusion to our public school system , and any speaker who sees fit to apostrophize it is certain to be fervidly applauded . Moreover , in private conversation , whether with our countrymen or with foreigners , every citizen is prone to indulge in the statement , commonly uttered with some degree of emotion , that our public schools are the great bulwarks of progressive democracy . Why , then , is the American parent , as soon as he becomes well-todo , apt to send his children elsewhere ? I was walking down town with a friend the other day , and he asked me casually where I sent my boys to school . When I told him that they attended a public school he said , promptly , " Good enough . I like to see a man do it . It 's the right thing . " I acquiesced modestly ; then , as I knew that he had a boy of his own , I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied slowly , " goes to Mr. Bingham 's " - indicating a private school for boys in the neighborhood . " He is a little delicate-that is , he had measles last summer , and has never quite recovered his strength . I had almost made up my mind to send him to a public school , so that he might mix with all kinds of boys , but his mother seemed to think that the chances of his catching scarlet fever or diphtheria would be greater , and she has an idea that he would make undesirable acquaintances and learn things which he should n't . So , on the whole , we decided to send him to Bingham 's . But I agree that you are right . " - There are many men in the community who , like my friend , believe thoroughVOL . XVJI. - 46 ly that everyone would do well to send his boys to a public school - that is , everyone but themselves . When it comes to the case of their own flesh and blood they hesitate , and in nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn their backs on the principles they profess . This is especially true in our cities , and it has been more or less true ever since the Declaration of Independence ; and as a proof of the flourishing condition of the tendency at present , it is necessary merely to instance the numerous private schools all over the country . The pupils at these private schools are the children of our people of means and social prominence , the people who ought to be the most patriotic citizens of the Republic . I frankly state that I , for one , would not send my boys to a public school unless I believed the school to be a good one . Whatever other motives may influence parents , there is no doubt that many are finally deterred from sending their boys to a public school by the conviction that the education offered to their sons in return for taxes is inferior to what can be obtained by private contract . Though a father may be desirous to have his boys understand early the theory of democratic equality , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to impress upon them this doctrine . In this age , when so much stress is laid on the importance of giving one 's children the best education possible , it seems too large a price to pay . Why , after all , should a citizen send his boys to a school provided by the State , if better schools exist in the neighborhood which he can afford to have them attend ? This conviction on the part of parents is certainly justified in many sections of the country , and when justifiable , disarms the critic who is prepared to take // a father to task for sending his children to a private school . Also , it is the only argument which the well-to-do aristocrat can successfully protect himself behind . It is a full suit of armor in itself , but it is all he has . Every other excuse which he can give is flimsy as tissuepaper , and exposes him utterly . Therefore , if the State is desirous to educate the sons of its leading citizens , it ought to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it does not , it has only itself to blame if they are educated apart from the sons of the masses of the population . Nor is it an answer to quote the Fourth of July orator , that our public schools are second to none in the world ; for one has only to investigate to be convinced that , both as regards the methods of teaching and as regards ventilation , many of them all over the country are signally inferior to the school as it should be , and the school , both public and private , as it is in certain localities . So long as school boards and committees , from the 486 Atlantic to the Pacific , are composed mainly of political aspirants without experience in educational matters , and who seek to serve as a first or second step toward the White House , our public schools are likely to remain only pretty good . So long as people with axes to grind , or , more plainly speaking , text-books to circulate , are chosen to office , our public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is the most serious factor of all -- so long as the well-to-do American father and mother continue to be sublimely indifferent to the condition of the public schools , the public schools will never be so good as they ought to be . It must certainly be a source of constant discouragement to the earn estminded people in this country , who are interested in education , and are at the same time believers in our professed national hostility to class distinctions , that the well-to-do American parent so calmly turns his back on the public schools , and regards them very much School Boards and Committees . ' // from the lofty standpoint from which certain persons are wont to regard religion-as an excellent thing for the masses , but superfluous for themselves . Of course , if we are going , in this respect also , to model ourselves on and imitate the older civilizations , there is nothing to be said . If the public schools are to be merely a semi-charitable institution for children whose parents can not afford to separate them from the common herd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our cherished and Fourth of July sanctified theories of equality and common school education ? And what do we mean when we prate of a common humanity , and no upper class ? It is in the city or town , where the public school is equal or superior to the private school , that the real test comes . Yet in these places well-to-do parents seem almost as indifferent as when they have the righteous defence that their children would be imperfectly educated , or breathe foul air , were they to be sent to a public school . They take no interest , and they fairly bristle with polite and ingenious excuses for evading compliance with the institutions of their country . Not everybody , but probably three-fifths of the parents who can afford , if necessary , to pay for private instruction . And having once made the decision that , for some reason , a public school education is not desirable for their children , they feel absolved from further responsibility and practically wash their hands of the matter . It is notorious that a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants , professional men , and other influential citizens , who reside in the so-called court end of our large cities , do not attend the public schools , and it is equally notorious that the existence of a well-conducted and satisfactory school in the district affects the attendance comparatively little . If only this element of the population , which is now so indifferent , would interest itself actively , what a vast improvement could be effected in our public school system If the parents in the community , whose standards of life are the highest , and whose ideas are the most enlightened , would as a class co - operate in the advancement of common education , the charge that our public schools produce on the whole second-rate acquirements , and second-rate morals and manners , would soon be refuted , and the cause of popular education would cease to be handicapped , as it is at present , by the coolness of the well-to-do class . If the public schools , in those sections of our cities where our most intelligent and influential citizens have their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as any private school , were the same interest manifested by the tax-payers as is shown when an undesirable pavement is laid , or a company threatens to provide rapid transit before their doors . Unfortunately , that same spirit of aloofness , which has in the past operated largely to exclude this element in the nation from participation in the affairs of popular government , seems to be at the bottom of this matter . Certainly much progress has been made in the last twenty years in remedying the political evil , and the public good appears to demand a change of front from the same class of people on the subject of common education , unless we are prepared to advocate the existence and growth of a favored , special class , out of touch with , and at heart disdainful of , the average citizen . The most serious enemies of the public schools among well - to - do people appear to be women . Many a man , People with axes to grind . ) // alive to the importance of educating his Sons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send his boys to a public school , but is deterred by his wife . A mother accustomed to the refinements of modern civilization , is apt to shrink from sending her fieckless darling to consort , and possibly become the boon companion or bosom friend , of a street waif . She urges the danger of contamination , both physical and moral , and is only too glad to discover an excuse for refusing to yield . " Would you like to have your precious boy sit side by side with a little negro " ? I was asked one day , in horrified accents , by a well-to-do American mother ; and I have heard many fears expressed by others that their offspring would learn vice , or contract disease , through daily association with the children of the mass . It is not unjust to state that the average well-to-do mother is gratified when the public school , to which her sons would otherwise be sent , is so unsatisfactory that their father 's patriotism is overborne by other considerations . All theories of government or humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , and the simplest way to her seems to be to set them apart from the rest of creation , instead of taking pains to make sure that they are suitably taught and protected side by side with the other children of the community . Excellent as many of our private schools are , it is doubtful if either the morals are better , or the liability to disease is less , among the children who attend them than at a public school of the best class . To begin with , the private schools in our cities are eagerly patronized by that not inconsiderable class of parents who hope or imagine that the social position of their children is to be established by association with the children of influential p e o p 1 e . Falsehood , meanness , and unworthy ambitions are quite as dangerous to character , when the little man who suggests them has no patches on his breeches , as when he has , and unfortunately there are no outward signs on the moral nature , like holes in trousers , to serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who occupy comfortable houses in desirable localities , will generally find on investigation that the average of the class of children which attend the public school in such a district is much superior to what paternal or maternal fancy has painted . In such a district the children of the ignorant emigrant class are not to be found in large numbers . The pupils consist mainly of the rank and file of the native American population , whose tendencies and capacities for good have always been , and continue to be , the basis of our strength as a people . There is no need that a mother with delicate sensibilities should send her , son into the slums in order to obtain for him a common school education ; she has merely to consent that he take his chance with the rest of the The Enemy of the Public School . ' children of the district in which he lives , and bend her own energies to make the standards of that school as high as possible . In that way she will V 7 // best help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and best aid to obliterate those class distinctions which , in spite of Fourth of July negations , are beginning to expose us to the charge of insincerity . When a boy has reached the age of eleven or twelve , another consideration presents itself which is a source of serious perplexity to parents . Shall he be educated at home - - that is , attend school in his own city or townor be sent to one of the boarding-schools or academies which are ready to open their doors to him and fit him for college ? Here again we are met by the suggestion that the boarding-school of this type is not a native growth , but an exotic . England has supplied us with a precedent . The great boardingschools , Rugby , Eton , and Harrow , are the resort of the gentlemen of England . Though termed public schools , they are class schools , reserved and intended for the education of only the highly respectable . The sons of the butcher , the baker , and candlestick-maker are not formally barred , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper and well - to - do middle classes . A few boarding - schools for boys have been in existence here for many years , but in the last twenty there has been a notable increase in their number and importance . These too are essentially class schools , for though ostensibly open to everybody , the charges for tuition and living are beyond the means of parents with a small income . Most of them are schools of a religious denomination , though commonly a belief in the creed for which the institution stands is not made a formal requisite for admission . The most successful profess the Episcopalian faith , and in other essential respects are modelled deliberately on the English public schools . The strongest argument for sending a boy to one of these schools is the fresh-air plea . Undeniably , the growing boy in a large city is at a disadvantage . for healthful exercise He can rarely , if ever , obtain opportunities and recreation equal to those afforded by a well-conducted boarding-schooL He is likely to become a little man too early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere to play . At a boarding-school he will , under firm but gentle discipline , keep regular hours , eat simple food , and between study times be stimulated to cultivate athletic or other outdoor pursuits . It is not strange that parents should be attracted by the comparison , and decide that , on the whole , their boys will fare better away from home . Obviously the aristocratic mother will point out to her husband that his predilection for the public school system is answered by the fact that the State does not supply schools away from the city , where abundant fresh air and a famous foot-ball field are appurtenant to the institution . Tom Brown at Rugby recurs to them both , and they conclude that what has been good enough for generations of English boys will be best for their own son and heir . On the other hand , have we Americans ever quite reconciled ourselves to , and sympathized with , the traditional attitude of English parents toward their sons as portrayed in veracious fiction ? The day of parting comes ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down ; the blubbering sisters throw their arms around the neck of the hero of the hour , and slip pen-wipers of their own precious making into his pockets ; the father , abnormally stern to hide his emotion , says , blufily , " Good-by , Tom ; it 's time to be off , and we 'll see you again at Christmas . " And out goes Tom , a tender fledgling into the great world of the public school , and that is the last of home . His holidays arrive , but The private school boy . " // there is no more weeping . He is practically out of his parents ' lives , and the sweet influence of a good mother is exercised only through fairly regular correspondence . And Tom is said to be getting manly , and that the nonsense has nearly been knocked out of him . He has been bullied and has learned to bully ; he has been a fag and is now a cock . Perhaps he is first scholar , if not a hero of the cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a stranger to those who love him best . This is fine and manly perhaps , in the Anglo-Saxon sense , but does it not seem just a little brutal ? Are we wellto-do Americans prepared to give up to others , however exemplary , the conduct of our children 's lives ? Granting that the American private boarding-school is a delightful institution where bullying and fags and cocks are not known , can it ever take the place of home , or supply the stimulus to individual life which is exercised by wise parental love and precept ? Of course it is easier , in a certain sense , to send one 's boy to a select boarding-school where the conditions are known to be highly satisfactory . It shifts the responsibility on to other shoulders , and yet leaves one who is not sensitive , in the pleasing frame of mind that the very best thing has been done for the young idea . In our busy American life-more feverish than that of our English kinsfolk whose institution we have copied -- many doubtless are induced to seek this solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of efficiency , and their own lack of leisure to provide a continuous home influence superior or equal to what can be supplied by head-masters and their assistants , who are both churchmen and athletes . Many too , especially fathers , are firm believers in that other English doctrine , that most boys need to have the nonsense knocked out of them , and that the best means of accomplishing this result is to cut them loose from their mothers ' apron-strings . It is to be borne in mind in this connection that the great English public schools are a national cult . That is , everybody above a certain class sends his sons to one of them . On the other hand , the private boarding-schools on this side of the water , fashioned after them , have thus far attracted the patronage of a very small element of the population . It is their misfortune , rather than their fault , that they are chiefly the resort of the sons of rich or fashionable people , and consequently are the most conspicuously class schools in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them " The day of parting . " // regret that this is so , but it is one of the factors of the case which the American parent with sons must face at present . It may be that this is to be the type of school which is to become predominant here , and that , as in England , the nation will recognize it as a national force , even though here , as there , only the sons of the upper classes enjoy its advantages . That will depend partly on the extent to which we shall decide , as a society , to promote further class education . At present these schools are essentially private institutions . They are small ; they do not , like our American colleges , offer scholarships , and thus invite the attendance of ambitious students without means . Moreover , they are almost universally conducted on a sectarian basis , or with a sectarian leaning , which is apt to proselytize , at least indirectly . While those in charge of them indisputably strive to inculcate every virtue , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimately there with many boys whose parents belong to that frivolous class which is to-day chiefly absorbed in beautiful establishments , elaborate cookery , and the wholly ma- /7 Practical instruction terial vanities of life , and are out of sympathy with , or are indifferent to , the earnest temper and views of that already large and intelligent portion of the community , which views with horror the development among us of an aristocracy of wealth , which apes and is striving to out-do the heartless inanities of the Old World . He must remember that a taste for luxury and sensuous , material aims , even though they be held in cheek by youthful devotion to the rites of the church , will prove no less disastrous , in the long run , to manhood and patriotism , than the lack of fresh air or a famous foot-ball field . If , however , the American father chooses to keep his sons at home , he is bound to do all he can to overcome the physical disadvantages of city life . Fresh air and suitable exercise can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and co-operation on the part of parents . As an instance , in one or two of our leading cities , clubs of twelve to fifteen boys are sent out three or four afternoons a week under the charge of an older youth -- usually a college or other studentwbo , without interfering with their liberty , supervises their sports , and sees that they are well occupied . On days when the weather is unsuitable for any kind of game , he will take them to museuins , manufactories , or other places of interest in the vicinity . In this way some of the watchfulness and discipline which are constantly operative at a // // Mr. Perkins and his four daughters . boarding-school , are exercised without injury to home ties . There is no doubt that , unless parents are vigilant and interest themselves unremittingly in providing necessary physical advantages , the boys in a crowded city are likely to be less healthy and vigorous in body , and perhaps in mind , than those educated at a first-class boarding-school . It may be , as our cities increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the boarding-school will become more generally popular ; but there is reason to believe that , before it is recognized as a national institution , sectarian religion will have ceased to control it , and it will be less imitative of England in its tone and social attitude . Until then , at least , many a parent will prefer to keep his boys at home . II " SuPPOsING you had four daughters , like Mr. Perkins , what would you do with them , educationally speaking ? ' * I said to my wife Barbara , by way of turning my attention to the other sex " You mean what would they do with me ? They would drive me into my grave , I think , " she answered . " Wom an 's horizon has become so enlarged that no mother can tell what her next daughter may not wish to do . I understand , though , that you are referring simply to schools . To begin with , I take for granted you will agree that American parents , who insist on sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or decline point-blank to send their girls . " " Precisely . And we are forthwith confronted by the question whether they are justified in so doing . " Barbara looked meditative for a moment , then she said : " I am quite aware there is no logical reason why girls should not be treated in the same way , and yet as a matter of fact I am not at all sure , patriotism and logic to the contrary notwithstanding , I should send a daughter to a public school unless I were convinced , from personal examination , that she would have neither a vulgar teacher nor vulgar associates . Manners mean The American school-mistress. ' // so much to a woman , and by manners I refer chiefly to those nice perceptions of everything which stamp a lady , and which you can no more describe than you can describe the perfume of the violet . The objection to the public schools for a girl is that the unwritten constitution of this country declared years ago that every woman was a born lady , and that manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required no cultivation for their production . Latterly , a good many people interested in educational matters have discovered the fallacy of this point of view ; so that when the name of a woman to act as the head of a college or other first-class institution for girls is brought forward to - day , the first question asked is , Is she a lady ? ' Ten years ago mental acquirements would have been regarded as sufficient , and the questioner silenced with the severe answer that every American woman is a lady . The public school authorities are still harping too much on the original fallacy , or rather the new point of view has not spread sufficiently to cause the average American school - teacher to suspect that her manners might be improved and her sensibilities refined . There , that sounds like trea*on to the principles of democracy , yet you know I am at heart a patriot . " " And yet to bring up boys on a common basis and separate the girls by class education seems like a contradiction of terms , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation really do believe in obliterating class distinctions-that it wo n't be long before those who control the public schools recognize more universally the value of manners , and of the other traits which distinguish the woman of breeding from the woman who has none , ** said Barbara " When that time comes the well - to - do American mother will have no more reason for not sending her daughters to a public school than her sons . As it is , they should send them oftener than they do . " " Of course , " continued Barbara , presently , " the best private schools are in the East , and a very much larger percentage , both of girls and boys , attends the public schools in the West than in the East . Indeed , I am inclined to think that comparatively few people west of Chicago do not send their children to public schools . But , on the other hand , there are boarding - schools for girls all over the East which are mainly supported by girls from the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the public schools at A1. home until they a r e thirteen o r fourteen , and then are packed off to school for three or four years in order to teach them how to move , and wear their hair , and spell , and control their voices -- for the proper modulation of the voice has at last been recognized as a necessary attribute of the well - bred American woman . As for the Eastern girl who is not sent to the public school , she usually attends a private day-school in her native city , the resources of which are supplemented by special instruction of various kinds , in order to produce the same finished specimen . But it is n't the finished specimen who is really interesting from the educational point of view to-day ; that is , the conventional , cosmopolitan , finished specimen such as is turned out with deportment and accomplishments from the hands of the English governess , the French Mother Superior , or the American private school-mistress* . The decayed gentlewoman of to-day . ' // After making due allowance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much difference in principle between the means adopted to finish the young lady of society here and elsewhere . There are thousands of daughters of well-to-do mothers in this country who are brought up on the old aristocratic theory that a woman should study moderately hard until she is eighteen , then look as pretty as she can , and devote herself until she is married to having what is called on this side of the Atlantic a good time . To be sure , in France the good time does not come until after marriage , and there are other differences , but the well-bred lady of social graces is the well-bred lady , whether it be in London , Paris , Vienna , or New York , and a ball - room in one capital is essentially the same as in all the others , unless it be that over here the very young people are allowed to crowd out everybody else . There are thousands of mothers who are content that this should be the limit of their daughters ' experience , a reasonably good education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband , or no husband and a conservative afternoon teadrinking spinsterhood  --  and they are 494 7 thankful on the whole when their girls put their necks meekly beneath the yoke of convention and do as past generations of women all over the civilized world have done . For the reign of the unconventional - society young woman is over . She shocks now her own countrywomen even more than foreigners ; and though , like the buffalo , she is still extant , she is disappearing even more rapidly than that illustrious quadruped. ' * " Are you not wandering slightly from the topic ? " I ventn red to inqnire . " Not at all , " said Barbara . " I was stating merely that the Old-World , NewWorld young lady , with all her originality and piquarmy , however charming , and however delightfully inevitable she may be , is not interesting from the educational point of view . Or rather I will put it in this way : the thoughtful , well-to-do American mother is wondering hard whether she has a right to be content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching with eager interest the experiments which some of her neighbors are trying with theirs . We can not claim as an exclusive national invention collegiate education for women , and there 's no doubt that my sex in England is no less completely on the war-path than the female world here ; but is there a question that the peculiar qualities of American womanhood are largely responsible for the awakening wherever it has taken place ? My dear , you asked me just now what a man like Mr. Perkins should do with his four daugh N Four years of wh*ri and then a husband . // Equip themselves thoroughly in some direction or other . " ters . Probably Mrs. Perkins is trying to make up her mind whether she ought to send them to college . Very likely she is arguing with Mr. Perkins as to whether , all things considered , it would n't be advisable to have one or two of them study a profession , or learn to do something bread-winning , so that in case he , poor man-for he does look overworked - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year he hopes , they need not swell the category of the decayed gentlewomen of the day . I dare say they discuss the subject assiduously , in spite of the views Mr. Perkins has expressed to you regarding the sacredness of unemployed feminine gentility ; for it costs so much to live that he ca n't lay up a great deal , and there are certainly strong arguments in favor of giving such girls the opportunity to make the most of themselves , or at least to look at life from the self-supporting point of view . At first , of course , the students at the colleges for women were chiefly girls who hoped to utilize , as workers in various lines , the higher knowledge they acquired there ; but every year sees more and more girls , who expect to be married sooner or later  --  the daughters of lawyers , physicians , merchants-apply for admis. sion , on the theory that what is requisite for a man is none too good for them ; and it is the example of these girls which is agitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many daughters the idea of doing likewise . Even the ranks of the most fashionable are being invaded , though undeniably it is still the fashion to stay at home , and I am inclined to think that it is only the lack of the seal of fashion that restrains many cbnservative people , like the Perkinses , from educating their daughters as though they probably would not be married , instead of as though they were almost certain to be . " " You may remember that Perkins assured me not long ago , that marriage did not run in the Perkins female line , " said I. " All the more reason , then , that his girls should be encouraged to equip themselves thoroughly in some direction or other , instead of waiting disconsolately to be chosen in marriage , keeping up their courage as the years slip away , with a few cold drops of Associated Charity .

We intend to learn what to teach our sons , so that we may no longer be silenced with the plea that women do not know , and be put off with a secretive conjugal smile . And as for the girls who do not marry , the world is open to them  --  the world of art and song and charity and healing and brave endeavor in a hundred fields . Become just like men ? Never .

For centuries the women of civilization have worshipped chastity , suffering resignation and elegance as the ideals of femininity ; now we mean to be intelligent besides , or at least as nearly so as possible .

As to what women are going to do when our preliminary perplexities are solved and our sails are set before a favorable wind , I have my ideas on that score also , and some day I will discuss them with you . But just now I should like you to answer me a question . What are the best occupations for sons to follow when they have left school or college ?
