txt Chairman PEABODY of the Brooklyn Democratic Club has filled the Committee of One Handred to whom is to be intrusted the starting of the reorganization of the party in that city . The names will be found in TEE TLIIES this morning . We need hardly say that they are among the ablest and most influential of the Democrats of the city , men whose loyalty to the principles and purposes of their party has been demonstrated beyond all question by the most effective and disinterested service . In every case , as Mr. PEABODY announces , the consent of the gentlemen named has been definitely secured , after being fully informed of the nature of the work to which they pledge themselves and the methods by which it will be carried on . Any one familiar with Brooklyn affairs needs but to study these names and recall the plan of reorganization which the committee has undertaken , to understand how strong a start the new movement has secured . The nest step will be the organization by election districts , which is the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . will bring out the full strength of the party , and on the other will be quite beyond the arbitrary manipulation for selfish purposes of any such small b and of greedy and unscrupulous managers as those who have brought disgrace and disaster upon the Democratic Party of Brooklyn in the past . And perhaps the strongest feature of the Brooklyn movement is that it is a part of the larger movement for the reorganization of the Democratic Party of the State so happily and strongly brought before the public on Thursday evening . Mr. A. A. HEALY , who represented the Democracy of Brooklyn on that occasion , is a type of the men who are engaged with all earnestness , not only in Brooklyn but throughout the State , in putting the Democratic Party upon a democratic footing , and making it equal to resisting any attack upon it from without or from within .
