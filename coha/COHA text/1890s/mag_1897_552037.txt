By Raymond L. Bridgman . HEN Henry M. Whitney was examined in 1890 , at the West End investigation , by the House committee of the Massachusetts legislature , he was asked the following question : " Do you state , then , that your corporation , as an applicant for legislation here at the State House , finds such a condition of things that a regular body of men , known commonly as the lobby , stands between the legislature and applicants for legislation , and that , in order to avoid having opposition in the legislature , it is necessary to retain them ? " To which he replied : " That was my view of the case entirely . " Mr. Whitney testified further that he believed that the employment of those men was necessary in order to give his corporation that fair standing before the legislature which it ought to have and that if he could have presented his arguments to either the Senate or House he should not have felt obliged to employ the lobby . The West End affair was put before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except perhaps that for the division of the town of Beverly . It is typical of other cases which have occurred at the State House before and since 1890 , and it is well worth while to examine further this statement of Mr. Whitney . In the list of men hired by the West End company to promote the passage of the West End bill were fifteen who may properly be classed as lobbyists ,  --  that is , men who openly made it their business to work for hire to favor or to oppose the pas sage of bills through the legislature . At least ten of these men probably had no other occupation of importance . But there were also employed by the West End twenty-one other men who were expected to render service to the company in the passage of its bill or to refrain from helping the opposition to it . The fifteen included one man who is usually employed by the anti-cruelty society , one who was then also the representative of a wellknown association of business men , one who was wholly superannuated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence with the legislature was doubtless absolutely worthless . On the other hand , the leading counsel of the West End was an ex-president of the Senate , and many men were evidently employed for the prestige of their names . In the list were a Democratic exgovernor of Massachusetts , a leading and popular Democratic lawyer of Boston , the chairman of the Republican state committee , an ex-secretary of the Democratic state committee , a former prominent candidate for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor and then widely known in business and political circles , five Republican ex-representatives , some of them of recent service , a leading Democratic ex-senator , a Republican ex-senator , a Republican ex-governor , a Republican ex-speaker , and others active in politics or likeJy to be valuable in secret work . The class of the twenty-one is far more significant than the class of fifteen ; and it is because these two classes illustrate the situation regarding the lobby as an American institution that it is worth while to take this time to see who they are . Mr. Whitney said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby if it could have been eliminated from the legislature and if he had not feared that the lobbyists would have favored some other corporation if he had not employed them . But it is a fact that he not only employed these men whom he wished were out of the way , but he employed a larger number and a more influential set of men outside of the regular lobby and had them working for him . The men in the class of txventy-one were surely far more influential with the legislature than the professional lobby , and the West End company doubtless knew it when it employed them , and doubtless that was the reason for their employment . The feeling with which the outside corporation regards the legislature is evidently well expressed in the remark of a wealthy man in view of the petition of a certain powerful interest before the legislature of 1897 : " They have got to get their bill through ; they ca n't afford to lose it . " There was no sign of scruple about the means to be employed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be used , and would be justified , for the passage of the bill . The short and the long of it was that a corporation with plenty of money had something which it desired to be enacted . That desire was the standard and the measure of the situation . What the corporation wanted must be had , no matter at what cost , and if the consciences of legislators stood in the way , why , those consciences must be bought up . Here is a vital matter to consider in all discussion of the lobby . It obtains at Washington and in state legislatures . Certain petitioners want something . The cost is high , but they are perfectly able and willing to pay it . Like the newly-rich father who was told that his daughter at a fashionable boarding-school made only slow progress because she had no capacity and who replied : " Capac ity ? How much does one cost ? Get her one . I am rich enough to afford it , " - these men wait only to be informed what is the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they know how much it is , they are perfectly willing to foot the bill , no matter if it includes such cheap items as the consciences of legislators and the good of the public . Money is the only standard for them and , having the money , they see no reason why they should not get any legislation which they want . They pay what it costs . Whose business is it ? Why should any one complain ? That is the attitude toward the legislature which is habitually assumed by the persons who make the lobby dangerous . It is to be observed in every instance of scandalous lobbying , to take Massachusetts as an illustration , that it is not the professional lobby which costs the most money or which exerts the most influence . Each of the fifteen in the West End 's list who can be classed as professional lobbyists was employed at a low figure compared with the price paid to the political manipulators and placeholders of high standing whose services were also secured . This is a feature of the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . The statement of Mr. Whitney , that a body of professional blackmailers stood between the West End corpo ? ation and the legislature , did not cover the case . In its legal sphere the work of the lobbyist is as honest and as legitimate as the occupation of the counsel who stands on an apparently higher plane and gets much larger fees . The special lobby which is created for the occasion is of most danger in the case . The special lobby varies with every matter which is brought before the legislature . It includes the men who are most likely to have influence with the members either by reason of politics or business . They are gathered together for an effort in the one particular case // in which they are employed , and for no other . They have their regular and probably honorable occupation away from the State House . They are not known as lobbyists-and therein consists the greater part of their effectiveness and also of their danger . The members whom they approach do not know that they are hired by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from reasons of public welfare , or because of some personal interest in the bill which is pending . It is not dreamed that they are earning a big fee under the cover of a previous good reputation and of an honest occupation . The cause of the special lobby enables us to realize that , in a broad way , the lobby evil is only one phase of the power which is exerted by unscrupulous people of large fortunes in every branch of life , and even by some people of moderate means who ordinarily pass for honest men . They want a certain thing . They are accustomed to buy what they want . In their ordinary dealings they find that money is the standard of value and that the good things of life are to be bought for so many dollars . As they would secure the services of a high-priced architect for the plans of a new mansion and pay without question the large money value which attaches to ability of this class , so they expect to pay a high price when the unusual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature is desired . It is this class of people who have debauched our politics and who have made our state capitols reek with the foul odor of corruption . These people very often stand high in social circles . Very likely they are popular and influential in politics . Almost certainly they are prominent in business circles , and in some instances they hold high place in religious activity . They are difficult to reach and not easy of punishment because of their social , political and business standing . Yet these are the very men , who should be a power for political purity and for a broad public policy , who show their moral rottenness by their participation in legislative corruption , and who prove their unfitness for political power by their promotion of bribery in order that they may control the whole state for their personal pecuniary gain . They want the public made tributary to their pockets , and they corrupt the public 's representatives in order that this may be done . They bribe the representatives of the public to betray their constituents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by further service by those who by natural deficiencies or hardships of condition are put at a hopeless disadvantage from the outset . The amounts of money which are spent at the State House by these special lobbies , judging by the facts in Massachusetts , are enormously extravagant . Such sums are not needed for the passage of the bills if there is a genuine public need for the service proposed or if the public is to receive any return to be compared at all with what the promoters of the enterprise hope to make . Of what avail are the thousands of dollars spent upon the daily papers for verbatim reports of speeches ? The public does not vote upon the passage of the bills . A petitioner with scant means would never imagine that the most economical and effective way to use his money was to lay it out for service of this sort . The entire course of procedure of these petitioners proves that they have gone to the State House stuffed with money which they are ready to scatter freely and ask no questions if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lobbying is in the men outside of the State House who have abundant means to pay for any class of service . To the everlasting shame of humanity , it is doubtless true that there is no act so base or so shocking that some man does not // stand ready to commit it if he is paid for it . In the good old times , and doubtless in modern ones , assassins have never been lacking , provided the cash was forthcoming for compensation ; and so there is no legislative job so mean or so dirty that some wretch can not be found to do it , if his services are needed by some distinguished leader in politics , business or religion , whose position will not permit him to do it himself . Good reason exists for saying that in the last Massachusetts legislature work of this sort was done , and the persons were of exactly the type mentioned . An unregistered lobbyist , nominally a business man , was the gobetween for the petitioners and the corrupt members of the committee , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fair compensation for their mercenary souls was five hundred dollars each . Possibly the petitioner did not know that his representative in the third house agreed to pay that price for a vote in committee in favor of his bill . Possibly he thought it was all a fair fee for the go-between whom he employed . Probably the gobetween put much of it into his own pocket after exciting the cupidity of the corrupt legislators who were selling out the public for their private gain ; but when the enraged and disappointed members failed to get the stipulated price for their betrayal of the public and began to infest the office of the petitioner with demands that he fulfill his part of the Judas bargain , then doubtless the petitioner knew beyond doubt how his money had been promised by his agent and also how it had actually been appropriated . Nobody can prove these suspicions , of course . Rascals who commit state prison offenses , even if they are members of the legislature , do not stand on a street corner and tell the passer-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the story is told in print . But there is reason to believe that exactly these things have taken place , and the history of recent legislation is ground for expecting that similarly disgraceful things will occur again . It will be our respectable , high-stepping citizens , with fine turnouts , with beautiful wives and daughters and fast sons , who , judging by the past , will advance the money to debauch the people 's representatives in order that their own respectability may continue to hold its exalted position , that the wives and daughters may appear as comports their station , and that the sons may prepare for a course as illustrious as the father 's . These future events are as certain as that the people will struggle against enormous odds for the establishment of absolute justice between class and class . The continued existence of a class of corrupt petitioners for legislation by states and by cities is not a matter of public solicitude to the extent which the evil deserves . In the large cities of the Union constant complaint is made of practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than highway robbery ; and the moral character of the thieves is no better than that of highwaymen . But the responsibility of gathering such gangs of unprincipled men belongs primarily and conspicuously upon the men who pay them for their votes . These thieves would not seek public office for the sake of rendering service to the public ; it is preposterous even to suppose such a motive on their part . They are in office for the money which they can make by the sale of their votes . That is , on the average , the councilman or alderman is sure that some measures will come before him which he can hold up until the price of passage has been paid . It is the certainty of such payments , on the doctrine of averages , which leads these men to seek public office . But the men who pay the money are as guilty as those who take it . These corrupt petitioners , these presidents and directors of street railway // corporations , of gas companies and of other corporations which need public concessions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aldermen and legislators that they may make more money , belong to the unconvicted criminal classes as truly as jailbirds belong to the convict class ; and they are more dangerous to the con*imunity than those guilty of coarse and disgusting vice and crime . They have already demoralized utterly many city governments . They have made a stench to arise from many a state capitol . They are to-day the weakest and the worst spot in our system of popular government . They are disguised in respectability ; they are powerful by reason of wealth . They are prostituting the government of the people to their private fortunes ; and they are dominating millions of workers by legal powers and privileges which they buy and pay for . City Hall lobbies and State House lobbies are solely their creation , and public sentiinent should condemn them before it denounces their hirelings who carry out their demoralizing and destructive purposes . The corrupt lobbyist exists because the corrupt petitioner exists . Remove the latter and the former disappears instantly ; he lapses into criminal life elsewhere or tries to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character . Remove the corrupt petitioner , and the temptation to the legislator is removed also and the scandal ceases . Retain the corrupt petitioner and elect honest legislators and then the scandal ceases also . The corrupt lobbyist is not at all the vital part of the situation . He is sure to appear when there is a demand for his services , and that demand is sure to exist as long as there are corrupt petitioners . There are two points , then , at which an effective remedy is theoretically possible ,  --  the petitioner and the legislator . The go-between , mean as he is , does not occupy a critical position , and attention to his case , which is given by the present lobby act , does not solve the problem . The question comes , whether there is any way by which the corrupt petitioner can be made to cease from his corruption . In the very constitution of a democratic government , every man who is out of jail has a right to petition the legislature ; and doubtless the average judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be in it and that many men of means who have been foremost in business enterprises have made their fortunes by cheating their fellowmen in such a way that the courts could not touch them . Hence it is altogether probable that the supply will never be cut off of petitioners who are ready to buy up the whole State House , if need be , to procure the passage of some money-making scheme . They will do it if the risk of detection is slight and if the promise of reward is large . But it is a most serious concern for both parties to a corrupt act to avoid detection , and it is not proved that future risks can be made any more perilous than the present . Experience proves that such risks are run successfully . Suspicion at the State House is always alert . Never does it seem to be relaxed at any point . Yet the corrupt transactions are so conducted that only once has any penalty fallen upon any member of the third house under the lobby law ; and the Suffolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who presented the facts for the prosecution , refused to bring an indictment in that case , though each branch of the legislature voted that the evidence was sufficient for disbarment of the lobbyist from practice . It is not to be supposed that remedy of the lobby evil can be found by any device applied to the corrupt petitioners . Theoretically they may be subject to reformation or regulation , but practically they are an exceedingly difficult class to treat by any penal or correc // tive legislation . They will bribe in the future as they have in the past , if they feel that the passage of their bills is only the question of so many dollars and that the risk is small . Not till the millennium will society be so pure that it may not be expected to yield some unscrupulous petitioner who stands ready to pay a material amount of money in order that he may be authorized by the people 's representatives to make still more money out of the people . In our search for a remedy for corruption in the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the character of the legislators individually . What is the prospect of improvement there ? If the people have elected some corrupt men thus far , is there any likelihood that they will elect fewer in the future ? At this point we must note the disposition of the people in recent years to withdraw from politics and to devote themselves more absorbingly to business by daylight and to amusement by gaslight , practically agreeing with Vanderbilt 's estimate of the public and of their public duties .. This dangerous disposition found its climax in Massachusetts in the recent movement for biennial elections , whose defeat is in itself a proof of strong public spirit and of willingness to discuss public issues on the part of a large majority of the voters . But there has been a downward tendency in state and municipal legislatures , and it is to-day the shame of our most competent business and professional men that only a few of them are found in either House or Senate , in Common Council or Board of Aldermen . As long as these men deliberately abdicate these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that men of another sort will be elected , if they can hoodwink people into voting for them . It is at this point that we touch the weakest spot , in our times , of our democratic form of government ,  - -  the indifference of the voters to their public duties , their ignorance of public affairs , their disposition to allow a few men to have full control of municipal , state and national administration , and their shallow and selfish absorption in their personal affairs . Popular literature runs too much to trivial matters , to whatever amuses and diverts . Popular plays are comedies and farces . Serious , sober , weighty concerns in the struggle of life are looked upon by a great many persons as intolerable bores , to be avoided , if possible . The struggle for liberty being past , the unity of the nation being assured by the bloody cement of fraternal strife , we now plunge into money-making as if that were the only worthy object of manly thought ; and then we take to amusement as a relief from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar , as if such relaxation completed the round of human existence . Of a great many of our people this is true , and they can not point to faithful service to the public as a palliation for their neglect of high and patriotic duty . The minority who are faithful may get what comfort they can out of the consciousness of duty done and the realization that they have but little influence upon their times . What is the prospect that a public of this sort will turn to state affairs sufficiently to improve the quality of the legislature ? The outlook is not bright ; yet there is encouragement to persevere in the effort to arouse the people to study their political condition more carefully , waiting for the future to show whether our confidence in the people is well founded . We believe that there is so much public spirit and civic virtue in our citizens that bad politics will spur them to a reformation , not to a tame submission ,  --  that if the corruption becomes disgracefully bad , if the honor of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squandered and wasted in heavy // taxes , they will revolt and will elect better legislators . They will persevere in the right way until they forget their lesson and are compelled to learn it all over again by bitter experience ; for our American democracy , in spite of its popular and fundamental maxim , has not yet learned practically that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . They still believe that they can invent some political alarm clock or hire some watchman with a certificate of good character , who will arouse them at the right time , or will keep watch over their peaceful slumbers in the bed of private interests , while they trustfully resign their liberty with their watchfulness . But the heart of the people is all right ; it needs only to be aroused . This is not flattery , and there is no occasion for the people to lay any flattering unction to their souls therefor ; for if they are all right when aroused , it is only because they are looking out for their own interests . Any one awaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize the thief and not regard his act as proof of his own high moral character or of his unusual public spirit . So the people in our democracy can be trusted to exert themselves , provided they can be aroused to their real danger . With the efficiency of our schools and churches as a basis for appeal , it may be assumed that the people will realize the shamefulness of legislative corruption . There is no doubt that their pockets will show the expensiveness of it to the whole state when excessive corporation powers and extortionate charges for the benefit of private stockholders exasperate still further a people whose beginning of indignation may be seen in the vote for Bryan for president . Every district may have an honest representative , if it chooses . If the people generally put the office on the lofty plane of respect which it really merits , leading men of ability and integrity will be found to accept its powers , responsibilities and honors . To conclude , then , this line of thinking , we believe that our reliance upon our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rolled in the dirt of legislative corruption enough to disgust themselves and to appear to the world in a generally shocking condition , they will get up and resolve to do better . But they can do better only by a thorough revolution in their habits of thought . Unless interest in public affairs becomes a second nature , they will be both ignorant and negligent ; they will surely become the prey of men who will seize and hold for themselves those activities which belong to the state . The situation is complex . It involves confusion in the relation of master and servant . Capital is consolidating . Entire branches of industry are being brought under one head . Men who have been independent are compelled to become employees in a system where the business of which they once were owners and masters has been reduced to a subordinate part of a larger whole . Fewer men than formerly , in proportion to the whole number of working men , are their own industrial masters . Most men are the servants of the few who are at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose imperative wills they are forced to obey without discretion , or leave the employment . Shall the employer dictate how the employees shall vote , and thus dominate them at the most vital point remaining to them where manhood can assert itself ? Or shall the employees , true to their manhood and faithful to their function as units in the state , each one of whose wellbeing is equal to that of any other , assert the mighty power of a majority over their industrial employers and make the employers realize that the state is supreme and that even heads of great corporations are only public servants ? To reach this level of intelligence and of vigorous action , our mass of voters needs to rise to the // new crisis which is forced upon them . Their industrial standing , their political independence , their whole prosperity and happiness are involved , tenfold more now than ever before , in the degree to which they give up their recreations and relaxations and apply themselves to the study of political principles and to the discharge of political duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought and won , and only as they rise to this real emergency can they be counted worthy successors of the men of 76 . Let them do this , and they will have a legislature not controlled by the lobby ; for the lobby is only another phase of the corporation power which is already their master and will be their owner if they are not eternally vigilant . To return for a moment to the lobby law of Massachusetts ,  --  it is pertinent to ask whether it can be made any more effective . It is not the remedy which it should be . In the legislature of 1896 , what was probably the most extensive and dangerous lobby was not registered at all . Doubtless the petitioners knew as well as the lobbyists certainly did that they were violating the law . They took their chances of detection . The weak spot of the law is that there is no ready way to enforce it . Men haunt the State House corridors for weeks , doubtless hired l ) y some petitioners for legislation , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account . Massachusetts law permits persons of criminal records , when found in suspicious circumstances , to be taken into custody for the public protection , unless they can give a good account of themselves . When great crowds are expected in Boston , as at the Knights Templar parade , the police can lock up men whom they suspect of being pickpockets , without a warrant and without any intention of bringing them to trial . They are put in confinement for the public good and are released when the peculiar danger to the public is over . So the lobby law ought to permit the chairman of any committee to call to account any person whose continual presence , with no apparent excuse , makes him open to suspicion . The president of the Senate and the speaker of the House should be authorized to command the sergeant-at-arms to exclude from the State House , without trial and for the public good , any and all persons who can not give satisfaction regarding the cause of their presence . Still further , they might be authorized to employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not infested by unregistered men seeking to influence legislation . Such measures would make illegal lobbying a very risky occupation and would doubtless mitigate the evil ; for both employers and employed in this business are naturally exceedingly suspicious and fearful of discovery . To drop the subject here might leave the impression upon the minds of men who are not familiar with the State House that legislation in Massachusetts is thoroughly corrupt and that no honest and poor petitioner can expect fair treatment . Such an impression would be wholly wide of the truth . The statistics which have been gathered of the session of 1894 are doubtless true of all recent sessions . The first point to be noticed in them is that lobbyists are employed by corporations almost without exception , or by petitioners for corporate powers . Second , not a private interest has employed a lobbyist . The measures upon which these men are hired are public concerns in which many people are sure to be interested in a business or political way . No poor petitioner has been forced to hire a lobbyist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied to any individual petitioner for legislation because he has been too impecunious to meet the charges of blackmailing lobbyists . This is the case as shown by the record , and // there is no doubt that it is substantially true , though some unsuspected exception should be discovered . A further pertinent point to the credit of the quality of legislation is that lobbyists aie employed on only a very small proportion of the cases pending . The number of instances in which lobbyists are engaged varies from two to five per cent of the whole number of matters introduced . That is , from 95 to 98 per cent of all the business is not contaminated by hired agents ; and if there are a few great cases in which the law is evaded and defied , the immense preponderance of those which rely apparently upon their merits can not be materially reduced . This is sufficient to reassure the public absolutely that they will receive just and courteous consideration for whatever business they bring to the General Court . Doubtless there are in most cases minor factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining the result , such as accommodations of members for each other ( not to use the term " log-rolling " ) , prejudice for or against the member in charge of the matter or toward the committee which reports it , the favor or opposition of local magnates , the relation to party policy , etc . But these causes of variation in the magnetic needle of a member 's judgment are incidental to human nature . They can not be overcome by legislation and are not a sign of either corruption or incompetency on the part of the members . One consequence of the lobby law is worth mention , though no proof of what is doubtless true can be given . The docket of " legislative agents " is a public record . It is in the office of the sergeant-at-arms , and any one can see it upon request . It contains , for every case , the name and address of the employer , the name and address of the agent employed , his occupation , the title of the matter upon which he is employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the time during which it is to continue . Reason exists for believing that corrupt members of the legislature have consulted this book in order to learn what petitioners are employing legislative agents , and that such members have used the information thus obtained as a means of opening communication directly with the petitioners , avoiding the lobby and making one less risk of detection for any petitioner or legislator who is willingto deal corruptly . It is impossible to learn what are the fees for the special lobby , which is the only dangerous one . The returns under the lobby law show that while some fat fees are paid , others are not large ; and it is a fact that some former members of the third house have declined further service because the compensation was small . From the published returns it appears that one lobbyist has made $6,050 in one session . But $3,500 of it came from one wealthy and foolish corporation , which would doubtless have got as good service for $*oo and which would have been as well off if it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same session , had three other cases of $5oo each , one at $400 , one at $250 , and two at $200 each . But this was as exceptional as a lawyer with $*o , ooo a year in fees . Probably most of the lobbyists get less than $i , ooo for the session , making allowance for some engagements not returned . One of the most experienced of the present generation has regarded $2,000 as a good figure , while the tail-enders are obliged to be content with a few hundreds . More money than is required is paid to the lobby . Doubtless much of it might as well be thrown away . But there is a field in which an agent at the legislature is of legitimate and valuable service to employers , and the matter of price is for them to arrange between themselves . The lobby law covers both " counsel " and " agents , " and returns must be made regarding the employment // of both , and both must register themselves , though the lists are in separate books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents whom they employ , which must be filed with the sergeant-atarms to show the authority upon which registration is made . Within thirty days of the prorogation of the legislature , employers of counsel or agents must file in the office of the secretary of state written statements of the persons employed , with the sums paid them for compensation . The names of delinquents are sent to the attorney general by the secretary of state , and steps are taken to compel compliance with the law . No one has really any intention of defying prosecution . Delinquency is due to ignorance or oversight , and the desired return is forthcoming when the serious nature of the matter is realized . No prosecutions have been even begun under the law . Counsel and agents may be employed on more than one case each . For the period of the law 's existence its results may be tabulated as follows , as far as figures can give information : 2892. 1892 . Number of counsel* 263 183 Cases with counsel 223 276 Number of agents 49 39 Cases with agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 262 246 20 27 63 59 23 33 2895. 2896. 238 273 236 270 42 28 35 88 The number of counsel is doubtless given correctly . It is equally probable , though incapable of proof , that the number of agents and the number of their cases ought to be larger , probably much larger . As the law stands , it is not of as much value as it ought to be ; but it may be made the basis of regulations which will be much more effective , though the perfect exclusion of corrupt influences from the legislature is doubtless impossible . The observer will not fail to note that the lobby evil is not itself a distinct affair in our system of legislation . It is only one manifestation of a much more serious evil , an evil which demands larger public attention than ever , and which , thanks to recent events , is sure to receive it . Lobbying , so far as it is an evil , is only one phase of the grasping power of strong selfish interests . If there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedied . The organization of the body politic will advance from our present crude condition , in which the will of the majority does not make itself felt , in which the intelligence of the majority is uninformed , and in which many of the individual atoms of society have not found any suitable place for employment . If we are to have a future , our civilization will reach a stage in which the great monopolies will be under the collective will of the people for the service of the whole , when the intelligence of the whole will see what is for the good of the whole , and when there will be a realization of the higher political virtue which is sure to come with our higher organization . When that stage is reached , the special lobby , lacking employers , will not appear . Legislative bodies of higher ability and character than are now elected in many of the states will command the respect of the public and will deal with public problems with regard to the good of the whole people along a definite line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation by great private moneyed interests will be gone by ; for , if the abundant signs of recent legislation reveal anything , it is that the people will control that service to themselves whose present ownership by private capital is the root of the lobby scandal .
