txt President Cleveland and all the members of his Cabinet except Secretary Hoke Smith were at Arlington this afternoon to see the body of Gen. W. Q. Gresham buried in the National Cemetery . They had met the train from Chicago at the railroad station , and in several carriages they followed the hearse to the hillside , overlooking the Potomac and the City of Washington . There were no funeral ceremonies . The weather was cloudy , the air warm and moist . A detachment of cavalrymen from Fort Meyer bore the coffin from the hearse to the grave , which had been dug on the slope east of the Lee mansion , and a little to the right of the grave of Sheridan . A group of trees make a canopy over the spot , which is near the carriage road . The President and his advisers stood in a line at the right of the grave with heads uncovered while the coffin was lowered , Postmaster General Wilson at the end of the line nearest the grave , and the President at the opposite end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Gresham , in deepest mourning , stood forward of the other spectators , leaning on the arm of Otto Gresham , her son . When the coffin had been lowered to its place a bugler sounded " taps , " and the friends who had assembled to pay respect to the memory of the brave soldier and just officer aimed away to leave the place , as the rain which had threatened began to fall . Gen. Gresham 's grave adds to the number that is gradually dotting the brow of the hill in front of the Arlington House . ? Hubert L. Smith Arrested Again . Hubert L.
