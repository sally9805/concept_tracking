txt It is , first , the Judiciary Committee of the Senate . and after that the Senate itself , not Mr. Peckham , that is on trial . The Judiciary Committee has put off the matter fur one week . That is no loss . The loner Peckham is considered , the more , sorely he will prevail . Only the malefactors , the , - assassins , and the hyenas u politiLs have had the hardihood openly to oppose the President 's nomination of Mr. Peckham to the bench of the Supr , ? te Court of the United States . It remains to be seen whether in its committees or as a brad is subject to influences emanating from malefactors , assassins , and hyenas . These are unpleasant terms , no doubt . 11- the Senators of the Democratic side uuld know if they are here fairly and justly employed , let them search their political scriptures . What was the re-orded conclusion of the voters of the State of New-York last Fall as to political malefactors ? What testimony du the . election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State of New-York ? What hyena , actually captured and caged or merely pictured jilt in speech , ever " cut up " in so foul a fashion as the beast that , for our sins , now represents us in the Senate cham-ber ? Senator Hawley 's statement that the repeal of the Federal election law " marks a new interpretation of the Constitution " upon provisions " supposed to have been settled beyond doubt for a hundred years " is rather extraordinary . Nobody questions the authority of Congress to " make or alter " regulations for the election of Senators and Representatives , ? xcept as to the place of choosing Senators , whenever it sees fit , any more than anybody questions its right to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies . " But if it does not choose to exercise that authority , the Constitution itself declared that these regulations shall be " prescribed " in each State by the Legislature thereof . " For much the greater part of a hundred years Congress left the regulation of the election of Representatives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that policy , it abandons no authority and puts no new interpretation upon the Constitution . Does Senator Hawley think that ' when Congress repealed the national bankruptcy law it lost its authority to enact another or that its repeal " marked " a new interpretation of the Constitution ? The disposition to revolt against ma : .. hine rule and " boss " dictation is just now having an illustration in the City of Syracuse , which is preparing for a municipal election . The Republican City Comtinttee is under the domination of Mr. Belden , but it is not absolutely united in its submission . In calling for the primaries the majority of the committee refused to allow the minority any representation among the caucus inspectors or its candidates any watchers at the polls of the primary elections , or to limit the hours during which the polls should be open . All protests of the minority were ignored , and it was evident that the machine was determined to have absolute control of caucuses and convention . The result was an uprising : and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to held ii 3. primaries to-day and a. convention this evening for the nomination of a municipal ticket opposed to the Belden machine . The party seems to be split wide open . The machine in Brooklyn , with characteristic impudence , has undertaken to oppose to the reorganization of the Committee of One Hundred one of its own , on the election-district basis . Unquestionably that is a far sounder basis than the ward and Assembly district , but it would be as worthless as the latter if controlled by corrupt men , which it would be under the management of , If the machine wishes to persuade any one that it wants real and honest reorganization of the Democratic Party , let it adopt the two characteristic features of the plan of the Committee of One Hundred  --  the exclusion of office holders from all conventions and committees and the express pledge to oppose plainly unfit candidates if nominated . And , after all , if the machine is ready to do this , it needs no reorganization of its own , but can act under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net a little too plainly in the sight of the bird .
