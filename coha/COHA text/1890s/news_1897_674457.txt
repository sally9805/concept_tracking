txt On the morning of April 15 the season for shad fishing will open , and hundreds of shad fishers will push their dingy old boats and dories from the shores or the Hudson to those places where the fishermen know the shad love to go in spawning time . Shad fishing is a large industry along the Hudson River . Hundreds of men all along the river engage in it , many tons of fish being caught every year . Off New Hamburg Reef , a few miles south of Poughkeepsie , is a favorite spot for shad fishermen , as the catch at that point is almost sure to be a large one . At points in the river off Newburg , Marlborough , and even at West Point , many shad are also caught , but the choice fishing grounds are off Kingston Point , near this city . This year a novel , although greatly to be deplored , scheme for catching the shad quickly and in enormous numbers has been devised by some of the largest shad fishermen of this city . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of seining shad and all other kinds of river fish . The nets that are to be used are to be of the kind and size that man power can not manage , being 1,200 feet long and 50 feet deep , crossing the main channel nearly from shore to shore , with a. large steamboat at either end of the net to operate it . These nets are to be worked daily , and with them it is expected that tons of fish can be secured . The scheme is a new one in river fishing , and is one that is apt to be very destructive as regards the future supply of fish , for the reason that the nets are to be operated at-a. point where-the river bottom. - i5 form , and more than a mile of the river will be seined . If this mode of fishing proves as successful as is expected , others will follow the same method , to the detriment of the future supply of the fish , as near Flatbush , some three miles north of this city . is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years the number of nets engaged in taking fish from the Hudson River , south of Kingston Point , has increased fully 50 per cent . Shad drift nets are worked the full length of the river . Twenty-five years ago , drift netting was a rarity below West Point and the Highland Reach , except at the Narrows at the mouth of the river , where the nets are not entirely destructive to fish that come into the river to spawn .
