txt subject has been so prolific in themes for essayists , historians , philosophers , and critics of all civilized nations as that of Education . The founders of this commonwealth gave it their earliest attention , and American literature of the latter half of the seventeenth , and of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries vies with that of England and continental Europe in the value and interest of its contributions to that subject . Every State in the Union has been generous to the public schools-munificent individuals have built and endowed with lavish hands universities and colleges for young men , and within the last two decades woman has had doled out to her , with great reluctance , with much reserve , and many misgivings , some of the crumbs which fall from the tables of the great universities . And four colleges , exclasively for women , have been built and geuerously endowed .

Meanwhile Vhere is a great and powerful arm of the educational force of this country which has no literature , no written history , which is seldom referred to by periodical , scientist , or the orator of the day , except in some flippant allusion to point a moral or adorn a tale-this is the " Private School for Girls . " For two hundred years this institution has held a dignified and responsible place in the educational and social system of this country . To this the American woman , such as she has been in times past , and such as we find her to-day , owes the character , the culture , the grace , and the embellishments which enable her to take her stand , not blushing for her ignorance or her stupidity , side by side , with the cultivated and representative woman of other countries . It has no favor from the state . Being private property it can not hold endowments ; it has paid its own taxes and supported itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to learn by accident that American ladies were not all educated in their famous public schools . The French Commissioner of Education to the Centennial Exhibition , whom I afterwards met , could not forgive the committee which waited on him in New York that it had not afforded him an opportunity to visit the schools in which the accomplished women whom he had met in this country were trained . He requested the circulars , rules , schedules of study , and whatever records and literature of interest had grown out of my school to be transmitted officially to him . Mr. Bryce , in his " American Commonwealth , " though his interesting chapter upon the " Position of Women " notices the facilities offered by the state for the education of girls and the eagerness with which they are accepted , makes no reference to Private Schools except that in a foot-note of two lines the existence of such schools in the Eastern States is mentioned . I have been asked to give to the current history of the day a sketch of one of these schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has adjusted events and incidents to the proper perspective is conceded to be almost impossible . Even when the victory is won , and the heart swells with gratitude , the stress and weariness of the conflict , may for a time so dull the ears and dim the eye that one may be insensible to the magnitude of the end achievcd and the far-reaching interest with which it may have been observed . A school which has stood twentysix years in this community has a history full of interest , not only as a // witness and an expression of the character and purposes of its head , but also as a witness for or against the social sentiment and educational demands of the day , and the quality of education which parents really desire and seek for their daughters . In 1864 when I determined to found a school in New York for the education of girls , I was impelled to do so by two motives . One , and the immediate occasion , was of a private nature , and the other and wider motive was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in my mind of founding an institution for the education of the daughters of gentlemen , in which the heart and character should have as much consideration as the intellect , and in which the standard aimed at should be the highest Christian ideal . I desired to build up a school in which American girls of the highest class should be trained to know and fulfil the duties which grow out of their various relations in life as members of the school , the home , of society , of their country , of humanity , and of the Church of Christ . The aim of this school should be to teach them that with them lies the conservation of the dignity and purity of society , and that under the favorable institutions of their country they are bound to exhibit to the world and to transmit to posterity the highest type of womanhood . I would have each one learn that this type is attained by individual culture and . individual discipline . She should learn that happiness , the ultimate end of her being , is secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her reason to the dictates of the Supreme Ruler of the universe . Her intellect must be trained to have a right judgment in all things ; her heart must be kept glowing with the sweet motions of charity , and her love for the beautiful must be cultivated that it may lend its grace and charm to the homeliest lot . While the harmonies of her intellectual , spiritual , and aesthetic nature are thus adjusted , the young girl must be early taught the care and respect which are due to her own body , with a knowledge of its marvellous structure and the phys ical laws which govern it . This was the ideal being whom I hoped to train up to take her stand in history as the representative woman at the opening of the twentieth century . It is in this moulding of the character that I feel that my greatest work for my pupils and for society has been done . I did not expect that every pupil or parent would recognize or appreciate this , for there are many who never lift their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been many in this community and in other parts of this country who prize it above all other advantages , and their approval and support have cheered my heart in the working out this one idea , which lifts the teacher above the prose of mechanical drudgery and stamps her common daily life with the signet of a Divine commission . In setting out to perform a work one must not only have a clear and well-defined idea of the purpose to be accomplished , and the organized system and method by which to attain that end , but one must also consider the character and dispositions of the agents to be employed , and the quality of the material presented with which that aim is to be achieved , and upon which the methods and the skill which one can control may be brought to bear . It is also important for those who have in their hearts high hopes to achieve , and who would venture their time , energies , and fortune to secure this purpose , to count the cost and weigh the chances of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon material or physical wants , but upon the wills and dispositions of the people in the community , a close analysis must be made as to the quality of that people and the motives which sway their wills and dispositions . The selection of teachers , and the bringing of various talents , qualifications , and dispositions into one organization , guided by one motive power , and quickened by one energy , has caused me more solicitude , more earnest prayer for right judgment than any other duty . The head of the school stands sponsor for posterity ; and the consequence of a false step here can not be calculated . Unsound principles , careless // habits , incorrect language , or personal peculiarities in a teacher will be transmitted to remote generations . Higher class work can always be assigned to IJuiversity men , but the numberless applicants who present themselves for the routine work of a girl 's school may be divided into two classes . To one belong those who , having from youth looked forward to that occupation , have fitted themselves in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who , though professionally equipped with good knowledge of the subject which they intend to teach , have revolved in a limited , and perhaps not exalted sphere , and often lack that inherent refinement and breadth of culture which aid so largely in the education of the young . In the other class are included those who come into the profession by other routes , those who , when compelled to depend on their own exertions for a support , bring into requisition for that purpose their educational attainments and personal accomplishments . As special qualifications are more easily acquired than high breeding and refinement of character , I have often found this class of teachers more available for my purpose . They often bring to their work a singleness of heart , and a devotion and fidelity which come only from a high sense of vocation . In estimating the value of a teacher , mere information is too often mistaken for ability or mental power . The memory may be filled with facts , like an encyclopaedia ; choice bits of knowledge may be laid up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires something more than the mere possession of knowledge . The number of qualified teachers bears no proportion to the demand , especially for the training of young children . The few who are qualified scorn to take that most important work of all , the primary department of the school . I have always felt the most intense interest in the trials and joys of children . Childhood should be gay and happy , free to turn its tendrils whithersoever it will , and to catch every gleam of sunshine from every source of love . Years ago my imagination was so depressed by a painting of the massacre of the Holy Innocents , and by Mrs. Browning 's " Cry of the Children , " that ever after they were to me like memories of some terrible experience . The thought of the army of children pattering along the streets and highways at five o'clock in the morning to the mines and factories of England , and back again at nine o'clock at night to their wretched hovels , sick and faint , to die-without sunshine and without cheer-harassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboring with Parliament to mitigate their sufferings . But more cruel than King Herod , more obdurate than the heart of the British legislator , is the system which condemns little children of a tender age to spend long , weary hours of every day in constrained positions in crowded rooms and stifled air , loading their little minds with burdens which they can not bear . In the words of the Rev. Henry Latham , " the receptive and carrying power of the mind of a child has a limit , and must carefully be measured . " Dr. Carpenter , in his " Principles of Mental Physiology , " explains the necessity of time for the forming of permanent impressions on the brain , and the slow processes of intellectual development ; he says this " assimilation can not be hurried ; the mind will only absorb at a certain rate . " This verdict , though by one of the most careful observers , and the wisest of modern men , is the one which the intelligent educator has the most difficulty in carrying out . Many parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results immediately , and judge of the progress of the pupil by the amount of memorized knowledge , which , as by a draft at sight , can be produced on demand . It is also astonishing to find how many , who are called good teachers , insist on this process of cramming the memory with knowledge , which Mr. Latham says " has no educational value to expand the mind or arouse the intellectual activity of the child , that strengthens no faculty but memory , and , in the end , by weakening others , may destroy even that . " I have been called to the school-room to witness feats of memory prepared as an agreeable surprise for me . I would find the children standing in a line , with // hands behind them and their little tongues would rattle off the names of the rivers of Asia and all the capes of South America . In higher classes I would be edified by a long column of dates and difficult rules of grammar . I always praised the children for their work ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher also . But if failing in subsequent efforts to convince her of the mischief of this method , upon psychological principles , I was constrained to change her for one more to my mind , it was with the sure knowledge that the credulous ear of parents would listen to , and sympathize with , her sufferings in the cause of education , and that the struggle to define the mysteries of qualitative and quantitative and participial adjectives by children who could not even pronounce the words , would still go on where no protecting hand would be stretched out over their heads . In taking charge of little children the bead of the school stands in the place of the parents . With children of tender age this parental care must ever be quick and vigilant . The judgment of children is imperfect and their feelings sensitive ; and with them the instructor holds the key of happiness or of misery . Teachers of little children are often more anxious to impose their own routine and methods than to develop the power and the faculties of the pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my greatest trials , and it is here that I feel almost constrained to acknowledge that I have suffered defeat-not as the world calls defeat ; but in not having been permitted to do with these little ones that which in honor and conscience I felt bound to do . The true teacher must be a true artist and have an insight into the nature of the child ; she must bring imagination and all the highest faculties to bear upon her work . But the appreciation of true artistic work in any direction has been very slow to develop in the natures of the citizens of this great commercial metropolis . It is only the elect to-day who know , or care to know , a chromo from a Rembrandt . The next consideration with which the school must concern itself is the quality of the material with which it has to deal . With purpose and principles avowed , with teachers engaged , the head of a school awaits the advent of that class of pupils for which these plans have been formulated . The private school is confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil who supports the school . In public and endowed schools the pupil knows that the state or college gives her education , and conforms her conduct to the situation . In a private school parents and pupils very properly regard the arrangement in the light of a contract . In many cases the pupil is allowed to choose for herself the school to which she will go ; and this fact is announced at her entrance . It may readily be seen how complicated relations between principal and parents and pupils might become , were there not a simple and strict system of ethics brought to bear on the first inauguration of the school . I have informed my pupils at the beginning of each year that while yesterday we were strangers to each other , having no relations to sustain , to-day their parents , by placing them in my care-not to promote my prosperity , but for their own greatest good-had entered into a covenant with me , which covenant I , by God 's help , was determined to fulfil . I should also do all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they failed in will and disposition to do so , I should regard the covenant as broken , and they must retire at once from the school , for I would never retain a member who was a let or hindrance to others , or a trial and vexation to myself . The young are generous and valiant , quick to see and respond to relations . A leader who will inspire them with enthusiasm and establish an esprit de corps must have firmness and courage , and move unswervingly upon the lines of inflexible principles . But , this once done in a school , good government is forever insured . During twenty-sixyears , never , in a single instance , by word or act , has disrespect been shown to me by a member of my school . I have treated them all with the same courtesy as if they were my guests . I have been scrupulous to receive them every morning in suitable attire . I have always received and taken leave of them standing , often when // I was very weary . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving a salutation , and if , after spending much time and money in having them taught and trained in the most exacting system of manners and etiquette , on the evening of the week which I set aside to entertain them I required from them a careful toilet and a court courtesy , it was because I wished them to be equipped for extraordinary occasions , as well as for the usual amenities of life . The rehearsal over , their dance and song were unrestrained , and enjoyed by me as much as by themselves . This social drill , which some affect to treat lightly , takes but little time , is good exercise , and gives to the body flexibility and poise . But it gives also to the girls the confidence which enables them on occasions to forget to think of themselves . This material from which the ideal is to be constructed is a being with a physical , mental , and moral nature to be developed and educated . This education is not like a mechanism produced by cunningly fitting together portions of grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptacle to be filled . The child brought for education must be regarded as a distinct personality , different from all other personalities , the result of antecedents and environments upon which , just as it is found at that moment , must be brought to bear the strongest motives and influences , to induce it to make sacrifices or suspend self-indulgence , for the sake of an end at which it aims . So far all true education must be the same . The state will take the child on its way so far as to enable it to become a good citizen ; there its duty ends . The college goes further and aims to make a learned man . The state and the college treat all their children alike ; the curriculum is inflexible , and the stagnation of uniformity is often the result of their rigid procrustean rule . While system , methods , and careful organization must form the groundwork of any school , the true aim of education should be to seek the individual , that it may bestow upon him in himself the fulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no attempt to make a lily of an orchid , or to train a violet into the gay flower of the parterre ; nor , though parents often expect it , and resent the failure to produce it , can the " hyssop on the walls ' be developed into a " cedar of Lebanon . " Strange ideas as to the function of an educator are sometimes met with . A socially ambitious mother , in a city renowned for the beauty and grace of its women , was greatly disappointed that her daughter , one year a pupil of the school , and an amiable and clever girl , did not take rank in society as a reigning belle . Nothing could exceed her bitter reproaches against the school on that account . Instead of fostering false , unwholesome ideals , and worldly-mindedness , a good school corrects all of this , and gives to the pupil principles of action , high ideals , and practical habits which steady her through the vortex and over the dangerous strands of modern life . A bright and rather handsome girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school life with me . She was respectful to her teachers , courteous to her companions , and though perhaps rather intense , most kind to everyone . Nothing in her disposition or bearing indicated the attention with which the eyes of the world would hereafter regard her . On taking her from school her mother informed me that her eldest daughter had married a humdrum man and settled down to mediocrity , but that she was determined that this daughter should have a career . She should take her to Newport for the summer , bring her to New York for the season the next winter , and with the experience thus gained take her to London the following summer for the success which she had planned . The Atlantic cables and foreign and home papers of every degree have borne testimony that she achieved her career . The yellow-covered novel idea of a girl 's boarding-school is also familiar and amusing . In The Popular Science Monthly some time ago was an article devoted to " Hy .. giene in the Education of Women , " in which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ladies lead . It says : " The system of // fashionable boarding - schools , whose anxiety to render their pupils accomplished and fascinating at all costs resuits in a forced and at the same time imperfect training which , combined with luxurious living , absence of exercise , and other healthy circumstances , tends to increase the irritability of the nervous system and to foster a precocious evolution of character . As this is increased , tone and energy are diminished . The girl returns from school a wayward , capricious , and hysterical young lady , weak and unstable in mind , habits , and pursuits . " There may be schools like this , there must have been somewhere at some time an original and a negative for all these worn-out impressions which are thrust upon the public view ; but Ihave never seen one , and I think it time to adjust the camera to a new subject . The boarding-school with which I am familiar has in it none of these hysterical , capricious young ladies . If such an one enter she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfpast seven , a brisk walk at half-past eight , morning prayers at nine , followed by class and study until noon ; then a hearty luncheon ; class and study again until 2 P.M. leave little time for anything maudlin , or for the greatest bane of a young girl 's life , introspection . Each hour she passes into a new atmosphere , where new enthusiasm makes the time fly as on wings . At two o'clock all emerge into the open air  --  the day-scholars to go home , the boarding-scholars to the park for an hour ; on their return , a slight repast awaits them ; then music with masters , or study in a room with a governess ; the hour from five to six with French or German conversation , brings the time to dress for dinner . Dinner , at which the canons of good breeding are strictly observed , lasts an hour , after which is recreation or repose . From eight to nine study , and at half-past nine a governess puts out the lights and the house is quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nervous system and to send the girl home a wayward , capricious , and hysterical young lady . " On the contrary , the brains are hardened , good salutary hab its are formed , promptness and careful value of time become the rule ; good manners , from being enforced by example and precept , become second nature , and the doctor is seldom in demand . Notwithstanding all the pressure which comes at the end of the school year , the girls might be exhibited at that time as specimens of perfect normal health . The visits to Huyler have been almost the only disturbing element in the sanitary record . By an accurate estimate , with proof ( including doctor 's fees , lessons lost , medicine , etc . ) , I have demonstrated to the girls that a pound of candy may , and often does , cost them twenty doflars . This demonstration with a limitation of such visits to Saturdays of late , has mitigated somewhat my sufferings , as well as theirs . As some of them assure the doctor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York school , this is surely a triumph . Besides educational and financial considerations a private school is expected justly to exercise a peculiar care in the selection of pupils in respect to their social desirability as associates . Here a narrow and false policy must be guarded against . Social questions must be considered with great care and discretion , which only the initiated can be supposed to appreciate or to have discovered . A woman 's education must qualify the individual to hold her place and fulfil her relations in the society or community in which her lot is cast . In this country the class called the best society is constantly recruited from the rank and file ; there is therefore the absolute necessity of infusing the healing and vivifying influences of true education , the pure ozone , into the very depths . The aesthetic arts , the love of nature , the love of beauty , should go hand in hand with the rudiments of learning into our common schools , into our public institutions , even into the schools of the almshouse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath it , no place too lowly , if it contains a being who may bear the title and have the right to exercise the functions of an American citizen . But if these classes should feel these // influences , what shall we say of those who stand in the front ranks of society , who stand so high that , like the sun , their influence is felt in every orbit of the social system ? All this the patriotic educator must have in view when the first impression is made upon the sensitive nature of the young child . This little being is to become an essential factor in the world 's history . And , in view of such an awful responsibility as the moulding of an immortal spirit , the educator should hold on her way , never temporizing with adverse influences , whether from gigantic wealth or uncompromising ignorance . The history of social life in a nation is happily not always the history of the special circle which comes to the front in a metropolis , and yet the influence of that portion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . It is the outcome of influences and institutions most interesting to the philosophical inquirer , and it is a question worth considering , how far a people is justified in allowing that set or coterieto have sway . In the matter of extravagance , with the old republics of Italy and many other governments , sumptuary laws were thought necessary . In England to-day the Duke of Westminster is compelled by act of parliament to expend a certain proportion of his vast income in repairs and renewals of his London estate . No one can more seriously respect a proper regard for the early associations of children than the writer . Evil communications corrupt good manners , and the true and conscientious teacher should keep the atmosphere which the innocent child is to breathe morally and spiritually , as well as physically , pure . More than this : A private school , which is supported by the parents , owes a duty to those parents that vulgarity and coarseness should not enter in . But parents must not ask too much of the school . The true work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even at the cradle . In any theory of education worth considering , it is the first and earliest years which are to be directed with discretion and truth . This done , the higher education , of which so much has been said and written , becomes an easy matter . It is owing to the mistakes and caprices of parents , at this early period , that good schools have difficulty in keeping up a high standard . Too often the first thought of a mother over the cradle of a little child , especially if it be a girl , is how to steer and trim her little bark so that at the proper age she may float upon the serene seas of social success . The schemes , and devices , and worries of young mothers in New York to achieve this end ; the complications in which they involve themselves , and the eaergy which they expend to control or to interfere with the affairs of a school in matters of which they have no knowledge or skill , would be amusing were it not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education of their children , it is this meretricious end alone which many parents are seeking . The teacher receives their children with the knowledge thaL her best work will never be appreciated . And the saddest thing of all is that the children see through these wretched subterfuges of the tuft-hunting parents . Such a child , taught at school that " she must not be puffed up , and not behave herself unseemly , and not seek her own , " and that she must speak the truth from her heart , often becomes at home , in her guileless innocence , a witness against the double dealing of her parents . She is furnished by them with a list of little girls with whom she may not play . But , in happy forgetfulness , she transgresses ; she can not understand why she should be put to bed without a supper for playing with a good little girl , and why her parents should wish her to play with a naughty little girl who disobeys and grieves her kind teacher . The child is perplexed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents are in a dilemma , for " they have promised and vowed that their child should love , honor , and obey its teachers , spiritual pastors , and masters . " They end the difficulty by cutting her off from the good school , and sending her to one more subservient ; or , oftener , by joining her to a private class in charge of one whose poverty of mind or estate suggests no perplexing questions . After many shifting experiments , this child is sometimes brought back to the school // a mental wreck , too far gone for repair ; or she is launched into society with no discipline , no acquirements , no armor in which to trust against the life which she is to confront . This is not the least of the trials which a conscientious teacher must face . The great success of a school is often won by features which the head of the school regards as accessories rather than essentials , and the best and most serious work is done almost by guile , and with no hope of winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has upon the roll names recognized as of social consequence , the teacher is often humiliated by the conviction that it is not the educational , but the external social advantage , which brings the new pupil . But in a large community with multifarious interests , like that of New York , there is always an important and intelligent class of citizens who are above all such baser motives . They really desire and seek for their children the best education which can be obtained . They have some faith in schools which have borne the test of time and the perils of success . Their social standing , and that of their children , is secure . In their recognition and support the honest and uncompromising school will always win in the end . Often , when I have led girls to the crowning moments of their school life , have seen them resist pleasure , self-indulgence , and temptation because of real enthusiasm for their work , as well as to please their parents and do credit to the school ; when I have watched the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I returned them to their parents as pure in heart as when in the timidity of childish innocence they first placed their hands in mine , and believed that their parents would guard these treasures with jealous care ; I have seen that which has filled my heart with grief . These parents , entitled by high birth and gentle breeding to every social advantage , have themselves stood aloof from the new society , and shrink from its demands upon their comfort , its late hours , its midnight suppers , and its morning dances ; and , have confided their innocent and beautiful daughters to the care of some old campaigner on whose face are scored many sharp and ignominious social conflicts , who will gladly induct them into the devious mazes of her social code in exchange for the notice and the court which their youth and beauty bring to her at the opera or the ball . One tempestuous winter 's day , when naught but dire necessity would be supposed to lead one out into the storm , the mother of one of these girls entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have come to open my heart , " she said , " to ask your counsel , and beg your sympathy . " Her daughter had been two winters in society under one of these chaperones , and had just opened her mother 's eyes to the quality of education which this experience had taught her . The mother then repeated to me phrases from the vocabulary of the club men and older women , innuendoes and sayings , the double meaning of which her daughter had interpreted to her . That which had distressed her most of all was that , while last winter her daughter could not hear this talk without dropping her eyelids and blushing most provokingly , now she could hear it all without a qmver of the lip . I could give her no comfort , but reminded her that she should not have confided to another the choicest and most delicate trust which life can bring to a woman . And so these parents send their sons and daughters through the fire to Moloch , and then ask why they are scarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society for the last fifty years has not fulfilled its promise . In 1839 , the date of the diploma given to me when I completed my own school education at the Albany Female Academy ( which Dr. Andrew S. Draper recently said is the first higher educational institution for women the world ever knew ) , one should , upon the principles of the theory of evolution , have been able to prognosticate the character of the social condition of this country for the next quarter of a century . Virtuous , dignified , and religious , the American woman was the central figure // of every household , presiding over her realm in great security , not vexing her mind with questions of rights and privileges which had never been disputed : and if she lived in bondage it was of her own choosing , after her own heart . The men of our cities had not organized themselves into clubs , but spent their evenings with their families , or in social enjoyments where the young and old met together at an early hour and dispersed at midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its career . Were one to draw a social picture of that day , there would be seen , of a winter evening , the cheerful drawing-rooms , the bright open fires ; father and mother in one room reading , or perhaps playing whist with some neighbors ; the daughters in an adjoining room , guests dropping in to chat over the gossip or news of the day , to sing a new song , perhaps accompanied with the violin or cello , to discuss the last chapters of Dickens or Thackeray , just received by the last packet , an essay by Macaulay or Carlyle , or a poem by Tennyson . If there were no questions of intense interest at home , the Oxford movement in England , the Syllabus at Rome were subjects of lively discussion , and now and then some lately returned student from the German universities treated us to a discourse upon the new philosophies . In those days there were very few of the suffering poor , even in our large cities , and it was the boast of our institutions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respectable livelihood . Those were rare days , and young men and women were receiving that fulness and richness of the higher education which can only be found in the agreeable intercourse of cultivated society . There was a zest to social life ; at an evening gathering the guests were capable of entertaining themselves , and were not constrained to listen to recitals from romantic young people , paid to entertain them . Young men of talent received the polish and fine finish , the " delicatesse , " so charming in the older men to-day , but which is lost to the generation which has spent its evenings , its Sundays , and leisure hours in the society of other men , at clubs . But events at home and abroad , maforeseen but startling and stupendous , conspired to arrest this quiet social evolution , and to develop suddenly a new order of things , bringing to this people unprecedented problems which were to test their social and political institutions to the last degree . All this was to be considered in determining the type of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the active energy evolved by the new order of things occupied itself was that to secure to woman the rights and privileges which she needs in order to qualify herself for the duties which modern life imposes upon her and which are her birthright . Among these privileges , and which should be held dear by all women , was that which President Andrew D. White prefers to call the further education of woman , and this watchword soon became a call for the exhibition of reforming zeal . It became the characteristic mark of the higher education reformer to recognize no " higher education " which should not be submitted to a board of college examiners and to loudly and sweepingly condemn the private schools for girls . The true plan was asserted to be , to take the system of preparatory schools and colleges for men , just as they found them , and press the young girl up to that standard , laying upon her in some colleges additional manual labor , like waiting at table , washing dishes , and chamber-work , which , while it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time which might well be spent in cultivating the tones of the voice and refining the pronunciation of the English tongue , or be utilized in becoming acquainted with high standards of womanly refinement and grace , or in studying the lives of some perfect woman who has lived and left her record . It might perhaps be fairly urged that the colleges for women , while doing good work on strictly intellectual lines , neglect that liberal and social culture which distinguishes artistic work from the merely mechanicaL A very few years ago , the catalogues of all these colleges showed but ten names of pupils from New York , and very few from the other large towns , and since then this average has not been // raised . This might be held to show that there is a large demand for another and different system of liberal education which these colleges do not satisfy . While the course of instruction which they offer - identical with that in colleges for men , and graduating their students at twenty-two and twenty-five years of age-is worthy of encouragement and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those girls who , as women , are sure to fill most important and influential positions throughout the land , will leave school at a much earlier age . The conditions of modern life in this great and growing country are such , that the average American girl of more favored circumstances may step from the school-room , generally before she is twenty years old , into a station where the demands of domestic , social , charitable , and practical affairs leave her little time for further systematic study , and yet tax every resource of her store of knowledge and acquirement . If , then , she is confronted with subjects of which she is ignorant , but with which she should have acquired at least a speaking acquaintance while at school , she may justly reproach her teachers that they have adopted the mistaken policy of educating a girl who was to leave school at twenty on the plan requiring a continuance at school till at least twentythree . Though many have doubted the possibility to provide for this active and proper demand , without compromise which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficiality , I am justified in having adopted and for many years defended such a plan , by the highest authority among the educators of modern times . The Rev. Henry Latham , Master of Trinity Hall , Cambridge , in his admirable work on the Action of Examinations , published in 1877 , defines a " liberal education as that which concerns itself with the greatest good and highest cultivation of the pupil , valuing any accomplishment it may give , for the perceptions it opens out , for the new powers it confers , or for some other good it may do the pupil , and iwt as in technical education with reference to work produced . " This defines preciselythe purpose and scope of the private school for girls , distinctly laid out by myself in 1864 , viz. , to afford to girls the best liberal education possible , consistent with certain limitations of age and the demands of their future lives  --  and from this purpose I have never swerved . Under this idea the regular course differentiates itself in the very beginning from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an advanced college course to follow . I took the college system for men , and eliminated from it studies , the educational value of which were questioned by high authorities , and adapted it to the needs of women . Just now , when in these colleges woman has demonstrated that she can do in an examination just as much and as well as a young man , the great universities of England and America have discovered what a quarter of a century ago I believed to be the case , that much of this preparation is a waste of time and energy . In the Forum of April last , is a paper by President Dwight , of Yale College , every word of which went to my heart . For twenty-six years the epithets of " fashionable , " " superficial , " have been applied to my system by the educational " Beckmessers " of the day , for exhibiting the very principles and views which he promulgates . President Dwight says , " If I am asked , therefore , what a boy who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is-of course bearing in mind the limitations which my thought and the nature of the case suggests-he should know everything . This is the richness of the blessing which education has to give , and which it may give  --  the richest of all the blessings which our human life knows or can know , except that of the personal union with God . " Discipline gives the man the use of his powers . It almost creates them . It is of infinite importance , and is the fundamental necessity in all education . " But enthusiasm sets the powers in motion , and fires the soul with the love of knowledge , and carries the man forward as on joyful wings . " " Discipline was the gift of the old education-that which the fathers received and handed // down to their children . " " The ordinary boy of our educated families lost , in my judgment , under the old system of school education , from two to three years out of the seven that were allotted for his earlier studies . He moved along his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is expected of woman whose nature feels every vibration of the greatly expanded moral medium about her in these latest years of the nineteenth century ? What education shall serve her under these varying and complex relations , under the burdens which one 's duty to one 's neighbor impose upon the American woman who stands upon the frontier of the twentieth century after Christ ? Science and relentless truth are already at work with her portrait . There shall be no mystery , no romance ; no poetic glamour will have to be dispelled when her likeness shall be exhibited . She will stand in the blaze of the electric light . The camera will be levelled upon her from every point of view ; the stethoscope and thermometer will record every palpitation and degree of temperature of the heart ; and the knife of the vivisector will reveal the source of the emotion which brings the blush to her cheek and the light to her eye . I was told by Sir William Thomson , that Americans excel all nations in making instruments of precision ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shall cry , not in shame but in innocence , for the rocks and the hills to cover her-not from the wrath of God , but from the curiosity of man . I have implicit faith in the American girl . The springs and impulses of her being are pure . It is expected of her that her education must enable her to fill any position which the civilization of the twentieth century may develop . She should have all knowledge , which must appear in her conversation not as learning , but distilled in the alembic of her brain , it must wait upon her lips with the amber perfume of culture . Like the model lady described by Baldessare Castaglione in the sixteenth century-she must be of " noble bearing , but without affectation , graceful and virtuous , witty , and to excel in dancing and all festive games , yet be able to guide the house , to be well skilled in needlework , pious and learned in the writings of the great doctors , a discreet wife and a careful mother . " The Alma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of responsibility was filled , if ( not only from a thousand homes in the city of New York , but from the Atlantic coast to the Golden Gate , from Puget Sound to the Rio Grande ) by beautiful and sensible girls and young wives and mothers rejoicing in health and happiness , performing with intelligence and devotion their duties to family , society , and the Christian church , its name was spoken with reverence and affection . But its influence is not limited by this broad continent . American women are wielding a great influence in foreign lands , either for better or for worse . Not only in England and France in places of responsibility , but near the throne in Germany , Italy , and other countries they fill positions of highest dignity . For many years there has been no time when some pupils of my own were not residing in honorable positions at foreign courts , or discharging with discretion and grace duties and obligations which have no place in the simpler social system of our Republic . It has been my ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the chief agents in developing whatever is true and faithful in the home , whatever is pure and dignified in society , whatever is holy and exalted in religious life , whatever impels the people of all nations to bow with an instinct of respect to the name of an American woman.
