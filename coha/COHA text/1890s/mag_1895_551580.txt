By Raymond L. Bridgman . WIT HI N ten miles of theAtlantic coast , from southern Maine to Florida , no higher elevation can be found than the historic Blue Hill of the town of Milton , from whose primitive Indian neighbors the state of Massachusetts takes its name . Rising six hundred and thirty-five feet above tide water , and more than one hundred feet higher than any other hill in the range which bears its name , it overlooks a wide expanse of country and commands a prospect of rare beauty and variety . The view seaward extends thirty-three miles , and the Uncanoonuc mountains in New Hampshire are visible on clear days . The hill is so far raised above local disturbing atmospheric influences that it is one of the best places in the country for scientific study of the phenomena of the weather . This advantage was appreciated by Mr. A. Lawrence Rotch , the scientist hy whose liberality the observatory is maintained ; and in August , 1884 , 40 the idea of establishing a meteorological station occurred to him . With characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of September a force of twenty men began work upon a road to the top , which they finished in ten days . Plans for the observatory were speedily drawn ; work upon the structure began October i 8 ; by December 6 the building was roofed in ; and on January 31 , 1885 , the energetic founder and bis observer moved into their quarters . Since then the observatory has become famous . An enthusiastic corps of young men has surrounded the leader from the beginning , and the results already achieved are highly satisfactory , while the promise for the future is no less than " brilliant , " in the judgment of the meteorologist of the station , Mr. H. Helm Clayton . The observations and investigations of these weather experts have deep popular interest , in addition to their scientific value , and it is on the popular side that this account of their discoveries is written . Careful observations are made and recorded constantly by self-registering instruments , and there is not an hour , since the apparatus was set at its involuntary task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEATHER STUDIES AT BLUE HILL .

Whenever in the future new problems in science have need of these facts , here they are ready to serve a purpose which was not anticipated by the men who found in them abundant material for the science of the weather which they were slowly and with much caution reducing to greater exactness . At the first meeting of the New England Meteorological Society , October 21 , 1884 , Mr. Rotch stated the purpose of his enterprise to be " the investigation of the rainfall at this elevation , the velocity and direction of the wind , the maximum and miniMETEOROLOGIST OF THE STATiON .

" In the science of the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotonous tables of figures which are furnished by these deaf , dumb and blind observers , which work at all hours of the day , in all weathers , never becoming hungry or tired , when translated by the intuitive intelligence of the weather calculator reveal a condition of affairs which is not suspected by the average citizen , and which perhaps might be disputed by him , were he not sure that the facts are on the side of the observatory . One of these singular facts is that the wind tends to veer completely around the compass during the twenty-four hours of every day . This motion of the air is slight and generally it is , of course , wholly broken up by stronger currents which sweep away such a minor force as is trying to assert itself in this form . But the records prove indisputably that in the H. HELM CLAYTON , // CUMULO NIMBUS . early part of the day there is a tendency for the wind to blow from the east . As the day advances , the wind veers to the south ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at night there is a return from the north of what went in that direction in the middle of the day . Now for the explanation , as it is given by Mr. Clayton . The atmosphere surrounding the earth , even if it is two hundred miles high , as is supposed , is only a very thin shell compared with the entire globe . When the sun shines upon it , the heat expands it and it is set in motion . With the sun in the east , the expansion forces the air westerly . When the sun is on the meridian , the current away from it would be to the north . When old Sol is heating the air in the west , the expansive force would make the air flow eastward ; and at night the air which was forced north at noon returns , thus giving a complete circuit of the compass by the wind regularly every twenty-four hours . Still further in this same line , there is found to be a tendency of the wind to veer around the compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the south has the greatest frequency in May and June . By July it is southwest . August and September also show that this breeze is partial to them . The favorite months for the west wind are November , December , January and February . The northwest wind rages especially in March . April is preferred by the CLOUD EFFECTS , northeast ; and the southeast chooses May for its portion . These tendencies are clearly revealed by the observations . But this truth must not be confused with the other truth , that there may be more of a given direction of wind in one month than in any other , and yet there be more of other wind in that month than of the one under consideration . Here is the companion truth , - that at the Blue Hill observatory the prevailing wind is northwest from February to April , is south in May , is southwest in summer , and is west and northwest for the other months of the year . There is an excess of northwest wind in March . Taking the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show wind in the quarter from southxvest to northwest . The same distinction is to be observed in speaking of the daily motion of the air . Taking all the currents together , the greatest frequency of south wind is at CUMULUS. // WEATHER STUDIES AT BLUE HILL . eight o'clock P.

From that time the hour moves backward rapidly until it reaches two o'clock in April , then it advances until it reaches six o'clock in July ; but by the time the sunrise has been delayed till after six o'clock , in instruments the floating objects are the clouds ; and this branch of weather study is most interesting . Now we deal with dizzy heights , with short-timed observations , and with almost inconceivable velocities . The highest cloud-forms at times float at a level of ten miles above the surface of the earth , and the velocities at which they fly are so furious that if the same speed were encountered as continuously at the surface the present orders of vegetation and of architecture could not endure for a day . THE BLUE HILL OBSERVATORY . // In a general way , the observers recognize five different cloud-levels . Highest of all is that which they have named in scientific circles the cirrus level . Level number two is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cumulus ; and level five , the stratus level . These names are given from the peculiarities of the clouds which are found at these levels respectively . These are the broad classes of clouds ; but there is a long list of compounds with which the reader need not be burdened here . Many excellent cloud photographs have been taken at the observatory , and some of them are here reproduced . Ninety per THEODOLITE ON OBSERvATORY TOWER . ( INITRUMENT FOR MEASURING THE HEIGHT OF CLOUGI. ) cent of these different kinds of cloud have been found by observation to float in the air at the following elevations : the cirrus clouds , from 23,000 to 39,000 feet ; the cirro-cumulus , from 14,800 to 29,500 ; the alto-cumulus , from 6,6oo to 16,400 ; the cumulus , from 3,300 to 8,200 ; and the stratus , below 3,300 . But the clouds do not float as high in winter as in summer , by any means . The air is colder at great heights . Currents of warmer air do not rise as high . The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man wraps his garments closer for warmth . The average height of the most distant clouds is 32,000 feet in summer ; but in winter they are more modest and come down to an average of 26,279 . Those in level four are still more struck with the cold , for they drop from an average of 26,987 feet in summer to 16,528 in winter . As we come nearer the earth the relative difference between summer and winter is smaller , but still it is material . For the clouds of level three the average summer height is 13,868 feet , but only 11,428 in winter . The cumulus level falls only from 5,435 feet in summer to 5,153 in winter , while the average of the lowlying stratus clouds is 1,847 feet in summer , and 1,489 in winter . But these are average VIEW FROM BLUE HILL DURING A FOG , SHOWING TOPS OF HiLLS AS ISLANDS . // the surface of the earth , or only a short distance above it . Occasionally the elevation ' of a stratus cloud is learned by walking down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then it can be seen , the lower surface a mass of broken and ragged projections , drifting rapidly by , permitting close observation of what is usually too distant for a speaking acquaintance . At times the cloud extends wholly to the surrounding country and is what every one knows as a fog . Sometimes the top of the hill is above the fog , and the other points of the Blue Hill range can be seen above the white covering which envelops them , rising above its level like islands from the sea . Excellent photographs have been taken showing this condition of the landscape . The inquiring reader may question whether the heights of clouds can be accurately determined ; and there is force in the doubt , for great difficulties exist which can not be wholly overcome . A cloud is usually an indefinite object . To fix the location of a point of one is not like locating a definite object , like a distant balloon . The observers find , as a rule , that the cloud is undergoing such constant and rapid change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over three minutes . Then the aspect of the same point is different at different stations . As there must be two ob* servers , with instruments , a considerable distance apart , it is difficult for them to sight to precisely the same point . So here is a possibility of variation , though the precautions adopted reduce it to less than it would appear at first thought . Elevations of clouds are measured by the theodolite , of which an illustration is given as it was photogiaphed on the top of the tower . Sighting through the eyepiece , the observer brings the intersection of the lines across the other end of the instrument directly over the point of cloud which is under observation . The vertical circle of the instrument gives the angular elevation of the cloud at that point , while the horizontal circle shows in what quarter of the compass the cloud is situated . At the base of the hill , three fourths of a mile away and 440 46 feet below the observatory , is another similar station for observation . Connection by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers can talk with each other and can thus agree upon the particular point to be observed . Having the base line of the triangle at whose apex is the cloud , and having the angle at each end of that line toward the cloud , it is a matter of figuring to find out the distance of the cloud from the earth . Another curious way of learning the heights of clouds is by measuring the angle at which light is reflected from the clouds . The observations for these calculations can be made at night by means of the electric lights of the large places within view of the observatory . Not only is the neighboring town of Hyde Park utilized for science in this novel way , but Quincy , B*ockton , Boston and even Providence , thirty-five miles away . The base line is known ; the WEATHER STUDIES AT BLUE HILL . PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE NORTH STAR , SHO*viNG ITS PATH AROUND THE POLE . // angular direction of the reflected light is measured , and then the height is figured out . Now as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporting world looks with wonder and delight upon WEATHER STUDIES AT BLUE HILL . miles an hour . Now let the observer of either horse or train at its highest speed bear that speed in mind , and then realize that the average speed of the highest clouds in winter - the average , mind , not the maximum - is one hundred miles an hour , while velocities have been observed of 230 miles an hour . This is so great that it is doubtful if one can clearly realize what it means in comparison with the lower rates of speed mentioned . Clouds fly much faster in winter than in summer , and it is estimated at the observatory that the entire mass of the atmosphere , from bottom to top , is moving about twice as fast in the coldest part of the year as in the warmest . It is said , further , that the upper currents are very much more rapid over America than over Europe ; and this accounts for the much faster movements of storms in America . It will not fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before our people had made that reputation for themselves in the eyes of the world - which raises the pertinent question , Are we creatures of our circumstances , or are we mere imitators , or are we great hustlers on our own hook , regardless of the general rush in nature about us ? Clouds have their traits , as persons , - in this particular of speed , at least . Flock clouds move more rapidly than the sheet clouds which lie at the same level . That is , they are PHOTOGRAPH OF LIGHTNING MADE AT BLUE HILL . flyers by nature , and you can not make a sheet cloud fly like a flock cloud , if you , put it at the same height . But , unlike persons , clouds change from one form to another . One way of measuring the speed of low clouds is by timing the movements of their shadows over the landscape . Blue Hill overlooks a wide expanse of comparatively the performance of the pacer who has covered his mile in less than two minutes , or a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and this not for one hour , but one mile . Rarely does any railroad train in our country sustain a rate of one mile in one minute , or sixty // level country lying about it in every direction . Villages dot this expanse in many places , and the distance from one to another is known . If , then , the time in which a cloud-shadow passes from one village to another is learned , the velocity of the cloud-movement is quite accurately ascertained , because the course of the cloud is practically parallel to the surface of the earth . Another way of calculating the velocity of clouds is by observing their motion as it is reflected in a level mirror . The elevation of a particular kind of cloud being known , the angle it would cover in a given time in passing from one part of the sky to another would afford the means of computing its velocity . By use of the mirror , the observer gets rid of the apparent curvature of the vault of the sky , and the observations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the study of the clouds is to determine the proportion of cloudiness to clear sky ; and the means by which this is done is worth attention . By day or by night there is apparatus on the watch , by whose records the determination is made . It is impossible to keep a record for the entire area of the sky ; but for the daytime the sky is assumed to be clear during the hours when the sun is shining , and for the night when the pole star is visible . So the recording instruments must tell when the sun shines or when one can see the north star . For the day observations there is on the south side of the parapet of the tower a glass sphere about three inches in diameter . This acts as a burning glass . Under it and about half an inch from it , where the rays come to a burning focus , is placed a piece of cardboard graduated to show the hours of the day . When the sun is clear , it burns a line along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , there SELF-RECORDING BAROMETER RECORD , SHOWING CHANGES IN PRESSURE DURING THE THUNDER STORM , AUGUST 12 , 1891 . SELF-RECORDING ANEMOMETER RECORD , SHOWING VARIA // is a break in the line corresponding to it . Hence the record is exact for each hour of the day , subtracting the half hour after sunrise and before sunset , when the sun is so low that it does not have burning power . These cards are preserved , and so a record is kept automatically of every hour of sunshine since this apparatus was put into service . By night the record is kept by what is called the pole-star recorder . This curious instrument is possible because the pole star is not at the pole , but distant one and three tenths degrees . The star describes , therefore , a perceptible circle in the sky , in its daily motion . This instrument for registering the amount of cloudiness by night consists of a small telescope with a photographic camera attached . A clock is connected , so that the apparatus is closed in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pole is beautifully photographed without a break . But whenever a cloud passes over the star the line is broken , showing by the length of the break the time during which the sky at the pole was overcast . These different conditions are clearly illustrated in the copies of photographs which are given . On one night the sky was perfectly cloudless , at any rate about the pole , while on the other the star was repeatedly obscured . As in the case of the day observations , the proportion of cloudiness at the point of observation is assumed to be the same as that for the entire heavenly vault . According to the record of one year , for day and night , fifty-eight per cent of the sky was cloudy ; and for another year the record showed fiftysix per cent . The maximum cloud period for the twentyfour hours , taking the year round , is at one I ' . M. , and the minimum is at nine P. M. , while there is a secondary maximum at seven A. M. The maximum has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August and September . The minimum usually occurs between eight and ten s. in. , which makes its average about nine . Observations from the top of Blue Hill concerning the transparency of the air , which is affected partly by cloudiness and partly by haziness , confirm the general impression regarding the comparative clearness at different seasons . Three mountains were selected as standards of observation , - Nobscot , twenty miles distant , Wachusett , forty-four miles , and DRAPERS sELF-REcoRL ) ING ANEMOSCOPE RECORD , SHOWING VARIATIONS IN DIRECTION OF THE WIND DURING THE THUNDER STORM OF AUGUST 12 , 1891. 12 1P.P7.2 3 # SELF-RECORDING THERMOMETER . TEMPERATURE RECORD DURING THE THUNDER STORM , AUGUST 12 , 1891. // Monadnock , sixty-eight miles . Every day since i886 a record has been kept of the visibility of these peaks from Blue Hill . As a rule , Nobscot can be seen on more than two thirds of the days , Wachusett on about half of them , and Monadnock on less than one third . In 1887 Nobscot was seen on two hundred and eighty-one days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *n one hundred and four days . In i888 the corresponding numbers were three hundred , two hundred and forty-eight and one hundred and seventy ; and in 1889 they were two hundred and sixty-four , one hundred and seventy-nine , and one hundred and sixteen . Spring and autumn were most profuse in clear days , good for seeing the broad vision of beauty which stretches into the dim Jistance on every side of the outlook ; while the chief minimum of visibility is in summer , with a secondary minimum in winter . The summer minimum is due to haze or dust , while that of the winter is caused by clouds or storms . As may be imagined from the preceding lines , the top of Blue Hill is the most favorable point in a wide area for beholdlng the great spectacles of nature . If the scene be regarded as a panorama , it is to be said that the presentation is constantly and rapidly changing , and that while it is often peaceful , yet it rises at times to the sublime . Violent storms can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ; and the intensity of the action of the elements , with the brilliant play of the lightning and the crash and roll of thunder , is at times thrilling . Phenomena of thunder storms have been the subject of special investigation by these indefatigable workers , and their records sustain the popular belief that there is often a tremendous force and suddenness to the onset of the storm . The diagrams accompanying this sketch will give ample demonstration of this . One of the most sudden thunder storms on record since the opening of the observatory , was that of August 12 , 1891 and the records made by the self-operating instruments for a few hours of that day are given , with the double purpose of illustrating the suddenness and force of this particular storm and of showing , in a general way , how the records of the weather are taken and preserved . We will begin with the instruments ' storyof this thunder storm by reading the barometer 's account of it , - Draper 's self-recording pencil barometer .

Now , while the barometer was thus suddenly and violently disturbed , what was the wind doing ? It was prodigiously busy , as can be easily shown . Here is an extract from the diary of one of the brothers of old Boreas for the early afternoon . The curving vertical lines give hours of the day , and the horizontal lines give the velocity of the wii*d per hour , in miles . The wind was booming along , before the storm , at the comfortable gait of a trifle over twenty miles an hour , when with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five miles . But the effort was too much for it . In a state of exhaustion it dropped almost immediately to its // former level , and then in a few minutes took a further drop , doubtless for rest , to nearly the ten-mile line . There it recovered breath , and then jogged along at an average of less than twenty miles . But during this dash and retreat it did not keep to its main course at all , but whisked around as if to find out whether there were any easier way than going straight ahead . By Draper 's self-recording anemoscope we are told that there was much shifting from one side to the other . On this diagram the points of the compass are shown by the vertical lines , while the hours , subdivided into twenty-minute sections , are shown progressing downward by the horizontal lines . Before the thunder storm came up , the wind had been shifting slowly from south of west to north of west . With its hurried dash up to fifty-five miles an hour , it wheeled clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock to the southwest , and went on in that quarter . This diagram shows only the average course of the wind . It is practically impossible to reproduce here the details which show the whirling of the vane back and forth incessantly . Still further , what story has the thermometer to tell of this very busy after- SELF-RECORI ) ING RAIN-GAUGE RECORD , SHOWING AMOUNT ' AND RATE OF RAINFALL DURING THE THUNDER STORM , AUGUST 12 , 1891. noon for the other instruments ? The diagram shows its record . The curved vertical lines show the hours of the day , and the horizontal lines show the degrees of temperature according to Fahrenheit . It was a warm afternoon , we see .. It would not be extravagant to say it was hot , for the mercury reached eighty-eight degrees before the storm came on . But , coincident with the great disturbance of the barometer , the anemometer and the anemoscope , the thermometer also felt ( lizzy , and the mercury dropped suddenly and far , as the record shows . But the hygrometer , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this diagram the curved vertical lines are hours of the day , and the horizontal lines are the percentages of moisture in the air , up to one hundred per cent , which is the rain-point . Early in the afternoon , says the hygrometer , it was not particularly moist . The record ran below fifty per cent . But see what a jump the record took just the time the wind made its bold dash ! Up it went at a bound to one hundred , and down came the rain . It was a hard downpour ; for there was another instrument at work , whose record will now be brought in . Here is a section for those hours , from the diagram for the self-recording rain-gauge . The curved lines are the hours , once more , while the horizontal lines show the rainfall to tenths of an inch . Almost half an inch of rain came down in those few minutes before three o'clock , proving how sharp was the shower . One further record will show how long the sun was overcast during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning of the sun into the card , as mentioned above . The transverse lines show divisions into half hours , and the black line running lengthwise through the middle of the card is the burnt hole made by the sun . So we have the story of Sol himself that he was shining steadily , without a cloud across his face , up to almost half past two . Then a forerunning cloud of the approaching storm obscured his brightness for a few minutes ; then his face was out again till the grand onset came , when he went into complete hiding . For almost exactly an hour he was concealed* though the rainfall continued only fifteen minutes . A little before four he was shining once more in full splendor , and so continued for the remainder of the day . // The reader may learn a point from the accompanying photograph of lightning flashes . There are never any zigzags in the course of the electric current . Artists who paint signs for telegraph offices may think so ; but the observations of years , corroborated now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate in the camera , proves that the lines are always curved . It will be noticed in this picture that a part of the cloud lies across the path of the flash . Photographs of flashes prove that the electricity passes from cloud to earth , from earth to cloud , and from cloud to cloud . The records of the observatory prove that there are particular hours of the day when thunder storms are most frequent . For winter thunder storms this maximum is at one o'clock in the morning . During the summer the maximum comes at three different hours , respectively two , four and eight P. i*i. , with a secondary maximum at three o'clock in the morning . The maxima which I come at two and four o'clock are attributed to storms which have their rise in the neighborhood , while the later maxi- SUNSHINE mum is credited to storms which arise in the valleys of the Connecticut and Hudson rivers . The air in valleys becomes heated during a summer day more than that over the hill country , and hence these localities named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the thunder storms* occur between the hours of five and ten in the forenoon . The general maximum is , of course , in summer , and the general mmmmum in winter . The annual distribution of severe gales is the exact reverse of thunder storms , for their maximum is in winter and their minimum in summer . Mr. Alexander McAdie , by experiments conducted at the Blue Hill observatory in June and July , 1891 , not only demonstrated once more the existence of electricity in thunder clouds , but proved further that , by means of copper wire attached to his kites , " it was possible to obtain sparks from a perfectly cloudless sky , and generally at an elevation not exceeding five hundred metres . " That is , the air is a vast reservoir of electricity , ready to be drawn upon at all times , giving a hint to the many inventors and investigators in the field of electricity of a source of exhaustless and irresistible power waiting to be harnessed to the machinery of man . Many people are weather observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking at it when it is nipping cold or blistering hot ; but at Blue Hill they are as methodical in recording the temperature as any of the other features of interest connected with the weather . It is an old saying , that it is always coldest an hour before sunrise . In making that general observation , the average , untrained man is not so far out of the way as unscientific people are sometimes , when compared with the I I I * I RECORD , SHOWING VARIATIONS IN AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE , AUGUST 12 , 1891. exact records . Taking the year around , the minimum temperature for the twentyfour hours of the day is about five o'clock in the morning , while the maximum is at two o'clock in the afternoon . But the minimum is displaced in May and June , falling back to four o'clock , still keeping before the rising of the sun . The maximum does not fall later in the afternoon in summer than from two to three o'clock , as it does further inland , on account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most agreeable disturbance , however , for the people along the coast in hot summer days , and a disturbance of the weather regularities and proprieties which will be readily forgiven . Almost exactly the reverse of the period of daily temperature is the period of daily humidity , showing that warmth of the air tends to favor evaporation and to charge the air more with moisture . // Sudden drops of temperature are much more frequent than sudden rises , as demonstrated by the records of the observatory . According to the definition of the government 's Weather Bureau a cold wave , is " an abnormal fall of temperature below forty-five degrees of , at least , fifteen degrees in twenty-four hours . " By the Blue Hill records , falls of twenty degrees or more at the rate of a degree a minute sometimes occur , while the most rapid rise of ten degrees or more , during seven years covered by the observations , was at the rate of one degree in five minutes . The sudden falls endured from thirty to sixty minutes , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the sudden falls in temperature occur in June and July , and are due to breezes from the sea . In general the cause of sudden changes in the temperature is a shifting of the wind , bringing a different current of air . It is a general truth that the warmest air is close to the earth , and that as one ascends the air is found to be colder . But many inversions of temperature , as they are called , have been observed at Blue Hill ; that is , it is warmer at the top of the hill than at the base . Naturally the temperature is two degrees higher at the base than it is at the summit , and when inversions occur they begin usually about six o'clock in the afternoon and end at seven in the morning . Mr. S. P. Fergusson , the valuable assistant at the observatory , has made a study of this phenomenon and has recorded a difference of temperature between the base and summit of twelve degrees , the summit being the warmer . Sometimes this inversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air will gradually grow warmer as one ascends , till a certain point on the side of the hill is reached , and then it will grow colder . Weather studies by means of the barometer have their fascinating features . For instance , comparison of the hourly records reveals the fact that atmospheric pressure has a double daily period . The chief maximum occurs at nine o'clock in the morning , and the chief minimum is at three o'clock in the afternoon . But there is a secondary maximum which occurs about ten o'clock in the evening , and a secondary minimum comes about three o'clock in the morning . In winter the chief maximum is not reached till ten o clock in the forenoon ; but as the sun rises earlier with its return northward , the maximum pressure folloxvs it until it is as early as eight o'clock in summer . The chief minimum takes just the other tack and is later in summer , advancing from two o'clock in winter to five in June . But the amount of rain has its daily period , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . Taking the amounts of precipitation according to the hourly record , the conclusion of the observatory is that they have a " fairly well marked double diurnal period with minima at two A. M. and one r . M. , and maxima at eleven A. M. and five i . M. " In the several months the amount of the precipitation is very irregular ; but if the six coldest months are taken as one group and the six warmest as another , the preceding conclusion is reached . The amount of the annual rainfall is so irregular that the observers do not think they have been making a record long enough to enable them to say that a certain amount is the average for one year . It is observed that there seem to be three maxima for rainfall during the year , - one in January or March , one in August , and one in November . At most stations in New England where weather observatiohs are made , August is the month of largest fall , while at every station June is the month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September . Ever since literature was , it has borne record to the tempestuous character of the ocean . Scripture and classic authors testify that the much-tossed mariners go down to the depths and , again , almost strike the lofty stars . But the exact mind of the modern man has set about measuring the waves which are reported to run " mOuntains high , " and finds that they come well inside of one hundred feet from trough to summit , if I remember the figures . The billows of the air , however , still afford ample scope for the // story-teller of vigorous imagination , for it is computed by science - the same sort of science which has taken the untruth out of the " mountains " of the ocean - that the waves of the air occur at times from ten to fifteen miles high from trough to summit . No wonder that the weather man hears with contempt the yarns of the storm-tossed mariner , for when it comes to height of waves , the old ocean is out of the contest altogether . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves occur when a lighter stratum of air is flowing over a heavier , and the agitation between them so corresponds to the wave-producing action of the air upon the ocean that genuine waves are formed . The existence of these is ascertained by the variations in the pressure of the barometer ; for the difference between the pulsations , as they are recorded upon the instrument , is such as to require the presence of a column of air ten or fifteen miles high to account for them . We hare already noticed that the weather prophets who have had no scientific training at all have been justified by science ; and a further justification , most interesting , is to be added . It is a common belief , probably ages old , that the moon has an influence upon the weather , and that when the moon quarters , especially at the new moon , a change in the weather is likely to occur . Now , science has been unable to learn that the moon has the slightest influence upon the weather ; but it does find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weather which is abundant basis for the conclusions of the unscientific . Many observers , in all , have recorded a periodicity of about twenty-seven days in the weather , which corresponds with sufficient closeness to the period of the revolution of the moon ; for some people ascribe to the moon any change of weather which occurs within three or four days of the entrance upon the first quarter . Now this twenty-seven-day period corresponds nearly to the time of the rotation of the sun once upon its axis . But there are shorter periods , which bear out the popular fallacy of changes being due to the moon 's entering upon a new quarter ; for Mr. Clayton , at this observatory , has repeatedly recorded seven-day periods in Dhenomena . There have been such recurrences of this period as to establish what is called a rhythm in the weather . There seems to be what may be likened to the harmonics of a string of a musical instrument . After several repetitions , the series is broken up and is lost . Not only is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed six-day periods also . This rhythmic movement of the weather seems to be so connected with the sun that , in the opinion of these observers , forecasts of the weather can be made for a week or two with nearly as much accuracy as for thirty-six hours . Space will not permit mention of the ingenious instruments which are used in making and recording the conditions of the weather . They are at work at all hours , making a continuous record , as the reader can see from the diagrams which were given above to illustrate the thunder storm . These records are carefully preserved , and any one who is interested to learn the condition of air or sky at any hour of day or night during these years will find it exactly set down . Cases in court have turned upon conditions which were shown by these records to have existed at the hour of a disputed occurrence . The amount of figuring connected with these observations is marvellous , and to draw conclusions from the volumes ( which are published as part of the Annals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of technical skill , but also a large fund of patience . One new invention , however , which promises much , may be mentioned , and that is the flying of kites with self-recording instruments attached , by which the conditions of the air high above the earth may be learned . The expert in this field is Mr. William A. Eddy of Bayonne , New Jersey , who conducted experiments at Blue Hill in the summer of 1894 . By means of a series of Malay , or tail-less , kites , attached to one string and sent up tandem , a record of the temperature was obtained at the height of fourteen hundred feet . At that point it was six // degrees lower than at the surface of the . earth . This beginning is believed to open the way for sending up other instruments , and so for adding much to our knowledge of the upper air . Certain material advantages are connected with kites , and the promise of valuable results in this field is excellent . It would be a pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but lack of space forbids . The following description of the building , before the addition of a wing containing a snug library , a workshop and another bedroom , is in the words of Mr. Rotch himself , the public-spirited founder . It shows that the culture of the science of the weather has its drawbacks as truly as the worship of science within the frozen zones or in the heat of the tropics . " The observatory is built of the broken stone found on the hill , with granite trimmings , it consists of a two-story circular tower of twelve feet inside diameter , twenty-five feet high with a flat roof , which contains the instruments . Extending southward from this tower is a one-story hip-roof house , with two bedrooms , a dining.room and kitchen . A wooden shed adjoins . In the construction every precaution was taken to insure solidity , the walls being twenty inches thick , and the roof well anchored to them . It has , however , been found impossible to make the walls impervious to rain , which is driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must contain . Several coats of marine varnish have served to disfigure the stone-work , but not to render it waterproof . The walls of the living rooms are plastered and the floors are of hard pine . In the cellar is a wooden tank , holding nine hundred gallons of water , obtained from the rain falling on the roof , which has always proved sufficient for domestic purposes . A spring furnishes water for drinking . A large stove in the lower room of the tower heats the upper room through a register , and by its flue and that of the kitchen range warms the other rooms also . About ten tons of coal are burnt annually . Double windows are put on throughout the building in winter . A safe built into the chimney protects the records and charts from fire . A telephone line extends down the south side of the hill to the central office in Milton . There are no houses within a mile of the observatory so that , even with this connection with civilization , it is largely dependent on its own resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Clayton were for several years published by the newspapers of Boston and adjacent cities . These were discontinued in 1891 , when the Weather Bureau , appreciating the advantage of local forecasts , established a station in Boston . Mr. Clayton has recently begun the publication of a weekly weather bulletin , giving a forecast of the weather for a week in advance . Already there have been signal verifications of his predictions which can not be reasonably attributed to chance . At the end of four months a summary of results was given , by which it was shown that " at Blue Hill about two thirds of these forecasts were correct , and one third wrong . " While it is admitted that there is much room for improvement , still it is asserted that there is a scientific basis for such forecasts of the weather , and the accomplishments of the past certainly give reason to expect greater accuracy of prediction for the future . The observatory is new ; its observers are young , rapidly adding to a soundness of judgment which has made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicacy are being invented from time to time ; broader bases of facts afford better grounds for generalizations and for the discovery of important laws ; other stations in this country and abroad are co-operating in the general purpose ; and the experience of the past shows how to avoid errors , as well as how to work on the most direct lines . Hence the prospect of still more exact weather science is encouraging , and the public can well afford to wait , trusting to the ability , patience and perseverance of these observers .
