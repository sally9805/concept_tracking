txt William H. Dowling , a young laboree who lives with his widowed mother , Margaret , at 276 /Tenth Avenue , was dying last night at he New-York Hospital of bullet wounds in the throat and abdomen Inflicted by James Tyndn , watchman for Clarke &; Hamilton , lessees of the ballroom at the grand Opera House . Dowling was shot after the ball of the Geisers Association at the Opera House . The ball was what is known as an " overcost " speculation . The title Is not significant , and the scheme was the result of chat on corners and in barrooms of the Thirteenth Assembly District . It was arranged to get out posters with the rallying cry , " Twiggy boo , boys , twiggy boo : " hire the ballroom for $35 , and divide up the profits among the originators of the entertainment , who were John Brennan , President ; Michael Leonard , Vice President ; John Muir , Financial Secretary ; Jamee Rafferty , Treasurer ; James , Recording Secretary ; John Purcell , Corree spending Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these enterprising young men are employed at humble occupations , Brennan working in a hose factory and Rafferty at cart driving for his father . Secretary was a waiter at the ball . The ball was regarded as a quiet one , and there were only two persons ejected , one a girl , for talking Billingsgate to another , and the other a young man , who was " mussy . " Tynan say to it that those who were thrust out of the ballroom left the building . There was a bar in the ballroom , but it is certain that there was no excessive drinking . President Brennan and Treasurer Rafferty left the ball at about 5 o'clock yesterday morning , when all the other officers had gone . There were then about thirty in the ballroom , and they were getting ready to leave . Tynan was at the ballroom door , and appeared to be impatient to close up the place . At about 5:40 o'clock Dowling staggered into the office of the American District Telegraph Company , at 270 West Twentythird Street , bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded , and needed a surgeon , and the night Superintendent . William O'Keefe , called a policeman , who summoned an ambulance . O'Keefe tried to get Dowling to say how and when he was wounded , but he evaded all questions . He , however , said : " If ever I get over this , I will get square with the man who shot me . " Ambulance Surgeon Higgins came , to find Dowling almost in a state of collapse , and discovered the wound in the abdomen , on the left side , near the tenth rib . Dowling rallied when a stimulant was given him and refused again to say how he was wounded . He was hurried to the hospital and word was sent to his mother , who came with her sons , John , who is a bartender at Thirtyfifth Street and Seventh Avenue , and Henry , who is a clerk in a fancy goods store . William was deaf to their pleadings to tell how he came by his hurts . Dowling said to Policeman Madden that he had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  namely , that he did not wound himself , but was shot accidentally , and that he proposed to add nothing to this statement . Madden reported this to Capt . Donohue of the Sixteenth Precinct , who at present has no ward detective . He detailed live policemen to assist Madden and went out himself to get information . Two persons were arrested on suspicion , but at 3 o'clock they were released , when it was known that they were innocent , and that the shooting was not , as was first supposed , in a liquor saloon , but in the opera house by Tynan . At 4:30 o'clock Madden and Policeman Jones , who were in citizen garb , met Tynan with one of his employers , Thomes Clarke , who has a stable in West Twentyfifth Street , at Eighth Avenue and Twentyfourth Street , and arrested Tynan. who said that on the advice of Mr. Clarke he was on his way to the West Twentieth Street Station House to surrender himself . Then he made a brief statement , to the effect that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a request to hurry up , . so that the place could be closed. ? He and  --  Tynangot  --  InTo -- -th. wrangle , and Dowling , who , like Tynan , was a robust man , found an ice pick , and advanced on Tynan in the lobby outside the ballroom . Tynan warned Dowling , without result , and then fired at him . This shot is supposed to have missed . At any rate , Dowling did not desist from attacking Tynan , who fired two more shots . Tynan said he did not know that he wounded Dowling , and that he left the building as if he were unhurt . Capt . Donohue locked Tynan up , and endeavored in vain to find witnesses to corroborate or disprove his story , which the police do not believe . They are of the opinion that Dowling could not have reached the street unaided , and that either , Tynan or some one who was at the ball helped him down stairs . No one was found who saw him in the street , and it is probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Serge . O'Keefe . At the hospital Surgeon Chamberlin decided at noon that Dowling was in such a. critical condition that heroic treatment was necessary , and arranged to have Dr. W. T. Bull , the operating surgeon , there in the afternoon . Dr. Bull decided that the abdominal wound could not be meddled with , but that an operation on Dowling 's throat was necessary to prevent suffocation . Tracheotomy was performed by Dr. Bull . This relieved the patient , but he was not permitted to see Tynan when he was brought to the hospital to be identified . Typ , an lived at Thirty-second Street and Third Avenue , but he often slept at 253 West Twenty-fifth Street . His employers . speak highly of him . He has no police record . Dowling is not known to the police , and his relatives are industrious , worthy people . The surgeons at the hospital say that he was sober when brought there . The shooting was discussed all over the Thirteenth Assembly District . It recalled the murder in the Opera House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Nov. 30 of that year the Linwood Club had a ball at the Opera House , and at it Brown quarreled with Samuel and G  --  or'ee Ogle , who had sneaked into the ball , although in disfavor , because George Ogle had embezzled $100 presented to the club by Alderman Smith . The dispute was renewed in E. Danner 's saloon . ' 250 Eighth Avenue , and George Ogle stabbed Brown in the heart , and he fell dead . The murderer fled to Montana , to shoot and kill a maxi a few days after his arrival there , but he was arrested in New-York Sept. 6 , 1885.
