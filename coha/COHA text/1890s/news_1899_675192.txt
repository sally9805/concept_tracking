txt There is no telling , at least not by us , how old is the saying that republics are ungrateful . " But now the time gives it proof . " KITCHENER 'S victory is a good deal more recent than DEWEY 'S . It did not begin to be of so much national importance as Dnwnv 's . And already it has been rewarded with a fullness that , to ten the simple truth , puts us to shame . Great Britain is often said to be as much of a republic as these United States , and so in many respects she is . But in the matter of honoring national heroes and benefactors she retains monarchical traditions that are of the greatest national value . If a soldier or a sailor serves her with conspicuous efficiency his services are at once recognized in the way that all men desire  --  that is to say , by putting him and his beyond the reach of want . That is what England has done for KITCHENER- That is what the United States has neglected to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country than KITCHENER has done for his . For it was the fortune of DEWEY to be the first to demonstrate to all mankind when for three-quarters of a century we had not been engaged in a foreign war that this was still a fighting Nation and that the United States Navy , which , as well as the United States Army , had been the target of every fool and every demagogue in Congress , had nevertheless lost none of its quality , but through all those years of insult or neglect had been making itself ready in the dark to come out into the light of battle . There may be , doubtless there are , other sailors in it as good as he . But it was he who had the fortune to show first and most conspicuously that we had retained " sea power . " To use a. commercial metaphor , the battle of Manila Bay sent up American stock in every market in the world . Nothing that we can do is too much for the man who has done this for us . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarding our National heroes in the most appropriate way . The Hon. JOSEPH BAILEY of Texas expressed the view that winning such a battle as that of Manila Bay was its own reward , and that the hero of it ought not to expect any other . As well might one of the clients of this statesman , when Mr. BAILEY had won an important and difficult lawsuit for him , tell the cheerful statesman that winning such a suit was its own reward , and that he ought not to expect any fee . And there is a singular editor in Washington of what pretends or aspires to be an organ of the army and navy who takes the same weird and wondrous view . In spite of the absence of such rewards as are given to British soldiers and sailors who have done their country great service and honor , we have no doubt that the trained soldiers and sailors of this country will go on doing their full duty , as they have done it heretofore , though one great incentive to deeds of enterprise and valor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sailors , it is the Nation itself , whose reputation is involved . And it must be owned that in our treatment of DEWEY , whether official or unofficial , we do not shine by contrast with the English in their treatment of KITCHENER .
