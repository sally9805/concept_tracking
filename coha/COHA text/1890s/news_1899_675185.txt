txt Hobart A. Tuttle , private secretary to Gov . Voorheei and a brother-in-law of Vice President Hobart ; ex-Assemblyman Haywar0 . A. Harvey of East Orange , Lawrence S , Mott of Newark , and George A. Denham of Boston are charged with fraud and conspiracy in a suit instituted in the United States Circuit Court to-day . The charge is made against the men as promoters of the Palace Car Company of New Jersey and the American Palace Car Company of Maine . The defendants are accused of attempting to dispose of patent rights and other proberty of the Maine company to the New Jersey corporation without the approval of the stockholders of the New England concern . The complainants , stockholders in the Maine company , are Allen L. Lawrence , Byron A. Eidred , and Sarah A. K. Willis , all of Boston ; Frank O. Hudson of Westfield , Mass. , and Charles T. Place of Syracuse . A. Q. Keasbey &; Sons , representing the complainants , to-day asked for and obtained from Judge Gray an injunction restraining Tuttle , Mott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exchanging , or otherwise disposing of , or altering the statute of any of the patent rights or other property of the Maine company . A rifle to show cause why this injunction should not be made permanent was made returnable June G. It is-set forth in the complaint that the Maine company was formed June 22 , 18:12 , with a capital stock of 81,500,000 . On this amount a limited number of shares were issued to cash subscribers , and the balance was given in exchange for letters patent granted to Charles J. Seymour for a combination parlor and sleeping car . Since June , 1897 , it is charged the complainants have received no notice of any meeting of the stockholders , and have therefore had no voice in the management of its affairs . They further charge that the formation of the New Jersey company and the propo- sition to have it absorb the Maine company are entirely new to them and were made without their knowledge . In June , 1897 , it is claimed , a letter was delivered to Denham , then Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of himself , Harvey , and Tuttle , agreeing to secure - an influential Board of Directors if a New Jersey corporation was formed , and to pay the debts of the Maine company if the latter would give them two shares of its stock in return for one of the New Jersey company . The bpi goes on to say that at a meeting , stated in the minutes to have been held on June 9 , 1897 , but in reality having been held on June T. Mott . Harvey . and Tuttle were elected Directors of the Maine company , together with Edward F. Lowe and Aaron S. Baldwin . It is alleged these Directors secretly and fraudulently connived with Denham in arranging a deal by which the New Jersey company was to take legal . title to the car " Boston , " the only car built by the Maine company , and a dozen patents , all of which were to be , ttarisferea to Harvey as Trustee , without any actual payment to the Maine company for its equity , or large sums expended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fratidu- ' lent arrangement the " Boston " was moved to Jersey City , and is still in possession of Harvey . The complainants say that no intimation of this plan was given to them , and other stockholders at the meeting of June 9 , which meeting was repeatedly adjourned for the purpose , it is alleged , of avoiding the opposition of stockholders who were likely to disapprove of the plan . At one of these adjourned meetings in August , it is asserted , Mott presented a letter , stating that he had been authorized to represent his associates ; that the New Jersey company had been formed and the " Boston " transferred , and he was then ready to carry out the proposition for the transfer of the stock . It is alleged that only ten persons besides Denham were present at the meeting , and that they held only 658 shares of stock in person and 109 by proxy . It is charged that Denham voted a large number of shares of stock which he held as trustee and which belonged to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in this manner a resolution providing for the absorption of the Maine company by the New Jersey company was adopted , and a bill of sale executed by Denham , which included all the personal property , acsignments of patents . and certificates for 4,570 shares of stock of the Mains company . ?
