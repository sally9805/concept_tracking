ARTICLE 11. - ARCHITECTURE AS AFFECTED BY THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION . GENERALLY speaking , there is no more satisfactory index to the social state of any people or any period than its a*-chitecture . Unsettled tribes , those far down in the social scale , with few arts and limited knowledge , will have habitations of the rudest description . A more advanced stage will exhibit better dwellings , sounder construction , more ambitions designs . So true is this that it is almost possible to construct a detailed statement of the evolution of society from architecture alone . It may , however , sometimes happen that some tribe which in other respects stands high in the scale presents a less advanced architecture than another in which the art of building has been carried to a relatively high degree . Instances such as these are to be found in other phases of mental growth , and do not in the least invalidate the general thesis that architecture is a true index to human progress . This is correct until we come to study the architecture of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most advanced civilization the world has seen , accompanied with an architectur&amp;which when compared with that of many previous epochs of history is not only debased but thoroughly out of keeping with the progress that has been made in other branches . This phenomenon is brought home to us in so very many ways , is so self-evident , and so amply illustrated as to raise a question as to the value of architecture as a guide to civilization . The present age , however , differs widely from preceding times . In earlier periods the genius of humanity found vent in art alone , while now a multitude of opportunities for the expansion of intellect present themselves , more in a mechanical and industrial way than artistic . It is , therefore , scarcely just to compare the products of our own time with those of earlier ones . It is not the object of this paper to deal with the problems of the architecture of the XIXth century , but to review the history of the subject with special reference to the influence the advance // of civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection between the two , and to show how the one reflects the other . In the early stages of society architecture had for its object the preservation of human life , the glorification of the sovereign , or of the deities . In other words , prehistoric remains are apparently either fortifications , palaces , or temples . Originally the three were probably not distinct , for the sacred person of the chief or sovereign would be guarded with jealous care , and his dwelling would be constructed with the greatest skill . Whether any existing remains of this distant period are palaces , temples , or forts it is impossible to say with any assurance of accuracy . In Mexico , Central America , and Peru , for example , there are hundreds of ruins that are known to us as palaces or temples that , for all we actually know , have not a shadow of a right to the names . A notable illustration of this confounding of nomenclature is to be found in th' Egyptian temples . These edifices have been known by a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fergusson called them " palace-temples , " their great size and multiplicity of detail misleading even so competent an authority . Recent researches have clearly established the fact that they are temples . No greater misfortune can be imagined than giving an unwarranted name to a building , because by this means attention is unconsciously diverted to a channel That may be far from the truth , and greatly hinder a correct interpretation . Whatever be the nature of prehistoric buildings it can at least be safely affirmed that they relate to ceremonial institutions , either of the state or of religion , or to matters of defence . They exhibit either the power of the ruler , the relative development of the religious idea , or the natural desire of man to defend himself against his enemies . Further than this they do not throw any definite light on the civilization of the people . Historic times supply us with definite facts . Viewing Egyptian architecture through the light gained by a study of Egyptian civilization we see how perfectly it gives expression to it . The enormous buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to years of arduous labor , the costly materials , frequently transported from distant points , the total // disregard of cost or of time or of labor , all point to an exacting and powerful despotism . More than this , these remains show a civilization far in advance of anything known in the ancient world , a civilization so developed , so complex , so full , that its earlier stages are lost in an unknown antiquity . If we coinpare Egyptian monuments of an early date with those of other regions the difference is appalling . The pyramid of ( Jheops , while not the most ancient of these wonderful structnres , is far in advance in technical skill and indicative of the knowledge and ability of its builders , than anything of the same date that can be found elsewhere . In many respects the Egyptians were the most remarkable people who ever lived . Whatever may have been the origin of their civilization , they developed it in their own way , and the results stand ont marked and distinct from all others . The early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doubtless largely answerable for this . The art-forms , not in architecture alone , but in painting , sculpture , and decoration as well , are , on the whole , through all the centuries in which Egyptian art had a life of its own , very similar . They varied , it is tine , but within certain limits , rather than indefinitely , as in the art of Greece . In a country where the artists were absolutely unfettered by law or tradition , such a phenomenon would not have been seen , but this prevailing feature of Egyptian life has left its indelible mark on its*art and its architecture . It would be interesting , though perhaps not altogether profitable , to speculate on what would have been the result had each successive civilization in the ancient world begun where the preceding one left off . All art , indeed , shows a growth , an evolution , from the Egyptian through the Chalda*an , Assyrian , Pho3nician , and kindred styles , to the perfection of the Greek , which , in its turn , culminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each of these people had their own art and their own architecture , and while they borrowed freely from each other , and often one developed a form better than its originator had done , they apparently began in a measure independently , in that they did not take advantage of the full development of the older styles , but only of such essentials and details as seemed best adapted to their uses . // No more striking contrast can be imagined than Egyptian and Assyrian architecture . One was an architecture of stone , the other an architecture of mud ; one expressed the predominance of the priesthood ; in the other the sovereign was the one figure in which all life centered . Both expressed a high degree of culture , a keen perception of natural requirements , a profound knowledge of methods , as well as great ability in carrying difficult work to a successful completion . Yet the results were essentially distinct . Doubtless this was largely due to the different materials which the diverse nature of the country imposed upon the builders , but history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions been the same , the architecture would have been identical . The civilization of the Egyptians was not the civilization of the Assyrians . While in Egypt the priesthood was supreme-Pharaoh himself being of the priestly office-in Assyria the civil life was more important . The chief remains of Egyptian architecture are the temples ; the palace is the form which has survived in Assyria-if such an expression be admissible in speaking of the shapeless ruins that have come down to our day . Assyrian architecture also bears witness to a more warlike people than were the Egyptians . The massive walls of unprecedented thickness , the lofty elevation of many of the buildings , all give evidence that they were a people who were in a state of constant conflict with their neighbors . Their religion , consisting largely of the worship of the celestial bodies , gave a decided impulse to the study of astronomy and led to the erection of the terraced temples , monuments quite unlike anything found elsewhere and which were characteristic of the Assyrian landscape . In Greece we are able to trace a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most finished and complex , and note the influence of the various stages of civilization . The early period shows an undeveloped architecture quite in keeping with the limited culture of the people . As they advanced in knowledge and as their intercourse with other nations became more intimate their architecture took new forms and developed in a corresponding ratio . They borrowed the Doric capital from the Egyptian ; and the Ionic and Cor // inthian from the Assyrian , or , at least , from Asia Minor , and made new styles of them , so permeated with their *personality that the original sources have been all but lost . Greek civilization was essentially refined , and its architectnre is , in consequence , the most delicate , the most carefully proportioned , and the most logical of which we have any knowledge . Beside it the beanties of Egyptian art appear coarse and ill-devised , and the glories of the Assyrian seem barbarons . With a people less cultured , less refined , less snsceptible to the beauty of form and of proportion , the results reached by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onr own day when the science of mechanics has reached a development never before attained , when perspective is studied in every school , and a knowledge of geometry is more or less diffnsed , the subject of tine proportion is scarcely understood , while instances of designing a building so as to obtain the best effects of atmosphere , or correcting a line or a moulding in order to avoid the distortion of perspective , is unheard of . Yet all these points and many others were carefully looked after by the Greeks , evincing a civilization if not more advanced than our own in architecture , at least better developed . The proudest achievement of Greek civilization was its architectnre , and succeeding generations may well pause before it and ask themselves what manner of culture it was that produced it . Whatever originality there may have been in Etruscan architecture the Romans speedily merged it into the more highly developed Grecian . This , in its turn , they modified to suit their own ideas , and engrafted on it methods and details from every style with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence , as thoroughly universal as their empire . The Roman civilization was luxurious and wealthy , and in proportion as it increased in these respects , as it fastened itself more firmly upon the people with whom it came in contact , as the Roman citizen grew in power and in arrogance , its architecture reflected the same conditions . Roman culture was proud and imperious ; Greek culture was delicate and refined ; the vanity of the one absorbed the ideality of the other ; the former was coarse and sensual , the latter intellectual and spiritual . A pure art such as was found under the Greeks was as // impossible with the Romans as if it had never existed . When , therefore , such people undertook to build in the Greek style it was a foregone conclusion that they would modify it to suit the requirements of their own nature and taste . Greek architecture is commonly said to have declined under the Romans ; in reality it was not a decline , but a development , an evolution , a creation of a new type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the styles of Asia Minor . No other result than the Greek modification could have been reached under the Greek civilization , and no other result than the Roman could have existed under the Roman civilization . Because the type was bad , because the details were debased , because the forms had lost their original character , because art as a whole assumed less pleasing and less artistic forms , its true position should not be distorted by an erroneous nomenclature , as is the case when the transformation of Greek art under the IRomans is spoken of as a collapse . Greek art did , in time , reach its end and fade away , but not in that form which is familiarly and generally termed Roman . The influence of Roman civilization on architecture may be noted in various ways . The Etruscan predilection for bloody spectacles and for games called for hippodromes and amphitheatres which became some of the most characteristic features of a Roman city . The love of display and pomp found expression in the elaborate baths , huge groups of buildings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the populace . This same craving for luxurious appointments is to be noted also in the private houses and villas of the wealthy citizens , where they gathered around them the finest creations of ancient art . The art gallery and museums were filled with the spoils of foreign conquest , and were the natural consequence of this luxurious taste . In gratifying it , the Roman citizen set an example for future generations . Roman civilization lasted so long and was so overpowering in its effects that many buildings which are spoken of as characteristic of the Romans would have been developed in the natural course of events under the Greek civilization had it held its individuality long enough . Their form is Roman , but their origin lies rather in the general progress of humanity than in any essentially Roman conditions . // With the political collapse of the Roman empire Roman architecture came to an end . Already , in fact , a djstinct style had been developed in the East where the influence of different cnstoms and the use of new methods of construction speedily evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself as noting a people whose influence on general progress was not marked though at one time it was very great . True it included monuments that have excited the admiration of the world , but after reaching a certain point it made no further advance . Doubtless this was due more to the political stagnation of the Eastern empire than to any inherent torpidity of the architecture itself . Its later development by the Russians and the Mohammedans makes clear how it could on the one hand be debased and on the other elevated . The Russian form of Byzantine architecture is one of the very worst styles that has ever been formed . We are not concerned here with questions of *sthetics and may safely leave that point of view to one side ; but from a structural standpoint alone there are many bad points in Russo-Byzantine . It is a union of the barbarous and the civilized that could not possibly have been a success so long as the mixture was made on the ill-balanced basis of borrowed forms without intelligent transformation . Mohammedan art , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible to carry architecture . Ita exquisite giace , its lightness of form , its beauty of ornament , bear testimony to an artistic perception that to our practical minds seems almost wholly lost . Like many people of antiquity , the Moslems give evidence of autocratic powers on the part of the builders , many of the more important monuments being on a large scale and constructed with vast expenditure of time , labor , and money . Mohammedan architecture reached a high degree of development , but it is impossible to say what might have been its later forms had the people been able to maintain their political supremacy . With the decline of the Mohammedan power its architecture naturally died . There are , however , several modifications in the art of building due to Mohammedan civilization which call for special comment . The universal practice in all Eastern countries of lavishing all the decoration on the interior of the edifice , leaving the exterior // bare and unattractive , is the most distinctive feature of the architecture of all Moslem countries . So widespread a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no satisfactory explanation has yet been vouchsafed . It has , however , been suggested , and with considerable plausibility , that it originated in the inherent dread of the Moslem to display his wealth to public gaze for fear of confiscation , a fear engendered by the scandalous system of government that it carried on wherever that faith has flourished . Another sharp distinction between Eastern and Western buildings is occasioned by the use of separate apartments for the women , and building , in reality , two entirely distinct structures nuder one roof , or two separate edifices more or less closely connected . While this remarkable development was taking place in the East a very different process was being carried out in the West . With the decadence of Roman civilization Roman art and architecture came to an end . This architecture , which was emphatically the architecture of wealth and luxury , required a rich and powerful society to support it , and , therefore , when Roman riches vanished it too passed away . The eruption of the barbarians into the fair fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all architectural growth . These wild hordes were destructive , not constructive ; their aim was to demolish , not to build . For centuries , architecture was almost a forgotten art , not only in Italy , but in northern Europe as well , where , indeed , it was only to be found in association with the Roman settlements . So completely was this the case that when that accomplished architect , M. Charles Gamier , selected a representative edifice for the time immediately following the fall of the Roman empire for his history of habitations at the Paris Exhibition of 1889 , he chose the wagon of the Hun , in which the people both lived and moved . No more striking illustration could be devised of the utter collapse , the degradation , the ruin , of architecture . The unsettled condition of Europe during this period led to the concentration of power in the hands of numerous individuals , who , though called nobles were , most of them , little better than robber chiefs . The central government was more nominal than real and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of things led to the building of strongholds , castles , towers , keeps , and the numerous fortified edifices of the Middle Ages . Without a castle it was almost imp'ossible for a knight to maintain a family or even a trusty body of retainers , and these buildings were , therefore , adapted first of all for defense , but with ample accommodations both for the family and for a number of soldiers . They exhibit an almost endless variety of plan , but were all called into existence by the state of society and the absence of any strong centralized government . Life in the towns was not much safer than that in the country , and the absence of decent streets , of lights , and of responsible and active police regulations , rendered a city by night fully as dangerous as the most remote mountain district . In these troublous times people thought more of the actual necessities of life than of artistic pursuits , and the buildings were constructed with the greatest economy , both as to materials and planning . The development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; people were no longer on constant guard against an enemy 's attack . A new feeling arose-it can scarcely be termed national , for the great nations of Europe were known by national names long before there was any definite coherence among the people-which may , for want of a better word , be called civic . It was a popular interest in local affairs , a general pride in one 's district or city . This feeling had two phases , a religious and a secular one , both of which were well shown in the various sacred and secular edifices which began to appear on all sides . The development of architecture in the Middle Ages was carried on under the inspiring influence of the church . The church retained within its limits all knowledge and culture that survived the inroads of the barbarians . For centuries the cathedrals and churches were the only buildings of prominence to be found in all Europe , and it was but natural and right that a body which could safely boast the exclusive possession of the means of progress should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied arts . Under the guidance of the clergy , therefore , the cathedrals were erected , and the occupants of the Episcopal thrones vied with each other // in seeking to surpass not only contemporary work , but that already done by their predecessors . In Winchester cathedral , for example , no less than three attempts were made to obtain the best results by completely changing the previous work , and many instances of the same kind are to be found in other churches of England and France . We may regret , for historical purposes , the destruction of early buildings , and deplore , on economic grounds , the tearing down of a good building to put one more stylish in its place , but the spirit that animated such a course , the enthusiasm that prompted it , the ambition that compelled it , are worthy of all praise . The glorious cathedrab of central Enrope , rearing their massive walls far above the surrounding buildings , with their towers and spires piercing the very vault of heaven with their wonderfully proportioned interiors , their rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracery , their grandeur , their strength , their beauty , their soul , forming , in a word , an incarnation of all that is good and true and great in art , testify in a remarkable degree to the growth of a new civilization , to the birth of new hopes and a new life , to the final defeat of the darkness which for so long had hidden man from the light of civilization . It is a noteworthy fact that the cathedrals reached their highest development in those countries which were the best governed , or perhaps it were better to say those in which the social fabric was most stable , and where it was possible for culture to flourish without too many distractions or limitations . The finest forms are to be found in France and England , and though Germany contains many good examples , its cathedrals are not , on the whole , as interesting or as finely finished as those of the other countries . Italy offers a striking contrast to northern Europe in this respect , and illustrates the differences arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy was divided had a most depressing effect on the progress of architecture . War was almost constant , and a permanency of government out of the question . More than this , the small size of the various political divisions prevented the clergy from levying contributions for their buildings over an extensive area , and it was altogether impossible to erect the gigantic edifices that are so abundant in England and // France . This is the reason why so many small churches are to be found in Italy , for the people were not possessed of sufficient means to erect large ones . Fortunately , however , civic pride was a trait well developed in the Italians , and the citizens of varions cities displayed a com*mendabIe enthusiasm in adorning them with suitable churches . Withont this intense local pride , architecture could never have made any progress in Italy . Advance in domestic architecture in Europe was equally as rapid as that in ecclesiastical . People no longer found it necessary to fortify themselves in strongholds in order to live , but with the spread of intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more accessible and less retired . Barriers were demolished and daily life grew less seeluded . It is an interesting fact that sacred edifices have remained unchanged for a longer time than have secular ones . With the one great exception of the Reformation , the Church has held practically the same doctrines and the same forms from the earliest times to the present day . At least this is true in so far that a church building of the VIlIth century , for example , answers for all the necessary requirements of the church of the XYth . There was , indeed , a marked progress in church architecture during these centuries , but the advance was a mechanical one , an improvement in constructive methods consequent upon the g*mneral spread of intelligence . From an ecclesiastical standpoint , however , the evolution has been very slight , and not of material importance so far as affecting architecture . Domestic architecture presents a striking contrast with this state of affairs . The daily life is susceptible of more marked and rapid changes than are ecclesiastical affairs , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages the dwelling that answered for one generation scarcely sufficed for the next . Thus it is that the remains of domestic architecture are so few and so unsatisfactory . It seems singular , though not , after all , strange , that the remains of ancient Rome have given up thousands of statues and fragile objects , while no indications have been obtained that throw any light on how the Roman city dwellings were constructed . They were simply swept away bodily , and were but a single specimen in a long // list of similar edifices , each of which gave evidence of the actual state of the civilization of the time in which it was built , and when this civilization passed away , it likewise gave place to a more progressive and modern building . The contrast between the life of the golden age of the Roman empire and that of the Middle Ages is very great , and is well illustrated in the architecture of the two periods . The Roman lived an objectiveless , easy , indolent life ; wealth was abundant and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in the public places , in thefora or the baths , and he was at his best advantage when disporting himself in his gayest attire in the finest places . The buildings were large and magnificent , and testified to a wealth of luxury and extravagance that the world has never seen equalled . Huge amphitheatres and enormous circi afforded amusement for the multitudes who were never too busy to deny themselves the enjoyment of a spectacle . Lofty temples and costly palaces decorated in the richest manner with all the resources of a rich and powerful civilization were to be seen on all sides . In the Middle Ages there were no palaces or temples , no amphitheatres or circi , no libraries or baths , no public places , no wealth , no statues . There were castles , it is true , which by courtesy were called palaces , but bore no other resemblance than that of name to the Roman buildings . The difference between the two civilizations was tremendous . Edifices which to the Romans were a necessity , were quite unknown in the later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was essential in the one was an absurdity in the other . The media*-valists had their churches , their monasteries or convents , and their castles , but beyond these buildings their architecture was extremely limited and presented fe*w variations of form . The civilization of Rome was an artificial one , particularly in the capital itself . Probably there never was a people whose life was made up of so many artificial needs , amusements , and luxuries , as the Romans . They seemed to thrive on the lighter things of life , and thought more of their shows and spectacles than of the stern realities of life . In the Middle Ages , all this was changed . The absence of wealth prevented any opportunity for display , and the infusion of barbarian // blood with the Roman seems to have had an important influence on the disposition of the people . At all events , whatever may have been the cause , there was no longer any opportunity or inclination for a luxurious , sensual life , such as the Romans had indulged in . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages seems dull and monotonous . It can not , however , be inferred that it was so to the people of that time ; it was the only life they knew , and it doubtless answered all their needs . They were concerned more with the realities of life than were the iRomans , but from necessity more than from choice or for a love of labor . The Roman was apparently able to keep soul and body together with small exertion and live by his wits rather than by downright , hard work . The medhevalist did not possess this happy faculty , and hence his lot was cast in a more difficult mould . In no instance is this difference better shown than in the buildings ; the one people overloaded their structures with ornament and decoration ; the others contented themselves with building in the simplest form and the least expensive way ; the former typified a luxurious life ; the latter one of necessity . It was eminently in keeping with the laws of association that the Gothic civilization of northern Europe should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always more an exotic than a natural growth . Classical traditions were too strong , the monuments of antiquity too numerous , to permit Gothic art to thrive in their midst . Italy was , therefore , the arena in which was fought the contest between mediawalism and the new life , in which the spirit of the dark ages was forever overcome , and mankind rejoiced and lived in the freedom of the Renaissance . The Renaissance  --  the throwing off of the obstacles of narrow traditions-could never have been accomplished elsewhere , because Italy alone possessed the literary and artistic monuments which gave the necessary impetus to such a movement . In no other portion of Europe did the spirit of the Renaissance achieve the same success or the same results . In France , the movement was due more to personal pressure and example on the part of the sovereign than a widely developed national feeling . Many important buildings were erected in the new style , but they adhered to the spirit of the old , and were really // Gothic structures , with classical ornaments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of the court and the desire of the wealthy classes to follow the example of the Italians led to a gradual neglect of the old style and the substitution of the new . Though the Gothic and the Renaissance styles are not properly to be compared with each other , their methods being so radically distinct , the one being exposed construction , the other concealed construction , it may , perhaps , be affirmed that out of Italy , Renaissance buildings do not compare favorably with the Gothic . Great and magnificent structures were , indeed , erected in the new style , but , after all , the glory of the architecture of central Europe is Gothic . Had the Renaissance not been an exotic , it , too , would have had monuments of equal merit . From the beginnings of the Renaissance , human affairs lost the apparent monotony of the Middle Ages , and became highly diversified . This new activity found vent in a multitude of buildings which had scarcely been thought of before . Certain it is that we can now study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any , previous remains . This may be due , perhaps , not so much to an actual increase in buildings as to the fact that Europe was in a more settled condition than formerly , governments were stronger , and the whole fabric of society more stable than before ; therefore it was that buildings ran less risk of dem6lition and more have survived . The nobles no longer built castles , but palaces and chateaux ; the defensive character of the earlier edifice had ceased to be a necessity , and buildings assumed a light and cheerful aspect , which only a short time before would have been regarded as a deliberate invitation to pillage and destruction . Comfort , convenience , and luxury now become the ruling elements in designing a building , instead of security and economy . In secular architecture , both domestic aud civic , painting and sculpture came into general and extensive use . Ornament was employed in profusion , and the evidences of public wealth and public stability , and a widespread faith in the permanency of the present condition of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said that all of this elaborate display is to be commended on the grounds of sound architecture or of good // taste ; on the contrary it is frequently worthy of the severest condemnation . Notwithstanding its bad aesthetic effects , however , the whole movement is of the greatest importance , and exemplifies , in a remarkable degree , the powerful influence which a well developed state of society exercises on architecture . With the establishment of a regular form of municipal government , it became necessary for every town of considerable importance to be supplied with a town hall . Schools and universities called for buildings of their own , though they did not produce such distinctive edifices as the civic structures . The growth of Protestantism , and the formation of small bodies of worshippers , called for the erection of many small churches and chapels . A new form of structure was required for the presentation of the modern drama , and many other changes were introduced , owing to new manners and customs , new social and political methods , new ideas , new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited , as in the Middle Ages , to churches and castles , but a multitude of structures have sprung up bearing conclusive evidence of the active and varied life of the times . A multiplicity of buildings and the progress of culture are cobrdinate facts that are intimately united . It is , indeed , true that the most glorious architectural monuments were the products of a civilization less advanced than ours , but varied as they were in design and execution , they were of limited kinds , and were chiefly intended for the same or similar uses . With the increase of culture , however , new forms were introduced , and we find buildings whose uses were unthought of in previous epochs . It can not be concealed that with the increase in kinds of buildings there has been a very serious deterioration in their artistic qualities . Not that there is any essential connection between the two , but , from the time of the first glow of the Renaissance , art ceased to retain its monopoly as the vent through which the intellectual life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ceased and that of science began . People put away artistic things and busied themselves with other matters . The genius of Europe no longer limited itself to one subject , but sought renown in other fields . As a // necessity for the preservation of human life , architecture continued to be practiced , but the old enthusiasm was gone , and a distinctive style became a thing of the past . We have indeed an Italian Renaissance , a French Renaissance , a German Renaissance , and an English Renaissance , all capable of being distinguished the one from the other . But the distinctions are not vital ones , and , generally speaking , they are very similar . The old national feeling has disappeared , for there is vastly less difference between the Renaissance of the peoples just named than there is between their styles of Gothic . Architecture had , in truth , fallen , and the art which had once been the pride and the glory of mankind sank to the level of the commonplace . In our own times , the errors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accentuated . In the swift rush and tempestuous turmoil of modern life , architecture has been pushed to the wall , until , within the past few years , a revival has taken place which while as yet only partially successful , is an important element in indicating the broadening of culture and the awakening of the artistic instinct . It shows that for too long we have contented ourselves with commercial and industrial buildings , that we have too much subordinated cost to final effect , that we have erred in considering too highly the merits of dollars and cents in measuring the value of - our buildings . Whatever may be the outcome of this revival , it is at least certain that no limit is to be placed on the forms of buildings nor their uses . The demands of modern life can be measured by no previous gauge , and the exigencies of business and of manufactures are constantly calling for new structures and new methods . Whatever may be the faults of the architecture of the present day , it has at least kept pace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required .
