txt Aside from the regular sessions of the National CongresS of Mothers to-day , there were several meetings held this morning before the regular session , at which different members of the congress presided . In the banquet hall of the Arlington Hotel Mrs. Henry S. Finley , Chairman of the Press Committee , presided over a conference . Dr. Ada L. Thomas made a , short address entitled " Accidents  --  What to do Before the Doctor Comes . " At the conclusion of Dr. Thomas 's address , Mrs Hompeen , Mrs. Hegelsborger , and Miss Alice Fletcher of the Anthropological Society gave short and interesting talks on " Fear  --  How , to Overcome It in Children . " At the First Baptist Church , Miss Newton of Chicago presided over a conference at the same hour as that held at the Arlington Hotel . Miss Jeannette Richards read a paper on " The Necessity of Schools for Trained Nurses , " which was followed by an address on " Punishments. " by Mrs. Putnam . Notwithstanding the early hour at which the conferences were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel and the First Baptist Church were crowded tCl their utmost capacity . The Crowd at the Congress . Long before the time set for the opening of the morning session-10:30 o'clock  --  there was not an available seat anywhere in the church , and when Mrs. Birney called ' the meeting to order , Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth of New York City made the devotional address . The audience joined in singing " Nearer , My God , to Thee , " after which Mrs. Booth read a few verses froth the Bible . During the course of her remarks she said : " It is a great comfort and a great strength to feel that we have the right to turn and claim the great , strong hand of God . It seems that those persons who stand to-day in the position of mother ? should feel grateful for the light and teachings which God has brought to our eyes . " In speaking of mother love , Mrs. Booth compared it to Divine love , the strongest love imaginable . A true woman , Mrs. Booth continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a mother . Speaking of her experiences in the different prisons , she said that it made no differ-. ence how low a criminal had fallen , or - what crime he had committed , there were times during his incarceration when he stilt showed some traces of his inTather 's training . One of the greatest errors ever committed by any legislators , continued Mrs. , Booth , and one that is a very black stain on the name of the State , was to deprive the convicts of Sing Sing of work Referring then to the advancement of women , she said that should a woman engage in the different meetings being held at the present time , it was no excuse whatever for her to neglect her children . A woman who neglects her babe for the public will find in the future the great mistake she has made , and that her work has been to no purpose . An Overflow meeting . At the conclusion of Mrs. Booth 's address Miss Birney announced an overflow meeting down stairs for the benefit of the large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflow meeting was in charge of Mrs. Hearst , Mrs. Margaret Sangster , and Mrs. Henrotin of Chicago , President of the Woman 's Federation . Mrs. Louise E. Hogan of Germantown , Penn. , next addressed the congress on " Dietetics . " " The study of dietetics , " she said , as applied to the nursery and the period of childhood , is constantly brought to our notice as an important phase of domestic education . Dr. Jacobi very wisely remarks that to understand only a small part of what is known on ? the vast topic of the development of infant life the mother must consult not one little volume . but many big books . The first step we should take as mothers in regard - to the careful feeding of our children should be to convince ourselves thoroughly of its necessity . " Many mothers may say , But I don ' t need . any dietetic rules for my baby of eighteen months , or ' two years . He eats everything and is quite well . ' Dr. L. Emmett Holt of the Babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large experience with those children who ate everything ' and seemed to relish it , and has followed a number of them to their graves as the ultimate result of such unreasonable and inconsiderate practice . " Rousseau dwells strongly upon the facts that a weak body in a child enfeebles the soul ; that the education of man begins at his birth ; that simplicity in diet is an absolute necessity for sound physical growth , and that the most dangerous period in human life is the interval between birth and the age of twelve . We should always let the food be simply for nourishment , not be taken for its own sake , but only for the sake of promoting bodily and mental activity . Dr. Preyer of Germany , author of ' Infant Mind , ' a book for mothers , and whose observations of children are known all over the world , thinks that mothers may do much if they know enough and if they will not - leave their children so much in the hands of ignorant persons . I have quite recently received several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been making in dietetics and individual child study , and he states decidedly in these letters that the controlling supervision of the physical development in her child is the most important - task of the young mother , because upon this development the child 's whole future Intellectual and moral life will depend . " In conclusion Mrs. Hogan said : " Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as physical morality . Men 's habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat their bodies as they please . The fact is all breaches of the laws of health are physical sins . When this is generally seen , then , and perhaps not till then , will the physical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves . " Careless Parentage a . Crime . Mrs. Alice Lee Moque of Washington read a paper on ' " Reproduction and Natural Law . " She said it was the old theory that parents were the involuntary , irresponsible agents of God in the propagation of species . Now it was considered that careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved the most serious and laborious study . Men and women are often influenced by trifles , light as air , in entering upon marriage . A girl ought , before allowing herself to love , to consider the health , mental constitution , position In life , means of support of the man she may wed . Also , she must consider herself . The first consideration is health . Women ought first to be emancipated from the doctors . Mother love ought to be exercised before maternity is entered on ; after , it is too late to remedy many ills . Right thinking and right living ought to complement each other in the man and woman who take upon themselves the duties of paternity . It was announced that the delegates of the Universal Peace Conference of Philadelphia extended thanks for the addresses being delivered . A delegate suggested that the congress memoralize the National Congress on behalf of a movement for universal peace . Some action will probably be taken later . : Moral Responsibility of Woman . Mrs. Helen H. Gardener of Boston read a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She said : " Selfabnegation , subserviency to man , whether he be father , lover , or husband , is the most dangerous theory that can be taught to her whose character shall mold the next generation . She has no right to transmit a nature and a character that is subservient , subject , inefficient , undeveloped ? in short , a slavish character , which is either blindly obedient , or blindly rebellious , and is , therefore , in " ither case set as a time-lock to prey or to be preyed upon by society In the future . " If a woman is not brave enough to demand and obtain personal liberty and entire control of her great and race-endowing function of maternity , she has no right to dare to stamp upon a child and to curse a race with the descendants of such a service , a dwarfed , a time-and-master-serving character . Subject mothers will never product a race of free , well-poised , justice-practicing children . " With her remarks the morning 's work ended .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
