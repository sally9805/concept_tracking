txt " Life crowded on him , and the days that swept Relentlessly all trust and love from out his heart . Where could he put his faith , where clasp a hand , That would not turn against him if occasion called ? " OU will have to be very cautious and very watchful , " and Greg paused in his idle whittling of the table ; " Henley is bitterly opposed to * you , and only has been held from molesting you and your plans by the positive orders of the doctor I found this out when I was surveying in Eureka . " " Do you think Henley will use unfair means to hurt me ? " and Jerry rose and leaned against the chimney . Greg stuck his knife up in the table once or twice thoughtfully , not looking up . " I do not like Henley , " he answered , cautiously . Then Jerry put on his hat , and Greg went to the door with him . " I will watch and listen for you , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do not trust anyone . " " Thanks , " and Jerry stepped out into the black night and biting wind ; he took off his hat to the cold air and drew a long breath-he felt as one standing in front of a desperate battle ! For , though estranged , he found that through all the doctor had protected him against Paul , who now stood revealed as an enemy whose bitterness could not be measured . And the last time they had spoken together , that dreadful day down at the mine , he had cursed Paul with unexampled fury , and had done it for the sake of a man who in his death had struck him the cruelest blow that the most careful malice could have designed . It had not been designed , he could reason that out ; still his heart grew hard as he remembered , and said to himself , " It was only a piece of the doctor 's cold , careful wisdom . " It had been a great pain to him that the doctor had died estranged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so think it all right that Paul should arrange everything for the honoring of the dead ; that even strangers should be called in and he shut out . It had hurt him deeply , and when after the funeral Engineer Mills had asked all the company to return with him to the doctor 's house , as the will was to be read , Jerry had turned away , until stopped by a special message that he should be wanted . Then he had followed the crowd , angly when he saw them hustling and jostling into the empty house that to him was sacred ; then crowding out again as the will was to be read on the piazza , where all could hear it , he among the rest . It had been hard , and had grown doubly so toward the end-almost too hard . Twenty-four hours ago it had happened , yet Jerry could see still the gaping crowd looking black against the snowy background ; still could hear them stamping with dull thuds to keep their feet warm-stamping that ceased as Engineer Mills read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appointing that the chief man of the towns should read the will aloud to the people , and see that it was carried into effect honestly . And then the murmur that had swept up from the crowd " Mr. Wilkerson-Mr . Wilkerson ! " Yes , he was the chief man of the towns - it was his glory brought him pain ! It had seemed a most cruel sarcasm , but the bitterness of the moment brought him strength , and when Mr. Mills cafled to him , and the crowd parted to let him mount the steps , he went forward without a second 's pause and joined the group on the piazza . And the men on the piazza knew what was in the will , and watched him as he read-he could feel them watching . It was short enough  --  a clear , concise statement that the doctor had cast his fortune in with the people of Eureka and Durden 's , and sincerely wished for their success and prosperity ; in proof of which he now left all his property to endow a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a home for the widows and orphans of the same ; that the tract of land he had bought , had been bought with this end in view ; it was surveyed in suitable lots , that were to be rented , and all rents used for the purposes above mentioned . That trustees and guardians had been appointed for the property , the mayor , or chief man of the towns , being always chairman of the same . That was all : not a word of the distrust the people had shown him ; no mention of his difficulties and disappointments ; a fair , free gift to the towns , and Jerry to see it given ! He had read it all through clearly , slowly , distinctly ; and in the silence that followed , a silence so intense that he seemed to hear it , he said no word . He stood there white and still , and folded the paper carefully , and the crowd watching him seemed scarcely to breathe . He would not speak of the misunderstandings and mistakes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken ; and the silence hung about them like death . Then there was a little movement , and he heard Greg ? peaking to the crowd and explaining what had been done for them-that widows and orphans would never suffer want again , and that education would be free to all . Then the crowd separated and went away quietly to their homes ; and Mr. Mills told Jerry that he would send him all papers relating to the property and put him in communication with the trustees . Only twenty-four hours ago all this had happened . He walked wearily up to his room : his burden seemed too great . For some noble end men might strive like this ; but he had let go his aspirations , and his highest motive had come to be the excelling of an enemy : could he sink any lower ? There was one lower depth-he could sell secretly and leave in the lurch all who had trusted him . He threw himself face down across his bed ; he despised himself , and realized a dreadful self-abasement that galled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest he had known had let him go astray . His heart hardened within him ; what use to love or trust ? Old Joe , whom he had not loved , loved him ; had been faithful to him . And this love he had won , he had not cared for  --  and the love he had longed for , he had not won . The only eyes he need please now were the eyes of the world ; and in the eyes of the world money was the highest good ; the world grown greedy and sordid in its old age . Money bought love , and honor , and power , and friendship , and souls , and bodies ; and the free and enlightened Nineteenth Century saw more slavery and subjection than any other age of the world . And he , he could not serve , he must rule-he must have money ! And to-day a new fear had come to him , and he realized that the money he had so longed for  --  the money that when he found it had seemed salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henley had that day gone East , and intended spending the rest of the winter there . Nobody could know what possibilities to Jerry lay hidden in this simple announcement that Greg had made to hi*m . A few weeks or a month would not have been such a risk , for Paul would have been too busy settling his own affairs to trouble himself with // the transactions of other people ; but the whole winter would leave him much unoccupied time . And yet what had Jerry done that he need fear being found out ? He had only invested money that had been left to him-this was all he had done . But he had no proof of this ; he had not told anyone at the time ; he had not shown anyone all the curious places in which this treasure had been hidden ; for then a vague fear had possessed him that once let Joe 's fortune be known , and claims would be put in against it as having been taken from another man 's property ; and this fear had proved true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been aware of Joe 's place of work ; and after Joe 's death he felt that Dan Burk watched him ; what he did not know was that at one time Dan Burk had shared Joe 's spoils , so giving him a hold over Burk . At the opening of the mine Burk had revealed to him Joe 's secret , which revelation had confirmed his worst fears . And now , once let Burk know that Joe had left a fortune , and he would either claim hushmoney , so holding Jerry always in subjection ; or he would tell the secret and ruin him . Jerry had not known all this at first , but he had known enough to make him very cautious , and he had had what was a still stronger motive for secrecy-a great longing for the money ! And this longing was what had made a coward of him , and was the net that had closed about him . A year ago he would have told the doctor what he had found , and have dealt justly by all ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; -a year ago , when no evil passions had been roused in him ; when he was strong in his carelessness of men 's opinions , and the world 's honors . Now  --  and his heart seemed to grow cold within him as he realized his own position-now , PaulHenley , his declared enemy , had gone to the East ; what would prevent his hearing of Jerry 's riches ; what would prevent his searching and finding out all that Jerry owned , and raising ugly stories as to the sources of his wealth ? A man who handled public money lay open always to suspic ion and attack , and for a man in such a position to be discovered suddenly to have a large fortune , was a black enough story . And Paul would sow distrust in the East by declaring Jerry a poor man ; and distrust in Durden 's by telling of Jerry 's possessions . Paul would not now hesitate . Jerry got up hurriedly and went to the window ; he must have fresh air ; he must shake off these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts with the town had been read to the committee , and put on record ; would not that prove his inno-cence ? Dan Burk knew that Joe had been saving all his life ; would not that be proof as to the source of his wealth ? Aye , too sure a proof ; a proof that would let in claims for all his fortune ! The Durden 's heirs who he knew were still living somewhere , and who had sold the mine to Lije Milton , they could present claims-  --  and Mrs. Milton would own all that was left . But now , when he needed all his strength and determination ; now , when the struggle was growing harder , and the plot more intricate , he must not flinch . He could not go back ; there was no retreat that would not end in ruin of character or fortune ; there was no explanation that would not weaken his position most terribly . He must be careful hereafter to have a witness for every transaction to which he was party ; to this extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , must wait until the attack came . This was all he could do ; there was no avoiding the daily anxiety ; there was no way of pushing aside this new fear ; no way of lessening the strain on mind or body ; and there was only one comfort he had-it was the knowledge that failure would kill him ! The terrible tension of always watching-always fearing-always suspecting ; the hard work by day and by night ; the absence of any creature in whom he could confide , this would wear him out even if at . the end he were successful ; if he failed , then he knew the string must snap . He shut the window slowly , as one // who had faced and weighed all the dangers about him , and had made his own course clear to himself ; had realized all to the end . There was no need of hurry even in the shutting of a window ; his work and his path were plain before him , and behind him an immutable Fate born of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned the lamp up , and sat down to his table , where lay a pile of papers relating to the doctor 's property , which Mr. Mills had sent that afternoon . His heart throbbed a little faster when he first looked at the familiar writing . But he put aside the memories ; they were not his any more , and it was with anger that he remembered the remorse he had felt when he found his friend dead , and peace not made between them . He had been only a duty to the doctor , not a love ; the end proved this . His mind was clear and quiet now , and he went over document after document , making notes and memoranda , then gathering his materials together , composed a letter to his co-workers in this bequest . He told them that having been educated by the doctor , he thought he could give them a clear idea of the system on which he would like the school carried out ; that having taught in Eureka himself , he knew that this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views as to the present and future values of the doctor 's property in Eureka , including the shares held in the Eureka Mine ; giving them the present condition of the towns , and their prospects ; and the present and probable future cost of building . A clear , succinct letter that caused a meeting of the three trustees , and many inquiries as to this Jeremiah P. Wilkerson . Inquiries that widened out until they penetrated the inner circle of moneyed men , and Jerry was reported as a man of solid means . After this , Paul was asked to meet these gentlemen ; after failing them many times he came at last , but with his temper unimproved by the examination of his mother 's affairs and property . His sister Edith-whom he found not to be his sister , but his first cousin , the daughter of the aunt who had died VOL . IX. - 27. in the convent , and who had been adopted by his father and given the name of Henley ; she had a large property-but he had little or nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , that he had inherited nothing from his guardian . He had not realized this before he left Durden 's , for the only will found there was the one giving the Durden 's and Eureka property to the towns ; and a memorandum referring them to his lawyer in the East for further information as to his affairs . So Paul came East with high hopes . Of course there was city property , and high rents all to be his , and visions of himself as a rich man floated fair before his eyes . But the visions had come to nothing . He felt an unreasoning anger against the poor of Durden 's and Eureka , who seemed to have defrauded him ; for he found that the doctor had sold everything to buy the great tract of land which had caused such a stir , and had changed so many lives . A wild , mad scheme , Paul called it , that had left him hardly enough to live on ; he thought that at least the doctor might have left him the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefrom ; but even this went to Jerry-Jerry whom he hated , Jerry who had been so successfuL And meeting the trustees in this frame of mind , he had to listen to Jerry 's letter , so clear and strong , and to praises of the writer expressed in slow , precise language by these mighty men , who seemed willing to leave the whole property in the hands of their " competent fellow-trustee . " " Whose wealth and business qualities , " they said , " as well as the high esteem in which he is held in business circles , make us feel sure that he will manage this great property with honesty and skill . " Paul sat still ; did he hear aright ? Were these men talking of the Wilkerson whom he knew ? And he asked what seemed to them a silly question : " Do you mean the Wilkerson from Durden 's ? " The three old men looked at him from over their glasses , and the eldest answered : // " Of course , Mr. Henley ; the same Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all your life ; the same Mr. Wilkerson of whom Mr. Charles T. Greg , one of the most solid men in the city , speaks in the highest terms ; of course you know him , this man who has risen from the people to the highest respect and esteem , and whose success-material , moneyed success - is well known on Wall Street . " Jerry Wilkerson in Wall Street-Jerry Wilkerson a moneyed success-Jerry Wilkerson indorsed by a man like Charles Greg ! His guardian had told him nothing of this-Jerry had not whispered it . And Paul felt himself in the heart of a mystery , and walked home slowly , and questioned Edith Henley closely as to all she knew or heard of Jerry . Then to Mr. Greg-then to Wall Street-day after day following closely in the track of his successful rivaL And as he went the mystery deepened ; it took him a long time , for he had to seem to know it all , and so had to grasp a few facts before he could pretend with any success . He was several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such respect ; the " Mr. Gilliam " who had requested Mr. Greg to give his adopted son Wilkerson unlimited credit , and who had paid all notes and bills with remarkable promptness ; and Mr. Greg had been very sorry to hear of his sudden death . Old Joe Gilliam ! the surprise was too great , and Paul had to remember suddenly an engagement , and was obliged to leave Mr. Greg . " Yes , Gilliam 's death had been sudden ; but he would call again if Mr. Greg would allow him . " Old Joe Gilliam giving Jerry unlimited credit  --  and Paul walked three blocks in a driving snow-storm before he took in fully this piece of information , or remembered that there were such things as cabs . And from all he could hear , Jerry had not spared money . Edith spoke of him always as a rich man , and represented the doctor as looking on Jerry in the same light . " The doctor said Mr. Wilkerson was already rich , and would be in time among the richest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did not look up from her embroidery , so did not see Paul 's face ; but a valuably-hideous cup fell from a stand with a little crash as she finished , and she wondered that Paul seemed so angry about it , and swore so openly as he picked up the pieces . Paul had lost some of his polish in the West , and it grieved her . Paul 's life , meanwhile , was becoming almost unbearable ; he realized his inability to cope with Jerry , and had not only to listen to commendations of him whenever his name was mentioned , but was allowed to see that some of the attention he received was due to his supposed brotherly connection with Jerry , whom people imagined he must love , as they had been educated by the same man . And he had to bear in silence , day after day , all the slow suffering born of his hatred for this man ; suffering that can not be measured - can not be equalled ; the suffering born of hatred is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working through all his nature , this hatred ; a dreadful corroding rust that was destroying his heart and soul ; that turned his blood to gall . And his anger grew deeper when he heard Isabel Greg 's name coupled with Jerry s , and the invariable comment - " Of course the Gregs will forward the match , as Mr. Wilkerson is so rich . " So rich ! and nobody in Eureka or in Durden 's had heard a rumor of it ! And he would sit for hours pondering on this strange revelation . If it had been a moderate sum that was named , Paul could have understood how old Gilliam might have saved it ; but when he heard of " unlimited credit , " and heard Fred Greg tell with much admiration of the " plucky way in which Wilkerson had run up the Durden 's stock " and of the " large amount he carried " ' the question became one that Paul could not solve . Where had this money come from ! Jerry had been decently dressed always , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read in the doctor 's library ; and Paul had come to know , somehow , that old Gilliam supported a poor woman in the village , instead of paying the doctor for Jerry 's // education . And until now these things had never seemed strange to him , now when from a distance he looked back and saw the great difference there had been in Joe 's action toward this boy he had picked up , and the actions of his class toward even their own children ; of course Joe must have had money to be able to do all this ; yet this had never occurred to Paul before . But this fact , having been established in Paul 's mind , did not advance him in the least in the solving of the problem as to where Joe got his money . He could not remember that he had ever heard Joe spoken of either as a miner , or a special worker of any kind ; indeed , as he looked back he found that he had never heard anything of Joe Gilliam except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and had adopted him . He had accepted old Gilham as one of the facts of the place ; something that had been there always had been there even before the doctor moved there , which seemed to Paul like some event back in the Middle Ages . Then his thoughts would slip away to the strange features in his own life . He had found no papers to tell him anything , and if any ever had existed , they had been destroyed most carefully . In the doctor 's possession he had found two pictures , one that he recognized as his mother , only younger and fairer than ever he had known her ; and the other not so regularly beautiful , but a brighter and more girlish face , and on the back the name " Edith Henley " - this was his aunt then , Edith 's mother , who had died in a convent . He had put the pictures aside , unable to understand how they had come into the possession of his guardian ; photographs might have been explained , but carefully executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of this same man had puzzled him always , especially when he remembered his mother 's tears , and his father 's stern , harsh orders ; stern and harsh even though he was dying . He hated mysteries , and would sigh most impatiently ; then return on the old track- " Where had Jerry gotten his money ? " He became quite friendly with the Gregs , almost intimate ; he won the entire confidence of the three trustees of his guardian 's property ; then , by a free use of the doctor 's and Jerry 's names , and by means of Mr. Greg 's patronage , he won his way gradually among the directors of the " Eureka , Durden 's , and the Great Western Railway , " and at last fixed his certain hold on the " banker and brokers ' who had Jerry 's interests in hand . It was a great discovery , and Paul drew a long breath when accidentally he made it ; and instantly determined to lengthen his stay in order to follow it up . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city ; and Paul put his own affairs into his hands immediately . Daily meetings and conversations ensued over proper investments . Jerry was not mentioned , but Durden 's stock was , and after many discussions , during which Paul let fall many dubious hints and candid fears , he allowed his new friend to invest for him in Durden 's . " But hold it lightly , " was Paul 's parting injunction , " I must watch and be more certain before I carry Durden 's as steady weight . " Then he went away , and the disinterested broker turned over all his own Durden 's stock to Jerry , writing to say that he had obeyed his orders to take any Durden 's that might be on the market , especially as it had still an upward tendency . And Jerry , under the steady pressure of his daily work , that seemed to gather force and velocity as the days went on , listened and watched with strained attention for every sign that might tell of Paul ; listening with painful eagerness to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a fortunate chance had put him at Mrs. Milton 's , where he could hear every rumor or surmise about every creature or affair in both towns ; could , as it were , feel the pulse of the community without ever seeming to do so , or to wish to do so . And when the letter came from New York telling of the increased amount of stock that had been taken for him , with the further information that Durden 's was on the rise , he drew a long breath of relief , for it seemed that he had not been injured as yet ; and he went about his increasing work with a better hope . // CHAPTER VIL " But at the last A great contempt and hatred of them took me , The base , vile churis ! Why should I stain my soul For such as those-dogs that would fawn and lick The hand that fed them , but , if food should fail , Would turn and rend me ? " AND this hope was a godsend to Jerry . The autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encouraging Jerry to believe that he was destined to succeed ; but following the favorable December had come weather that was unprecedented in its severity . The snow-falls had been so heavy and so continuous , that all available labor had to be put to the work of keeping the gorge clear ; else , who could estimate the danger to the lives and property of the whole town . Only once since Durden 's had been settled had there been such a winter , and then many lives had been lost of people who lived in the bottom of the gulch ; so that after that the people had built in sheltered places only , where great bodies of snow could not slide down on them from higher points . But during all the safe years that had followed , this precaution had been forgotten , and now the houses were everywhere , and the danger was great . " It were the awfulest time I ever seen , " and Mrs. Milton finished her relation of woes with an ominous shake of the head , " an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in the spring ; an ' the Lord hey mussy fur the water thet come down when the snow melt-ed ! " And Jerry listened with a heavy heart , and urged Mr. Henshaw and the men on to every exertion possible to make the place safe . And still the snow fell . The work on the railway had been stopped , and the workmen had gone back over the mountains ; the men had been taken from the mine , so that the work there was at a standstill , and no dividend could be declared ; money was scarce in the treasury ; wood was getting low ; there was no doctor in either town to attend the sick , and no priest or minister of any kind to bury the dead . Colder and darker the winter settled down ; each hour drawing things nearer to desperation-each day coming as a freshly armed enemy ! So quietly the danger had crept upon him that Jerry did not realize that it was a danger . So many things culminated so silently ; the continued snow that stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the mine that caused the dividend to be postponed ; the emptiness of the treasury that the dividend would have filled ; the stacks of wood that were not suf. ficient to meet the extraordinary run on them ; the public store of meat and meal that could not be replenished because th' roads were blocked . Who could have foreseen all this-who would have realized it until it was too late ? Jerry was appalled , but he gave no sign ; instead , he made as if he did not hear the murmurs that at first were disjointed , but that now were growing more and more continuous . He made superhuman efforts to rectify things and to satisfy all wants ; but he would hear no murmurs . He grew thin and white with the dreadful strain , and his eyes shone with an unnatural lustre . Suppose the people should revott**-should throw all their shares on the market ! He ground his teeth : a sudden fierce anger , that was like madness when it seized him , swept over him when he remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! And as he heard the sullen grumbling grow louder , and knew that insolent words were said for him to hear , he longed to beat and stamp upon them , and to drive them from the town ; and his anger grew almost more than he could bear . At last there came a break in the clouds , and for one week no snow fell ; this gave some hope , and the discontented murmurs were lessened somewhat . A party went out to hunt , that the people mi*ht have fresh meat ; another party we*t after wood , and those who stayed at home spoke cheerfully of spring . // Two weeks without snow ; and Jerry asked Mrs. Milton , in a half-frightened way , if she thought the winter had broken ; and hardly dared ask the question , lest the snow should begin again . At the end of the two weeks Mr. Henshaw advised that the men be put to work on the dam before any snow melted , as when this happened it would be too late to help matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Committee , and for the first time since he had been their leader he met a repulse . He had expected it , for he knew that the men thought the work in the mine would now be resumed , and a dividend declared : nevertheless , just at first it gave him a shock , then his accumulated anger flared up . How dared they oppose him - these ignorant fools ! and he rose to his feet with a light in his eyes that made the bravest man there wish himself out of the difficulty . With his hands in his pockets , he stood for a moment looking coolly and scornfully over the crowd -- men grown gaunt and white during the long , hard winter for lack of proper food and warmth ; men of desperate characters and fortunes , who had come to Durden 's expecting immediate wealth ; disappointed men , who had grown sullen and hungry and were not to be tampered with lightly . But Jerry was more desperate than they ; he had more at stake . To them it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to him it was success or disgrace-it was fame , fortune , life  --  or death ! Slowly , and in a voice that showed the restraint under which he was holding himself , he began his speech . He reminded them of how this venture had come to life and been carried on ; how he had built up the town of Durden 's and had had the railway extended ; how they had been cared for and helped through the hardest winter ever known in that country ; how the Eastern shareholders of the mine had consented that the work might be stopped if the miners were needed to work for the protection of the town . " And now , when the winter is break - ing , " he went on , raising his voice , when the time has come to make the thing pay  --  to save the thing from destruction , you stand back like fools and refuse to work ! " Protect the mine by a week 's work , then work it so that a dividend can be declared . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this town is in better order , and the people more free , and more justly dealt by , than in any other mining town in America . You know that as long as the present government of this town continues , things will go on as prosperously as now ; but change it , and what will be the result ? With the entrance of the railway the place will be flooded by a mob of placer miners ; ' the Eastern shareholders will look only to their own interests , and you will lose all the work , and much of the money you have invested in Durden 's . I say that if you change the present organization you are fools ; I say that if you do not make the mine safe , you are fools . You can shoot for these words , but so can I : it will not pay , however , and you will not do it . " Now , I want you to think of two things : First , without a strong government the railway will ruin us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dam to - morrow morning , I wash my hands of this whole business I will resign every position and leave Durden 's to-morrow ! " And he took up his hat and walked down through the crowded room , where a way was made for him , and out of the house . He had made a desperate move , and how would it be taken ? Every nerve was quivering , and he strode through the snow to Mrs. Milton 's house , scarcely heeding that he did not follow the beaten track , made safe but hideous by ashes being sprinkled on it . Even down to so small a matter as this , he carried his rule . One woman had slipped on the ice and broken her arm , which Jerry could set but very indifferently ; and after that each householder had to save ashes , and sprinkle the pathway for a certain distance . Young Greg had watched with wonder the way in which Jerry controlled these people , who were , many of them , no better nor more educated than beasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how had he won their confidence so entirely ? At the time of the doctor 's death Greg had watched for some outbreak ; would they distinguish between Jerry 's words against abstract landsharpers , and the doctor ? Would they remember that the doctor had indorsed Jerry and his plans , or would they remember only that he had left his money to benefit them , not once mentioning past ingratitude ? He had expected some revulsion of feeling in the people that would carry them violently in an opposite direction and dethrone Jerry ; but he watched in vain . The money had been left to them ; a good man had vindicated his name and proved his interest in their welfare : this had been done , but the money had not come to them in a way that would arouse any enthusiasm . The good they were to reap from it was not personal enough for the men to feel any special gratitude for it ; and the women had no word in the matter . They looked on the will only as another " curus doin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystery to them always . Indeed , on speaking to one or two of the men about it , Greg found that they thought that Mr. Wilkerson had done much more for them , and in the future would make the fortune of the town and all the people in it . As the winter went on , however , and the cold grew more and more intense , and the prospect of work and money more and more precarious , Greg once more began to watch and listen anxiously . It had become a great wish with him that Jerry should succeed , a great wish outside of his own interests in the town . Jerry had worked so bravely , and his success had been so unprecedented , that it had come to be like the watching of some exciting game of chance . He knew for what high stakes Jerry was playing ; he saw that it would be life or death to him , and that the instinct of self-preservation inspired some of the moves Jerry made . But beyond this , he had played so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was overcome Greg would draw a long breath , and wonder how long this man 's highly strung temperament would stand the strain ! And as he sat in the council-room lately put up over Burk 's shop , where the public meeting was held to call for men to work on the dam-as he , going early , sat and watched the gathering of the crowd , he realized that a dangerous crisis had come , and wondered what the upshot would be . Greg watched anxiously as Dan Burk explained that the meeting had been called to hear a plan of Mr. Wilkerson 's ; that now the working season had come again , Mr. Wilkerson had something to say to them . This was received in silence ; then Jerry told them that he wanted them to work on the dam and so make it safe before beginning work in the mine : and when he ceased there was the same ominous silence  --  a silence that made Greg lean forward and listen and watch intently . There was a little shuffling of feetthen a man rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , for that meant a dividend to them and to the town , and money was needed badly enough ; but that " work on the dam " pausing in his slow , drawling speech to give full effect , " wuz n't wuther damn , an ' all were free men ; " then he sat down amid great applause ! It was then that Jerry rose and attacked them so unhesitatingly , and threatened to throw over the whole scheme . And when he was gone Greg looked about in grave anxiety : how would they stand this ? But nothing was said , and after a little while he saw the new men , who had come after the town was well under way , rise one after another and leave the room ; and from the window he could see that they had congregated outside , and inside the old inhabitants sat in sullen silence , looking at him rather suspiciously . But he did not move , and these also left the room one by one , making another group in the road , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleek , straight hair slowly . " It ll bust all to pieces if Mr. Wilker-* son gives it up , " he said . And Greg asked impatiently : " Why do not you tell the men so ? " But Burk shook his head . They knows it just as well as * // he said , " an ' they ai n't agoin ' to let nobody talk no sass to them except Mr. Wilkerson : an ' you kin rest damn sure , Mr. Greg , that if they want to go to the devil , talkin ' wo n't stop em ; just be sure of that , " then he rose , and Greg followed him down the ladder to the shop below . Evidently there was no way for him to find out the probable course of events , and having a letter he wanted to show Jerry , Greg turned his face in the direction of Mrs. Milton 's . It was a letter from his sister that surprised him a little . She said that they had seen a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that he told them a great deal of the life at Durden 's , and " spoke most pleasantly and affectionately of Mr. Wilkerson , whom , " he said , " he had known most intimately ; but laughed when we called him wealthy . " And Greg was much puzzled . Of the extent of Jerry 's fortune Greg knew only what his father and brother knew , and this knowledge did not include Jerry 's transactions with his broker ; and to Greg , as to Paul , it had seemed a strange thing for a common man like Gilliam to have so much money , but it had never entered into his mind to ask the how of the fact . Indeed , life in iDurden 's was to Greg so new and unique that he seldom wondered or was surprised at anything ; each individual enjoyed perfect freedom of action and thought , while comment and questions were careful and few . Jerry was the only man that Greg could find who was in the least hampered , and that only because he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would sell the town to the railway and the mining company , could free himself and go East a rich man . But Greg could not imagine Jerry as doing this ; his ambition was higher than the mere making of a fortune : he wanted to create a community-he wanted to control great interests  --  to be known as a " Money King " - he wanted to raise the people : and this last made Greg sigh . Still , he thought Jerry bid fair to win even with this weak philanthropical joint in his harness . Things looked dark just now , and Paul Henley was a dangerous enemy because an unscrupulous one , and Greg felt anxious ; but he had great faith in Jerry 's keenness and power over the people . His speech that day had been dangerous , but it had dealt a telling blow in that it had divided the party that was against him . The old and the new had separated completely : the new were favorable to the present government , with much contempt for the old IDurden 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back angrily to the old times because they were learning to be ashamed of the old ways , while yet they had a weak longing for their license . But all parties were fully aware that there was no man in either town who could guide affairs as Jerry had done . For himself , Greg felt that he had been cool to Jerry , and by his father 's advice had abstained from being intimate with him for the present ; but he could not help feeling a sort of pitying admiration for this man fighting so hard a battle , and standing so entirely alone ! Yet sometimes , as he watched Jerry , his mind would fill with doubt , and his father*s warning would seem wise . Jerry 's door stood a little open , and Greg walked in to find him seated at the table with his arms crossed on it and his head bent down on them . Greg stood quite still ; the whole man and position looked so despairing , and he feared , as he had never done before , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurriedly as if he wished to hide his feelings and the anxiety that possessed him , but slowly as one who was thoroughly worn out . He had made a rash speech-had pronounced a rash ultimatum ; what if he had been taken at his word ? Where would he stand with all his fortune invested in the mine ? It would look like base desertion for him to sell out ; indeed , he did not believe that he could sell the stock if the facts of the case should become known . His only alternative would be to sell secretly ; in this way he could save his money . And if the men did not come to their work in the morning , woQld he do this ? // But now Greg interrupted him , and he rose wearily- " I have brought you this letter , " Greg began , ignoring all the morning 's troubles , " because I can not make anything of it , and I thought that you might read something between the lines ; it is from my sister , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page that mentioned Henley . The paper was rich , and a little perfume seemed to float up from the folds of it ; a faint , sweet smell that took Jerry back to the luxury , and beauty , and pleasure that he remembered as a dream ! He did not see the words just at first , but stood wondering at the past and at himself as he had been then . He passed his hand wearily over his brow , a gesture he often made now , and with an effort brought his mind back to Greg and the letter . He read it slowly once , then more carefully the second time , standing quite still in front of the fire , while Greg watched him anxiously . " He is winning their confidence-the women first , Fred and your father later-in order to injure me , " he said , then walked over to the window . " How will they help him ? " Greg asked a little hotly . " He speaks of me in this way to them , so that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his side , not looking for any personal motives behind his actions . " Greg sat down thoughtfully ; this ridiculously simple solution was not all that Jerry read between the lines ; of course Jerry saw more than this-he had not mentioned the allusion to his wealth . Jerry handed the letter back slowlyhe liked to hold it , it was so dainty and refined ; and he watched it while Greg folded it and put it away , and caught himself wondering how it was he had such a longing for things so entirely out of his sphere . " I am much obliged to you , Greg , " he said , " for taking the trouble to bring the letter here , and for your kind interest in my small difficulties . " Then sitting down near the fire , " Has your father written you anything of Durden 's stock lately ? " " Firm , with an upward tendency , " Greg answered ; " the report of Henshaw has made a great sensation ; then the doctor 's will has br notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Jerry took a letter from the table . " The trustees leave the whole matter in my hands , " he went on , " asking for a yearly report of the property ; they have empowered me to employ a secretary ; do you know of any one who can fill the position ? " Greg shook his head . " There is no one out here , but I dare say they can send you one . " " I prefer that they should , " Jerry answered ; " and send me a man clearly instructed to watch the destination of every cent , " his voice growing harder as he went on . " I prefer to be watched in my transactions . " Greg moved a little ; this did not have a pleasant sound ; did Jerry think he could be attacked from that side by Paul ? " You have been watched in all your town transactions , " he said , " you do not know how closely : Burk never allows anything to escape him ; you need have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am uneasy , ** Jerry answered ; " but I prefer to be watched , for then I can have witnesses always . " Unless those who watch you are unscrupulous , and enemies , " and Greg rose to go . He felt repulsed , and yet could not blame Jerry , for in the first instance he had turned from Jerry : but the man seemed so lonely that unconsciously Greg had cultivated a feeling that at any time that he held out a hand , Jerry would take it ; but now he found that even though very lonely-even though entirely without friends , Jerry would not let him return to his old position . It hurt him just a little at first , this stiffness , but when he thought over it quietly he was not sorry . It was interesting to stand and watch this game as it was played ; it was exciting even , but he did not want it to be any more so than at present ; if he cast in his fate with Jerry it would grow too exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man . As it was , he was secure outside of Jerry 's venture ; on his own land he had found gold , and besides his investments // in the town and in the mine , he had this private vein that already paid him . He was doing well , and was glad that Jerry had withdrawn from him ; for now he was not only financially safe , but his conscience was clear , for he had made an advance to Jerry , and had been repulsed . On the whole he was glad , and his father had been wise . CHAPTER VIII . " Who bettering not with time , Corrupts the strength of heaven-descended will , And ever weaker grows through acted crime , Or seeming-genial venial fault Recurring and suggesting still THE daylight seemed to come reluctantly the next morning ; at least so it seemed to Jerry , who was watching for it with a weary excitement . Sleep had been impossible to him ; all night long he had lain with wide-open eyes trying to rest-trying to push out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the day dawned . And he watched the firelight that played on the wall , and the wan gray day that marked so gradually the square of the window . The sky was leaden-hued , but no snow was falling ; he sighed a little , for the snow would have solved this difficulty . But the snow was waiting for some time when he would not want it ; and the issue stood before him unsettled . He dressed slowly ; he would give the men the benefit of every moment of time ; and he ate his breakfast slowlyvery slowly , by the light of a smoking lamp-for Mrs. Milton had it ready for him always before the work-horn blew ; then slowly made his preparations for going out to the dam . " Hey a leetle patience , Jerry Wilkerson , " Mrs. Milton said , as she followed him to the door . " Orl the boys is been right smartly honggry sence the cole sot in , an ' they ai n't got much onderstandin ' no how ; so hey a leetle patience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his hat ; but he said no word in answer to Mrs. Milton 's exhortation , and left her watching him anxiously as he walked away . " Techin ' hisn hat , fur orl the worl ' like the doctor , " she muttered , " an ' a-killin ' hisseff fur this pore trash jest like the doctor , " and she turned away with a sigh . Jerry found it a hard climb over the snow that was mashed into ice  --  a slow climb that gave him full time to think , and now that the issue was on him he could no longer drive away his anxiety : every step brought him nearer to this decision ; every step brought him nearer to an awful temptation ! He looked down anxiously for the tracks that would show that the men had passed on their way to the dam , but the frozen snow held no marks . Beyond the end of the street he would be able to see tracks , but he would have to go to his office for something , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have followed ; so that until he reached the top of the dam he could not know how the issue had been decided . He might have gone and looked for tracks , but this would have been too great an acknowledgment even to himself . His office was dark and cold and dusty , and in one corner were the things he had brought away from the old house . Dead memorials that had gained a human aspect from long association with living souls ; things that looked as if they had regular habits , and were distressed by their homeless , useless condition ; by being huddled into a corner with dust and spiders ' webs about them . Did they suspect that they might pass into strange hands before this day faded ' ? He turned away hastily : if the men were going to obey his orders , they would be at work by this time ; if not he would need all the day for the arrangement of his own affairs ; and locking the door , he took his way up the gorge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dry snow blown from off the higher peaks came about him in sudden swirls and eddies ; up from the white valley that yet was checkered and smirched with the black marks of civilization ' ; up to where he could see so clearly the unsullied because unhumanized mountain tops shining white against the leaden sky . // Half-way up the gorge he paused , and listened intently ; he heard no sound of pick or spade , he heard no sound of voices . More intently still , with his hand to his ear , and his head turned away from the wind ; his heart sank within him-had they turned against him as Joe warned him that they would ? Up higher , and still no sound nor voices greeted him ; not even his own footsteps could be heard as he worked his way through the soft , dry snow . On the highest ridge that he would touch he paused again to listen ; it was strange he could hear nothing  --  the strokes of the pick would reach him at this distance surely ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , and he waited to hear it-it was his horn now . Clear and distinct , ringing up and down the white , dead stillness ; and a little thrill of scorn for himself went through him as he listened . It was a small thing he had done in establishing that horn to mark the work-hours-a small thing that he had done to mark himself as victor and master ; and he had worked-secretly , of course  --  to get the same horn , the very same horn he had heard that evening when he had been shown his place  --  the evening when his old life died-died with such painful throes ! Yes , it was small . Then the last echo faded , and once more he plodded on ; if the men were coming they would be at the dam by this time , and he would not stop again . Steadily forward ; and on the top of the dam he stopped ; below him the small ravine into which the stream had been turned , a pile of wood lay ready for lighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking a match , and all about it a mass of silent workmen showing black against the snow ! He stopped still to recover himself , for they had not seen him as yet , and his heart was beating strangely as with a halt in its throb ; and his head seemed full of blood ; he had had the feeling once before when he found Joe 's money ! Then Mr. Henshaw caught sight of him , and hailed him , and Jerry climbed down among them . The fire was lighted now , and the men stood about it quietly . " We get to work none too soon , " and Mr. Henshaw pointed to the sky , " this freeze will not last much longer ; all indications point to a warmer change . " " And so we must work the harder , " Jerry answered , selecting a pick from a pile near at hand . " What shall we do first ? " The revulsion of feeling had been great , and he felt weak from it , but he had nodded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed down to where the engineer thought the bed of the stream should be widened to lessen the weight against the dam . Besides , the stream would be so full from the unusual amount of snow , that it might flow over the artificial bank if room were not made for it . The dam could not be made higher in a freeze like this , and in any event this would not be so advisable as the other . So the work was laid out , and the men told off in gangs to work at different points : fifty men , Jerry counted , with a strong feeling of exultation ; fifty men who yesterday had defied him almost ! He struck good blows with his pick ; strong blows that rang clear and sharp ; he led his gang in work , but said no word to them . And when Greg came , he stood still and watched how Jerry took the lead even in this work ; and when the short day was done , how easily he resumed his place as chief , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directing the men who had worked to come and draw extra rations ; then he gave his pick to be put in with the rest , and walked home with Mr. Henshaw and Greg . Greg watched it all , with the question ever in his mind , " How does he do it ? " What was the source of this man 's power over these men of his own class and standing ? And with his head bent , and his hands in his pockets , he walked in silence , not even hearing the talk between Jerry and Mr. Henshaw , but wondering if his father 's fears about Jerry would be realized ever . This crisis was past , and Jerry lay on his bed exhausted . All day long he had worked as hard as a common laborerafter a long strain of responsibility sud // denly increased into a dreadful anxiety and temptation , a tense state that had been relieved as the sudden snapping of a cord too tightly drawn ; he had worked as if his life , like the men about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raiment , and now the reaction was too great . Through all the day 's work the exultation had found vent in the quick regularity of his blows , and the short clipping of his words when he gave his orders : an exultation and relief that were over now , leaving him exhausted and bitterly humiliated by a realization that had been pursuing him all day , ever since he had mounted the dam and had seen the men gathered below him ; a realization of himself that was new to him , and being new was still dreadful ; a realization that had come close to him , and had wrapped him in its hateful folds . He abhorred himself , for he knew that if the men had refused to work he would have sold out by telegraph , and at this moment would have stood free , and rich , and a legalized thief . He would have withdrawn from the venture secretly-would have escaped free with the spoils-would have failed to every trust in order to save his own money ! And as he dragged himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would the greatest success , even , repay him for this ? What would the greatest success mean  --  the success for which he found he would sell his soul - what would this greatest success mean ? He leaned against the chimney and looked down into the fire ; the greatest possible success could mean only the gathering of a colossal fortune for himself-and then ? He turned quickly to the door ; then he would have to hunt for somebody to love him-for somebody to put faith in - for a new level of self-respect-for a new ideal of a man ! And he went down-stairs slowly . Already in his pursuit of money he had lost his trust in every human creature with whom he had come in contact ; and with a fortune in his hands how black human nature would seem ! And yet , there was nothing left for him to believe now but that money would com pass most of the things he desiredwould make him happy ! And he would gather and gather gold until it would mean nothing to him  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the country would ring with his name . He ate his supper hurriedly , and walked rapidly to Dan Burk 's shop , where the public stores were kept ; he had to issue rations , and to order out more men to work , for the wind had a new and sudden warmth in it that meant a thaw . Swiftly down the rough road , and in at Burk 's shop , glad to reach the piles of meat and bins of meal-to reach and measure out the crude , illsmelling liquor from the great barrels that stood in the inner room-glad to do anything , or go anywhere that would deliver him from this " self " he was learning to fear-this " self " he was not brave enough to contemplate . How he had fallen from his high ideals ! how recklessly he had striven and fought for this money that had seemed to satisfy ! and he had gained it . Gained it ? he spilled the whiskey a little as he measured it out by the light of a flickering torch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained the gold , but the gold him ! It held him fast and strong , and drove him in ways he abhorred-held him down until his old self became a haunting spirit that made him loathe this new creature born of covetousness . The men had gone now , and twenty new hands were coming to the work in the morning . His task was done , and he locked the doors and walked up the street with Greg , who had come to help him . The men have worked well to-day , Greg said , wondering if Jerry would allude to the crisis in any way . " Yes , " Jerry answered , " it is not often they are blind to their own interests , " but that was all , and at Mrs. Milton 's door he said good-night without the least suggestion that Greg should come in . And Greg turned away provoked , yet he felt uneasy ; he must make peace with this man to-morrow-did he care for him really ? - strange what power he had . // CHAPTER IX . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , where men sit and hear each other groan ; When palsy shakes a few last , sad gray hairs ; When youth grows pale , and spectre-thin , and dies ; When but to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden-eyed despairs . " AND so the winter passed with its sufferings and crises ; with its strained watching and excitement , and at last the weather had broken , and a chilling thaw set in . Worse than the dry , iron freeze of the mid - winter , this thaw seemed with its death-like dampness to search in among the bones , and to creep up and down the shrunken blood - vessels . The roads were half-frozen slush , and the stream already boiled white and angry down the mountain - side , while as yet the upper snow had not begun to melt . There was a fascination in watching its eddies and foaming waves , and Jerry would stand on the dam and wonder how much higher it would rise when the real spring-weather came ; and would the dam hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ills with which cold and dampness could afflict . Many of the little children and the old people died , and the murmur of regret for the doctor swelled and grew into rooted discontent . Mr. Wilkerson ought to send for a physician ; and Jerry , who had appealed to his friends in the East already , made another statement of his needs , and asked that a clergyman should be sent also ; for he felt a strange reluctance to read the services over the dead , which thing he had to do because the doctor had done it always  --  a superstitious feeling about it that made him afraid almost , and a knowledge that he was not fit to do it . Yet many , many times he had to stand in the rain-washed graveyard , and commit to their last restingplaces the children , and the men , and the women he had known ; had brought out there in some cases ; had watched sicken and die with no creature near with knowledge enough to help them ! He could not do everything . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and soon the advanced corps of workmen would be in the town , and the physician of the company be near enough to help them . As yet , Jerry had heard nothing from the East that could in any way advise him of Paul 's movements , save the letter from Isabel Greg , which her brother had shown him . But he had not much time to brood over this now , for the mine occupied all his attention . Mr. Henshaw 's work was thorough , but he worked with a deliberation that to Jerry was maddening almost . Mr. Henshaw could not realize the importance of making one quick dividend that would keep the people patient and fill the treasury ; he had perfect confidence in the mine himself , and wrote it up most diligently ; and the capitalists in the East were perfectly satisfied , but the people in Durden 's , who were doing the work , began to murmur . They were not in want , for the town supplied them with all the necessaries of life , but they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury had more money than the governing members ot the Commune . Jerry spent much weary thought on the subject , but could find no solution for the problem ; if he advised these men to sell , it would affect seriously the mining stock ; if he broke up the Commune system , and paid back to these men all they had invested , he would have to sell much of his own Durden 's stock , which would look more like a loss of confidence than any other move he could make . Henshaw could relieve him from his difficulty entirely , if he would make a little haste ; but this he did not seem to understand , and Jerry knew that if he tried to hurry him by telling him all the motives and necessities of the situation , he would not comprehend the position , and might kill the whole scheme with his slow , blundering , literal explanations to every soul who , he thought , contributed one cent to the very handsome salary that made him and his " Sue** so comfortable . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , but Henshaw 's elaborate explanations would be sure to make it seem so . Jerry thought of every possible , and impossible , plan to satisfy these igno // rant people who were hampering him so cruelly . If his money had been an accepted fact among them , he would have bought out the half of every discontented man 's share , and so have satisfied them ; as it was he could not do this without explanations which would seem like fairy tales to these people , and more surely than anything else would ruin him . One last plan occurred to him : it was to double the working force in the mine , and compel Henshaw to be more active . And he could get the men easily , for now that the terminus of the railway was so near , numbers of new men were coming in every day to ask for work ; but how pay them ? It came home to him with harsh force how foolish he had been to invest everything in Durden 's ; if any part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less ruinous to touch , he gladly would have withdrawn it all in order to pay these men and quicken the declaration of a dividend . His only alternative was to borrow ; again and again he had turned away from this thought , only to come back to it whenever a louder and more angry murmur came from the people . Borrow money to carry him over this crisis , and all would be well ; borrow money in his own name , and buy out the shares of these discontented people in the name of his broker-why not ? This would be easy , very easy ; and he wrote to the broker the amount he wanted to borrow . It took nights of thought , coming after long days of labor , to decide this , and he felt very weary when at last he wrote to his broker ; and was in despair almost when he saw the rate of interest charged him . Still , to have the money was a relief , and the broker 's name to shield him . Louder the murmurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed without actual disaster in the shape of a strike was so much gained . Louder and louder , then quietly he stepped in and bought in the name of Mr. Glendale the half of every stockholder*s interest in the mine ; then made a biting speech about their cowardice and shortsighted policy ; a speech that made every man regret his action , and on the first suggestion agree to advance all that had been paid them , that the body of workmen in the mine might be doubled . And Mr. Henshaw was delighted , and promised to make his work still more sure and honest ; with a doubled corps of workmen why need he hurry and so leave careless work to mar his reputation ? This mine was bound to succeed , and with its success his name as an engineer would stand or fall . So the spring days came and went , each one a little warmer and giving no sign of the late snows prophesied , but melting the frozen masses that had gathered during the winter ; and the streams were many and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet now , save for the coming of the railway , and the rumor of a great excursion . For now the time was approaching when the Board of Directors of the " Eureka , Durden 's and Great Western Railway " were to come out in special trains , and drive " last spikes , " and make speeches , and spend money to make the venture better known . It was a grand affair , this railway , and must be advertised that in the future it might give grand results ; and these great Directors must be treasure  --  or if he could have been his own engineer and have declared a dividend . But new hope caine to Jerry in the news that more " Durden 's " had been bought for him , as it was still rising , for this assured him at least that Paul had not injured his scheme as yet . So he borrowed more money and set about making the greatest arrangements possible to IDurden 's for the reception of the coming magnates ; and galvanized his dead enthusiasm to rouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , and to awaken in them the high hopes that he was now too weary to entertain . For now he felt that he was driven on and held up to his purpose more through fear of failure than through the realized value of what he was striving for . But also he knew that now for him there was no choice , for as he looked back , every barrier that // had hindered his onward march seemed to have doubled in strength once he had passed it ; what had been hard to pass , now became impossible to repass ; and he saw with growing despair that there was no retracing his steps ; his mistakes held him in worse than Egyptian bondage . There was no middle way for him now , the end must be either an absolute success , or an overwhelming failure ; and even the thought of failure had become torture too exquisite to be borne ; no toil that might avert this could be too hard-no risk could be too dangerous that might gain success for him ! And two bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the light in his eyes had become an unhealthy glitter . CHAPTER X. Waiting to strive a happy strife , To war with falsehood to the knife , And not to lose the good of lifeAs far as might be to carve out Free space for every human doubt , That the whole mind might orb about . ' Yea , ' saith the voice , thy dream was good While thou abodest in the bud , It was the stirring of the blood . ' " JERRY made a speech . in which the people did not see the effort , and a small sum was gathered to provide for the reception of the excursion party . " What weuns eats every day is good enough fur them , I reckon , " and Mrs. Milton gave a dollar ; " an ' I 'll tuck in three thout chargin ' no bo'de , " and Jerry telegraphed that the sleeping-cars must be brought the whole way . He thought much on the subject , and knew that he would be doing well if he could rouse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to eat ; more than this was impossible , and he would not suggest even any further effort . So he made a list of the strangers coming , and put them about with the people according to the number they each agreed to provide food for ; then wrote a letter explaining as best he might the customs and resources of the place , and the type of accommodations that could be furnished . And the Directors laughed , and pre pared as for a great picnic . What did they care for the feelings of these wild borderers-feelings Jerry had used all his power to rouse successfully into a state of hospitality ; what did they think of the eager expectation of making a show , that possessed the hearts of the Durden 's people ; what did they realize of the willingness to help Mr. Wilkerson , and the latent pride the people had in this man who was one of themselves , yet powerful enough to have influence with these " money-princes ; " and further , how could they appreciate the precarious position of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them as one of themselves , but who had to be now one of the mob ? They stocked their train with every delicacy ; they carried a full corps of servants ; they spent great sums in transporting , without jarring , much priceless wine ; and put on an extra car for a few wives and daughters who were " ecstatic and wild to see the romantic Western life ; the dear miners , and the heroic women who were brave enough to share their frontier life " - which was not frontier life , but hopelessly within the border for the excitement of Indians , or of anything more romantic than wild creatures and tramps . An old mining town that had been deserted and kept in the shade for twenty odd years-that had been given over as a failure until one year ago . Of course the frontier was across the plains by this time , and all the Indian agencies and reservations seemed as far from IDurden 's , almost , as the great Eastern cities . But these people from the centres of American civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South and West were unknown parts of the earththe South meant oranges , and flowers , and " Ku Klux ; " and the West meant Indians and gold mines . And Indians were all the " Last of the Mohicans , " and gold mines were beautiful grottos where stalwart men , clothed in red and blue shirts and spotless white trousers , carelessly gathered shining lumps of gold . And Jerry worked hard to make the town look clean after the hard winter , so that the excursionists would not be too much disappointed . // " My mother and sister will come , " Greg said , " but against my advice . " " You may have my house prepared for them , " Jerry answered quickly . Greg shook his head . They must remain in the sleeper , ** he said ; " it will be for two days only . I can not make them as comfortable anywhere as they will be there ; but I thank you very much . By the way , " pausing doubtfully , " Henley is come-arrived this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pen moved none the less steadily because the beating of his heart had doubled . " I have not seen him , " Greg went on , " but he sent me the news of my mother 's coming ; I believe he expects to entertain many people . " " Your people ? " and for the first time Jerry looked up . " Not with my consent , " Greg answered , coming nearer this man who puzzled him so often , " you know that I do not trust Henley . " Jerry returned to his work . " I think we had better make your house or my house ready for them , " he said . But Greg would not agree ; he was sure that the car would be the best place for them . Then he left Jerry to his work , and going down the road met Paul Henley-Paul Henley who grasped both his hands ; who was dressed as would be Greg 's civilized friends , giving him a home look ; who rattled off the Eastern news ; who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted sister out with them , and who was dreadfully anxious that everything in the doctor 's house should be in proper order to receive them . " I suppose you know that your mother and sister will stay with me ? " he finished . " No , " Greg answered , bluntly ; " no , I did not know it . " " Well , they will , " and Paul watched Greg keenly . " You are very kind , " Greg answered , his brown face showing more color than he would have liked if he had seen himself , " but I think they had better stay in the sleeper . " Paul laughed . " Your mother 's only objection to coming was her dislike to the sleeper , " he said . Greg walked on a little space in silence ; he did not trust Paul Henley ; he was angry with himself that he had not warned his family against this man he was provoked that they should have agreed to stop at Paul 's house , and he determined to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be prepared for them , or Jerry 's househe would go and see Jerry about it . " You have never met my adopted sister ? " Paul went on . No , " and Greg looked interested he could not but look interested when a man talked to him of his sister . " She has no notion of taking care of herself , " Paul went on , " and could not have come unless with your mother , and she and your sister are friends . " " Are they ? " and Greg felt that his plans were becoming impossible . " And you had better come to my house also , " Paul went on , " and stay while your mother and sister are with me , you can then see so much more of them . " " You are very kind , " Greg answered , " but I have made other arrangements for them . " " The sleeper ' ? " laughing amiably ; " that is impossible , for I promised your mother that so soon as they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in the place , and that you should come and stay with them ; so do not trouble yourself needlessly ; and deprive me of this pleasure . " " You are very kind , " Greg said again , then turned off toward the mine . What would Wilkerson say ? was his first thought ; then angrily he asked himself , what right had Jerry to say anything ? No right in the world ; and in his secret heart Greg knew that Jerry would not say one word ; probably he would not look at him , but go on quietly with whatever he might be doing . This was the sore spot , that Jerry could and probably would listen to his words of explanation silently , then quietly put him and his mother and sister aside with Paul Henley , and go on his own way . And if Jerry did , what matter to him ? // he had not espoused Jerry 's side to any extent ; he had not become an intimate of Jerry 's ; his father had advised against this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , and drove his hands deeper into his pockets ; he despised Paul Henley , and he was learning to value strangely Jerry 's approbation and good will ; was growing anxious to break through the reserve and silence in which Jerry wrapped himself . And that this should be thus was the heart of the problem for Greg ; why should this man be of any special importance to him ? Jerry had no higher aims now than many men Greg knew , no higher motives-why should Greg wish for his friendship ? Jerry had grown selfish , intensely selfish . At first there had been at the root of his work the desire for the good of the many ; this had been the enthusiasm that had set the work in motion , as well as the force that had been at first the motive power ; but Greg knew that this enthusiasm was dead ; how he knew this , or when this force had died , he could not tell . but the fact of its death dwelt with him , and strange to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The loss of the higher motive that had seemed chimerical , gave the venture a solidity that enhanced Greg 's faith in it , and increased his respect for Jerry . It had seemed weak to him at first , this plan to improve a town for the good of the town 's people , and not as a speculation ; to build up a community that possibly would help all , but positively would make the fortune of no one person ; it had seemed wild and unstable , and a mere waste of energy ; it was against the spirit of the age that was for monopoly , even though it might go hand in hand with the theory of the age which was for humanity . This theory was wrong ; it would weaken any man to help all about him , and to be helped in return . Every man must fight through his own life , and shape his own fortunes ; every man must run his own race and win his own prize ; this it was that made men of Americans ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man had equal chances ; every man could have all he could get and hold against the odds brought to force his gains from him ; this made men strong and hard for the battle , and this was what had at last made him look up to and respect Jerry ; this very power to take all he wanted  --  to guide all to suit his will , and yet to build all on the fair foundation of the public good ! Greg was forced into admirationPaul was forced into envy and malice . And Greg went home angry with himself that he had not guided his steps better than to wander from under the shadow of this man 's power . This man whose power was bound to increase because daily he was learning the motto of the age- " Every man for himself . " If every man stop to help his brother ; to " pour in oil and wine " and bring him to a safe resting-place , who could first reach the goal ? who could do more than win food and raiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can permit no such weakness as this ; the narrower the aim , and the harder the heart , the surer the success ! The creed of Individualism and the Creed of the Christ touch but at one point : " Thou canst not serve God and Mammon . " ( To be continued. )
