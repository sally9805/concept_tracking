txt George N. Curzon , Parliamentary Secretary for the Foreign Office , and the representative in Parliament for the Southport Division of Lancashire , made his annual address to his constituents to-day , and met with an enthusiastic reception . He opened with a reference to the arbitration treaty negotiations with the United States , an achievement with which , he said , the name of the Marquis of Salisbury would be perpetually linked in history , and for which , at any rate , the people on this side of the water deserved the exclusive credit , if , as they were told , war is likely ; but he hoped it would not occur . If the motives and tactics which were alien to the spirit of the proposals they apparently intended to wreck succeeded in strangling that agreement in its cradle , they would not succeed in depriving its authors , either on this side or the other side of the Atlantic , of the credit of its parentage , and a later date would surely come when their treaty , if not completed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code of the Anglo-Saxon brotherhood , and perhaps a part of the international law of the world . The lawgivers who originated it would ever afterward be held in honored remembrance . These remarks were greeted with cheers . Speaking of the Eastern question , Secretary Curzon said that a war cloud was daily growing on the horizon , but he was hopeful that prudent statesmanship and the unselfish alms of the powers might yet dispel the cloud before it breaks into a cyclone of universal destruction . He presumed that the Britishers had two objects in view , the welfare of Crete and the avoidance of European war . The speaker excepted the Radicals , who , he said , held without regard for facts that whatever Greece did was right . Secretary Curzon then referred to the " bogey integrity " of the Ottoman Empire , and said that part of the international law which had heretofore been modified by the powers would be modified again ; but that the distribution of the empire as it gradually breaks up must be undertaken by Europe and not left to individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spoils . The only effect , he said , of Lord Kimberley 's or Lord Harcourt 's proposals to tear up t.tt e treaties and repudiate the obligations of Great Britain would be to alienate our allies and leave vacant a place in the concert of Europe , which was a league of peace . At the present moment nothing could be worse for Crete and nothing so unfortunate for Greece as that the ancient liberties of the former should be imperiled or that the financial difficulties of the latter should be aggravated by a strain which annexation would impose , Both would be absurd to the powers and produce a constitution which might be destroyed in a week by the clash of arms . But a constitution for Crete would be ready soon , and peace would be restored . More important points than the forming of a constitution were the creation of a supreme governing authority and the pacification of the island . The new Governor should be a Christian , nominated by the powers . In this connection the speaker said that he could not imagine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to select their own Governor . The withdrawal of the Turkish troops was a logical sequence after the withdrawal of Crete from the authority of the Sultan . England was taking all the steps possible to get rid of the Turkish troops on the island , but the responsibility for their remaining rests with the insurgents and the Greek troops , who were encouraging them . Only a knave would make the suggestion that we are acting for the Turks in this matter , and only an idiot would believe if Greece declared war , as we read with shame , she would do it in order to spite herself on the powers . She could not act from a pettier or meaner motive or commit a greater crime . Our duty lies with the concert of the powers , because it is in the cause of peace . It is a , cabinet of nations , marking the greatest advance of international law and international ethics which the century has seen . At the conclusion of Secretary Curzon 's remarks he received an ovation , and a vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
