txt An extra edition of The Skaguay Alaskan , received by the steamer Tees at midnight . contains the following report , wired from Bennett to Skaguay , just previous to the sailing of the steamer ? " Another disastrous fire has visited Dawson City , this time fairly wiping out the entire business centre of the town , creating losses that will aggregate $1,000,000 , with not a dollar ' , worth of insurance . The news was telegranhed from Bennett this afternoon by the special correspondent of The Daily Alaskan . who received it from a man named TokaleS. who had just reached Bennett from a long and perilous trip out from Dawson over broken trails , open rivers , and dangerous lakes . " Mr. Tokales repot% that the fire occurred on April 21 in the very heart of the business centre of the ' city , commencing near the Opel a House . on the water front . and spreading with unusual rapidity , driven by a strong wind , destroying everything in its way on that street down to and includihg Donahue &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-front buildings abreast of the same blocks . The fire crossed the street , burned through , and spread over to Second Street , covering the principal business portion of Dawson , leaving it all in ashes , with the firemen helpless and powerless to do anything . The fire consumed everytning from the Simmons Royal Caf ? down to and opposite the Fairview Hotel . The fire was the most disastrous that has ever visited Dawson . The buildings burned like tinder , due to the fact that they had been standing for nearly two years , and the logs were as drx as powder . The fire spread with such great rapidity that the people were unable to save anything in the way of furniture goods , and clothing , so that the losses when footed up promise . to be even greater than at first estimated . ' Among the most prominent firms burned out were : " The Royal Caf ? . Donahue &; Smith , &; the Parsons Produce Company , the Aurora Saloon , the Bodega Saloon , the Madden House , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British North America . " This lire came at a time when the mills and dealers in building materials had exhausted their Winter supply : and were waiting the opening of navigation to replenish their stocks . The- results are that there is a famine in all kinds of building material and furniture , such as sashes , doors , locks . hinges , &c.; The few articles still remaining outside of ' the burned district have quadrupled in price . Doors are , selling for : F35 each : door locuts , $8 each , and everything ' else in proportion . The town is paralyzed , , because nothing can be done unfit the open- ing of navigation , which will not be for several weeks . ' HISTORY OF ' DAWSON CITY . Extraordinary Rapidity of Its Growth - in a Single Year . ' Dawson City , named after the great Canadian explorer who discovered the gold in the Klondike regions , was mainly ' built in 1897 . It was situated on the north bank of the Yukon and close to the mouth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site between the hills and the river Joseph Harper of Fort Selkirk and Josephl Ladue of Sixty Mile put up the first cabin on the site , having- removed their trading stock immediately on the receipt oft the news of the discovery cf gold , in August , 1SiG . In less than a year after . the entry of the town site , Dawson had over 2,000 inhabitants , with hotels , stores , and wharves . Its boggy soil caused much ill-health , and the ' *two hospitals which were erected there were not able to accommodate all the typhoid patients of the first open season . The managers of the Alaska Commercial Company of San Francisco , of which Louis Sloss is the President , and which had offices at Juneau City . Alaska , saw that there would be a ready market for lumber in Dawson City , and thousands of feet were sent over Chiicoot Pass for the erection of buildings . The town was soon a thriving one , and streets were laid out by the Canadian police . Third Avenue was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse on this street , as also did Thomas ' Magee of San Francisco , ewho , with his sons , Walter Magee and Thomas Magee , Jr. , started a large provision business . Some of the other prominent concerns on the same street were William B. Styke , ( " Stillwater Bill , " ) who conducted a large sporting place ; G. W. Kent a Co .. dealers in raining equipments ; the Dawson City Hotel , the Vaudeville Theatre , which was owned and operated by H. B. S. Marcus , who was in New York City in November last , and the Post Office , which was destroyed by fire in October . Near the Post Office was the Green Tree Saloon , the scene of many revelries , and also the office of The Klondike Nugget , Dawson 's onlypaper . The Oregon Navigation ... Company , the Klondike Development Company , A. T. White &; Co. , the Alaska Trading Company , and Watson &; CO. all had large buildings in the business section . The Fire Department of Dawson City owned only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was dragged from its shed to be used in extinguishing small blazes , it was found to be next to useless . Many attempts were made to raise funds to secure engines from San Francisco , but these schemes fell through . The last big fire in Dawson , on Oct. 16 , WJS. when forty buildings were burned , including the Post Office , caused a loss of ** It started in the Green Tree Saloon . where two women were quarreling . One threw a lighted lamp at the other , setting the place en fire . On this occasion 2,000 men turned out and worked with wet blankets , buckets of water , and axes , and with the aid of the fire engine succeeded in preventing the whole city from being destroyed . John P. Barrows. a theatrical man of Juneau . Alaska . who is in this city , said yesterday : " I am not surprised to hear that the whole town has been destroyed , for , if the inhabitants of Dawson were ever careless of anything they were of fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close together . When I was in Dawson , some three months ago , I noticed that many new buildings were being erected on the site which was destroyed by fire last year . There was plenty of lumber in the city at the time , and if that has not been destroyed there is still plenty with which to build again . At that time a friend up there said to me : ' This place will go up in smoke some day . ' And I guess he was right . " The worst feature of this fire in Dawson lies in the fact that there is no insurance there , and the losses will all have to be sustained by individuals . Every one was careless about the coal-oil lamps which were used at night , and it was not uncommon to hear of two or three being overturned in the saloons every night . The Canadian police often told the saloon keepers they should keep buckets of water ready , but they paid little or no heed to the warning . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
