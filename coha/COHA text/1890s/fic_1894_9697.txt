DISCOVERED : WILSON , lighting lamps and giving final touches to room . WILSON . ( looking round ) If art is the object to be pursued in this mansion , then art let it be , and if this is not artistic , I ca n't ' elp it . ( crosses R. ) ( Enter GEORGE . C. ) GEORGE . Anybody here yet . Wilson ? WILSON . Not as yet , Master George . Art is like an owl , sir , and only flies at night ; and it 's early yet . Shall I light the lamps in the conservatory , sir ? GEORGE . I 'm sure I do n't care whether you do or not . I do n't know anything about it . WILSON . Perhaps it would be as well to light up , sir ? ( going towards conservatory ) GEORGE . I dare say it would , and in the picture gallery as well . Not that it makes any difference to me . ( Exit WILSON to conservatory , R. 3 E. ) Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a bore . I wish I were dead . ( Sits on sofa C. , and buries face in hands . ) Why do people want to come here to enjoy themselves when I am so miserable ? ( Enter UNA from passage L. through C. ) UNA . Ah , there you are , George ! How do you like me ? GEORGE . As well as I do anybody , just now . When will Aunt Florence arrive ? UNA . She came almost directly after dinner . She will be down presently . ( Enter WILSON , C. ) WILSON . Mr. Krebs , Master George , to see Sir Everard . ( crosses L and into library and exit ) GEORGE . ( aside , alarmed ) Krebs ! What does he want here now ? ( Enter KREBS , R. C. ) GEORGE . ( with affected ease ) Hello , Krebs , is that you ? The Governor will be here soon . KREBS. ( speaking precisely , and with a slight German accent ) Thank you , Master George , I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Foxwood , ( bows ) UNA . You look tired and harassed this evening , Mr. Krebs . I trust you have no bad news from Mentone ? KREBS . I am glad to say that my wife is better now , and mending daily . I have no words to tell my gratitude to your kind aunt , for her great generosity , which under Providence has proved the means of saving my wife 's life . UNA . I 'll let papa know you are waiting , if you like , Mr. Krebs ? KREBS . If you would be so good , Miss . ( UNA goes to door ) GEORGE . The Governor wo n't much like being like disturbed of a reception evening . ( Exit UNA , C. off L. ) KREBS . Master George . ( GEORGE moves uneasily ) Something must be done . GEORGE . ( helplessly ) I know it , Krebs , I know it , but for Heaven 's sake , what can I do ? KREBS . You must raise the seven hundred pounds . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . If the Governor thought I had lost the money on a horse-race , he would turn me out of the house , ( dropping on chair ) KREBS . But if you  --  ( Enter SIR EVERARD from library , L. 2 C. , followed by WILSON , and WILSON exits C. Both rise . ) SIR E. Sir Everard Well , Krebs , you want to see me , I am told ? KREBS. ( coming forward ) Yes , sir , I  --  SIR E. Sir Everard ( haughtily ) You know I have a decided objection to being followed home on business . ( to GEORGE , who is going ) You may remain , George . KREBS. ( producing document ) If you please , Sir Everard , I desired your signature to this statement which is to go before the Directors of the South Palestine Bitumen Company , Limited , to-morrow morning . SIR E. Sir Everard ( glances over papers ) Tut , tut , tut , this is not a very hopeful showing , Krebs . I shall have to send out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can be done to create an artificial market . Till I can get this off my hands , I can not manage my gold mine to advantage . KREBS . Then Mr. Wolcott has sold , sir ? ( GEORGE closes his memo , book and rises ) SIR E. Sir Everard Not yet . But , I shall have that gold mine all in good time . Sir William Butler , and I have already taken the preliminary steps to incorporate a company for its purchase . ( signs document ) There , you can take it away , Krebs , and you might hint to the Directors to-morrow that in the present state of Eastern Europe it would be inexpedient to make anything regarding the affairs of the Palestine Company public . ( to GEORGE , who lounges down towards him ) You have heard what I have been saying , George ? GEORGE . Yes , sir , that it would be inexpedient to make anything public regarding the affairs of the Palestine Company . SIR E. Sir Everard Exactly , and as a general rule the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( laughs ) That will do , Krebs , you can go . ( KREBS goes to door C. ) GEORGE . ( following him and whispering ) I will do my best , Krebs . I think I have found a way . ( exit KREBS . C. to L. ) ( RIORDAN enters . ) Hello , Riordan , glad to see you . The Governor 's here . This is Mr. Riordan , sir . SIR E. Sir Everard I am glad to meet you , Mr. Riordan . I hope we may see as much of you in the future as your parliamentary duties will permit . RIORDAN . Thank you , Sir Everard . I ca n't say an Irish M. P. 's berth is exactly a sinecure . SIR E. Sir Everard Legislature duties , sir , ought never to be a sinecure . RIORDAN . I know it . Poor fellows must work . It is only one of you city men , who can roll in riches like a cow in clover . SIR E. Sir Everard By making a few judicious speculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly . RIORDAN . And scattered quite as fast . Many a man has found Capel Court a short cut to the County Court . ( sits on sofa C. ) SIR E. Sir Everard I said judicious speculations , Mr. Riordan . RIORDAN . Ah , but who is to be a judge of judiciousness ? Nothing succeeds but success . SIR E. Sir Everard Why do you not try your own fortune ? RIORDAN . I 've a hatful of reasons . In the first place , I do n't know how . In New York , once I did " Wall Street " for the " Herald " for six months , but here in London I have n't the remotest idea how the cat will jump or who is going to let her out of the bag . SIR E. Sir Everard That is only one reason . RIORDAN . And I 've another . A man has to raise the wind before he can fly kites . Now , I 've no money . ( GEORGE indicates that he has none ) SIR E. Sir Everard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , you are a member of Parliament  --  RIORDAN . Elected for the purpose of breaking it up . to start a new one somewhere else . SIR E. Sir Everard Then you have another hold on the world of finance  --  you are a correspondent of a leading Transatlantic journal . RIORDAN. ( smiling ) I do a cable letter every Saturday for the Gotham Gazette , but that 's worth only fifty dollars a week . SIR E. Sir Everard ( rising ) It is worth as much as you choose to make it worth . I 'll give you an instance . There is the South Palestine Bitumen Company  --  you shall have a prospectus before you go  --  I am buying in as fast as I can spare the money . Owing to local complications it is very low just now . Of course I am not telling you this for publication . GEORGE . Yes , I heard the Governor tell old Krebs just now that it was inexpedient to make the affairs of the company public . ( rises , crosses up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly so , George , but from a friend , as I trust Mr. Riordan will suffer me to call him  --  ( RIORDAN rises , bows ) I can have no secrets . If you will do me the favor of stepping with me into my den  --  ( goes L. and opens library door ) GEORGE . ( low ) Snuggest room in the house , old fellow  --  and such cigars and brandy . RIORDAN. ( going L. ) I 'm at your service , Sir Everard , and faith , I wo n't say but that Bitumen sounds like a dry subject that would stand a deal of moistening . SIR E. Sir Everard ( pushing door open ) After you . ( RIORDAN bows and exit L. , followed by SIR E. ) GEORGE . That may be a good thing , though . The Governor 's shrewd enough and he seems hot on it . I wonder if I could n't pick up a hundred in the Bitumen stock , or even a thousand . There 's lots of fellows would carry an account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a great mind to try it . UNA. ( entering C. from L. ) George , here 's Aunt Florence ! ( Enter MRS . MEREDITH C. from L. ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Well George ! ( GEORGE goes to her , she embraces him ) My dear , dear boy , I am delighted to see you ! ( holding him off at arm 's length ) You 're not looking as well as I could wish . You need change of some kind . GEORGE . ( aside ) I need a good deal of change  --  about seven hundred pounds ' worth . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( examining UNA 'S costume ) And I shall have to take you back to Paris with me , too , if it is only that you may learn how to dress . UNA . Oh , Aunt , I am Undine . GEORGE . What rot ! Una is always trying to be someone else ! She wants to sit to some artist fellow as a model . ( Enter SIR E. L. from library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library ) I beg you will make yourself perfectly at home . If you need anything , ring for it . ( advancing ) Ah , Florence , I am charmed to see you here . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And I am glad to see myself here . ( they shake hands ) What victim have you got in your toils yonder now ? SIR E. Sir Everard In the library ? That is Mr. Riordan , a young Irish journalist , a member of Parliament  --  home rule , of course  --  but he seems a very clever young fellow for all that . UNA . Yes , papa , is n't he nice ? GEORGE . He 's no end of a brick , I know . SIR E. Sir Everard That is a courtly phrase I can not but appreciate . GEORGE . You 're always snubbing a fellow , Governor . SIR E. Sir Everard Well , Florence , I hope you wo n't fly back to Paris till the season is over . I intend to entertain more than usual this year . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are right . Una is a little eccentric , and eccentric girls  --  even when they are pretty and have money  --  do n't always go off well . UNA . Oh , Aunt , you are simply dreadful . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( to SIR E. ) This evening sees the first of your entertainments  --  an art reception , is n't it ? SIR E. Sir Everard Yes , a portrait of mine has come home , and I thought  --  ah  --  ahem  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You thought it your duty to gratify your friends with a view of it . Perhaps this Irish journalist is an art critic ? UNA . You will be sure to like him , aunty . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I 'm not so sure of that , for I dislike an Irishman next to an American . SIR E. Sir Everard By the bye , I expect an American here to-night . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith He or she ? SIR E. Sir Everard A gentleman , with whom I have had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Mrs. Meredith ( smiling ) Then he has a strong claim on my pity . SIR E. Sir Everard I trust that you will be civil to him and make him at home . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I shall certainly be civil . I have n't different color=redPage 9 manners for different nationalities ; and as to making him at home , why , if he does not do that for himself , he will be the first American I ever met who did not . ( rising , crosses to R. ) SIR E. Sir Everard This Mr. Woolcott has acquired a valuable piece of property under the strange laws of his country , and I may  --  ahem  --  purchase it . I have invited him here to meet my friend , Sir William Butler , who may  --  ahem  --  be concerned in my business transactions with this Mr. Woolcott . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( sits ) Well , I wish both you and Sir William Butler joy of your American . ( fans herself ) UNA . What a beautiful fan ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fancy Undine with a fan ! SIR E. Sir Everard We must be moving now ; our friends will be arriving presently . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And your Irishman yonder ? ( pointing L. ) SIR E. Sir Everard I left him writing out a dispatch for his paper with some information I gave him about the state of affairs in South Palestine . Come , Una. ( up to C. ) ( Exit L. C. downstairs with UNA on his arm . ) GEORGE . How jolly to have you here , aunt . There is no one like you . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( rising and leaving fan on seat ) I want you to think of me as the best friend you have , George . GEORGE . ( offering his arm ) By Jove , you 're a brick , Aunt Florence , and m  --  I 'm  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You 're what , George ? GEORGE . ( aside ) I wish I had the pluck to make a clean breast of it to her , but  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an aunt like you . ( GEORGE and MRS . M. meet WILSON coming on as they go off . ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Are you looking for anyone , Wilson ? WILSON . No , ma'am . Sir Everard told me to go and get a telegraphic despatch , ma'am , that a gentleman is writing in his library . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Very well , ( to GEORGE ) It 's the journalistic Home Ruler . Come , dear . ( Exit with GEORGE C. off L. ) ( Enter WOOLCOTT from conservatory R. ) WOOLCOTT . Well , this is the queerest place to get into I ever struck ; all through the vines and palm trees like the entrance to the Garden of Eden . WILSON . ( aside ) Who 's that gent ? I do n't know ' im and I never saw ' im here . ( aloud ) I beg yer pardon , sir . WOOLCOTT . Do n't mention it . WILSON . Might I ask who you was a-looking for , sir ? WOOLCOTT . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everard . WILSON . Sir Everard , sir ? WOOLCOTT . That 's his full style and title , I guess . WILSON . Strange way to come , sir , in through the conservatory . WOOLCOTT . Oh , that 's the conservatory , is it ? The cabby must have mistaken me for a hot-house plant . WILSON . The front door is  --  WOOLCOTT . Oh , there is a front door . I thought it odd when the cabby set me down opposite a kind of little wicket in the garden-wall ; but it was n't my place to be critical , so I just pushed ahead . WILSON . Might I ask your name , sir ? WOOLCOTT . I ai n't ashamed of it . Silas K. Woolcott of Grass Valley , California , U. S. A.  --  sorry I left my card case in my other pants , but that 's the full printed description . And now , who are you ? ( puts hat and coat on chair R. ) WILSON . Butler , sir . WOOLCOTT . The very old chap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . ( WILSON hesitates ) Oh , come now ; do n't be so stiff and stand off . If we do business together , it may be money in your pocket yet . ( WILSON shakes hands ) So you 're Butler , eh ? William , is n't it ? WILSON . Wilson , sir . WOOLCOTT . Thought it was William the old man said . Never mind , Wilson 's near enough . WILSON . Shall I tell Sir Everard ? WOOLCOTT . That I 'm here ? Oh , he 'll find it out fast enough . I 'll try and worry along with you , by way of change . Sit down and let us have a sociable time . WILSON . Oh , I caw n't , sir . WOOLCOTT . What 's the reason you " caw n't " ? Got a stiff joint ? ( forces WILSON into seat and sits beside him ) WILSON . ( aside ) Remarkable affable gent ! WOOLCOTT . And now  --  do n't you want to buy a gold mine ? WILSON . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? WOOLCOTT . Do n't mention it . Now , this is biz  --  do you want to buy a gold mine ? WILSON . Ah , now , sir , you 're chawfing me ! WOOLCOTT . I suppose you object to talking business at an evening sociable ? WILSON . ( rising ) If you 'll excuse me , sir  --  WOOLCOTT. ( pulling him down ) Now , sit down , Butler , and make yourself miserable for a minute . Has n't Everard told you anything about the mine ? WILSON . ' Taint no wise likely Sir Everard should tell me anything of the kind , sir . WOOLCOTT . Likely or not , he told me he would , and asked me here to-night especially to talk it over with you . WILSON . To talk it over with me , sir ? WOOLCOTT . Sure . WILSON . Most astonishing ! WOOLCOTT . You 're Butler , ai n't you ? WILSON . That is my position , sir . WOOLCOTT . Position 's good ! William Butler , eh ? WILSON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson Butler . WILSON . ( rising ) I ' umbly beg your pardon , sir  --  WOOLCOTT . Do n't mention it . WILSON . Sir William Butler is expected here to-night . WOOLCOTT . Brother of yours , eh ? WILSON . I am the butler  --  Sir Everard 's  --  ah  --  ahem  --  principal retainer , sir . WOOLCOTT . Oh , the devil ! WILSON . No , sir , the butler . WOOLCOTT. ( irritably ) I wish to goodness you butlers would n't get yourselves up so confoundably respectable . How was I to tell you from a baronet ? WILSON . I 'm sure I caw n't say ' ow , sir . WOOLCOTT. ( putting his hand in his pocket ) Here 's one way . ( produces coin ) Do you know what that is ? WILSON . It 's a ' alf sovereign , sir . WOOLCOTT . If I offered it to you  --  WILSON . I 'd thank you ' umbly , sir . WOOLCOTT. ( giving it ) No baronet about him . Now , go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , sir . ( goes off L. 2 E. ) WOOLCOTT . All I know about the home life of the British Aristocracy I 've picked up from looking at the society drama at home . Now , they always dress their flunkies there in blue or red coats and silk knee-breeches , so it 's comparatively easy to tell ' em from the real swells . But , with a fellow like that  --  he might be anyone from a duke to a dancing master . WILSON . ( entering L. with despatch in his hand . Crosses to R. ) All right , sir , I 'll order a ' ansom to take it directly , sir . WOOLCOTT . And tell Everard I got past the man at the door and I 'm here . WILSON . I beg your pardon , sir . Will you favor me with your name again , sir ? WOOLCOTT . Cert . I 'm Silas K. Woolcott of Grass Valley , California , U. S. A. Try and have it by heart this time . ( WILSON exits C. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. Woolcott I see before me ? WOOLCOTT . ( R. doubtfully ) It is n't anyone else . ( recognizing him ) Gerald Riordan , as I 'm a living sinner ! RIORDAN. ( shaking hands ) I 'm devilish glad to see you again , old fellow . WOOLCOTT . The same to you and many of them . And what brings you here to London ? RIORDAN . I 'm a member of Parliament , returned in the National interest for my native borough of Ballynockslottery , and hard at work freeing Ireland by constitutional means . WOOLCOTT . Good thing ? RIORDAN . Is what a good thing ? WOOLCOTT . Any money in it ? RIORDAN . Why man , it is patriotism , not filthy lucre ! WOOLCOTT . And do n't you get anything for it ? RIORDAN . The devil a ha'porth , my boy , save and except always the reward of an approving conscience and the left-handed blessing of the ministry . WOOLCOTT . Then I 'd like to know what is done with all the money we have been subscribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you here ? WOOLCOTT . I have come to sell a gold mine . RIORDAN . Honest ? WOOLCOTT . Honest ? Well , I should dump a claim ! The Treasure Trove is as honest as they can make them ; and that 's the cold truth . ( insinuatingly ) Now , do n't you want to buy a gold mine ? RIORDAN . Could n't buy an inch of one , if they were selling like eggs at eighteen pence a score . WOOLCOTT . Come have a gold mine with me . RIORDAN . Have you talked to Foxwood about it ? WOOLCOTT . Scarcely talked to anybody else . I 've got him on the string , only it is n't long enough . He has offered me fifteen thousand . RIORDAN . Pounds or dollars ? WOOLCOTT . Pounds Sterling , Bank of England , gilt edge , extra dry . RIORDAN . And you wo n't take it ? WOOLCOTT . Not if the court knows itself , and it thinks it  --  do . RIORDAN . Faith , and it must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest thing on ice . Do you know Grass Valley , California ? RIORDAN . Well ? WOOLCOTT . That 's where it is . Things are just booming in Grass Valley now , and the Treasure Trove is on top of the heap . Old Foxwood knows all about it . RIORDAN . He would n't offer you money for it if he did n't . You seem to have struck it rich . WOOLCOTT . I have for a fact , and it was about time , for I have had to rustle around pretty lively since I saw you . After that trouble in New York about my brother  --  ( pause ) RIORDAN. ( quietly ) I remember . WOOLCOTT . You managed to keep the worst of it out of the newspapers for me , and I 've not forgotten it , Riordan , and never will  --  ( shakes hands ) RIORDAN. ( sits on sofa ) And after that ? WOOLCOTT. ( sits on sofa ) It took my bottom dollar to close up that account , so I went back to Colorado and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then I tried a little speculation in land and made some money , but luck went back on me again , and my cash and that of a lot of other tenderfeet went to keep up the carriage of the receiver of a railroad I helped to build . Then I went to prospecting . To make a long story short , I stumbled on the color in Eureka county  --  and the quick way I grabbed the treasure was n't slow . RIORDAN . Quartz ? WOOLCOTT . Quartz , of course . If it was a placer , do you think I 'd be letting Foxwood cut into my pie ? But , quartz takes capital to get it . RIORDAN . That 's what a countryman of mine used to say whose income could seldom carry him beyond pints . ( arising , crosses to L. GEORGE enters up C. looking for fan ) Here 's the son of the house . WOOLCOTT . He 's a good-looking young fellow . GEORGE . I say , Riordan , have you seen a fan ? ( as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) WOOLCOTT . Do n't you see a likeness ? RIORDAN . There is something  --  WOOLCOTT . They are as like as a Yankee boy can be to a Britisher . GEORGE . ( finding fan ) Ah , here it is. ( going ) RIORDAN . George , this is my friend , Mr. Woolcott of Grass Valley , California . GEORGE . ( eagerly ) I 've always wished I could go over to see California and the diggings and the big trees  --  and everything . WOOLCOTT. ( shaking hands heartily ) Walk across some day  --  I shall be very glad to show you round . I know it from Alfred to Omaha . GEORGE . ( to RIORDAN going up ) He seems a good sort , that Yankee . ( Exit down stairs C. ) WOOLCOTT. ( looking after him ) Poor Charley ! He might have been as light-hearted and as happy as that boy is  --  if I 'd got to New York twenty-four hours sooner . RIORDAN. ( sits on chair R. of table L. during preceding speech ) Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you made out afterwards . WOOLCOTT. ( sits ) Luck played it pretty low down on me for a good while , but I 've got a drop on it now . Making money is a tough job , but spending it is as easy as rolling off a log ; and when I sell the mine , I 'll just paint the town red . RIORDAN . I suppose you 'll cut a great swell . WOOLCOTT . I would n't cut any swell unless he put on frills and most of them do . There seems to be dead loads of them here to-night . Are you reporting the orgy ? RIORDAN . I am here trying to enjoy myself . Besides , there is a girl here that I am afraid I 'm in love with . WOOLCOTT . That 's interesting . A man in love is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . Who is she ? RIORDAN . I do n't know who she is to-night . The first time I met her she was Mary Queen of Scots . Since then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen of Troy , and a dozen other interesting personages . WOOLCOTT . You must find her a little confusing . What 's her name ? RIORDAN . She is the daughter of Sir Everard Foxwood . WOOLCOTT . I 've no use for that man except to sell him the Treasure Trove ; he is a hard old file . RIORDAN . He has n't tried to rasp me yet . He entertains well though . To-night 's soiree is in honor of a new portrait of himself , and if you want to get into his good graces , you might say that it does n't do him justice . WOOLCOTT . To do that , they would have to hang him on the line , if half I hear about him is true . RIORDAN . If you take to judging men in this off-hand way you 'll never get on in London . WOOLCOTT . I do n't want to . I want to sell my mine and go home  --  I 've had London enough in mine ; it 's too far from the Bowery. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you get into society a bit , you 'll like it better . You 'll meet some handsome women here to-night . WOOLCOTT . Not half as many as I can meet on Broadway any matinee afternoon . I did see a beauty to-day , though . I came up with her on the cars from Dover , and attempted a little travel talk with her , but she squelched me with the regular stony British stare . RIORDAN. ( standing L. ) You did n't make much progress , then ? WOOLCOTT . No , maybe I 'll meet her again . I 'd like to know her . RIORDAN . She must have made an impression . But London 's a pretty big place , recollect . WOOLCOTT . Too big and too selfish  --  all body and no heart . RIORDAN . That complaint comes oddly from a man of the world . WOOLCOTT . You are a man of the world and I 'm not . I 'm a stranger from way-back . Just tell me who 's who and give me a few stray hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riordan , who is that ? RIORDAN . Which ? WOOLCOTT . The handsome woman with the large fan  --  she 's a daisy . RIORDAN . The lady that Butler is speaking to ? WOOLCOTT . Damn that Butler ! There , see with the fan ! Now , she 's moved away . That 's the very lady I was telling you about  --  in the cars . RIORDAN . You are in luck ; you will have a chance now to get acquainted . WOLCOTT. ( waves handkerchief ) Howde ! RIORDAN . Ah , there 's Miss Foxwood , the daughter of the house . She 's got up as a water nymph of some sort . I must find out just what she represents or I 'll get myself into hotter water than she is supposed to have come out of . Ah , there is the only Juliet ! WOOLCOTT . Who ? RIORDAN . You see those two ladies coming out of the music-room together , one with a fan  --  WOOLCOTT . That is the one I asked you about just now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , she is the only Juliet . WOOLCOTT . And who is the only Juliet , when she is at home ? RIORDAN. ( coming down together ) She is Mrs. Vandervast ; she was Grace Strangeways , and the old critics swear we have n't had a Juliet since she left the stage . And she thinks so , too , and is always ready to spout Shakespeare to you at the shortest notice  --  she can never forget she was once the toast of the town . WOOLCOTT . I wonder what took her to Dover ? RIORDAN . She may have been in Paris . She 's nothing to do but amuse herself and she 's always dodging about . She left the stage to marry a Dutchman , the senior partner in Vandervast , Schriften &; Co. , and she is now the happiest of sublunary mortals , a wealthy widow , and likes to speculate now and then . ( crosses down L. ) WOOLCOTT . Do you suppose she wants to buy a gold mine ? RIORDAN . ( L. ) Faith , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no difficulty in getting into her good graces if you approach her adroitly . Greet her as Juliet , play Romeo yourself , and draw on your memory and your imagination for all the hyperbole you can call up . WOOLCOTT . ( R. ) She is a beauty  --  and no mistake ! RIORDAN . She was a beauty . If you think her beautiful now , you must be looking at the wrong woman . WOOLCOTT . " How silver sweet sound lovers tongues by night . " If she will only come up here on the balcony , we can begin the scene at once . But , perhaps I had better wait until I have shed some of my wild Western ways . RIORDAN . Never think of it , my boy . Be as American as you can . The English like the humor of it . They are getting to be very fond of the Transatlantic flavors over here . Stick to your Yankee twang , as they call it . Leave to the dudes in New York , all attempts at the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WOOLCOTT . Then I will venture an allusion to the venerable chestnut made by the Governor of North Carolina to the Governor of South Carolina . Which was that : " It 's a long time between drinks . " RIORDAN . Sir Everard has made me free of his private supplies in his library here and he told me to make myself at home . ( going to library door L. ) WOOLCOTT . Then perhaps he has a soul to be saved after all . ( As RIORDAN and WOOLCOTT go L. , SIR E. enters from R. U. E. ) SIR E. Sir Everard ( C. ) How do you do , Mr. Woolcott ? We can steal five minutes from social engagements and perhaps conclude our negotiations for your gold mine . What do you say ? WOOLCOTT. ( c. , aside to RIORDAN ) I say I am euchered out of my drink . ( aloud ) At your service , Sir Everard . SIR E. Sir Everard I 'll introduce you to Sir William Butler presently . You have n't met him , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he got away . SIR E. Sir Everard Young Butler  --  Sir William 's son  --  has just finished a course at the engineering school . Sir William talks of sending out to examine the property . Now , Mr. Woolcott , what do you think of going back to California with him ? WOOLCOTT . What for ? SIR E. Sir Everard To go over the property . WOOLCOTT . I know it by heart , and I should think you would by this time . Still , I 'm always glad of an excuse to go home for a spell . RIORDAN . The girl I left behind me  --  is that the idea , Mr. Woolcott ? SIR E. Sir Everard Your wife resides in California , Mr. Woolcott ? WOOLCOTT . No , sir , she do n't reside anywhere . I 've had no leisure for courting in my life . When a man 's making love , he 's no time for making money . SIR E. Sir Everard You are a bachelor , then ? WOOLCOTT . ( C. ) Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born so . SIR E. Sir Everard ( R. ) But you have no objection to going over to California ? WOOLCOTT . Not in the least . RIORDAN . ( L. ) I do n't think he likes London , Sir Everard . ( going up L. ) WOOLCOTT. ( aside to RIORDAN ) Say , Riordan , do n't finish the bottle . RIORDAN . Trust me. ( exit in library ) WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) Trust you ! Trust an Irishman with a whisky bottle ! SIR E. Sir Everard ( sits ) I will see young Butler here this evening and ascertain how soon he will be ready to start . WOOLCOTT. ( sits ) He ca n't start any too soon to please me . I wish you would make me a fair offer for the mine and let me finish the business right here . SIR E. Sir Everard I am willing to give you fifteen thousand pounds . WOOLCOTT . I 'm not willing to take it . Come , be sporty , Sir Everard ! You know the mine 's worth every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must consider that when you get back from Grass Valley . WOOLCOTT . The mine will be neither richer nor poorer , and I wo n't drop a dollar in my price . You ca n't hatch a china egg , Sir Everard , if you set on it till the robins nest again . SIR E. Sir Everard Well , perhaps we can settle it by correspondence . WOOLCOTT . No , sir , you can write around me every time . Before I 'd start to do business with you by letter , I 'd argue with a mule when his back is turned . SIR E. Sir Everard ( haughtily ) A mule ! WOOLCOTT. ( rising ) Nothing personal , Sir Everard . You 're a kick above a mule for you 're open to conviction , and I 've something here that will convince you if anything will . ( crosses to his overcoat and returns with quartz specimen ) Just see the veins running through that ! SIR E. Sir Everard ( adjusting glasses ) Very pretty , indeed ! WOOLCOTT . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoat ) SIR E. Sir Everard Well I will see young Butler . This can wait till your return , but remember , Woolcott , my offer of fifteen thousand pounds is open any time you choose to close with it . Shall we go down stairs ? WOOLCOTT . It seems to me my friend Riordan may be lonesome in there . SIR E. Sir Everard Not at all . He 's probably enjoying a cigar and a glass of brandy and water . WOOLCOTT . Look at the luck some fellows have ! That 's just what I 've been pining for . SIR E. Sir Everard By all means , step in and try some . WOOLCOTT . Well , Sir Everard , I wo n't say no , for I 've a thirst on me I would n't take ten dollars for . ( WOOLCOTT and SIR EVERARD off L. ) GEORGE . ( off C. ) Now , lean on me , Mrs. Vandervast . There is no one here . You will have quiet and air and you will be better directly . ( Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is faint and assist her to chair down C. ) UNA. ( fanning her with MRS . M 'S fan ) There now , how do you feel ? MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Better , my dear , better . Ah , this reminds me of the last night I played Juliet  --  it was before your time , my dears . It was a command night from a very great personage , and the theatre was crowded to suffocation . What with the heat and the applause and the excitement I fainted after the potion scene , and the first thing I remember was , hearing a very distinguished voice saying : " So even Juliet is mortal ! " Pretty , was n't it ? UNA. ( fanning ) Very . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast And gratifying . You need not fan me any more , dear ; I am quite restored . ( UNA rises ; gives fan to MRS . VAN . and goes R. GEORGE gets to table and picks up book . ) ( Enter RIORDAN L. ) RIORDAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . I 'm Undine to-night . RIORDAN . And Undine is a naiad with all the modern improvements . But , what do my eyes behold ? " It is the east and Juliet is the sun ! " Do n't arise , fair sun ! ( stopping MRS . VAN . who would rise to greet him ) But let the humblest of your slaves kiss your hands . GEORGE . ( aside ) What rot ! ( crosses in front of table to chair L. of table ) MRS VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Ah , ' t is you , is it ? Fair Mercutio  --  somehow , you always remind me of Mercutio  --  I fear you are a sad flatterer . UNA . Indeed he is , Mrs. Vandervast . RIORDAN . ( R. C. ) This from Miss Foxwood ! I can not tell a lie  --  I never flatter . UNA . ( R. ) I believe gentlemen on your side of the channel call it " blarney . " ( sits on chair R. ) RIORDAN . Faith , blarney is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . The wisest and greatest of men have been indebted to it . Solomon was the wisest man that ever yet was known because he swam to Ireland and kissed the blarney-stone . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Indeed ! Is that historical ? How interesting ! RIORDAN . And was there ever such a past master in the art of blarney as your own friend Romeo ? MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast ( sighing with pleasure ) Ah , time has been , Mr. Riordan . RIORDAN . Of course it has , and it has ceased to be , having been conquered by an alliance of genius and beauty ! " See even she leans her cheek upon her hand , would I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek . " GEORGE . ( aside ) Rubbish ! ( Strain of music heard off . ) RIORDAN . Hark ! They are dancing ! UNA . They are getting up a set of quadrilles . RIORDAN . Quadrilles are respectable if slow  --  a sort of tacit protest against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering his arm .

( GEORGE turns to run ) RIORDAN . Thrice happy George ! Ah , madam , if it was only a question of saraband or even a minuet . GEORGE . ( to RIORDAN ) You wo n't get into the set if you do n't look sharp . RIORDAN . Fair Juliet , adieu . " Parting is such sweet sorrow that I could say good night till to-morrow . " Come , Miss Foxwood . ( UNA and RIORDAN exit C. down stairs R. ) GEORGE . Did you say you 'd like to go into the conservatory , Mrs. Vandervast ? It 's awfully jolly and romantic and all that , you know , when the lamps are lit . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast I think I should . ( GEORGE offers her right arm ) No , the other arm , George . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left arm , leaving the sword arm free to defend her . ( They go towards conservatory R. , meeting MRS . MEREDITH entering C. up stage to R. ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You are better , I trust ? I got away as soon as I could to see how you were . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Thank you , I am distinctly better , and my kind young friend is taking me to the conservatory . So , I can return the fan now with many , many thanks . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You are sure you do not need it ? GEORGE . Oh , she 's all jolly now . Are n't you , Mrs. Vandervast ? MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Indeed yes , I assure you . ( Exit with GEORGE into conservatory R. ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( seating herself on sofa ) I am beginning to be tired , I confess . Even a woman can not travel all day and play the hostess in the evening without feeling the fatigue . ( fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( aside ) There 's the only Juliet  --  fan and all ! Great scott , but she 's a pretty woman . There was excuse for Romeo . ( shuts the door ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Here is Everard 's Home-Rule Irishman ! Why , it 's the same man I came up from Dover with this afternoon . ( rises ) WOOLCOTT . Ah , good evening . I had the pleasure of seeing you on the train to-day . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I saw you . WOOLCOTT . Did you ? It seemed to me that you were looking right through me , as if my face was a pane of glass and my back hair a landscape . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I believe I have a sense of humor . WOOLCOTT . So have I. Some day or other I mean to come over here and start a funny Punch . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith That is rather cruel to the present publication . ( bows slightly and as she moves away drops her fan ) WOOLCOTT. ( stepping forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( surprised ) Sir ! WOOLCOTT . There 's a blunder to begin with . That 's Hamlet , and it 's Romeo and Juliet she 's struck after . ( aloud ) A pleasant reunion our friend Sir Everard has here to-night . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( amused ) I find it amusing  --  now : Have you known Sir Everard long ? WOOLCOTT . Not a great while . Quite a little man , is n't he ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Why , what should he be ? WOOLCOTT . Nothing , nothing . Is he a great admirer of Shakespeare ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I think he appreciates Shakespeare and the musical glasses . WOOLCOTT. ( embarrassed ) Of course , of course . ( aside ) Now , what is she talking about ? Musical glasses ? That 's a little high for me ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( aside ) Either he 's been taking a glass that was n't musical or he 's a little touched in the head  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) My recollection of Romeo is very rusty  --  and besides I ca n't recall that he ever tried to sell Juliet a gold mine . ( aloud ) How long is it since you left the theatre ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Left the theatre ? I have n't been to the play this evening . WOOLCOTT . Of course of course  --  I mean since you left it  --  gave it up . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I have not been to the theatre since my poor husband 's death . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) If I do n't strike a lead soon , the conversation will not pan out very profitably . ( aloud ) So , you are a widow ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Yes . ( aside ) This is really amusing . The man is an original ! WOOLCOTT . Seeing you so beautiful , I might have guessed that some man had died for love of you and left you his widow . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( aside ) Here is Irish blarney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complimentary . WOOLCOTT . " Oh , thou dost teach the torches to burn bright . Thy beauty hangs upon the brows of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop 's ear . " MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Have n't I heard that somewhere before ? WOOLCOTT . Of course , of course . That 's Romeo and Juliet , is n't it ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith It is very pretty indeed  --  but I do not greatly care for second-hand compliments . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) She 's mighty bright woman  --  and not half as crazy after Juliet as Riordan said . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( aside ) Now he can tell me if he will . He is a Home-Rule M. P. and I have long wanted to know if these fellows are really patriotic or altogether selfish . ( aloud ) May I take the liberty of asking you a question or two on a subject which interests me greatly ? WOOLCOTT . Any information I can give is entirely at your service . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , of course . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And you will not be offended ? WOOLCOTT . Certainly not . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Well , then  --  about this movement  --  how shall I phrase it  --  this business of yours that brings so many of your countrymen to London  --  how does it get on ? WOOLCOTT . Not so fast as I could wish . There 's a great deal of shilly-shally and hang-back about your leading men over here . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith So I should have supposed . But , assuming you are successful , do you , individually expect to make money out of it ? WOOLCOTT . Well , I should smile . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Excuse me , but what does " I should smile " mean ? WOOLCOTT . It expressed enthusiastic assent . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Then you do expect to make money out of it ? WOOLCOTT . Of couse  --  of course  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( aside ) They are as mercenary as I thought ! WOOLCOTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hope to make my pile ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Very true , why indeed ? That is candid at any rate . Then you do not fight for the principle of the thing at all ? WOOLCOTT . Certainly I do . It is my principal , and I propose to turn it into cash if I can . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Sell it , in fact ? WOOLCOTT . To the highest bidder . To yourself , Madam , if you make me a good offer . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Thank you , it is quite out of my line , and I only asked as a matter of curiosity . WOOLCOTT . Hold on ! I 'll give you a specimen . ( rises ; makes for his coat ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Never mind it . After what you told me , your oratory would fall rather flat . WOOLCOTT . My oratory ! I was n't going to preach a sermon over it . But , it 's good ! You do n't know what you might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside ) I do n't know quite what to make of him . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) Perhaps if I gave her a little more Juliet and Romeo  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Apart from the money then , you take no interest at all . WOOLCOTT . If I am paid a lump sum , I shall have no occasion to take interest . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith No doubt you know best ; but that does not seem to me a very patriotic way of looking at the matter . WOOLCOTT . Patriotism has nothing to do with it , as far as I can see . To me , it is a mere matter of business  --  just a gold mine , neither more or less . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith A gold mine , of course ; and I have no doubt it will prove a profitable one . WOOLCOTT. ( rises ) Thank you , ma'am , I hope it will . I need it in my business . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I thank you for your kindness  --  and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of the Irish question before . ( going up R. ) WOOLCOTT . There 's nothing so Irish in a square trade . ( aside ) She must n't go before I have a chance to soften her heart with a little more Romeo . ( aloud ) I answered your questions , now , wo n't you do me a favor ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith If I can . WOOLCOTT . Just run through a scene or two of Juliet for me . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( surprised ) Juliet ! WOOLCOTT . Do n't refuse me . I know you gave up the stage long ago . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( astonished ) What ? WOOLCOTT . You are famous on the other side of the water , and when I go back , I 'd like to be able to say I had gone through the balcony scene with the only Juliet ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith The only Juliet ! ( aside , much amused ) The man takes me for Mrs. Vandervast . Now , I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the death of me . WOOLCOTT. ( persuasively ) Just a few lines  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You must prompt me then , for it is a long while since I have read the play . WOOLCOTT . All right ! ( aside ) By Jove , I wish I could speak the lines on my own account . ( aloud ) You hold your face as if you had the toothache . See , how she leans her head upon her hand . Oh , would I were a glove upon that hand , that I might kiss  --  or touch  --  is it ? Is it kiss or touch ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Neither if I know it . WOOLCOTT . Anyhow , there is " cheek " in the line . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And it is a word you are thoroughly familiar with ! WOOLCOTT . Then you answer  --  " Oh , Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou Romeo ? " ( MRS . VANDERVAST and GEORGE enter from R. ) MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position .

Sir Everard My sister , Mrs. Meredith . ( WOOLCOTT staggers back to sofa ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Mr. Woolcott and I have managed to fall into acquaintance . WOOLCOTT . Well , Mrs. Meredith , all I can say is , I hope we shall never fall out . ( Enter WILSON , C. from L. , with a tray of ices . He hands them around . ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Allow me to introduce you to the genuine , the only Juliet . ( WOOLCOTT and MRS . VANDERVAST bow ) WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) That 's different . Good-bye , Romeo .

( mopping his face ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was about to say , when this absurd scene put everything out of my head  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Do n't scold , Everard , it has given me the best laugh I 've had for months . WOOLCOTT. ( recovering ) I 'm glad I amused you , Mrs. Meredith . I suppose now , you 'll look on me as a mountebank to the end of the chapter . RIORDAN . That wo n't be long , if you 're going right back to California ? SIR E. Sir Everard Young Butler says he can sail Saturday . You will be ready then , I suppose , Mr. Woolcott ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Are you going away so soon ? What a pity ! WOOLCOTT . Think so ? Then I wo n't go at all . SIR E. Sir Everard Not go  --  why I 've arranged it all with young Butler . WOOLCOTT . Butler can go without me . I 've changed my mind . ( looking at MRS .

( aloud ) Yes . CURTAIN . ACT II . SCENE : Five months later . Plays July 4th . Same set as Act I. Early afternoon . WILSON brings on KREBS , C. , upstairs L. WILSON . Sit down here , if you 've a mind to , Mr. Krebs , but you may have to wait a goodish bit . Master George was gone to Lords to-day , playing in a cricket match . KREBS. ( sits L. ) A cricket match . These English are a strange people , they would leave their house burning to go to a cricket match . WILSON . ( R. C. ) Which they know the duty they owe , sir , to their country and their eleven . ( Enter GEORGE C. , dressed in cricketing flannels ; his left hand bandaged and arm in sling . ) GEORGE . ( coming down C. ) Hello , Krebs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see you . I hope no accident has happened . GEORGE . ( C. ) Nothing much . Enough to send me home though . I have been playing cricket and managed to split two of my fingers . But , you wanted to see me , Krebs ? KREBS . There is a little matter of business  --  ( points and looks at WILSON ) GEORGE . ( understanding ) Wilson , will you go down and dismiss that cab . I have n't any money in these pockets  --  ( aside )  --  and precious little anywhere else . ( crosses R. ) ( WILSON exits downstairs , R. C. ) GEORGE . ( after watching him off ) What is it ? I gave you that seven hundred pounds months ago to settle up with . KREBS. ( rising , coming C. to GEORGE ) That is all settled . This is something else . Do you know who was in the office this morning ? GEORGE . ( R. ) No . KREBS . ( L. ) Mr. Selover of Sharp and Selover . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor ? KREBS . Sir Everard 's not been down to-day . Mr. Selover spoke to me , sir , and  --  GEORGE . I know  --  I know ! Lord , what a precious fool I have been . KREBS . This is a very serious matter . Mr. Selover said it was close upon ten thousand pounds . GEORGE . So much as that ? I had no idea . They have been carrying stock for me . Krebs , and  --  KREBS . Mr. Selover told me all about it . He said they had no objection to continue to carry you , if Sir Everard said it was all right , but it is a very heavy account for so young a gentleman , so he thought he would ask if Sir Everard approved . GEORGE . Approved ! If he hears of it , Krebs , I do n't know what he 'd do . He 'd  --  oh , Heavens . ( walking up and down R. ) KREBS . Sir Everard has sold nearly all his Palestine Bitumen shares . GEORGE . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sold me with them ! ( strong ) KREBS . And that will not make him more amiable when he discovers it . GEORGE . But he must not discover it . Oh , what am I to do ? KREBS . We must try and get a little time from Sharp and Selover till you can turn round and get the money . GEORGE . ( bitterly ) Oh , that 'll be easy . I found it so simple to get seven hundred pounds that there 'll be no trouble at all raising ten thousand . But , I 'll see what can he done . I 'll  --  oh ,  --  I do n't know what to do ! ( distractedly ) KREBS . You may count on me , Master George , to help you all I can . I will go straight to their office . ( gets but at table L. ) I will telegraph to you at once to say whether or not , they will give you till the end of the week . GEORGE . That 's the most they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than I expect they will let you have . GEORGE . I shall be on pins and needles till I get your telegram . ( KREBS going ) Oh , I say  --  ( KREBS goes back to GEORGE again C. ) If Una sees it , she 's safe to open it  --  she ca n't believe a brother has any secrets from his sister . Put it this way , if they will give me till Saturday before they see the Governor , wire " Two runs to spare " or if it 's a case of to-morrow : " Bowled out . " Then if Una does get hold of it , she 'll think it something about a cricket match . KREBS . " Two runs to spare , " or " Bowled out . " I will remember . ( sees UNA coming  --  motions GEORGE to be still . ) ( Enter UNA from conservatory R. She wears a dress very like MARGUERITE 'S in " FAUST . " ) UNA . ( R. C. ) Oh , George , what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hurt it at Lord 's . UNA . Oh , you poor dear boy ! Let me see it . GEORGE . ( annoyed  --  crossing R. ) I ca n't untie it for you to peep at . UNA. ( seeing KREBS ) Good afternoon , Mr. Krebs . Did you want to see papa ? He 's not well to-day , and has gone for a walk , but he 'll be back directly . KREBS . I can not wait any longer , but it is of no consequence UNA . And how is Mrs. Krebs ? KREBS . Greatly better , thank you . She owes her life to your dear Aunt  --  Heaven bless her ! I expect her home to-night , and she will take an early day to express her gratitude to Mrs. Meredith . UNA . I am so glad to hear she is improved . GEORGE . ( fidgetting ) I 'll walk down with you to the corner , Krebs , and see you on your bus . UNA . But ought you to walk , George , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands , you little goose ! ( UNA annoyed , goes to table L. and stands ) Come , Krebs  --  ( they go up ) UNA. ( sitting R. of table L. ) I ca n't think what is the matter wih George . He seems so strange  --  as though he were worried about something . And I do n't believe Mr. Riordan meant to come at all . Here it is nearly 3 o'clock , and he promised me last night that he would call early , and see how I was after my fatigue  --  as if a hall fatigued me . Still , I wish he 'd come all the same . It 's too bad to dress for nothing , and I could have lounged away the whole afternoon in my Marie Antoinette . ( Enter RIORDAN L. C. , unperceived . ) And I dressed as Hibernia last night , just out of compliment to him , and because the tiresome florist could not send me any shamrock , and I had to wear laurel instead , he took me for Daphne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIORDAN . Fair Marguerite , I kiss your hand ! UNA. ( with a little scream ) Oh , Mr. Riordan , how you startled me ! Who could have expected you so early ? RIORDAN . Is it early ? I thought it was late . UNA . I wish you could feel how my heart is beating ? RIORDAN . I wish I could . I did n't intend to startle you . I 'm not Mephistopheles . I 've got you right this time , have n't I  --  you 're Marguerite ? UNA . Of course , I 'm Marguerite , but I wonder at your knowing it . I should have supposed that you would have taken me for Daphne again . RIORDAN . Not twice in twenty-four hours . But my mistake last night was excusable enough . But , you looked charming . UNA . Did I ? It was a delightful ball . But , what possessed you to go as the Toreador ? RIORDAN . Because you told me you were going as Carmen . UNA . That 's pretty . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John-bull fighter would be more appropriate , would it not ? UNA . You must n't abuse England to me . RIORDAN . Then you must n't abuse Ireland to me . To paraphrase Cowper , I will say : " Ireland , with all thy faults , I love thee still ! " UNA . Mr. Riordan , what can you mean ? RIORDAN . I mean I love you . ( UNA turns from him still seated ) Oh , do n't turn away your head , Una . Wo n't you give me an answer ? Ca n't you say " Yes ? " Just one little " Yes ? "  --  from your sweet lips is all I need to make me the happiest man in the universe this minute . WILSON . ( at C. announcing ) Mrs. Vandervast ! ( exit C. ) RIORDAN. ( jumping up ) The devil ! MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast ( coming airily forward ) Ah , young people ! I am not spoiling a tete-a-tete , I hope ? RIORDAN. ( aside ) You'e spoiling my temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively have someone to compare notes with about the ball last night . Do n't ask me to take off my things , because I 'm going to ( taking off shawl , parasol , sits C. ) Where is Mrs. Meredith ? UNA . ( L. C. ) Aunt has gone out . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast How provoking ! I hope you enjoyed yourself , dear ? I saw you , and you were looking lovely ! Did n't you think so , Mr. Riordan ? RIORDAN . Miss Foxwood knows what I thought of her last night  --  ( aside to UNA ) and always . UNA . Yet he mistook me for Daphne . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Did he ? How very stupid ! If Mercutio will excuse my saying so , I knew you at once  --  Cordelia  --  and admirably you were made up , my dear  --  ( RIORDAN laughs ) What are you laughing at , Mr. Riordan ? I have played the part , and I am sure I ought to be competent to express an opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of me ? RIORDAN . Madam , I found you , as I always do , the most charming impersonator of Juliet , heart could desire , either on or off the stage . ( pointedly ) Will you subscribe to my declaration , Miss Foxwood ? MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast To be sure she will , dear girl , only too partial to her friends . Did you see old Lord Vavasour speaking to me ? A dear old man ! The bouquets he used to send me thirty years ago ! Do you know what he said to me last night  --  " If Grace Strangeways ever carried the charms of Juliet to adorn private life , I had hoped her new initial would have been " V. " UNA . And so it is . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Exactly so , my dear , but that was not exactly what Lord Vavasour meant , and he intended it for a compliment , poor fellow . RIORDAN . When Mr. Vandervast proposed to you  --  you 'll stop me if I am impertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Vandervast I do n't say you are impertinent , but it is an odd question . Why do you wish to know ? RIORDAN . Because I have been thinking of proposing myself , and I am collecting all the methods of successful suitors of modern history with the view of selecting one for my own use . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Dear me , that is ingenious , and worthy of Mercutio . Well , Mr. Vandervast borrowed a prompt copy of Romeo and studied the whole part . He had a sad Dutch accent , poor fellow , which rather marred his delivery when the time came , but after all , Romeo was a foreigner too . RIORDAN . I am afraid that precedent  --  even with the sanction of its distinguished success , ( bowing to MRS . VAN ) would hardly answer my case . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast You had better woo as Mercutio than as Romeo , but I hope you will succeed . RIORDAN . Will you echo that wish , Miss Foxwood ? MRS . VAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear child . RIORDAN. ( impatiently ) Ca n't you let her answer for herself , Mrs. Vandervast ? MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast There now , Mr. Riordan , you have made her blush . " Love 's ensign yet is crimson on her cheeks ! " RIORDAN . Do you think I shall speed in my wooing , Miss Foxwood ? UNA. ( hesitating ) If you are wooing in earnest  --  ( looking up and catching RIORDAN 'S gaze , he makes gesture of solemn asseveration . She looks down again ) I think you have won your suit . ( RIORDAN jumps up joyfully and seizes UNA 'S hand behind MRS . VAN 'S back . ) MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast What did I tell you ? And I do believe the girl 's right . I think you have certainly got past the proposal . Tell me , in confidence , now when is the happy day ? RIORDAN . I must have an opportunity to consult with the lady before I can answer that question . ( telegraphing to UNA ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ashamed of yourself ! RIORDAN. ( laughing ) Do you think she 'll make me wait long ? UNA. ( stamping ) She 'd make you wait forever , if she knew that you dared to laugh at her . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Not she . She may send me away the first time , but not far . But there , there ! If Mrs. Meredith is not in , I think I will go . UNA . Surely not so soon , Mrs. Vandervast . But if you really must  --  you know  --  here are your things  --  let me put them on for you . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Thank you , my dear . RIORDAN . And this is your parasol . Shall I see if your carriage is at the door ? MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast I ordered the coachman to remain , as I only ran up here for a minute . RIORDAN. ( aside ) Ye gods ! What a minute she chose ! ( going L. , then back ) Allow me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes up , as if to take her down stairs . ) MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast ( re-seating herself ) By the way , dear , are you going to Lady Caldecott 's this evening  --  ? UNA . I am  --  no  --  yes  --  I believe so . ( RIORDAN up stage is expressing agony of impatience . ) MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Because if your people are not going , I have an extra card and I will be most pleased to call for you . UNA . Thank you ever so much , but we have all got cards , and I am ever so much obliged to you . And now I shall never forgive myself if I keep you from your drive for a moment longer this lovely afternoon . ( RIORDAN fidgeting L. forced smile ) ( Enter GEORGE C. , meeting MRS . VAN who is being escorted off by RIORDAN . ) GEORGE . How do you do , Mrs. Vandervast ? ( they shake hands ) RIORDAN . This looks like a positive conspiracy . GEORGE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Vandervast But what is the matter with your hand ? GEORGE . Nothing to signify . I hurt it at cricket . I say , Una , has a telegram come for me ? UNA . Not that I know of . If you expect one , you had better ask down stairs . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast And you can give me your arm down to the carriage . I will excuse your right arm this time , my poor wounded knight . Good-bye , dear , and all possible success to you , Mr. Mercutio . ( RIORDAN down L. UNA is down R. GEORGE and MRS . VAN exeunt C. , downstairs L. ) RIORDAN . Thank Heaven , she 's gone . UNA . I thought she 'd never go . RIORDAN . I wish she had not come . At last ! ( Rushes down to UNA , embracing her . ) So , you do love me ! UNA . Just a little , though you do not deserve it , making me so uncomfortable with your hints and innuendos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you please now you have confessed that you love me. ( kisses her ) Did you know I loved you ? UNA . I thought so . In fact , I 've been expecting you to propose for about two weeks now . RIORDAN . Two weeks wasted . I must make up for lost time . ( kisses her ) UNA . You must not do so , Mr. Riordan . RIORDAN . Call me Gerald . UNA . Well , one kiss a day is enough , Mr. Gerald . RIORDAN . Not Mr. Gerald , just plain Gerald . UNA . I ca n't call you plain Gerald , you 're too good looking . See how you 've fidgeted yourself into a state of untidyness . Stoop down and let me settle your tie . RIORDAN . Una  --  UNA . Yes  --  Gerald . RIORDAN . Do you think it 's right for a young lady to keep what does n't belong to her ? UNA . Certainly not . RIORDAN . Then , I 'll trouble you to give me back those kisses I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't . RIORDAN . Just one . It is quite easy when you 've once made a beginning . ( draws her to him ) UNA . Only a little one . ( kisses him ) RIORDAN . Sure , I 'll be generous and wo n't keep it . ( kisses her ) ( Enter WOOLCOTT C. ) ( UNA crosses L. and turns ; RIORDAN goes R. ) WOOLCOTT. ( shaking hands ) How 's yourself , Miss Una ? Well , Riordan , you have n't blown up Parliament with that dynamite speech yet , I see ? RIORDAN . The explosion is set to come off to-night . WOOLCOTT . The Fourth of July is just the day for fireworks and oratory . I 've an appointment here with Sir Everard , but it goes against the grain to be doing business on the Fourth . Yet we can hardly expect a Britisher to take stock in that anniversary . RIORDAN . So it is the Fourth of July ! I had n't thought of it . WOOLCOTT . Of course , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the Fourth of July remarkable for ? RIORDAN . It is the birthday of your favorite Pocahontas . UNA . Not really ! WOOLCOTT . He 's chaffing you . ( oratorically ) It is the greatest day of the year in America , for it is the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence . It is on the Fourth of July that the spread eagle of America flaps its wings and soars into the blue empyrean  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( entering C. up-stairs ) Is Mr. Woolcott making what he would call a stump speech ? WOOLCOTT . Of course , of course . ( aside ) That woman shuts me up like a jack-knife , only I 'm not half as sharp . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( sinking on sofa and fanning ) What a warm day it is . Una dear , take my bonnet off . RIORDAN. ( to WOOLCOTT ) You are not going ? WOOLCOTT . Why not ?  --  as Mrs. Meredith says , it is a warm day . Why should I stay to be roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? WOOLCOTT . I like it . I could not live without it , but it is like a cold shower bath , invigorating in the end , but a great shock at first . RIORDAN . I like to see a handsome widow with a good flow of spirits . WOOLCOTT . I like this handsome widow , but a man has no more chance with one than a trading schooner has with a privateer . They all sail under the black flag , and if they do happen to marry again , they are still no better than pirates who only hoist the white flag that they may get within arm 's length of the foe . ( During above , UNA has been removing her aunt 's bonnet and otherwise assisting her . ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Thank you , dear , that 's better . Yes , you can have that bud if you admire it . ( UNA takes flower from MRS . M'S. breast ) Do you know , I think we are the most inconsistent people in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country only when it gets too cold to be agreeable there . WOOLCOTT . Now we do exactly the reverse in America , we  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Now do n't talk about America . I see the thermometer stood at 102 in the shade in New York yesterday . WOOLCOTT . Ours is a great country , ma'am , and we like a big thing , whether it is a circus , or a railroad , or a hot spell  --  we get all we can . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And here in London we do all we can , till we ca n't do any more . Consider my day 's work . I left the ball about one o'clock , and from two till nine I enjoyed a little rest and blessed oblivion . At nine I was downstairs giving my dear boy his breakfast . Then I wrote letters  --  thirteen of them . Then there was luncheon to eat and dinner to order . Then the carriage comes round and off I go alone . The streets are muddy where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust anywhere else . This is London in the season . And there I am at last , after spending an hour and a half at the meeting of the patroness of the Charitable Eye and Ear Infirmary . WOOLCOTT. ( drily ) I did not know there was a charitable eye or ear in all London . How 's that ? ( shakes hands ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( rising , sweetly ) Evidently when we need a charitable tongue , we can import it from America . ( crossing to UNA L. ) RIORDAN . How 's that ? ( shakes hands ) WOOLCOTT. ( aside to RIORDAN ) I knew I should catch it . I always do . After two minutes ' talk with her , I am a regular Saint Sebastian , all stuck full of arrows like a pin-cushion . RIORDAN . There why do n't you keep out of range ? WOOLCOTT . I ca n't : she makes me miserable when I 'm here , and I make myself miserable when I 'm not here . She 's a true woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Now , Una , what are you going to wear to-night ? UNA . I have not quite made up my mind , aunt . I was thinking  --  ( glances at RIORDAN ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Why do you look at Mr. Riordan ? Do you think he is as great an authority on woman 's dress as he is on land tenure ? ( RIORDAN rises ) Let me look at you ! Blushing , I declare . Una , what is this ? RIORDAN. ( looking at his watch ) I must say good-bye , Mrs. Meredith ; I have an engagement this afternoon in the city  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Here  --  here  --  your city friends can wait . City people are rich enough to afford anything , even time , if they only thought so . Now , Una tell me  --  UNA. ( kisses her ) Oh , Aunt . ( hiding her face ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith So you have an engagement here , too , Mr. Riordan . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't listen to you for a moment . ( rise ) WOOLCOTT . I congratulate you , my dear fellow . ( shakes RIORDAN 'S hand ) I wonder if you will have the same opinion of Home Rule next year ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Now , you can go if you wish . I 've found out all I want to know , and you mus n't keep your rich friends waiting , and I 'm very glad , Una , and God bless you , dear , and I hope you may be very , very happy . UNA . Thank you , aunt . RIORDAN . I must go really , for my city appointment is a solid fact and not a lover 's fiction . UNA . I 'll go down stairs with you . I 'll be back directly , aunt . ( Exit UNA AND RIORDAN down stairs . ) WOOLCOTT. ( hums ) " There 's nothing half so sweet in life as love 's young dream ! " MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith It is a little too sweet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ? WOOLCOTT . I never fell in love till I came to England . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith That 's rather unpatriotic , is n't it ? I thought the American girls were so pretty . WOOLCOTT . I thought so myself , once  --  once ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith How is the gold mine ? Sold yet ? WOOLCOTT . Not yet . Your brother wo n't come to my terms , and I 'm afraid I ca n't come to his . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( laughing ) I never think of that gold mine without laughing at our dreadful game of cross purposes the first time I met you . Poor Mr. Riordan ! ( laugh ) I thought him the most mercenary patriot I had ever heard of . WOOLCOTT . And poor Mrs. Vandervast . For one brief half hour I thought I really understood Romeo . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Pooh ! Romeo was in love ! I have no sympathy with lovers . With you men , love is like the tide  --  when it reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with you women , love is like the moon that causes the tide  --  it has a new man every month . And yet , I have seen such a thing as a perfectly happy marriage . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Yes , there has to be one every now and then , like the great prize in a lottery , to encourage speculation . WOOLCOTT . When a woman gets a lover  --  oh , I 've watched lots of them  --  she likes to purr and play with him as a cat does with a mouse , letting him go for a while , just for the cruel pleasure of catching him back again . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I suppose in America , it is considered polite to liken a lady to an old cat . WOOLCOTT . She 's rather apt to get her back up if you do . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You Americans respect nothing  --  not even an old family tree . WOOLCOTT . Well , I 've noticed that an old family is often like an old tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith But you do respect the roast beef of Old England ? WOOLCOTT . I worship it , though it has come from Chicago . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Mr. Woolcott , when I told you I had met one of your Senators who ate with his knife , you bounced out of the room like a tornado . WOOLCOTT . Now , there 's one of your contracted insular ideas . You do n't know a tornado when you see one . What would be a mere spring zephyr in America , becomes a hurricane over here in this little island of yours . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Indeed ! And what would an American hurricane do in England ? WOOLCOTT . It would tear the island up by the roots , ma'am  --  blow it clean across the Atlantic and sink it in the Hudson river , where it would n't even prove an impediment to navigation . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And you Americans would be desolated , because you could n't come to London next year , having no Liverpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOOLCOTT . You 've an answer to everything , so give me one to this question : would n't you like to see America ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Do n't you think I can form a more favorable impression from listening to you and believing you  --  when I can . WOOLCOTT . When you can  --  But are n't you a little curious ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I ca n't say I am in that direction . WOOLCOTT . I thought all women were in every direction . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I confess that woman is the moat curious of all created beings  --  after a man . WOOLCOTT . Then you confess woman generally is after a man . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith That is only because the man is rude enough to go first . UNA. ( enters C. up-stairs ) Quarrelling as usual , you two . WOOLCOTT . It takes two to quarrel , and all I am doing is to suffer under my customary castigation . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Did n't you deserve it ? WOOLCOTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had as much as I can stand for one day . With your permission , I will stroll down to the river with a cigar . ( goes up stage . UNA crosses to table . MRS . M. comes down . To UNA ) May I beg you to tell your father that I am waiting to see him ? ( going ) UNA . I ca n't think what keeps him so long . WOOLCOTT. ( up C. ) Good afternoon , ladies . ( Exit C. downstairs L. ) UNA . Why are you so hard on poor Mr. Woolcott ? I like him rather . I think he is a rough diamond . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith That 's why I want to cut him . UNA . Gerald calls him " a white man " as they say in America . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( indifferently ) I thought they were either red men or black men , like the knaves in a pack of cards . UNA . He certainly seems fond of George , aunt . MRS . M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a point in his favor , but , then , who would n't be fond of that dear boy ? ( enter GEORGE C. upstairs L. ) Oh , George , what 's the matter with your hand ? GEORGE . Oh , nothing . Aunty , only a hot one at point . ( anxiously ) Have n't seen anything of a telegram for me , have you ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith It is important ? GEORGE . No  --  yes  --  it 's rather interesting to me . ( Enter WILSON from library L. ) WILSON . A telegram for you , Master George . ( GEORGE seizes it and tears it open , reads it at a glance and is greatly overcome ) WILSON . Any answer , sir ? GEORGE . No , no answer . ( exit WILSON C. downstairs ) Oh , what am I to do ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith What is it , George ? For pity 's sake , what is the matter ? UNA. ( picking up telegram ) " Bowled out . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . M. Mrs. Meredith Tell me the truth . What is the meaning of this ? GEORGE . Oh , aunty , if I could  --  if I only dared ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith My dear boy , I am your friend , if you have one in the world . Whatever your trouble , it will be made no lighter by concealment . Perhaps I may be able to help you . Shall I send Una away ? GEORGE . There is no need  --  and I ca n't tell you  --  you could n't help me  --  it is too much . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Is it a money trouble ? ( GEORGE nods ) Your father does n't know ? ( he shakes his head ) Now out with it , George  --  how much is it ? The whole truth , mind ! GEORGE . ( dismally ) It is about ten thousand pounds . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Ten thousand pounds ! UNA . Oh , George dear , how did you manage ? GEORGE . I knew it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone wretched as well as myself ? I ran behind about six months ago , aunty , and I 've been trying to make a little money on change , and everything went wrong  --  and now it 's come to this . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( resolutely ) To whom do you owe this money ? GEORGE . Sharp &; Selover , the stockbrokers . They 've been carrying the account for me , but unless it is made good to-morrow , they 'll take it to the Governor . UNA . Oh , George , papa will never forgive you ! GEORGE . Oh , if I were only out of this , just this once ! ( goes up R. ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I wonder if I went to my brother  --  UNA . It would be no use , aunt . He paid George 's debts once  --  a little insignificant sum compared to this  --  and he said if such a thing ever came to his knowledge again , he would wash his hands of George ; get him a clerkship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEORGE . And I know he meant it . If you had seen him  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I am afraid we shall have to manage it without your father , unless we make up our minds to see you go abroad  --  ( GEORGE goes to MRS . M. ) and I ca n't bear that , my boy . I wonder what is best to be done ? GEORGE . I think there 's nothing for me but to jump off Waterloo Bridge . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Do n't talk nonsense to me  --  I 'll see what can be done . GEORGE . But , if I do n't make good at Sharp &; Selover 's to-morrow  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith A great deal may be done before to-morrow . SIR E. Sir Everard ( without ) Wilson ! ( all rise quickly ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Here 's your father . Run away , children . I must speak to him alone . ( UNA and GEORGE exit into conservatory R. as SIR E. enters from library L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to you . SIR E. Sir Everard I have an appointment with Woolcott , and I 'm rather late . I thought I should find him here . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith He is about the place somewhere , but he said he was in no hurry . Ca n't you give me a minute ? My business is immediate . SIR E. Sir Everard ( seating himself ) Well , what is it ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I wanted to ask you about my money . SIR E. Sir Everard As your trustee . I am ready to answer all questions , though I do n't see that the matter is pressing . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You have thirty thousand pounds invested for me , have you not ? SIR E. Sir Everard Only about eighteen thousand at this moment , for I have twelve thousand pounds on hand which I shall re-invest at the first favorable opportunity . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Then there is no difficulty  --  I want ten thousand pounds immediately . SIR E. Sir Everard ( surprised ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think I can have understood you . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I spoke plainly enough . I want ten thousand pounds . SIR E. Sir Everard What do you want it for ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith That is my business . SIR E. Sir Everard ( firmly ) And it is mine also . I am your acting trustee , and responsible under my father 's will , and your marriage settlements to my co-trustees , and to my own conscience . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I am not a baby . SIR E. Sir Everard ( smiling ) Then , why not be business-like ? If you see an investment for the sum you mention , tell me , and if I approve , you shall have the money to-morrow morning . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I want it to-day . SIR E. Sir Everard Tut , tut , tut , that is quite absurd . You ask for ten thousand pounds as a girl asks for a shilling cab fare . You must know I can not give up the money in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) If I were to go to law about it , I presume you would have to pay it ? SIR E. Sir Everard If you were to pray for a dissolution of the trust , you possibly might succeed , unless you were adjudged a lunatic on my testimony as to this conversation . Ca n't you tell me what you want to do with the money ? It is your own , and I have no wish to withold it from you . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I can not tell you , and I do not think it is very gentlemanly of you to press a woman for a reason which she declines to give . SIR E. Sir Everard Tut , tut , tut , you ought to be able to see that my only aim is to do my duty . MRS . M.

You heard what he said about the river ? UNA . That 's only his talk . He could n't mean it . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You do not know what desperate things people do when they are in trouble . I feel as if I could commit a murder  --  or a marriage  --  for ten thousand pounds down this minute . And this has been harrassing the poor boy for nearly six months .

That Yankee will see I 've been crying . WOOLCOTT . Pardon , ladies , if I intrude , but Wilson told me Sir Everard was asking for me. ( seeing MRS .

It just sat back on its hind legs and howled . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( going R. ) And if you were as sharp as the East wind , Mr. Woolcott , we should probably find more point in your remarks . ( Exit into conservatory R. ) WOOLCOTT . Crushed again ! I 've riled her , have n't I , Miss Una ? I 'm always doing it , and never meaning it . ( UNA is going ) Do n't go ; I want to speak to you .

Oh , thanks , Mr. Woolcott , we 're in no trouble . ( UNA R. C. ) WOOLCOTT. ( sit L. C. ) Do n't dare to tell me that with your pretty eyes full of tears and your chin quivering like a shape of jelly . If I 'm meddlesome , say so . I do n't mean to be . You 've all been kind to me , and I 'm fond of you all ; and how far I would go to serve some members of this family wo n't be known till I 'm tried . UNA . Thank you , but I 'm afraid you can do nothing . We are in  --  a  --  little  --  trouble . ( sobs ) But , there 's no help for it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl . I 'm nearly old enough to be your father , and I have a shrewd guess as to part of this difficulty . I happened to see your brother George  --  fine young fellow that  --  and I like him  --  I saw him just now trying to write a letter that did n't seem any too easy to write . I come up here and find your aunt in tears . Now , two and two make four all the world over . The trouble is George 's trouble , and from what I know of the breed of young men , George 's trouble is money  --  UNA . But , even so , Mr. Woolcott  --  ( rises , goes R. ) WOOLCOTT . You do n't see how I can help you ? I do n't either . I am not rich , and even if I was , I suppose even the friendliest offer of money would be looked on in certain quarters  --  ( unconsciously glances R. ) as an insult . But , I 've known cases where a word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you a story , if you do n't mind listening , Miss Una . Sit down , wo n't you ? ( music . They sit on ottoman ) I had a brother  --  a good deal younger than I was  --  a fine , manly fellow . Oh , how proud I was of that boy , Miss Una . He went wrong ; he  --  he  --  got to speculating , and he used money he had no business to use . He was in a New York bank ; I was out West at the time . He did n't write to me  --  I do n't know why . God forgive me if I ever gave him reason to think that I would n't have stood by him in trouble . Somehow , he shrank from applying to me . Maybe he was ashamed . ( pause ) When he could n't hide his trouble any longer  --  he  --  he went to his room and put a bullet in his heart . Now , if he 'd had a friend to advise with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of facing that cruel pistol . That 's why I say good advice is sometimes better than dollars . I came on East and settled up with the bank . It left me poor , but I 've often been poor before then , and since , and I did n't mind that . But , I had lost my brother . UNA. ( putting out hand ) And George talked just in that way , and aunt seemed to fear  --  oh ! ( breaks off in tears , rising ) WOOLCOTT. ( consoling her ) Perhaps out of my own bitter experience I can find good counsel for your brother . UNA . If you only could . He is so young ! He has been foolish , but then papa is so severe . He has been speculating , Mr. Woolcott , and he has lost ten thousand pounds . WOOLCOTT . Ten thousand pounds ! Holy Moses , what has he been doing ? ( walks R. then back again ) UNA . It 's awful , is n't it ? It seems criminal , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our enemy , is only a trifling error in a friend . All these things are comparative . UNA . It would seem terrible in papa 's eyes . He is so rigidly exact in business . WOOLCOTT . No doubt . The morality of a man who has n't been tempted is n't a virtue , it is only a hypothesis . I will see George and talk to him . If he has sound advice , he wo n't do anything rash . He has wealthy friends who would be willing to help him . Now , go to your aunt , but do n't tell her what I have been talking to you about . Just you take heart  --  and trust the Yankee . UNA . But we need ten thousand pounds to-morrow . WOOLCOTT . Well , you shall have ten thousand pounds to-morrow . ( enter SIR E. from library L. ) Leave me now : I have a little matter of business to discuss with your father . ( pushes UNA off R. , meeting SIR E. ) SIR E. Sir Everard I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been pleasantly employed . SIR E. Sir Everard ( sitting down ) Now , about this mine of yours . Sir William Butler and I have all the arrangements made for incorporation , and  --  WOOLCOTT . I do n't want to have anything to do with companies , Sir Everard . My mine is for sale . SIR E. Sir Everard At the old figure ? WOOLCOTT . At the old figure . SIR E. Sir Everard That is out of the question . Why not take part cash and part in shares of the company ? WOOLCOTT . Because I have had bad luck with shares . I helped to build the Sierra Nevada Central and it came near ruining me . SIR E. Sir Everard What was the matter ? Did n't the stock go up ? WOOLCOTT . No , but the company did . SIR E. Sir Everard I thought all but the narrow gauge roads in America earned good dividends . What gauge was it ? WOOLCOTT . Mortgage principally . Why , that road could have earned good dividends from the freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling stock enough to carry them all . SIR E. Sir Everard Where did it run ? WOOLCOTT . Into debt , and then , it went into the hands of a receiver . SIR E. Sir Everard Was it well equipped  --  steel rails and so forth ? WOOLCOTT . Well , I hardly think he 'd steal rails , but he 'd steal most anything else . In a railroad a receiver 's worse than a thief . SIR E. Sir Everard An unfortunate experience . WOOLCOTT . That 's why I want cash down on the nail . Now , will you give me the twenty thousand pounds I ask ? SIR E. Sir Everard As I have told you , that is a prohibitive price . WOOLCOTT . Well , I have been thinking the matter over , and I 've concluded to take the fifteen thousand pounds you offered me . SIR E. Sir Everard ( aside ) He is pushed for money . ( aloud ) When did I offer you fifteen thousand pounds ? WOOLCOTT . Two weeks ago . SIR E. Sir Everard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mine has n't moved since  --  it is just as good as ever . SIR E. Sir Everard You declined my offer then and now I have reconsidered it . I have not that amount of cash to spare . If you would take shares  --  ( WOOLCOTT shakes his head ) then , the extreme sum I could offer would be ten thousand pounds . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) The old Shylock ! Does he read my heart , that he tempts me with the very sum ? SIR E. Sir Everard You see , the risk is all mine . WOOLCOTT . You mean that the mine is all risk , but it is n't . And no man in England knows better what that property is worth than you do , Sir Everard Foxwood . SIR E. Sir Everard And I offer you 10,000 . Take it or leave it . It is my final offer . I have plenty of other use for ten thousand pounds WOOLCOTT. ( after a struggle , rising ) I 've pledged my word to that little girl ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everard Well , all the examinations of the property have been completed : the papers have been drawn up ; nothing remains but to settle the terms of payment . Shall we say four payments , extending over  --  WOOLCOTT . We will say one payment , extending over the next twenty-four hours . Cash down , Sir Everard , or no deal . SIR E. Sir Everard Then you are pressed for funds ? WOOLCOTT . That 's my business . If you want that mine , you must press yourself to pay me 10,000 before 12 to-morrow . SIR E. Sir Everard There will be no trouble about that . I 'll give you my check to-day , if you 'll step into my study , and sign a memorandum of agreement , or you can have the money in notes to-morrow morning . WOOLCOTT . Your check is good enough for me . SIR E. Sir Everard Then the matter is settled . WOOLCOTT . Settled . I wo n't go back on my word , and I 'll be at your office by ten to-morrow morning ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . SIR E. Sir Everard I need not say I will not go back on my word , as you phrase it . ( Exit L. to library . ) WOOLCOTT . No , indeed , you need not say it . You 've got a good thing . Sir Everard Foxwood , and you know it ; you 'll waltz up with your little ten thousand to-morrow , never fear . The money will square the boy and make his aunt happy . It 'll break me , though . Well , I 've been broke before . I 'll take the first chance that offers ; one can never tell where any road may lead to now-a-days ; and as for that ten thousand  --  the widow 's worth it  --  every dollar of it , to say nothing of a boy 's life . ( Enter GEORGE C. with letter in his hand . ) GEORGE . Mr. Woolcott , have you seen aunt ? WOOLCOTT . I have , and your sister . George , my boy , I know all about that trouble you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? GEORGE . Oh , Mr. Woolcott , it 's awful ! If It comes to the Governor 's ears , there 'll be the devil to pay ! WOOLCOTT . And he 's a creditor who always insists on his money . GEORGE . ( R. C. ) If my Governor was like any other fellow 's Governor  --  WOOLCOTT . I know  --  I know . When a man makes a fool of himself he always likes to think it was some other man 's fault . GEORGE . I do n't mean it 's his fault ; it 's my fault . WOOLCOTT . That 's good , that 's honest ! GEORGE . But , you see , I hate to tell him anything about it . His principles are so good  --  WOOLCOTT . That he hates to wear them out by practice . See here , George ! ( turns GEORGE around so that he faces him , puts other hand on shoulder so they are face to face this speech ) I 'd like to help you  --  I want to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , there are more dollars in this world , than there are boys  --  though some people do n't seem to think so , and when it comes to a question of who 's going to the devil  --  a few dollars or a boy of the right sort  --  I say let the dollars slide every time . I think a good deal of you . You remind me of a brother I had once  --  he 's gone now  --  and I like you for his sake and for your own . You need not tell the Guv'nor , as you call him , for the money will be forthcoming to-morroy morning . GEORGE . The money will be forthcoming ! How  --  where ? WOOLCOTT . Did you think you had no friends ? GEORGE . ( puzzled ) I have you and Mr. Riordan . WOOLCOTT . And we have friends . You may regard the money as a loan from us , if you like , to be repaid when you can . We 'll raise it for you amongst us . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll see if they are any use at a pinch . You shall have the money to-morrow . But , do n't breathe a word to anyone , not to your sister , nor above all to your aunt , that I have anything to do with the matter . Promise ! GEORGE . Certainly I promise if you wish , but I must tell them something . WOOLCOTT . Tell them anything that comes into your head , but do n't mention me . Hush , here she comes ! GEORGE . All right ! ( Enter MRS . M. and UNA R. ) ( WOOLCOTT L. , sees MRS . M. and UNA approaching , motions GEORGE to hush and points to where they are coming and goes L. to table ; busy picking up books . GEORGE runs up and meets them and down R. C. ) GEORGE . Oh , Aunt , it 's all settled  --  I shall have the money before 12 to-morrow . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith My dearest boy , how ? But , take care , George ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( whistle ) Mr. Woolcott knows all about it . That is  --  he  --  he  --  UNA . Aunt , I did confide our trouble to Mr. Woolcott . He spoke so kindly to me about it , I could n't help it . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I am afraid it can hardly have been amusing to Mr. Woolcott . But , this is excellent news , George . Tell me all about it . ( GEORGE looks at WOOLCOTT . WOOLCOTT looks round , catches GEORGE 'S eye . ) GEORGE . By and by , aunt . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith The fact is enough for me . The details will keep . I declare , I could dance for joy . Mr. Woolcott , could n't you do an American dance for me , a scalp dance , for instance ? WOOLCOTT . You have tied me to the stake , and it is n't the captive who does the dancing in my country . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I have something else to attend to just now , so I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Una ; come , George . ( Exit C. with UNA and GEORGE . ) WOOLCOTT. ( watching them off ) I 'm afraid I 'm a little further away from her than ever , now . I 'm a poor man again . Pshaw ! What difference does it make ? A man does n't get perceptibly further away from the moon by tumbling into a well . But , empty pockets are a great bar to conversation . ( Enter SIR E. L. from library . ) SIR E. Sir Everard Oh , here you are still , Woolcott . By the way , you promised to dine with me in a quiet way , one of these days  --  ( patting WOOLCOTT on shoulders with both hands ) why not make it this evening ? WOOLCOTT . ( R. ) You are very kind . SIR E. Sir Everard ( L. , in laughing tone ) I have a weakness for entertaining capitalists . You know you are a capitalist , or will be to-morrow . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) Yes , for about a minute . SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your company ? ( stately manner ) WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) I could see her again . ( hesitating ) And yet  --  but I have n't strength to refuse . ( aloud ) I accept with pleasure , Sir Everard . ( going ) SIR E. Sir Everard By the bye , I should like that assignment to be made to my clerk , Julius Krebs ; it will stand in his name till the company is formed . WOOLCOTT . It makes no odds to me who has the mine , so long as I have to part with it . ( aside ) But I wonder what this little game is ! I guess he 's putting up a job on the company . He 's a beauty . SIR E. Sir Everard And if I can aid you with any advice as to the investment of your ten thousand pounds  --  command me . WOOLCOTT . Thank you . Sir Everard , it is invested . SIR E. Sir Everard Invested ? WOOLCOTT . I mean it 's forestalled . It is spent already . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sudden change of manner ) Really , that is deplorable . I am most pained to hear it . You must have squandered money shamefully . WOOLCOTT . What I have done , Sir Everard , is my own affair and I require no remarks about it . SIR E. Sir Everard ( patronizingly ) If you are really destitute , Woolcott , perhaps I could find you something to do . How would you like to go to Palestine ? WOOLCOTT . It does n't much matter where I go . Any money in it ? SIR E. Sir Everard I am about to send out a special agent to report on the works of the Bitumen Company . I will give you two hundred pounds a year , and traveling expenses . WOOLCOTT . You are very good . Give me time to think that over . SIR E. Sir Everard ( patronizingly ) There is no hurry . Let me know your decision when you come to my office to-morrow . Good afternoon . ( Exit C. downstairs L. ) WOOLCOTT. ( alone , shakes his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I 'd sooner work for him in Palestine than here . If I get to work at once , I sha n't have time to worry . I 'll take the job . Here I am , forty years of age , in fair health and sound normal condition  --  and broke  --  dead broke  --  in a foreign country , three thousand miles from home  --  and without a friend to give me a lift . ( WILSON enters C. upstairs L. ) WILSON . Sir Everard 's compliments , sir , and he begs you will excuse him from that appointment this evening , as he had forgotten a previous engagement . WOOLCOTT. ( surprised ) That appointment this evening ? Oh , the dinner . ( drily ) Tell Sir Everard I will excuse him  --  with pleasure . ( WILSON bows and exits ) I did n't think he was quite as mean as that , but misfortune makes a vacuum about a man which human nature does not abhor  --  just as though bad luck was catching . ( drops into seat C. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ? " Pleasant Fourth of July ! " Well , I 've had it  --  great Scott , I 've had it . ( taking flower from button-hole and looking at it ) But if it was to do over again , I 'd do it . CURTAIN . ACT III . SCENE : Same as last set . Afternoon of the following day , July 5th . DISCOVERED : At rise of curtain , MRS . MEREDITH and UNA enter R. from conservatory . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith But , I do n't understand it at all , Una . I had no idea Mr. Riordan was so wealthy . UNA . He is n't at all wealthy . He 's just as poor as he can be . Of course , he did n't give George the money himself . He merely managed it . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith How did the 10,000 reach him ? If we know that , it might afford some clue to his benefactor . UNA . George was to go the first thing this morning to Sharp and Selover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain there till it came . He did as he was told and a little before 12 o'clock , a commissioner brought a sealed packet , containing ten thousand pounds in Bank of England notes . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And who was it that told George to go to the stockbroker 's and to wait for the money ? UNA . That 's just what he wo n't tell , and he hinted something about Gerald . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I suppose it can not be anyone else . RIORDAN. ( without ) Ladies upstairs ? All right  --  you need n't announce me . UNA . There he is now . ( runs across and exits C. ) ( Re-enter UNA C. , dragging on RIORDAN . ) UNA . Here he is , Aunt . Now he shall tell us all about it . Oh , Gerald , I am proud of you ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith My dear Gerald , for you must allow me to give you brevet rank as nephew , and call you so  --  I hardly know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to thank you for what you have done , or to admire in silence . RIORDAN . You are too kind , and if I were only sure you were not laughing at me  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I see nothing to laugh at . It was nobly done , Gerald , it was bravely done , and it was like a gentleman . RIORDAN . Really ! You overpower me ! I had no idea you would take so much interest in my little attempt . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Scarcely anything in my whole life has interested me so much . UNA . It was splendid , generous , admirable ! Oh ; Gerald , I am proud of you . RIORDAN . I am very glad that my first effort in the cause of suffering humanity finds such warm appreciation in the quarter where I value it most . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Who should appreciate it , if we do not ? And when I remember on whose behalf the effort was made  --  RIORDAN. ( surprised ) I thought they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Mrs. Meredith They ! Who ? RIORDAN . The Irish tenants . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith What has put the Irish tenants into your head just now ? RIORDAN . We have been talking about them all this time , have n't we ? It was on their behalf I made the effort , which you were pleased to rate so highly . They were the text of my speech last night . UNA . And a very good speech it was , Gerald . I will compliment you upon it presently . But , just now we are so full of what you have done for George  --  RIORDAN . And pray , what have I done for George ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Have n't you advanced him ten thousand pounds ? RIORDAN ( astonished ) No ! I wish I had ten thousand pounds , or the tenth part of it . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Have n't you helped him to close his account with Sharp and Selover , and to keep his losses from his father ? RIORDAN . I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any help or had any loss . MRS M. Mrs. Meredith Strange ! RIORDAN . It is strange , indeed , and you puzzle me entirely . I do n't know what you are driving at . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Yesterday George was in trouble about a speculation and he had to find ten thousand pounds to-day . I tried to raise the money for him and failed . Some unknown friend had found the money for him to-day . RIORDAN . This is most wonderful ! Faith , he was a friend indeed . I 'll borrow him when you are done with him . UNA . Oh , Gerald , I thought it was you . I wish it had been . RIORDAN . So do I , with all my heart . But in the name of common sense , how came you to pitch upon me  --  an out at elbows Irishman  --  as George 's fairy godmother ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I do not know exactly . Una seemed to have it all cut and dried that it should be no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciously . But , if it was n't you  --  RIORDAN . And I give you my word of honor it was not ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Who could it have been ? RIORDAN . Could his father  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith His father knew nothing of the matter . And it was our great object to keep all knowledge of it from him . RIORDAN . The money must have come from somewhere . It does n't snow Bank of England notes in July . Perhaps Sir Everard wished to help the boy out of his scrape without taking any official cognizance of his embarrassment . UNA . That 's not a bit like papa . RIORDAN . I 'm afraid he is not the man to spend ten thousand pounds without an equivalent of some sort , even if he had to take out the value of it in blowing the boy up . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith So the identity of George 's benefactor is a mystery still . ( Enter WILSON C. upstairs L. ) WILSON . I beg your pardon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Ask him to come up . ( exit WILSON ) I suppose his wife has returned . UNA . She was to have arrived last night , so he told me . RIORDAN. ( whispering ) I say , Una , ca n't I have a chance for a word to you alone ? Wo n't you come into the conservatory ? UNA. ( crosses L. ) Presently , presently . Just now , I 'm not at all pleased with you . RIORDAN . Why not ? Because I have n't done something you thought I did . UNA . No , I 'm sure you would have done that if you could . RIORDAN . Well , then  --  UNA . Well , there is something else in which your conduct was not at all satisfactory . ( crossing L. and sitting L. of table L. ) ( RIORDAN follows her and kneels on chair R. of table , talking across to her in pantomime as MRS . M. and KREBS down R. UNA shows that she is much annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Enter KREBS C. upstairs L. ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I am very glad to see you , Mr. Krebs . How is your wife ? KREBS . She arrived last night  --  so well , so strong , so much improved . Madam , I can never thank you enough for all you have done for us . Her winter in the South of France has renewed her life . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( crosses R , sits ) Indeed , I am glad to hear she has benefited by it . I will call and see her to-morrow . KREBS . It is too much kindness  --  too much honor . If you will say at what time you will be disengaged , she will wait upon you , and offer you her thanks in person . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Nonsense , she is an invalid  --  KREBS . She is an invalid no longer , thanks to your bounty , Madam . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith She is the latest arrival at any rate , and I shall take the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Change Alley , Madam . He has had a busy day . He has just concluded the purchase of the American gentleman 's mine . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You surprise me , for Mr. Woolcott told me no later than yesterday that there was no likelihood of their agreeing on a price . He said he could not accept the terms my brother offered . KREBS . He has accepted less . He has sold to Sir Everard  --  or rather to me , who act in the matter as Sir Everard 's agent  --  for ten thousand pounds ; five thousand less than the first offer , which he refused . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith This is very curious ! I wonder why he should do that ? KREBS . He had sudden and pressing need of 10,000 , I think , Madam . At last , he insisted that it should be paid over in cash before noon to-day . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( wondering ) Ten thousand pounds in cash , before noon to-day . ( continues to converse ) RIORDAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in love with another girl . RIORDAN . But I 'm not . UNA . That 's what you said in your dream . RIORDAN . I 'm in love with you . UNA . That 's what you said in your dream . RIORDAN . Well ? UNA . But , I saw her so distinctly . RIORDAN . Who ? UNA . The other girl . A sallow-doll-faced thing she was too , not at all pretty  --  and she wore imitation lace . RIORDAN . And you saw all this in the dream ? UNA . Yes . RIORDAN . I 'm sure I never did the like of that to her . ( kisses UNA ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And you say Master George ca n't tell from what source the money came . KREBS . He either can not or will not . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I think I am on the threshold of the secret ( pauses ) How was the money paid to Mr. Woolcott ? KREBS . In 1,000 Bank of England notes . MRS . M. Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krebs , I have a favor to ask of you . KREBS . Of me , Madam ? You know you have only to name it . WILSON . ( entering ) Mrs. Vandervast ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Do not say I am at home , Wilson . Una , my dear , you must receive her . Beg Mrs. Vandervast to step upstairs , Wilson . ( exit WILSON as MRS . M. crosses L. ) Come into the library a moment , Mr. Krebs . UNA . But , aunt  --  MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I can not be interrupted , Una . I am engaged on most important business . ( exit L. into library with KREBS ) UNA . Now , is n't this too provoking ! RIORDAN . She is determined that our love making shall have as many crosses as Juliet 's own . ( Enter MRS . VANDERVAST . ) MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Ah , how do you do , my dear ? RIORDAN . " Here comes the lady ! " Welcome fair and ever fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Mercuito , is that you again ? Whenever I call here I seem always to find you . No matter , I am glad to have an opportunity of congratulating you . You are a noble , generous man . Mr. Riordan , you have a great and feeling heart , sir , and I could kiss you for it . RIORDAN . I assure you , it has been all a mistake , Mrs. Vandervast ! I have been getting credit under false pretenses about that  --  MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast ( surprised ) Under false pretenses ? And did n't you really make that speech which I read in to-day 's paper ? RIORDAN . Oh , the speech ! Faith , I had forgotten all about it . ( aside to UNA ) I thought she was off after that ten thousand pounds like the rest of them  --  MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast You should not have forgotten it , sir , for it was a speech that should be remembered . It recalled to me all that my father was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery orators of your native land . RIORDAN . You are very kind to say so , Mrs. Vandervast . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast You deserve it . You have a career before you , young man , and if you do not mar it at the outset by an imprudent marriage  --  ah , that reminds me , you were about to apply the touchstone to your fate when I saw you last  --  to choose the casket  --  you have done so  --  and how have you sped in your wooing ? RIORDAN . I chose the leaden casket , and I found in it the portrait of the lady I have been wearing in my heart . I offered her the heart  --  and she gave me her hand in exchange . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast I hope I may have the pleasure of meeting the bride soon . RIORDAN . You have met her to-day here . ( crosses R. ) ( Gives his hand to UNA who curtseys shyly . ) MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Una , is it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose she regards herself as grown up now . Dear me ! Dear me ! How old we grow ! It seems but yesterday I was at her mother 's wedding . Well , dear , ( crosses to UNA . I hope you may be happy . You have an old woman 's heartfelt good wishes that every blessing may attend both of you . ( gives hand to each ) ' T is the union of Cordelia and Mercuito . UNA . Thank you , dear Mrs. Vandervast . RIORDAN . I will do my best that your kind wish may be fulfilled . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast And when is it to be ? Ah , you rogue , you were making love to her over my shoulder all the while I was here yesterday . I might have mistrusted something . UNA . It is all very new as yet . The day has not been decided upon . RIORDAN . But it will be soon . UNA . Indeed . sir , how do you know that ? MRS . VAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early day . Why you have no reason to delay  --  Juliet went to Friar Lawrence 's cell . UNA . And now Mrs. Vandervast I want you to give me your advise upon a subject of the highest importance , on which no one 's opinion could be more valuable than yours . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast You are entirely welcome to it , my dear , whatever it may be worth . UNA . Of course , I shall be married in white . Now , I want your advice whether to be dressed as Sappho or as one of the Vestal Virgins  --  I ca n't make up my mind which . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Which of the Vestal Virgins ? The costumes are all alike , are n't they ? UNA . No , you do n't understand , as any of them , or as Sappho . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast I ca n't say , my dear . I never played the part .

I came right up , Miss Una , because I have not much time to waste , and I thought I would not spend it on the stairs . I 'm going away to-morrow morning . RIORDAN . Back to the States ? WOOLCOTT . No , I 'm going to Palestine . UNA . To-morrow ? WOOLCOTT . I should have gone to-night , only I thought I 'd take an evening to look in and say good-bye to you all . UNA .

WOOLCOTT . Thank you , I 'm sure to enjoy myself , it will be uncommonly pleasant . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast Palestine is so full of interesting associations . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) And Bitumen . MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast I know that most Americans consider that they have n't made the grand tour complete till they have , as they say , taken in the Holy Land . WOOLCOTT . If all I hear is true , the part of the Holy Land I am going to has taken in a good many people first and last . UNA . My father is in the City , Mr. Woolcott , but I am sure he would wish to see you before you go . WOOLCOTT. ( dryly ) Thank you , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change Alley .

Run down and tell him I must see him instantly  --  instantly . GEORGE . Aunty , you are not going to blow on a fellow ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Silly boy , have n't I fretted myself gray-haired to keep your secret from him . Tell him I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . M. sits again C. ) I do not know much about business and its methods and usages , it is true , but the more I think of what Everard has done , the worse it appears . ( Enter SIR EVERARD . Coming down L. ) SIR E. Sir Everard George tells me you want to speak to me , Florence . What is it now ? Another ten thousand pounds , eh ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Yes , Everard , it is another ten thousand pounds . I hear you have bought Mr. Woolcott 's gold mine . SIR E. Sir Everard I have  --  and a very profitable day 's work it was . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith No doubt . And will you tell me why you bought the mine under another man 's name ? SIR E. Sir Everard It was a technicality of business , which you would not understand if I tried to explain . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I am afraid I understand without your telling me . You did it to make money out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everard Florence ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I know the details of the whole transaction  --  how , Mr. Woolcott asked you twenty thousand pounds for his mine , and how you offered him fifteen thousand pounds , though you had all your plans made for making it over to the company at twenty-five thousand pounds , and when you found Mr. Woolcott was pressed for ready money , you meanly dropped your offer to ten thousand pounds ! SIR E. Sir Everard ( with dignity ) Tut  --  tut  --  tut  --  Florence . You are taking a tone with me that I do not like and will not submit to . But I excuse you , for you are a woman and you evidently do not in the least understand what you are talking about . The whole affair is a strictly legitimate business transaction and such as any man in the City would gladly avail himself of , were the opportunity offered . It is rarely so profitable a chance arises , though , and I flatter myself that there are few who could handle the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Meredith ( C. ) You expect the transaction to be very profitable , do you ? SIR E. Sir Everard ( smiling with satisfaction ) By that one-half hour 's work , I hope to make fifteen thousand pounds . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Scarcely so much , I think . SIR E. Sir Everard At the very least ten thousand pounds . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You will not make ten thousand pence . SIR E. Sir Everard The Yankee has n't cheated me about the yield of gold , has he ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Oh no , he has n't cheated you . SIR E. Sir Everard I do not think he could , for I took every precaution . I had the mine carefully examined , and the expert reported that it was well worth that which Woolcott asked originally , and I have got it for half his first figure . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You have n't got it yet ? SIR E. Sir Everard It is mine , at least , I can have it when I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Mrs. Meredith ( strong ) It is not yours . You can not have it when you want it , and Krebs does not hold it . SIR E. Sir Everard ( alarmed ) What do you mean ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Krebs has parted with it . SIR E. Sir Everard ( excitedly ) Do you dare to tell me that the scoundrel has been bold enough to play a trick on me ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Who began playing tricks first ? SIR E. Sir Everard Answer me ! I insist on your telling me all you know . Answer me ! Krebs has disposed of the mine ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Yes . SIR E. Sir Everard ( choking with rage ) The thief ! The villain ! I 'll have him arrested at once . I 'll put him in the dock ! I 'll have him transported . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You did n't mean him to keep it for himself , did you ? SIR E. Sir Everard ( walking about ) I can not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingratitude  --  a man who has been a pensioner on my bounty for years . He is worse than a dog to turn on the hand that fed him . ( coming to MRS . M. ) Say , it is not true ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith But it is true . SIR E. Sir Everard It is impossible . He has had no opportunity . When could he have disposed of it ? Where ?  --  to whom ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( strong ) This very day  --  in this very house  --  to me ? SIR E. Sir Everard ( profoundly astonished ) To you ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith To me . SIR E. Sir Everard To you ? And pray what can you do with a gold mine ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I can restore it to the rightful owner . SIR E. Sir Everard You are not going to give it back to the Yankee ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I am . SIR E. Sir Everard But I have bought it from him . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need not be afraid that you shall lose anything . I stand ready to pay you what you gave for it . ( crosses L. ) SIR E. Sir Everard ( baffled ) But I expected to make a profit of fifteen thousand pounds . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Great expectations are their own reward sometimes . SIR E. Sir Everard ( coaxing ) Come , come . Florence , I am your brother , your only brother . I have been a father to you all your life . Now , I come to ask a favor  --  let me have that mine . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I shall give it back to the man from whom you conveyed it . SIR E. Sir Everard And you would rob your brother to enrich a stranger  --  a man for whom you care nothing . Eh  --  what ? ( looks at her keenly ) You color . You do care for him ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Everard ! SIR E. Sir Everard That 's it , is it ? I see it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You love this Woolcott . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You have no right to speak to me so . SIR E. Sir Everard And you are willing to rob me to enrich this Yankee adventurer who has got round you with his glib tongue . Viscount Hathway 's daughter-in-law is looking high for her number two . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( rising indignantly ) I am ashamed of you . And I refuse to listen to you any longer . ( starts to go , crosses R. ) SIR E. Sir Everard ( seizes her hand ) Stop ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Take care , Everard , you hurt me . SIR E. Sir Everard This is no child 's play . I will prevent this villainy if I can . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You hurt me . SIR E. Sir Everard ( releasing her hand ) Answer me now . How do you know the deed has been made out in proper form ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith It was made out on the blank form prepared under your own directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Mrs. Meredith Wilson witnessed it . SIR E. Sir Everard I will discharge him  --  him  --  Krebs  --  and everyone who has had anything to do with this . Where is this assignment ? Let me see it . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Mr. Krebs has taken it with him to have it registered . SIR E. Sir Everard Well , Madam , I shall see if there is any law in England to reach this case . I think Parliament in its wisdom has framed some statutes to cover conspiracy and the subordination of servants . ( exit L. into library , slamming door ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( looking after him ) And this is my brother ! Touched in his pocket  --  his most sensitive point , it seems , his true self stands revealed . And I have misjudged the American as much as I have misjudged Everard . And we might have been good friends now , but for my silly fancy for sharpening my wit on his shoulder . ( Sinks into chair at door of conservatory R. , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily enough , but if I had known his real value , I should have not kept him from me by idle words . ( musing ) And yet , George says  --  WOOLCOTT. ( entering C. and coming down L. ) Great Scott . I ca n't stand any more of that . Congratulations and felicitations as if I were starting out on a wedding trip , and not a poor devil of a commercial traveler in Bitumen , for , as I can see that is about my position . And I ca n't bear to tell them truth , for that would involve a lot of explanations , and if there is one thing that would rile my present temper more than another it would be to explain Yet , I 'd like to see Mrs. Meredith to say good-bye . Maybe it 's just as well I should n't see her . I might say move than I could take back  --  ( sits C. ) for when I 'm talking to her , my heart 's in my mouth , and some fine day it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place indeed . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I wonder where he is ? I wonder whether he ever thinks of me when he is away from me , as I am thinking of him now ? I suppose he is busy making ready to return to America now that he has sold his mine . WOOLCOTT. ( on sofa , finding fan ) Her fan ! The very one she held in her hand the night I saw her first , here in this room , nearly five months ago . Gracious , how time flies ! I see her now as she stood before me that night , laughing at my blunder . And she has been laughing at me ever since , and I have come back again and again to be laughed at . Why , I 'd sooner see her laugh at me than any other woman smile on me . I wonder if she ever knew what was deep down in my heart when I had a light jest on the tip of my tongue ? Women are quick to see when they have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool of myself , and she is not like other women . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( rising ) I can not bear to think of it all . ( sees WOOLCOTT ) Why , there he is ! When did he come in ? How long has he been here ? WOOLCOTT . I 'm glad I found this fan ! I shall keep it . She has my heart and she will not grudge me this in exchange . I shall need a fan in Palestine , they say the climate 's rather warm there . I 'll keep this . ( kisses it and puts it in breast ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( aside ) He kissed my fan , then  --  ( pauses , then aloud ) So you are there , Mr. Woolcott. ( coming down R. ) WOOLCOTT. ( springing up startled ; L. C. , puts fan in pocket , corner out ) Of course  --  of course . I  --  how do you do ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( R. C. ) You have my fan I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have your fan . I found it here . I thought I 'd take care of it for you . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You are very kind . I 'll take it if you wish ( holds out her hand ) ( WOOLCOTT kisses the hand she holds out as he restores the fan . ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Mr. Woolcott ! WOOLCOTT . Do not be angry , Mrs. Meredith . I have only come to say good-bye and the occasion seemed to me to demand a little more than the usual shake of the hand . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I supposed you would be going now . I hear you have sold the gold mine . WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) Damn that gold mine ! ( aloud ) Oh , yes , it 's sold . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And am I to congratulate you ? WOOLCOTT . You may suit yourself about that . Personally I 'd rather you did not . I 've had rather more of that kind of thing than I can stand . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when do you return to America ? WOOLCOTT . I do n't return to America at all  --  at least , not at present . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith No ? But I thought you said you came to say good-bye . WOOLCOTT . America is n't the only place in the world , though a good many folks over there think so . No , I 'm going to Palestine . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( interested ) To Palestine ? WOOLCOTT . Now . for Heaven 's sake , please do not wish me a pleasant trip , and congratulate me on my certain enjoyment of the associations of the Holy Land , for I ca n't stand that either . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith May I ask what takes you to Palestine , for I 'm sure it is n't pleasure ? WOOLCOTT . It 's business  --  bread and butter in fact , and mighty little of the butter . Never mind about that ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Why need you go now ? WOOLCOTT . Because  --  because I must MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season is not over yet ? WOOLCOTT . The season has no pleasure for me  --  now . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( aside ) Poor fellow ! ( aloud ) But , if you sold the mine  --  a gold mine too  --  for a fair price  --  WOOLCOTT. ( seriously ) Pray do not press that , Mrs. Meredith . I 've had ups and downs in my life , mostly downs , and this is one of them . I parted with the price of the mine before I had it . I can carry off my poverty with a smile before the others , but somehow , before you , I  --  I  --  ( MRS . M. puts out her hand , he seizes it and shakes it . ) You did that as though you were really sorry for me . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And would that surprise you ? WOOLCOTT . I confess , it would a little . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Do n't you think I can be a sincere friend ? WOOLCOTT . Why not ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Meredith You do n't take to heart all I say , do you ? WOOLCOTT . Do n't I ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Whatever you may think of me , I know you are a staunch friend , for I have tried you and you were not found wanting . You guard your secret well  --  but I know it . WOOLCOTT. ( suddenly ) Who told you ? ( pauses ) I mean to say , that I have no secrets . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I know why you sold your mine . I know to whom you sold it , and the price he paid  --  the shamefully inadequate price . I would like to apologize for my brother , if I knew how to do it , but  --  WOOLCOTT . Stop ! Hold your horses ! Do n't say a word about him ! He drove a hard bargain , but  --  he did more than his bond called for  --  he 's given me a situation . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith What do you mean ? WOOLCOTT . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred pounds a year to go to South Palestine to see what has become of the Bitumen which ought to be there . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith And that is why you leave us ? WOOLCOTT . Why , certainly . I 'm out of money and out of a job . Sir Everard offers me work  --  why should n't I take it ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You must not go ! WOOLCOTT . Oh , yes , I must  --  now more than ever . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( after a pause and shyly ) But , I have asked you to stay  --  WOOLCOTT . Great Scott ! Do you want to make me speak whether I will or not ? Do you want another scalp to hang at the door of your wigwam ? All right , you can have mine . And I 'm not sorry to have a chance to tell you all that 's in my heart before I go away . I love you , do n't jump !  --  and I have loved you ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , but I could n't help loving you . I have gone on loving more and more even when we were exchanging hard words . I set myself as a target for your jibes just that I might hear the sound of your voice , and feast my eyes with a sight of your face . Now the murder 's out , and you can turn me away as soon as you please . ( Pauses . MRS . MEREDITH sits silently , with downcast eyes . ) You do not dismiss me at once . Then , I 'll go on to the end . I 'm a poor man now , I 'm dead broke  --  the only wealth I have in the world is my love for you , and it 's all I have to offer you . Will you take it ? Will you be my wife , Florence ? MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith ( turns to him , raising her eyes and hands to his ) Yes . WOOLCOTT. ( pulling her up , embrace and kiss ) This is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Someone might come in  --  and just fancy two old people like us  --  WOOLCOTT . Do n't fret ! I feel like a boy of twenty  --  and you look younger than your niece . Let me gaze at you again , a man likes to survey his property . Well , after all , I struck a streak of luck when I found that mine  --  for it led me to you , and if I have n't the gold mine , I have you . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You have me , and I have the gold mine . WOOLCOTT . What ! MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith I bought it from Julius Krebs at the same price my brother gave for it . You can have it back again . WOOLCOTT . What is the odds , my dear ? It 'll be all in the family . I 'll never part with it again . It would be flying in the face of good luck . We 'll work it ourselves . ( Enter UNA and RIORDAN upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling her dress and down L. ) RIORDAN . I 'm with you . UNA . Oh , aunt ! Stop , Gerald , pulling back is n't fair ! ( WOOLCOTT about to kiss MRS . M. , head , turns , sees RIORDAN , kick up stage . ) MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith What have you done with Mrs. Vandervast ? UNA. ( all out of breath , crosses to L. C. ) Oh , she 's coming . We ran on because we had a question for you to settle , and we both wanted to get here first . RIORDAN. ( out of breath , same bus . ) Una says  --  UNA . No , Gerald says  --  WOOLCOTT . In fact , you both say  --  UNA . Gerald pretends that we can get married this season , and I tell him it is ridiculously too soon . What do you think ? WOOLCOTT. ( aside ) Say this season , and soon too . for , of course , we 'll have to make a double wedding of it . RIORDAN . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good word for me . WOOLCOTT . And two for myself . What do you think ? ( Enter MRS . VANDERVAST . ) MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast And what 's the decision ? These rude young people ran away from me to appeal to you . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith What is your opinion ? MRS . VAN . Mrs. Vandervast I see no reason for delay . Juliet went to Friar Lawrence 's cell and got married at a day 's notice . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith You are in a minority , Una . We had better say the close of the season . WOOLCOTT. ( aside to MRS . M. ) And we do n't go to South Palestine on our wedding journey either . ( Enter SIR E. L. from library . ) SIR E. Sir Everard You are making too much noise out here , you disturb me. ( to WOOLCOTT ) I presume , Mr. Woolcott , that my sister has acquainted you with the result of her scheming with my servants . WOOLCOTT . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Meredith has acquainted me with a fact of a very deep interest to me . SIR E. Sir Everard And you intend to take advantage of her  --  her generosity ? WOOLCOTT . You bet your bottom dollar I do , every time ! SIR E. Sir Everard That 's enough , sir ! I have nothing more to say to you . WOOLCOTT . That settles it . ( Enter GEORGE R. C. , down R. ) GEORGE . ( going eagerly to WOOLCOTT ) Mr. Woolcott , how can I ever thank you ? WOOLCOTT. ( shaking hands ) Keep out of mischief for the future , and never say a word about it . GEORGE . But  --  WOOLCOTT. ( interrupting him ) There 's your lame hand with the bandage looking three ways for Sunday . Go over to your aunt  --  nephew . MRS . M. Mrs. Meredith Come here , George , I 'll settle it . ( GEORGE crosses to her . ) UNA . Papa , as I told you this morning , Gerald and I have  --  have  --  SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RIORDAN . We are thinking of getting married before the close of the season , Sir Everard . SIR E. Sir Everard It is not to be thought of , sir . Your position is too undecided . You must show a fixed income , a certain position , before  --  WOOLCOTT . That 'll be all right . I will appoint Mr. Riordan London agent of the gold mine , with a good salary and a percentage of the profits . RIORDAN . Thank you , old fellow . WOOLCOTT . We shall need a paymaster and treasurer at Grass Valley . I will give Krebs that position . SIR E. Sir Everard George , I shall certainly forbid your playing cricket if the result is to maim you and keep you away from your duties at the office . WOOLCOTT . I think , Sir Everard , the boy will do better away from the office altogether , and away from London . My advice to him would be to go West and grow up with the country . I daresay we can find him a suitable position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed ) Tut ! Tut ! Tut ! Your gold mine seems omnivorous , and ready to swallow up all my household . Perhaps my sister will find occupation there too ? WOOLCOTT. ( extending arms to MRS . M. who crosses to him ) She will . She has kindly consented to come out and take care of the owner of the gold mine . Back matter CURTAIN .
