txt From information obtained yesterday , it seems probable that when Feldman and Neiderland were arrested in South Brooklyn on Friday by Chief Scanlon of the United States Secret Service Department an the charge of counterfeiting , the principal counterfeiter , John Neiderland , escaped , and that his brother was taken into custody in his stead . Witten , the officers Who accompanied Mr. Scanlon went to the workshop in the rear of 167 Eighteenth Street , where the mint for manutaceurIng counterfeit coins is sitSlated , it is said that JOhn Neiderland made this escape from the premises . Theofticer then threatened Feldman and compelled him to give him the name of his partner . Instead of giving him the name of John Neiderland , Feldman , it is said , gave the name of ** brother Arius , who , it Is claimed , was in no way connected with the counterfeiting business .

A steel die sinker , he said , could make brass dies , but he did not believe that a brass die maker could possibly make such perfect dies as those confiscated from the counterfeiters , which had been shown to him when he visited the District Attorney 's office yesterday . Mr. Hartmann will give evidence to this effect before United States Commissioner Morle when the en se comes up for a hearing , and he believes that Arius Neiderland will be discharged . He has the fullest confidence in his employe 's innocsnce , and says he feels bound to do what he can to restore him . to his wife and children . The house in which the Neiderlarbds live is a two-story frame building in a very poor neighborhood . The family occupies a single room on the first floor . There are six small children , all of whom are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though three were sturdy IfIrN from five to eight years old . A reporter for The New-York Times called at the house yesterday . The small apartment was miserably furnished , and there was no evidence , from its appearance , that Arius Neiderland is in as good circumstances as a counterfeiter might be expected to be if he is connected with an establishment which Is said to have realized $20,000 . To the reporter 's questions , Mrs. Neiderland said that all she knew about John Neiclerla.nd , her husband 's brother , was that she understood he was a partner of Feldman In the manufacture of jewelry . The charge against her husband , she said , was that he sold the dies to Feldman . but she was certain he did not do so . She appeared to be very much distressed over his arrest . John Neiderland , who made his escape from the mint , has been about five years in the country . He is a Russian Jew . He , it is believed , was the originator of the business . It is thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arius , his brother , who is now in Raymond Street Jail , came here from Russia three years ago , and it is claimed that he can account for himself during this period . Before obtaining employment with Mr. Hartmann , it is said , he worked for two years with another manufacturer of window signs in South Brooklyn . From all that could be learned in the neighborhood of the counterfeiting mint , it seems almost certain that one of the men engaged in the business eecapecL It Is certain that two men were daily at work there for the past four months , since the premises were hired from Mr. Alger 's agent . It has been stated that they lived in the two-story frame dwelling in front , but this is not correct . William Ferguson , who has lived in the house 157 Eighteenth Street , informed the reporter that they never lived there . He and his three brothers have occupied the house for the past two months , Before that time it was unoccupied for nearly a year . He said the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not close Cae shop until late in the afternoon . Nobody in the neighborhood ever saw the interior of the workshop . Even when the agent for the premises , James Rodenberg , called to collect the rent he was not permitted to enter . Only two dies were found in the premises , one for terecent pieces and another for quarters . About New Year 's Day Nederland complained to the agent that a burglar had broken into the shop and stolen important screws belonging to the machines . When Ferguson told him he should- report it to the police he did not appear to like the suggestion . It is now thought that the burglars took away dies for dollars and half dollars . It is certain the door was broken in , and that the proprietors did not care to have anything to do with the police . A more desirable neighborhood for a counterfeiting establishment could not be selected . The district is occupied by the la.boring and artisan classes , who live in small , two-story frame buildings . The location of the warkehors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a compactly-built , aingle-story brick building . 16 feet wide by 32 feet deep , having a front and rear entrance and several windows . It is connected with the street by an alleyway . The surroundings are such that the business might be carried on for years without being detected . Traders in the neighborhood have found several counterfeit coins in circulation recently . One man who keeps a store on Third Avenue said that during the past month a bad ten-cent piece , a quarter , half dollar , and dollar had been offered in his store . The coins were good counterfeits , but were made of a mixture of tin and antimony . It is thought probable that Feldman and Neiderland may not have confined themselves exclusively to the manufacture of silver counterfeits . The theory was started yesterday , to account for the perfection of the dies found in their possession , that they might have been stolen from the mint In Philade/phisThe coins turned out by the counterfeiters are fac similes of those coined a few years ago , and it is regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate those used during the past two years for the new silver coinage . Mr. Scanlon states that the dies are so perfect that only an expert could detect the difference between them and those used in the United States Mint . He said it would be impossible to cut a steel die by hand so evenly that some slight difference in the work could not be discovered when examined carefully . He was very reticent as to the nature of the evidence he can produce on the examinatien of the counterfeiters , and said it would not be grope ; tor him to disclose it beforehand .
