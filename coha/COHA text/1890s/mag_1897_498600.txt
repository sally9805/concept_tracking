// BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER . FROM THE NORTH ANNA TO COLD HARBOR . GRANT CROSSES THE PAMUNKEY . As soon as all the commands had safely recrossed the North Anna , General Grant set out on the morning of May 27 , 1864 , and marched with the troops in the new movement to the left . Sheridan , with two divisions of his cavalry , had started east the afternoon of the day before , and had moved rapidly to Hanovertown on the Pamunkey , a distance of nearly thirty miles . On the march the general-in-chief , as he rode by , was vociferously cheered , as usual , by the troops . Every movement directed by him inspired the men with new confidence in his ability and his watchfulness over their interests ; and not only the officers , but the rank and file , understood fully that he had saved them on the North Anna from the slaughter which would probably have occurred if they had been thrown against Lee 's formidable intrenchments , and had had to fight a battle with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them without the loss of a man or a wagon , and that they were again making an advance movement . The soldiers by this time were getting on intimate terms with their commander-in fact , becoming quite chummy . One man in the ranks touched his hat as the chief rode by , and asked , " Is it all right , general ? ) ) He received a nod of the head in reply , and the words , " Yes , I think so. * Another man looked up at him , and said in an earnest tone , ( ( General , we 11 lick em sure pop next time . ) ) These remarks were not attempts at undue familiarity , but expressions of a genuine sentiment of soldierly fellowship which the men had learned to entertain toward their chief . That night general headquarters were established at Mangohick Church , about twenty miles in a southeasterly direction from Quarles 's Ford . The cavalry had been handled with great skill . It made a feint as i to cross at Littlepage 's and Taylor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hanover Ferry , about twelve miles farther down the VOL . LIIJ. - 90- 91. stream , where the actual crossing took place on the morhing of the 27th . It was followed by Russell 's division of infantry . The rest of the troops had made a good march , and soon after midday on May 28 Wright , Hancock , and Warren had crossed the river and gone into position about a mile and a half beyond . Burnside had reached the ferry , but remained on the north side to guard the trains . General Grant had pushed on to Hanover Ferry , and expressed himself as greatly pleased at the success of the movement . He had abundant reason to congratulate himself upon the thorough carrying out of his instructions . In each of his three attempts to move close to Lee 's troops and cross difficult rivers in his very face , Grant had been completely successful , and had manceuvered so as to accomplish a most formidable task in warfare with insignificant loss . In the operations of the last few days General Grant had employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , celerity of action , and fertility of resource . While his plans were always well matured , and much thought and investigation were expended upon perfecting them in advance , yet they were sufficiently general in their nature to admit readily of those changes which often have to be made upon the instant in consequence of some unanticipated movement of the enemy , or some unexpected discovery in the topography of the field of operations . It seemed a little singular to him that Lee , after falling back behind the North Anna River , had allowed the Union army to advance across that difficult stream without any substantial resistance , and that , when across , he had made a stand with his back to another river , the South Anna , and remained there entirely passive , and that three days afterward he had permitted the Union army to withdraw across the North Anna under his very nose without even attacking its rear-guards . It was these circumstances which made Grant say at this time , and also write to the government : " Lee 's army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 713 // them outside of intrenchments can not be had . . . Our base of supplies was now transferred from Port Royal to White House on the York River . MAN ) IEUVERING FOR POSITION . BEFORE describing the personal incidents connected with what is known as the Cold Harbor campaign , it is important to give the reader a general idea of the character of the country in which the manceuvering and fighting occurred . Hanovertown , near which place our army had now been concentrated , is about seventeen miles in a straight line northeast from Richmond . The country is crossed by two streams , Totopotomoy Creek and the Chickahominy River , both running in a southeasterly direction , the latter being about four miles from Richmond at the nearest point . Between these are a number of smaller creeks and rivulets . Their banks are low , and their approaches swampy and covered with woods and thickets . Three main roads lead from Hanovertown to Richmond . The most northerly is called the Hanovertown or Shady Grove road ; the second route , the Mechanicsville road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Cold Harbor , New Cold Harbor , and Gaines 's Mill , is known as the Cold Harbor road . Old Cold Harbor , half-way between Hanovertown and Richmond , consisted merely of a few scattered houses ; but its strategic position was important for reasons which will hereafter appear . New Cold Harbor was little more than the intersection of cross-roads about a mile and a half west of Old Cold Harbor . It was at first supposed that Cold Harbor was a corruption of the phrase Cool Arbor , and the shade-trees in the vicinity seemed to suggest such a name ; but it was ascertained afterward that the name Cold Harbor was correct , that it had been taken from the places frequently found along the highways of England , and means ( ( shelter without fire . ) ) On May 28 Sheridan was pushed out toward Mechanicsville to discover the enemy 's position , and after a sharp fight at Haw 's Shop , drove a body of the enemy out of some earthworks in which it was posted . That night the Ninth Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north side until the morning of the 30th to cover the crossing of the trains . General headquarters had crossed the Pamunkey on the pontoon bridge in the afternoon of May 28 , after a hard , dusty ride , and had gone into camp on the south side . In the mean time Lee had moved his entire army rapidly from the North Anna , and thrown it between our army and Richmond . On the morning of the 29th , Wright , Hancock , and Warren were directed to move forward and make a reconnaissance in force , which brought about some spirited fighting . The movement disclosed the fact that all of Lee 's troops were in position on the north side of the Chickahominy , and were well intrenched . GRANT INTERVIEWS A PRISONER . GENERAL GRANT was particularly anxious , that evening , to obtain information of the enemy from some inside source . Several prisoners had been taken , and one of them who was disposed to be particularly talkative was brought in to headquarters , it being thought that the general might like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slim , shock-headed , comical-looking creature , and proved to be so full of native humor that I give the portion of his conversation which afforded us the most amusement . He , of course , did not know in whose presence he was as he rattled off his quick-witted remarks . ( ( What command do you belong to ? ) ) asked the general . 4 m in Early 's corps , and I belong to a No'th Ca'lina reegiment , suh , * was the reply . ( ( Oh , you re from North Carolina , ) ) remarked the general . ( ( Yes , ) ) said the prisoner , ( ( and a good deal fa'thah from it jes ' now than I d like to be , God knows . ) ) ( ( Well , where were you taken , and how did you get here ? ) ) was next asked . ( ( How did I get h'yah ! Well , when a man has half a dozen o ' them than reckless and desp'rit dragoons o ' yourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wallopin ' him with the fiats o ' than sabahs , he do n't have no trouble gittin ' h'yah . ) ) ( ( Is your whole corps in our front , and when did it arrive ? ) ) inquired the general . ( ( Well , now , jes ' let me tell you about that , ) ) said the prisoner ; ( ( and let me begin right from the sta't . I m not goin ' to fool you , cause I m fast losin ' interest in this fight . I was a peaceful man , and I did n't want to hurt nobody , when a conscript officah down than in the ole Tar State come around , and told me I would have to get into the ranks , and go to fightin ' fo ' my rights . I tried to have him p'int em out for me . I told him I d as lief have em all , but I was n't strenuous about it . Then he begun to put on mole airs than a buckin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come right along-that the country wanted me . Well , I had noticed that our folks was losin ' a good // many battles ; that you-all was too much for em ; and I got to flatterin ' myself that perhaps it was only right for me to go and jine our army , jes to kind o ' even things up . But matters has been goin ' pretty rough with us ever since , and I m gettin ' to feel peacefuller and peacefuller every day . They re feedin ' us half the time on crumbs , and than s one boy in my company that s got so thin you have to throw a tent-fly over him to get up a respectable shadow . Then they have a way of campin ' us alongside o ' creeks not much biggah than a slate-pencil ; and you have to be powerful quick about gettin ' what watah you want , or some thirsty cow 11 come along and drink up the whole stream . I thought , from all the fuss she had made at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole wah through herself , and make it a picnic for the rest of us ; but when than s real trouble she has to get the ole Tar State to do the solid work . ) ) " Are there any men from South Carolina in your brigade ? ) ) was the next question . The answer came with a serio-comic expre*-sion of countenance : " Yas ; a few-in the band . ) ) The general suppressed the laugh with which he was now struggling , and feeling that an effort to get any useful information from the North Carolinian would be a slow process , disappeared into his tent to attend to some correspondence , and left the prisoner to be further interviewed by the staff . " I tell you , gentlemen , ) ) went on the Confederate , " than s lots o ' cobwebs in my throat , and I could talk to you-all a good deal bettah if I only had a dish o ' liquor . Thah s nothin ' braces a man up like takin ' a little o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought , and after the man had poured out about four fingers of commissary whisky and tossed it off as if it were water , he looked considerably invigorated . Nothin ' as soothin ' as co'njuice , aftah all , ) ) he continued . " I d like to live in Kaintucky ; them Kaintucky fellers say they can walk right into a co'n-field , strip off an eah , and jes ' squeeze a drink of whisky right out'n it . ) ) ( ( How did you happen to be picked up ? ) ) was now asked . " Well , you see , sub , ) ) he replied , " our cap'n , Jimmy Skipwo'th , marched me out on the picket-line . Cap'n Jimmy s one o ' them than slacktwisted , loose-belted , toggle-j'inted kind o ' fellers that sends you straight out to the front ; and if you do n't get killed right off , *hy , he gets all out o ' patience , an ' thinks you want to live fo'evah . You ca n't get away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he marched us out to-day I says to him : ( Cap'n Jimmy , than do n't pear to be enough of the boys a-comm ' along with us . Now I tell you , when we go to monkeyin ' with them Yankees we ought to have plenty o ' company ; we do n't want to feel lonesome . ) Well , we got thah , and went to diggin ' a ditch so we could flop down in it and protect our heads , and could use it afterward fo ' buryin ' you-all in it , ef we could get hold o ' you . Well , jes ' then you opened lively , and come at us a-whoopin ' and a-careerin ' like sin ; and ez fo ' me , I took a header for the ditch . The boys saw somethin ' drop , and I did n't make any effo't to pick it up ag'in till the misunderstandin ' was ovah . The fust thing I knowed aftah that , you lighted onto me , yanked me out o ' the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' dragoons ; and Lo 'd ! how they did run me into you ' lines ! Andsoh'yahIam. * After the provost-marshal 's people had been told to take the prisoner to the rear and treat him well , the man , before moving on , said : " Gentlemen , I would like mighty well to see that thab new-fangled weepon o ' yourn that shoots like it was a whole platoon . They tell me , you can load it up on Sunday and fiah it off all the rest o ' the week . ) ) He had derived this notion from the Spencer carbine , the new magazine-gun which fired seven shots in rapid succession . After this exhibition of his talent for dialogue , he was marched off to join the other prisoners . REGION OF THE TOTOPOTOMOY . ON May 30 , Wright , Hancock , and Warren engaged the enemy in their respective fronts , which led to some active skirmishing , the enemy 's skirmishers being in most places strongly intrenched . Burnside this day crossed the Totopotomoy . Early 's ( formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turning our left , and made a heavy attack , but was repulsed , and forced to fall back , after suffering a severe loss , particularly in field-officers . About noon Grant received word that transports bringing W. F. Smith 's troops from Butler 's army were beginning to arrive at White House ; and they were ordered to move forward at once , and join the Army of the Potomac . General Grant thought that it was not improbable that the enemy would endeavor to throw troops around our left flank , in the hope of striking Smith a crushing blow before we could detach a force from the Army of the Potomac to prevent it . Sheridan was directed to watch for such a // movement , and an infantry brigade was sent out early that morning to join Smith , and march back with him so as to strengthen his forces . General Grant said at this time : ( ( Nothing would please me better than to have the enemy make a movement around our left flank . I would in that case move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee and Richmond. * But this opportunity did not arise . On May 30 the general headquarters had been established in a clearing on the north side of the Shady Grove road , about a mile and three quarters west of Haw 's Shop . General Grant this day sent a despatch to Halleck at Washington saying : 4 wish you would send all the pontoon bridging you can to City Point to have it ready in case it is wanted . ) ) As early as May 26 staff-officers had been sent from the Army of the Potomac to collect all the bridging material at command , and hold it in readiness . This was done in order to be prepared to cross the James River , if deemed best , and attack Richmond and Petersburg from the south side , and carry out the views expressed by Grant in the beginning of the Wilderness campaign as to his movements in certain contingencies . It was seen by him from the operations of the 30th that the enemy was working his way southward by extending his right flank , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads running from that point toward the James River and White House . This would cut off Grant 's short route to the James in case he should decide to cross that river , and would also command the principal line of communication with his base at White House . Old Cold Harbor was therefore a point much desired by both the contending generals , and the operations of the 31st were watched with much interest to see which army would secure the prize . GRANT SEIZES OLD COLD HARBOR . THAT morning my orders took me to the extreme left in connection with the movements of the cavalry . Sheridan advanced rapidly upon Old Cold Harbor , attacked a body of the enemy intrenched there , and after a severe fight carried the position . The place , however , was too important to be abandoned by the enemy without a further struggle , and he soon returned , bringing up a force so large that it appeared for a time impossible for Sheridan to hold his position . Finding no troops advancing to his support , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but just as he had withdrawn he received an order to hold the place at all hazards until reinforcements could reach him . With his usual zeal and boldness , he now reoccupied the enemy 's breastworks , dismounted his men , and determined td make a desperate struggle to hold the position against whatever force might be sent against him . Darkness set in , however , before the enemy made another assault . In anticipation of a hard fight for the possession of Cold Harbor , General Grant had ordered Wright 's corps to make a night march and move to Sheridan 's relief . Lee , discovering this , ordered Anderson 's corps to Cold Harbor . On Sheridan 's front during the night we could distinctly hear the enemy 's troops making preparations for the next morning 's attack , and could even hear some of the commands given by their officers . Soon after daylight on June 1 the assault began . Sheridan kept quiet till the attacking party came within a short distance of his breastworks , and then opened with a destructive fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He soon rallied , however , and rushed again to the assault , but once more recoiled before Sheridan 's welldelivered volleys . Wright had been instructed to arrive at daylight , but the night march had been exceptionally difficult , and the head of his column did not appear until nine o'clock . The troops were footsore and jaded , but they moved promptly into line , and relieved Sheridan 's little force , which had been fighting desperately against great odds for about four hours . Grant had secured Old Cold Harbor , and won the game . W. F. SMITH 'S TROOPS JOIN THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC . SMITH 'S corps consisted of 13,000 men . He left about 2,500 to guard White House , and with the rest started for the front , reaching there at three o'clock in the afternoon of June 1 . At five o'clock Wright 's and Smith 's commands advanced and captured the earthworks in their front , taking about 750 prisoners . The enemy had made three attacks upon Warren , but had been handsomely repulsed . Hancock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from sending troops to reinforce our left . The enemy seemed roused to desperation in his struggle to gain the much-coveted strategic point at Old Cold Harbor , and made several savage attacks in that direction dur // ing the night ; but they were all successfully repelled . In gaining and holding the important position sought , the Union army that day lost nearly 2000 men in killed and in wounded ; the enemy probably suffered to about the same extent . GRANT DISCIPLINES A TEAMSTER . HEADQUARTERS were moved about two miles this day , June 1 , to the Via House , which was half a mile south of Totopotomoy Creek on the road leading from Haw 's Shop to Bethesda Church . Before starting , the general 's servant asked whether he should saddle Jeff Davis , the horse Grant had been riding for two days . ( ( No , ) ) was the reply ; ( ( we are getting into a rather swampy country , and I fear little Jeff 's legs are not quite long enough for wading through the mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was large in size and a medium-colored bay . He was called Egypt not because he had come from the region of the Nile , but from the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers in southern Illinois , a section of country named after the land of the Ptolemies . When the horse was brought up the general mounted as usual in a manner peculiar to himself . He made no perceptible effort , and used his hands but little to aid him ; he put his left foot in the stirrup , grasped the horse 's mane near the withers with his left hand , and rose without making a spring , by simply straightening the left leg till his body was high enough to enable him to throw the right leg over the saddle . There was no " climbing* up the animal 's side , and no jerky movements . The mounting was always done in an instant and with the greatest possible ease . Rawlins rode with the general at the head of the staff . As the party turned a bend in the road near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of a teamster whose wagonwas stalled in a place where it was somewhat swampy , and who was standing beside his team beating his horses brutally in the face with the butt-end of his whip , and swearing with a volubility calculated to give a sulphurous odor to all the surrounding atmosphere . Grant 's aversion to profanity and his love of horses caused all the ire in his nature to be aroused by the sight presented . Putting both spurs into Egypt 's flanks , he dashed toward the teamster , and raising his clenched fist , called out to him : ( ( What does this conduct mean , you scoundrel ? Stop beating those horses ! ) ) The teamster looked at him , and said coolly , as he delivered another blow aimed at the face of the wheel-horse : ( ( Well , who s drivin ' this team anyhow-you or me ? ) ) The general was now thoroughly angered , and his manner was byno means as angelic as that of the celestial being who called a halt when Balaam was disciplining the ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain ! ) ) he cried , shaking his fist in the man 's face . Then calling to an officer of the escort , he said : ( ( Take this man in charge , and have him tied up to a tree for six hours as a punishment for his brutality . ) ) The man slunk off sullenly in charge of the escort to receive his punishment , without showing any penitence for his conduct . He was evidently a hardened case . Of course he was not aware that the officer addressing him was the general-in-chief , but he evidently knew that he was an officer of high rank , as he was accompanied by a staff and an escort , so that there was no excuse for the insubordinate and insolent remark . During the stirring scenes of that day 's battle the general twice referred to the incident in vehement language , showing that the recollection of it was still rankling in his mind . This was the one exhibition of temper manifested by him during the entire campaign , and the only one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remarked that night to Colonel Bowers , who had served with his chief ever since the Fort Donelson campaign : ( ( The general to-day gave us his first exhibition of anger . Did you ever see him fire up in that way in his earlier campaigns ? ) ) ( ( Never but once , * said Bowers : ( ( and that was in the luka campaign . One day on the march he came across a straggler who had stopped at a house and assaulted a woman . The general sprang from his horse , seized a musket from the hands of a soldier , and struck the culprit over the head with it , sending him sprawling to the ground . ) ) He always had a peculiar horror of such crimes . They were very rare in our war , but when brought to his attention the general showed no mercy to the culprit . GRANT 'S FONDNESS FOR HORSES . GRANT and Meade rode along the lines that day , and learned from personal observation the general features of the topography . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of the Sixth Corps gave the party some delicious icewater . He had found an ice-house near his headquarters , and after a hot and dusty ride since daylight the cool draught was gratefully relished by those whose thirst it slaked . The // previous winter had been unusually cold , and an abundance of ice had formed upon the streams in Virginia . The well-filled icehouses found on the line of march were a great boon to the wounded . General Wright had assumed command of the Sixth Corps at a critica.l period of the campaign , and under very trying circumstances ; but he had conducted it with such heroic gallantry and marked ability that he had commended himself highly to both Grant and Meade . That night the variety of food at the headquarters mess was increased by the arrival of a supply of oysters received by way of White House . Shell-fish were among the few dishes which tempted the general 's appetite , and as he had been living principally on roast beef and hard bread during the whole campaign , and had not eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one was delighted that evening , when sitting down at the mess-table , to see the general attack the oysters with evident relish , and make a hearty meal of them . Thereafter every effort was made to get a supply of that species of sea food as often as possible . At the dinner-table he referred again to the brutality of the teamster , saying : ( ( If people knew how much more they could get out of a horse by gentleness than by harshness , they would save a great deal of trouble both to the horse and the man . A horse is a particularly intelligent animal ; he can be made to do almost anything if his master has intelligence enough to let him know what is required . Some men , for instance , when they want to lead a horse forward , turn toward him and stare him in the face . He , of course , thinks they are barring his way , and he stands still . If they would turn their back to him and move on he would naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we can end this war , and I can settle down on my St. Louis farm and raise horses . I love to train young colts , and I will invite you all to visit me and take a hand in the amusement . When old age comes on , and I get too feeble to move about , I expect to derive my chief pleasure from sitting in a big arm-chair in the center of a ring ,  --  a sort of trainingcourse ,  --  holding a colt 's leading-line in my hand , and watching him run around the ring . ) ) He little foresaw that a torturing disease was to cut short his life before he could realize his cherished hopes of enjoying the happiness of the peaceful old age which he anticipated . No warrior was ever more anxious for peace , and all of the general 's references to the pending strife evinced his constant longing for the termination of the struggle upon terms which would secure forever the integrityofthe Union . When he prepared his letter of acceptance of his first nomination I*or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed the genuine sentiments of his heart , when he said , ( ( Let us have peace . ) ) MOVING INTO POSITION . THE night of the 1st of June was a busy one for both officers and men . Grant , eager as usual to push the advantage gained , set about making such disposition of the troops as would best accomplish this purpose . Hancock was ordered to move after nightfall from the extreme right to the extreme left of the army . The night was extremely dark , especially when passing through the woods , no one was familiar with the roads , the heat was intense , and the dust stifling ; but notwithstanding all the difficulties encountered , Hancock arrived at Old Cold Harbor on the morning of June 2 , after a march of over twelve miles . As the men were greatly exhausted , however , from hunger and fatigue , they had to be given an opportunity to rest and eat their rations , and it was found impossible to make a formidable assault until five o'clock in the afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their troops , but they repelled all assaults , and caused the enemy considerable loss . THE HALT AT BETHESDA CHURCH . AT daylight on June 2 the headquarters were moved about two miles south to a camp near Bethesda Church , so as to be nearer the center of the line , which had been extended toward the left . Upon reaching the church , and while waiting for the arrival of the wagons and the pitching of the tents , a number of important orders were issued . The pews had been carried out of the church and placed in the shade of the trees surrounding it . The general-in-chief and his officers seated themselves in the pews , while the horses were taken to a little distance in the rear . The ubiquitous photographers were promptly on the ground , and they succeeded in taking several fairly good views of the group . A supply of New York papers had just been received , and the party , with the exception of the general , were soon absorbed in reading the news . He was too much occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to give attention to the papers , // and was content to hear from the staff a summary of anything of importance mentioned in the press . He was usually a diligent reader of the newspapers and of all current literature . There was one New York morning journal which claimed a special previous knowledge of his movements , and made some very clever guesses concerning his plans . He used to call this paper his ( ( organ , ) ) and upon the arrival of the mail he would generally pick it up first , and remark : ( ( Now let me see what my organ has to say , and then I can tell better what I am going to do . ) ) A large delegation of the Christian Commission had arrived at White House , and was now moving up toward the lines with a supply-train which carried many comforts for the wounded . I saw among the number a person whom I recognized as the pastor of a church which I had attended some years before . He was trudging along like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was covered with Virginia dust . I presented him to General Grant and the rest of the officers , and then brought up a number of the other members of the Commission , and presented them in turn . General Grant rose to his feet , shook handswith them , and greeted them all with great cordiality ; then , resuming his seat , he said : ( ( Sit down , gentlemen , and rest ; you look tired after your march . ) ) They thanked him , and several of them took seats in the church pews near him , though , considering their professional training , most of them would have doubtless felt more at home in the pulpit than in the pews . The general continued by saying : " I am very glad to see you coming to the army on your present mission ; unfortunately , you will find an extensive field for your work . My greatest concern in this campaign is the care of the large number of wounded . Our surgeons have been unremitting in their labors , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gentlemen replied : " We have brought with us everything that we thought could minister to the comfort of the wounded , and we will devote ourselves religiously to the work . ) ) After the general had assured them that they should have all necessary transportation put at their disposal , they bid him goodby , and continued their march . His parting words were : ( ( Remember , gentlemen , whatever instructions you may receive , let your first care be for the wounded . ) ) Before leaving they expressed to the staff their great delight in having had this unexpected chat with the commander of the armies , and having been treated by him with so much consideration . The Christian Commission , as well as the Sanitary Commission , was often of inestimable service to the wounded , and many a gallant fellow owed his life to its kindly and devoted ministerings . STRENGTH OF LEE 'S POSITION AT COLD HARBOR . LEE had manceuvered and fought over this ground two years before , and was perfectly acquainted with every detail of topography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , in the Army of the Potomac a great many prominent officers who had served with McClellan on the Peninsula , and were familiar with the locality . General Grant , as usual , had not only to give direction to the active movements taking place under his own eye , but was compelled to bestow much thought upon the cooperating armies at a distance ; and the double responsibility was a severe tax upon his energies . He expected that much would be accomplished in the valley of Virginia by Hunter , now that the forces opposed to him had withdrawn , and was urging him to increased exertion ; but he had to communicate with him by way of Washington , which created much delay , and added greatly to the anxieties of the general-in-chief . In the afternoon of the 2d , Lee became aware that we were sending troops against his right , and was active in moving his forces to meet an attack on that flank . His left now rested on Totopotomoy Creek , and his right was near New Cold Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parapet was thrown up on his right in the rear of a sunken road which answered the purpose of a ditch . On the left center the ground was lower and more level , but difficult of approach on account of swamps , ravines , and thickets . Added to this were the usual obstacles of heavy slashings of timber . General Grant had manceuvered skilfully with a view to compelling Lee to stretch out his line and make it as thin and weak as possible , and it was at present over six miles long . WHY GRANT ASSAULTED AT COLD HARBOR . A SERIOUS problem now presented itself to General Grant 's mind-whether to attempt to crush Lee 's army on the north side of the James , with the prospect in case of success of driving him into Richmond , capturing the city perhaps without a siege , and putting the Confederate government to flight ; or to move // the Union army south of the James without giving hattie , and transfer the field of operations to the vicinity of Petersburg . It was a nice question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal officers , and weighing all the chances , he decided to attack Lee 's army in its present position . He had succeeded in breaking the enemy 's line at Chattanooga , Spotsylvania , and other places under circumstances which were not more favorable , and the results to he obtained now would be so great in case of success that it seemed wise to make the attempt . The general considered the question not only from a military standpoint , but he took a still broader view of the situation . The expenses of the war had reached nearly four million dollars a day . Many of the people in the North were becoming discouraged at the prolongation of the contest . If the army were transferred south of the James without fighting a battle on the north side , people would be impatient at the prospect of an apparently indefinite continuation of operations ; and as the sickly season of sumnier was approaching , the deaths from disease among the troops meanwhile would he greater than any possible loss encountered in the contemplated attack . The loss from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , as his troops were acclimated and ours were not . Besides , there were constant rumors that if the war continued much longer European powers would recognize the Confederacy , and perhaps give it material assistance , but this consideration influenced Grant much less than the others . Delays are usually dangerous , and there was at present too much at stake to admit of further loss of time in ending the war , if it could he avoided . The attack was ordered to be made at daylight on the morning of June *3 . The eve of battle was , as usual , an anxious and tiresome night at headquarters , and some changes in the detailed orders specifying the part the troops were to perform in the coming action were made nearly as late as midnight . Lee 's position was such that no turning movement was practicable , and it was necessary that one of his flanks should be crushed by a direct assault . An attack on the enemy 's right promised the better results , and Grant had decided to strike the blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position could not he ascertained until developed by a close attack , as changes were constantly being made in it , and new batteries were likely to be put in position at any time . The general 's intention , therefore , was to attack early in the morning , and make a vigorous effort to break Lee 's right , and if it were demonstrated that the assault could not succeed without too great a sacrifice of life , to desist , and have the men throw up cover for their protection with a view of holding all the ground they had gained . Our troops were disposed as follows : Hancock on the extreme left , Wright next , then Smith and Warren , with Burnside on the extreme right . A NOTABLE INSTANCE OF COURAGE . EVERYTHING was now in readiness for the memorable battle of Cold Harbor . Headquarters had been moved two miles farther to our jeft , and established near Old Cold Harbor , so as to be within easy reach of the main point of attack . It has been stated by inimical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaults in which they had been engaged ; that they had lost much of their spirit , and were even insubordinate , refusing to move against the earthworks in obedience to the orders of their immediate commanders . This is a gross slander upon the troops , who were as gallant and subordinate as any forces in the history of modern warfare , although it is true that many of the veterans had fallen , and that the recruits who replaced them were inferior in fighting qualities . In passing along on foot among the troops at the extreme front that eveningwhile transmitting some of the final orders , I observed an incident which afforded a practical illustration of the deliberate and desperate courage of the men . As I came near one of the regiments which was making preparations . for the next morning 's assault , I noticed that many of the soldiers had taken off their coats , and seemed to be engaged in sewing up rents in them . This exhibition of tailoring seemed rather peculiar at such a moment , . but upon closer examination it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and home addresses on slips of paper , and pinning them on the backs of their coats , so that their dead bodies might be recognized upon the field , and their fate made known to their families at home . They were veterans . who knew well from terrible experience the danger which awaited them , but their minds were occupied not with thoughts of shirking their duty , but with preparation for the desperate work of the coming morning . Such courage is more than heroic-it is sublime . // BATTLE OF COLD HARBOR . AT 4:80 A. M. , June 3 , Hancock , Wright , and Smith moved forward promptly to the attack . Hancock 's troops struck a salient of the enemy 's works , and after a desperate struggle captured it , taking a couple of hundred prisoners , three guns , and a stand of colors . Then turning the captured guns upon the enemy , they soon drove him from that part of the line into his main works a short distance in the rear . The second line , however , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was finally driven back and forced out of the works it had captured . The men resisted stubbornly , and taking advantage of the crest of a low hill at a distance of fifty or sixty yards from the captured works , they rapidly threw up enough cover to enable them to hold that position . Another division had rushed forward in column to effect a lodgment , if possible , in the enemy 's works ; but an impassable swamp divided the troops , who were now subjected to a galling fire of artillery and musketry ; and although a portion of them gain*d the enemy 's intrenchments , their ranks had become too much weakened and scattered to hold their position , and they were compelled to fall back . Wright 's corps had moved forward , and carried the rifle-pits in its front , and then assaulted the main line . This was too strong , however , to be captured , and our troops were compelled to retire . Nevertheless , they held a line , and protected it as best they could , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smith made his assault by taking advantage of a ravine which sheltered his troops somewhat from the cross-fire of the enemy . His men drove the enemy 's skirmishers before them , and carried the rifle-pits with great gallantry ; but the line had to be readjusted at close quarters , and the same cross-fire from which Wright had suffered made further advances extremely hazardous . Smith now reported that his troops were so cut up that there was no prospect of carrying the works in his front unless the enfilading fire on his flank could be silenced . Additional artillery was then sent forward to try to keep down the enemy 's fire . Burnside had captured the advance riflepits in front of Early 's left , and had taken up a position close to the enemy 's main line . Warren 's line was long and thin , and his troops , from the position they occupied , could not do much in the way of assaulting . These demonstrations against the enemy 's left were principally to keep him engaged , and prevent him from withdrawing troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in driving Early from the Shady Grove road , upon which he had advanced and made an attack . Gordon had attacked Warren 's center , but was handsomely repulsed . Wilson 's division of cavalry , which had returned from destroying the Virginia Central Railroad , moved across the Totopotomoy to Haw 's Shop , drove the enemy from that place , made a further advance , carried some rifle-pits and held them for an hour , but was unable to connect with Burnside 's infantry , and withdrew to Haw 's Shop . The reports received by General Grant were at first favorable and encouraging , and he urged a continuance of the successes gained ; but finding the strength of the position greater than any one could have supposed , he sent word at 7 A. M. to General Meade , saying : ( ( The moment it becomes certain that an assault can not succeed , suspend the offensive ; but when one does succeed , push it vigorously , and if necessary pile in troops at the successful point from wherever they can be taken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line . General Grant had established himself at a central position , which had been made known to all the commanders and staff-officers , so that he could at that point receive promptly all reports . Some of these messages were rather contradictory , and became still more conflicting as the attack proceeded . His staff-officers were active in bringing information from every important point , but the phases of battle were changing more rapidly than they could be reported . At eleven o'clock the general rode out along the lines to consult with commanding officers on the spot . Hancock now reported that the position in his front could not be taken . Wright stated that a lodgment might be made in his front , but that nothing would be gained by it unless Hancock and Smith were to advance at the same time . Smith thought that he might be able to carry the works before him , but was not sanguine . Burnside believed that he could break the enemy 's line in his front , but Warren on his left did not agree in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more attacks upon the enemy 's works would not result in success that at half-past twelve o'clock he wrote the following order to General Meade : ( ( The opinion of the corps commanders not being sanguine of success in case an assault is // ordered , you may direct a suspension of farther advance for the present . Hold our most advanced positions , and strengthen them . . . . To aid the expedition under General Hunter , it is necessary that we should detain all the army now with Lee until the former gets well on his way to Lynchburg . To do this effectually , it will be better to keep the enemy out of the intrenchments of Richmond than to have them go back there . Wright and Hancock should be ready to assault in case the enemy should break through General Smith 's lines , and all should be ready to resist an assault . ) ) After finishing this despatch the general discussed at some length the situation , saying : 4 am still of the opinion I have held since leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the offensive against us ; but I want to prepare for every contingency , and I am particularly anxious to be able to turn the tables upon the enemy in case they should , after their success this morning in acting on the defensive , be tempted to make a counter-attack upon our lines . ) ) AFTER THE BATTLE . AT two o'clock Grant announced the result of the engagement to Halleck . At three o'clock , while waiting for news in regard to the casualties of the morning and reports in detail from the corps commanders , he busied himself in sending instructions in regard to Banks 's command in Louisiana , and advised a movement against Mobile . There was a good deal of irregular firing along the lines , and in the afternoon it became heavy on Burnside 's right . The enemy had made an attack there , and while it lasted he attempted to haul off some of his batteries ; but Burnside 's return fire was so vigorous that this attempt was prevented . In the night the enemy 's troops withdrew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and their dead unburied . General Grant 's time was now given up almost entirely to thinking of the care of the wounded . Our entire loss in killed , wounded , and missing was nearly 7000 . Our surgeons were able to give prompt relief to the wounded who were recovered , as every preparation had been made for this emergency , and our army was fortunately only twelve miles from a water base . Many , however , were left between the lines ; and as the works were close together , and the intervening ground under a constant fire , it was not possible to remove a great number of the wounded or to bury the dead . The enemy 's wounded in our hands were taken in charge by our surgeons , and the same care was given to them as to our own men . GRANT 'S COMMENTS ON COLD HARBOR . THAT evening , when the staff-officers had assembled at headquarters after much hard riding and hot work during the day , the events which had occurred were discussed with the commander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general said : " I regret this assault more than any one I have ever ordered . I regarded it as a stern necessity , and believed that it would bring compensating results ; but , as it has proved , no advantages have been gained sufficient to justify the heavy losses suffered . The early assault at Vicksburg , while it was not successful , yet brought compensating advantages ; for it taught the men that they could not seize the much-coveted prize of that stronghold without a siege , and it was the means of making them work cheerfully and patiently afterwards in the trenches , and of securing the capture of the place with but little more loss of life ; whereas if the assault had not been made the men could not have been convinced that they could not have captured the city by making a dash upon it which might have saved them many months of arduous labor , sickness , and fatigue . ) ) The matter was seldom referred to again in conversation , for General Grant , with his usual habit of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . There has been brought out recently a remarkable vindication of Grant 's judgment in ordering the assault at Cold Harbor . In a lecture delivered at San Antonio , Texas , April 20 , 1896 , by ex-United States Senator John H. Reagan , who was postmaster-general in Jefferson Davis 's cabinet , he states that he and several of the judges of the courts in Richmond rode out to General Lee 's headquarters , and were with him during this attack . In describing the interview he says : ( ( He Lee then said to me that General Grant was at that time assaulting his lines at three different places , with columns of from six to eight deep . Upon this , I asked him if his line should be broken what reserve he had . He replied , ( Not a regiment , ) and added that if he should shorten his lines to make a reserve the enemy would turn him , and if he should weaken his lines to make a reserve they would be broken . ) ) This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling Lee to stretch out his line almost to the breaking-point , and a proof that if our attacking columns had penetrated it , Lee would have been found without reserves , and the damage inflicted upon him would have been irreparable . GRANT 'S ( ( HAMMERING . ) ) THERE were critics who were severe in their condemnation of what Grant called ( ( hammering ) ) and Sherman called ( ( pounding ) ) ; but they were found principally among the stay-at-homes , and especially the men who sympathized with the enemy . A soldier said one night , when reading by a camp-fire an account of a call issued by a disloyal newspaper at home for a public meeting to protest against the continued bloodshed in this campaign : " Who s shedding this blood , anyhow ? They better wait till we fellows down here at the front hollo , ( Enough ! ) ) ) The soldiers were as anxious as their commander to fight the war to a finish , and be allowed to return to their families and their business . Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding from battle . He could have avoided all bloodshed by remaining north of the Rapidan , intrenching , and not moving against his enemy : but he was not placed in command of the armies for that purpose . It had been demonstrated by more than three years of campaigning that peace could be secured only by whipping and destroying the enemy . No one was more desirous of peace ; no one was possessed of a heart more sensitive to every form of human suffering than the commander : but he realized that paper bullets are not effective in warfare ; he knew better than to attempt to hew rocks with a razor ; and he felt that in campaigning the hardest blows bring the quickest relief . He was aware that in Wellington 's armies the annual loss from disease was 113 out of 1000 ; in our Mexican war , 152 ; and in the Crimea , 600 ; and that in the campaigns thus far in our own war more men had died from sickness while lying in camp than from shot and shell in battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this continuous siege of fortified lines ; for , though he and his chief officers applied all their experience and skill in endeavors to manceuver the enemy out of strong positions before attacking him , his foe was often too able and wily to fall into the traps set for hini , and had to be struck in positions which were far from Grant 's choosing . When Lee stopped fighting the cause of secession was lost . If Grant had stopped fighting the cause of the Union would have been lost . He was assigned one of the most appalling tasks ever intrusted to a commander . He did his duty fearlessly to the bitter end , and triumphed . In thirteen months after Lincoln handed him his commission of lieutenant-general , and intrusted to him the command of the armies , the war was virtually ended . GRANT DECIDES TO CROSS THE JAMES . THE time had now come when Grant was to carry out his alternative movement of throwing the entire army south of the James River . Halleck , who was rather fertile in suggestions , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the advisability of throwing his army round by the right flank , taking up a line northeast of Richmond , controlling the railroads leading north of Richmond , and using them to supply the Union army . This view may have been favored in Washington for the reason that it was thought it would better protect the capital . Grant said , in discussing this matter at headquarters : ( ( We can defend Washington best by keeping Lee so occupied that he can not detach enough troops to capture it . If the safety of the city should really become imperiled , we have water communication , and can transport a sufficient number of troops to Washington at any time to hold it against attack . This movement proposed by Halleck would separate the Army of the Potomac by a still greater distance from Butler 's army , while it would leave us a long vulnerable line of communication , and require a large part of our effective force to properly guard it . I shall prepare at once to move across the James River , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of Richmond . ) ) On June 5 , General J. G. Barnard , of the United States engineer corps , was assigned to duty as chief engineer at Grant 's headquarters . SUFFERINGS AT THE FRONT . THE general-in-chief realized that he was in a swampy and sickly portion of the country . The malaria was highly productive of disease , and the Chickahominy fever was dreaded by all the troops who had a recollection of its ravages when they campaigned in that section of the country two years before . The operations had been so active that precautions against sickness had necessarily been // much neglected , and the general was anxious , while giving the men some rest , to improve the sanitary conditions . By dint of extraordinary exertions the camps were well policed , and large quantities of fresh vegetables were brought , forward and distributed . Cattle were received in much better condition than those which had made long marches and had furnished beef which was far from being wholesome . Greater attention was demanded in the cooking of the food and the procuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more stringent sanitary regulations were enforced throughout the entire command . What was most distressing at this time was the condition of affairs at the extreme front . No one who did not witness the sights on those portions of the line where the opposing troops were in exceptionally close contact can form an idea of the sufferings experienced . Staff-officers used to work theirwayon foot daily to the advanced points , so as to be able to report with accuracy these harrowing scenes . Some of the sights were not unlike those of the ( ( bloody angle ) ) at Spotsylvania . Between the lines where the heavy assaults bad been made there was in some places a distance of thirty or forty yards completely covered by the dead and wounded of both sides . The bodies of the dead were festering in the sun , while the wounded were dying a torturing death from starvation , thirst , and loss of blood . In some places the stench became sickening . Every attempt to make a change in the picket-line brought on heavy firing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest movement on either front led to the belief that it was the beginning of an assault . In the night there was often heavy artillery firing , sometimes accompanied by musketry , with a view to deterring the other side from attacking , or occasioned by false rumors of an attempt to assault . The men on the advanced lines had to lie close to the ground in narrow trenches , with little water for drinking purposes , except that obtained from surface drainage . They were subjected to the broiling heat by day and the chilling winds and fogs at night , and had to eat the rations that could be got to them under the greatest imaginable discomfort . GRANT 'S VISITOR FROM THE PACIFIC SLOPE . THE staff-officers , in their frequent visits to the front of our lines , had learned the most exposed points , and in passing them usually quickened their speed so as to be a shorter time under the enemy 's fire . There was one particularly dangerous place where a dirt road ran along the foot of a knoll on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific coast , whom General Grant knew , had arrived from Washington , and was spending a few days at headquarters to see what an army in the field looked like . One morning , as the general was mounting with a portion of his staff to make one of his frequent reconnoitering trips along the lines , the visitor proposed to ride with him , but said before starting : " Is there going to be much shooting where you re going , general ? For I ye got a wife and children waiting for me on the Pacific slope , and I do n't want to get pinked by the Johnny Rebs. * ( ( Well , they 're not very particular over there where their shots strike when they begin firing . I always advise persons who have no business to transact with them to keep away , ) ) replied the general . ( ( Yes ; but I want to see as much of this show as possible , now that I ye come here , ) ) said the guest ; and mounting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode along with the party . Pretty soon some stray artillery shots flew in our direction , but the visitor rode on without showing any signs of disturbance , except a very active ducking of the head , accompanied by a running comment upon the utter carelessness and waste of ammunition on the part of the enemy , and the evident disposition to mow down a mildmannered and harmless civilian with as little hesitation as they would the general-in-chief who was crowding them with all his armies . After a while we came to the dangerous portion of the dirt road , and the staff-officers reminded the general that it was usually pretty hot there ; but he passed over it at a walk without paying attention to the warning , and stopped at the most exposed point to examine the position in front , which seemed to him to present some features of importance . A battery instantly opened , and shot and shell shrieked through the air , and plowed the ground in a most enlivening manner . The visitor , whose head was now bobbing from one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out te the commander : ( ( See here , general ; it do n't appear to me that this place could have been selected by you with special reference to personal safety. * The general was absorbed in his examination of the ground , and made no reply for a minute or two . Then looking at his guest , who was growing red and pale by turns , and rolling nearly out of his saddle in // dodging to the right and left , remarked with a smile : ( ( You are giving yourself a great deal of useless exercise . When you hear the sound of a shot it has already passed you. * Just then a shell exploded close by , scattering the dirt in every direction . This was too great a trial for the overstrained nerves of the visitor . He turned his horse 's head to the rear , drove both spurs into the animal 's flanks , and as he dashed away with the speed of a John Gilpin , he cried back to us : " I have a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for time . Besides , I m not much of a curiosity-seeker anyway. * Just then his black silk hat blew off , but he did not stop to recover it , and was soon out of sight . He had evidently reached a state of mind when the best of hats appears to be of no special value . That evening in camp the general perpetrated a number of jokes at the visitor 's expense , saying to him : ( ( Well , you appear to have won that race you entered your horse for this afternoon. * " Yes , * said the visitor ; el seem to have got in first . ) ) ( ( Perhaps , ) ) continued the general , **you felt like that soldier in one of our retreats who , when asked by an officer where he was going , said : ( I m trying to find the rear of this army , but it do n't appear to have * " I do n't know why it was , but Lee seemed to have some personal grudge against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the general , ( ( it must have been that high hatwhich attracted his attention . ) ) ( ( Great Scott ! ) ) screamed the visitor , springing from his camp-stool as if the enemy had again opened fire on him ; ( ( do you know that that hat had a card in it with my name on ? Holy smoke ! If the boys get hold of it , and give me away , and the news gets out to the Pacific slope , I 11 be a dead duck in the next political campaign ! ) ) AN IMPORTANT MISSION . GENERAL GRANT was now stimulating every one to increased activity in making preparations for the formidable movement he was about to undertake in throwing the army with all its impedimenta across the James . He was fully impressed with its hazardous nature , but was perfectly confident that he could carry it out without encountering extraordinary risks . The army had to be withdrawn so quietly from its position that it would be able to gain a night 's march before its absence should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty or forty yards of each other at some points made this an exceedingly delicate task . Roads had to be constructed over the marshes leading to the lower Chickahominy , and bridges thrown over that stream preparatory to crossing . The army was then to move to the James , and cross upon pontoon bridges and improvised ferries . This would involve a march of about fifty miles in order to reach Butler 's position , while Lee , holding interior lines , could arrive there by a march of less than half that distance . In the afternoon of June 6 the general called Colonel Comstock and me into his tent , asked us to be seated , and said with more impressiveness of manner than he usually manifested : " I want you to undertake an important mission preliminary to moving the army from its present position . I have made up my mind to send Smith 's corps by a forced night march to Cole 's Landing on the Chickahominy , there to take boats and be transferred to Butler 's position at Bermuda Hundred . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their batteries will accompany the Army of the Potomac . That army will be held in readiness to pull out on short notice , and by rapid marches reach the James River and prepare to cross . I want you to go to Bermuda Hundred , and explain the contemplated movement fully to General Butler , and see that the necessary preparations are made by him to render his position secure against any attack from Lee 's forces while the Army of the Potomac is making its movement . You will then select the best point on the river for the crossing , taking into consideration the necessity of choosing a place which will give the Army of the Potomac as short a line of march as practicable , and which will at the same time be far enough down-stream to allow for a sufficient distance between it and the present position of Lee 's army to prevent the chances of our being attacked successfully while in the act of crossing . You should be guided also by considerations of the width of the river at the point of crossing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be approached . ) ) Early the next morning Comstock and I rode rapidly to White House , and then took a steamboat down the Pamunkey and York rivers , and up the James , reaching Butler 's headquarters at Bermuda Hundred the next day . After having obtained a knowledge of the topography along the James , and secured the best maps that could be had , we despatched a message to the general and started down the James on the 10th , making further // careful reconnaissances of the banks and the approaches on each side . Comstock and I had served on General McClellan 's staff when his army occupied the north bank of the James two years before , and the country for many miles along the river was quite familiar to us . This knowledge was of much assistance on the present mission . We returned by the same route by which we had come , and reached headquarters on the 12th . We had noted one or two places on the river which might have served the purpose of crossing ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a point familiarly known as Fort Powhatan , about ten miles below City Point , the latter place being at the junction of the James and Appomattox rivers . Several roads led to the point selected for crossing both on the north and the south side of the James , and it was found that they could be made suitable for the passage of wagon-trains by repairing ahd in some places corduroying them . The principal advantage of the place selected was that it was the narrowest point that could be found on the river below City Point , being twenty-one hundred feet in width from Wilcox 's Landing on the north side to Windmill Point on the south side . General Grant had been anxiously awaiting our return , and had in the mean time made every preparation for withdrawing the army from its present position . On our arrival we went at once to his tent , and were closeted with him for nearly an hour discussing the contemplated operation . While listening to our verbal report and preparing the orders for the movement which was to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manner he had ever manifested on any occasion . After smoking his cigar vigorously for some minutes , he removed it from his mouth , put it on the table , and allowed it to go out ; then relighted it , gave a few puffs , and laid it aside again . In giving him the information he desired , we could hardly get the words out of our mouths fast enough to suit him . He kept repeating , ( ( Yes , yes , ) ) in a manner which was equivalent to saying , ( ( Go on , go on** ; and the numerous questions he asked were uttered with much greater rapidity than usual . This would not have been noticed by persons unfamiliar with his habit ; but to us it was evident that he was wrought up to an intensity of thought and action which he seldom displayed . At the close of the interview he informed us that he would begin the movement that night . PREPARATIONS FOR A CHANGE OF BASE . THE same day on which Comstock and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sent north with two divisions of cavalry to break up the Virginia Central Railroad , and , if practicable , to push west and join General Hunter 's force , which was moving down the valley . It was expected that the enemy 's cavalry would be compelled to follow Sheridan , and that our large trains would be safe from its attacks during the contemplated movement across the James River . Nothing was left unthought of by the trained mind of the commander who was conducting these formidable operations . On June 9 a portion of the Army of the Potomac had been set to work fortifying a line to our left and rear on ground overlooking the Chickahominy , under cover of which the army could move down that stream . Boats for making the ferriage of the James had been ordered from all available places . Preparations had been made for bridging necessary points on the Chickahominy , and a large force had been put to work under engineer officers to repair the roads . This day ( June 12 ) was Sunday , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now ready for the in ; - portant movement . DEALING WITH A LIBELER OF THE PRESS . GENERAL MEADE had been untiring in his efforts during this eventful week . He was General Grant 's senior by seven years , was older than any of the corps commanders , and was naturally of an excitable temperament , and with the continual annoyances to which he was subjected he not infrequently became quite irritable . He was greatly disturbed at this time by some newspaper reports stating that on the second night of the battle of the Wilderness he had advised a retreat across the Rapidan ; and in talking this matter over with General Grant , his indignation became so great that his wrath knew no bounds . He said that the rumor had been circulated throughout the press , and would be believed by many of the people , and perhaps by the authorities in Washington . Mr. Dana , the Assistant Secretary of War , who was still with the army , was present at the interview , and he and General Grant tried to console Meade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they would give a broad contradiction to it . Mr. Dana at once sent a despatch to the Secretary of War , alluding to the rumor , and saying : ( ( This is entirely untrue . He has not shown any weakness of // the sort *ince moving from Culpeper , nor once intimated a doubt as to the successful issue of the campaign. * The Secretary replied the next day ( June 10 ) , saying : ( ( Please say to General Meade that the lying report alluded to in your telegram was not even for a moment believed by the President or myself . We have the most perfect confidence in him . He could not wish a more exalted estimation of his ability , his firmness , and every quality of a commanding general than is entertained for him . ) ) The newspaper correspondent who had been the author of this slander was seized and placed on a horse , with large placards hung upon his breast and back bearing the inscription , ( ( Libeler of the Press , ) ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment when Meade had not been in favor of bold and vigorous advances , and he would have been the last man to counsel a retreat . LOSSES . WHILE at the mess-table taking our last meal before starting upon the march to the James on the evening of the 12th , the conversation turned upon the losses which had occurred and the reinforcements which had been received up to that time . The figures then known did not differ much from those contained in the accurate official reports afterward compiled . From the opening of the campaign , May 4 , to the movement across the James , June 12 , the total casualties in the Army of the Potomac , including Sheridan 's cavalry and Burnside 's command , had been : killed 7,621 ; wounded 38,889 ; captured or missing 8,966 ; total 54,926 . The services of all the men included in these figures were not , however , permanently lost to the army . A number of them were prisoners who were afterward exchanged , and many had been only slightly wounded , and were soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once , as a soldier who was wounded in a battle twice , and afterward killed , may have been counted three times in making up the list of casualties , whereas the army had really lost but one man . The losses of the enemy have never been ascertained . No precise information on the subject has been discovered , and not even a general statement can be made of his casualties . In a few of the battles of this campaign his losses were greater than the losses suffered by the Union troops ; in the greater part of the battles they were less . Our reinforcements had amounted to just about the same number as the losses . It was estimated from the best sources of information that Lee had also received reinforcements equal to his losses , so that the armies were now of about the same size as when the campaign began . All the reinforcements organized in the North and reported as on their way to the front did not reach us . There was a good deal of truth in the remark reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We get a large body of reinforcements together , and start them to the front ; but after deducting the sick , the deserters , the stragglers , and the discharged , the numbers seriously diminish by the time they reach their destination . It s like trying to shovel fleas across a barnyard ; you do n't get em all there . ) ) GRANT RELATES SOME ANECDOTES . GENERAL GRANT said during the discussion : 4 was with General Taylor 's command in Mexico when he not only failed to receive reinforcements , but found that nearly all his regulars were to be sent away from him to join General Scott . Taylor was apt to be a little absent-minded when absorbed in any perplexing problem , and the morning he received the discouraging news he sat down to breakfast in a brown study , poured out a cup of coffee , and instead of putting in the sugar , he reached out and got hold of the mustardpot , and stirred half a dozen spoonfuls of its contents into the coffee . He did n't realize what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he broke out in a towering rage . ( ( We learned something at Shiloh about the way in which the reports of losses are sometimes exaggerated in battle . At the close of the first day 's fight Sherman met a colonel of one of his regiments with only about a hundred of his soldiers in ranks , and said to him , ( Why , where are your men ? ) The colonel cast his eyes sadly along the line , wiped a tear from his cheek , and replied in a whimpering voice : ( Wewent in eight hundred strong , and that 's all that s left of us . ) ( You do n't tell me ! ) exclaimed Sherman , beginning to be deeply affected by the fearful result of the carnage . ( Yes , ) said the colonel ; ( the rebs appeared to have a special spite against us . ) Sherman passed along some hours afterward , when the commissary was issuing rations , and found that the colonel 's men were returning on the run from under the bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing ; and in a few minutes nearly all of the lost seven hundred had rejoined , and were boiling coffee and eating a hearty meal with an appetite that showed they were still very much alive. ) )
