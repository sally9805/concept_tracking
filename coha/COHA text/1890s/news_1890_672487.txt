txt The Brooklyn Institute was all but destroyed by lire last night . It is a four-story brick building , with massive plain granite front , situated on the west side of Washington Street , nearConcord . Just after 6 o'clock Prof. Franklin W. Hooper , one of the Directors , started for home . On the opposite aide of the street he saw a man running and crying " Fire ! " Prof. Hooper turned in the direction in which the man was looking and saw smoke issuing from the cornice of the Institute . He ran back into the library , where Librarian William J. Crandall and his assistants and Janitor Davis were engaged , but in utter ignorance of the threatened danger . They followed the professor to the top of the building , where , through the studio skylights , they saw that the entire apace between the ceiling and the roof was in flames . Persons from the streets and policemen who had followed them into the building quickly stripped the walls of the paintings , engravings , and drawings ana hurried them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were safely stored . The Fire Department had responded to the alarm by that time , and soon had their hose in and on the roof of the building ; but the fire had gained a considerable headway and was blazing fiercely in a part of the building that was difficult of access . Despite the efforts of the firemen it gained upon them . In about half an hour after the fire was first discovered the roof over the large lecture room in the rear part of the top floor fell in with a crash carrying with it the floor of the lecture room , the entire ruin falling to the floor of the large auditorium that takes up the greater part of the second and third floors . With the fall of the roof and top floor a section of the rear wall fell out upon the roof of the Home for Aged Women ana Friendless Children , which adjoined the institute on Concord Street . Firemen Fitzgerald and Dale , who were on the roof of the house at the time , narrowly escaped being crushed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire was quickly got under subjection , but not until the building had been completely water-soaked . Besides the lecture room on the top floor , there were five studios and cabinet rooms , in which several valuable botanical , geological , and entomological collections were contained , few of the specimens fortunately being out of their oabinets . In two of the rooms there were also a large oolleotion of plaster casts and figures , some or them the property of the institute and some belonging to instructors . Burning embers which fell from the roof and floods of water poured in by the firemen left little of value among the caste , but the collections were not seriously injured . Four cabinets which were ranged along the walls of the lecture room were securely fastened to the walls , and were undisturbed by the falling of the roof . Of laboratory apparatus the institute had but little , and most of this escaped injury . Prof. Hooper found his microscopes intact and but slightly injured after the lire was put out , but Prof. Van der Weyde , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy loser . He bad in the lecture room a collection of chemical and electric apparatus comprising over two hundred and fifty pieces , the accumulation of a lifetime , which were all destroyed , and which it will be impossible to replace . Among them was a collection of the telephones of nearly all the companies which at various times tried issue with the Bell company , besides otherenthe invention of the professor himself . In the main auditorium there was little except furniture and carpets to damage ; everything of this character was ruined . The large and valuable free library of the Institute , the offices , and some few cabinets of geological specimens were on the first floor . The furniture was ruined , but the books , being iu cases , for the most part escaped injury , about two hundred volumes only being more or less damaged by water . The library embraces about 15,000 volumes altogether , and the first concern of the Board of Directors will be to get it removed to a place of security . The loss upon the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents was estimated by the police and fire officials at about $40,000 . Prof. Hooper said that the Institute carried $60,000 of insurance , covering the building and its contents . The Brooklyn Institute was orgassiied in 1823 and incorporated Nov. 20 , 1824 , under.the name of the Brooklyn Apprentices ' Library Association . A building was erected at Henry and Cranberry Streets , the cornerstone of which was laid with imposing ceremonies on the 4th of July , 1925 , by Gen. Lafayette . The building so nearly destroyed last night was erected by a Board of Trustees in 1840 at an original cost of $35,000 , as a Lyceum , and the 4th ofJuly , 1848 , the Apprentices ' Library , which had moved in 1843 , having sold its property to the city , and the Lyceum were consolidated under the name of the Brooklyn Institute , Mr. Augustus Graham , its President at the time , making the institute a present of the property free and clear of all ! ileumbrances . Mr. Grahaai further en owed the Institute by bequests aggregating $27,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end devices of important collections , which have materially ? dried to the value of its property and equipment . The development of the pity southward and westward , and the conversion of the neighborhood'in which the institute was situated to business uses , had in recent years led to the organization of a movement for its removal to a locality more central to the residence section . Gen. John B. Woodward , President of the institute , is the leader in this effort . Although a site has not been definitely selected , it was the design of the friends of the institute to establish it in new quarters upon the east-side lauds of Prospect Park . where it was taken for granted the city would award an eligible site : Last night 's lire has rendered the further use of the present building a practical impossibility without its complete reconstruction , and this circumstance , it was said . would lead to the rapid development of the plans for the removal . Prof. Hooper said that a meeting of the Directors would be called for Monday or Tuesday to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete mystery . There had been no fire in the building for months . Twice before within the last eight months the building had been on fire , once oatohing fire from some rubbish about the furnaces in the basement and once from a carelessly-thrown cigar stump in a closet under the sidewalk . In neither case was the damage serious .
