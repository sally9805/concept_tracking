By Horace Busknel/. * I HAT we call History , considered as giving a record of notable events or transactions , under names and dates , and so a really just and true exhibition of the causes that construct a social state , I conceive to be commonly very much of a fiction . True worth is for the most part unhistoric , and so of all the beneficent causes and powers included in the lives of simply worthy men ; causes most fundamental and efficient , as regards the well-being and public name of communities . They are such as flow in silence , like the great powers of nature . Indeed , we say of history , and say rightly , that it is a record of c-vents -- that is , of turnings out , points where the silence is broken by something apparently not in the regular flow of common life ; just as electric ity , when still , goes through and masters the world , holding all atoms to their places and quickening even the life of our bodies , and becomes historic only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its thunder , than simply to notify us , by so great a noise , of the breach of its connections and the disturbance of its silent work . Besides , in our historic pictures , we are obliged to sink particulars in generals , and so to gather , under the name of a prominen.t few , what is really done by nameless multitudes . These , we say , led out the colonies , these raised up the states and communities , these fought the battles . And so we make a vicious inversion , not seldom , of the truth ; representing as causes those who , after all , are not so much causes as effects , not so much powers as instruments , in the occasions signalized by their names-caps only of foam , that roll conspicuous in the sun , lifted , still , by the deep under-swell of waters hid from the eye . If then you ask who made this Litchfleld County of ours , it will be no sufficient answer that you get , however instructive and useful , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , and recited the events that have found an honorable place in the history of th' County , or the republic . You must not go into the burial places , and look about only for the tall monuments and the titled names . It is not the starred epitaphs of the Doctors of Divinity , the Generals , the Judges , the Honorables , the Governors , or even of the village notables called Esquires , that mark the springs of our successes and the sources of our distinction . These are rather effects than causes ; the spinning-wheels have done a great deal more than these . Around the honored few , here a Bellamy or a Day , sleeping in the midst of his flock , here a Wolcott or a Smith , an Allen or a Tracy , a Reeve or a Gould , all names of honor-round about these few and others like them , are lying multitudes of worthy men and women , under their humbler monuments , or in graves that are hidden by the monumental green that loves to freshen over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but good many , we are to find the deepest , truest causes of our happy history . Here lie the sturdy kings of Homespun , From a " secular sermon " delivered at the centennial celebration of Litchfield county , coon. , August 14 , 1851 , published in full in the volume entitled " work and Play . " This address , almost forgotten hv the great body of our people , is reprinted here , like Rufus choate 's address on " The Importance of Illustrating New England History by a Series of Romances like the XVaverley Novels " in the November , 1897 , number of the magazine , as one of many similar works which we can not afford to let die . Nowhere has the sturdy strength and simplicity of the old New England country character been more impressively brought out than by Dr. Bushnell in this address. - EnsTos. // who climbed among these hills , with their axes , to cut away room for their cabins and for family prayers , and so for the good future to come . Here lie their sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built stonefence while the corn was sprouting in the hills , getting ready , in that way , to send a boy or two to college . Here lie the good housewives who made coats , every year , like Hannah , for their children 's bodies , and lined their memory with catechism . Here the millers who took honest toll of the rye ; the smiths and coopers who superintended two hands and got a little revenue of honest bread and schooling from their small joint stock of twohanded investment . Here the district committees and school-mistresses , the religious society founders and church deacons , and withal a great many sensible , wise-headed men , who read a weekly newspaper , loved George Washington and their country , and had never a thought of going to the General Assembly ! These are the men and women who made Litchfield County . Who they are , by name , we can not tell - no matter who they are - we sflouid be none the wiser if we could name them , they themselves none the more honorable . Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good old time gone by-kings and queens of Homespun , out of whom we draw our royal lineage . It was a great advance in human society which was indicated by a transition from the dress of skins to that of cloth-an advance of so great dignity , that spinning and weaving were looked upon as a kind of fine art , or polite accomplishment . Another ad**ance , and one that is equally remarkable , is indicated by the transition from a dress of homespun to a dress of factory cloths , produced by machinery and obtained by the exchanges of commerce , at home or abroad . This transition we are now making , or rather , I should say , it is already so far made that the very terms , " domes. tic manufacture , " have quite lost their meaning ; being applied to that which is neither domestic , as being made in the house , nor manufacture , as being made by the ha*ds . This transition from mother and daughter power to water and steam power is a great one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive - one that is to carry with it a complete revolution of domestic life and social manners . If , in this transition , there is something to regret , there is more , I trust , to Oesire . If it carries away the old simplicity , it must also open higher possibilities of culture and social ornament . The principal danger is , that , in removing the rough necessities of the homespun age , it may take away also the severe virtues and the homely but deep and true piety by which , in their lAessed fruits , as we are all here testifying , that age is so honorably distinguished . Be the issue what it may , good or bad , hopeful or unhopeful , it has come ; it is already a fact , and the consequences must lcA ! ow . If our sons and daughters should assemble , a hundred years hence , to hold another celebration like this , they will scarcely be able to imagine the Arcadian pictures now so fresh in the memory of many of us , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal knowledge or remembrance . Everything that was most distinctive of the old homespun mode of life * ill then have passed away . The spinning-wheels of wool and flax , that used to buzz so familiarly in the childish ears of some of us will be heard no more forever ; seen no more , in fact , save in the halls of the Antiquarian Societies , where the delicate daughters will be asking , what these strange machines are , and how they were made to go ? The huge , hewn-timber looms , that used to occupy a room by themselves in the farm-houses , will be gone , cut up for cord wood , and their heavy thwack , beating up the woof , will be heard no more by the passer-by - not even the // Antiquarian Halls will find room to harbor a specimen . The long strips of linen , bleaching on the grass , and tended by a sturdy maiden , sprinkling them , each hour , from her water-can , under a broiling sun-thus to prepare the Sunday linen for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save as they return to fill a picture in some novel or ballad of the old time . The tables will be spread with some cunning , water-power Silesia not yet invented , or perchance with some meaner fabric from the cotton mills . The heavy Sunday coats that grew on sheep individually remembered-more comfortably carried , in warm weather , on the armand the specially fine-striped blue and white pantaloons of linen just from the loom , will no longer be conspicuous in processions of footmen going to their homespun worship , but will have given place to processions of broadcloth gentlemen lolling in the upholstery of their coaches , able to worship , it may be , in a more cultivated figure , but not with a finer sincerity . The churches , too , that used to be simple brown meeting-houses covered with rived clapboards of oak , will have come down , mostly , from the bleak hill-tops into the close villages and populous towns that crowd the waterfalls and the railroads ; and the old burial places , where the fathers sleep , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , of an age that lived as much nearer to heaven and as much less under the world . The change will be complete . Would that we might raise some worthy monument to a social state , then to be passed by , worthy , in all future time , to be held in the dearest reverence . It may have seemed extravagant or fantastic , to some of you , that I should think to give a character of the century now past , under the one article of homespun . It certainly is not the only , or in itself the chief article of distinction ; and yet we shall find it to be a distinction that runs through all others , and gives a color to the whole economy of life and character , in the times of which we speak . Thus , if the clothing is to be manufactured in the house , then flax will be grown in the plowed land , and sheep will be raised in the pasture , and the measure of the flax ground , and the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house market  --  the number of the sons and daughters to be clothed-so that the agriculture out of doors will map the family in doors . Then as there is no thought of obtaining the articles of clothing , or dress , by exchange ; as there is little passing of money , and the habit of exchange is feebly developed ; the fainilv will be fed on home-grown products , buckwheat , maize , rye , or whatever the soil will yield . And as carriages are a luxury introduced only with exchanges , the lads will be going back and forth to the mill on horseback , astride the fresh grists , to keep the mouths in supply . The meat market will be equally domestic , a kind of quarter-master slaughter and supply , laid up in the cellar , at fit times in the year . The daughters who , in factory days , would go abroad to join the female conscription of the cotton mill , will be kept in the home factory , or in that of some other family , and so in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , that a form of life which includes almost every point of economy , centers round the article of homespun dress , and is by that determined . Given the fact that a people spin their own dress , you have in that fact a whole volume of characteristics . They may be shepherds dwelling in tents , or they may build them fixed habitations , but the distinction given will show them to be a people who are not in trade , whose life centers in in the family , home-bred in their manners , primitive and simple in their character , inflexible in their piety , hospitable without show , intelligent without refinement . And so it will be seen that our homespun fathers and mothers made a Puritan Arcadia among these bills , answering to the picture which // Polybius , himself an Arcadian , gave of his countrymen , when he said that they had , " throughout Greece , a high and honorable reputation ; not only on account of their hospitality to strangers , and their benevolence towards all men , but especially on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , if we speak of what , in the polite world , is called society , our homespun age had just none of itand perhaps the more of society for that reason ; because what they had was separate from all the polite fictions and showy conventionalities of the world . I speak not here of the rude and promiscuous gatherings connected so often with low and vulgar excesses ; the military trainings , the huskings , the raisings , commonly ended with a wrestling match . These were their dissipations , and perhaps they were about as good as any . The appleparing and quilting frolics , you may set down , if you will , as the polkadances and masquerades of homespun . If they undertook a formal entertainment of any kind , it was commonly stiff and quite unsuccessful . But when some two queens of the spindle. specially fond of each other , instead of calling back and forth with a cardcase in their hand , agreed to " join works , " as it was called , for a week or two . in spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , and , when the two skeins were done , spending the rest of the day in such kind of recreation as pleased them , this to them was real society , and , so far , a good type of all the society they had . It was the society not of the Nominalists. but of the Realists ; society in or after work ; spontaneously gathered , for the most part . in terms of elective affinity-foot excursions of young people , or excursions on horseback , after the haying , to the tops of the nei*+horing mountains : boatings on the river or the lake , by moonli*ht , filling the wooded shores and th' recesses of the hills with lively echoes ; evening schools of sacred music , in which the music is not so much sacred as preparing to be ; evening circles of young persons , falling together , as they imagine , by accident , round some village queen of song , and chasing away the time in ballads and glees so much faster than they wish , that just such another accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the minister and talk of both worlds together , and , if he is limber enough to suffer it , in such happy mixtures , that both are melted into one . But most of all to be remembered are those friendly circles , gathered so often round the winter 's fire-not the stove , but the fire , the brightly blazing , hospitable fire . In the early dusk , the home circle is drawn more closely and quietly round it ; but a good neighbor and his wife drop in shortly from over the way , and the circle begins to spread . Next , a few young folk from the other end of the village , entering in brisker mood , find as many more chairs set in as wedges into the periphery to receive them also . And then a friendly sleigh-full of old and young , who have come down from the hill to spend an hour or two , spread the circle again , moving it still farther back from the fire ; and the fire blazes just as much higher and more brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no restraint , certainly no affectation of style . They tell stories , they laugh , they sing . They are serious and gay by turns , or the young folks go on with some play , while the fathers and mothers are discussing some hard point of theology in the minister 's last sermon ; or perhaps the great danger coming to sound morals from the multiplication of turnpikes and newspapers ! Meantime the good housewife brings out her choice stock of home-grown exotics , gathered from , three realms , doughnuts from the pantry , hickory nuts from the chamber , and the nicest , smoothest apples from the cellar ; all which , including , I suppose I must add , the rather unpoetic beverage that // gave its acid smack to the ancient hospitality , are discussed as freely , with no fear of consequences . And then , as the tall clock in the corner of the room ticks on majestically towards nine , the conversation takes , it may be , a little more serious turn , and it is suggested that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whereupon the circle breaks up with a reverent , congratulative look on every face , which is itself the truest language of a social nature blessed in human fellowship . Such , in general , was the society of the homespun age . It was not th*tt society that puts one in connection with the great world of letters , or fashion , or power , raising as much the level of his consciousness and the scale and style of his action ; but it was society back of the world , in the sacred retreats of natural feeling , truth and piety . Descending from the topic of society in general to one more delicate , that of marriage and the tender passion and the domestic felicities of the homespun age , the main distinction here to be noted is , that marriages were commonly contracted at a much earlier period in life than now . Not because the habit of the time was more romantic or less prudential , but because a principle more primitive and closer to the beautiful simplicity of nature is yet in vogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much to help their husbands spend a living , as to help them get one . Accordingly , the ministers were always very emphatic , as I remember in their marriage ceremonies , on the ancient idea that the woman was given to the man to be a help , meet for him . Had they supposed , on the contrary , what many appear in our day to assume , that the woman is given to the man to enjoy his living , I am not sure that a certain way they had of adhering always to the reason of things , would not have set them at feud with the custom that requires the fee of the man , insisting that it go to the charge of the other party , where , in such a case , it properly belongs . Now exactly this notion of theirs , I confess , appears to me to be the most sentimental and really the most romantic notion possible of marriage . What more beautiful embodiment is there on this earth , of true sentiment , than the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness , to make him strong ; to enter into the hard battle of his life and bear the brunt of it with him ; to go down with him in disaster , if he fails , and cling to him for what he is ; to rise with him , if he rises , and share a two-fold joy with him in the competence achieved ; remembering , both of them , how it grew by little and little , and by what methods of frugal industry it was nourished ; having it also , not as his , but theirs , the reward of their common perseverance , and the token of their consolidated love . And if this be the most heroic sentiment in the woman , it certainly was no fault in the man of homespun to look for it . And , in this view , the picture given of his suit , by a favorite poetess of our own , is as much deeper in poetry as it is closer to the simplicity of nature . " Behold , The ruddy dam*sel singeth at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Perchance his shrewd eye secretly doth count The mass of skeins that , hanging on the wall , Increaseth day by day . Perchance his thought ( Por men have wiser minds than women , sure , ) Is ca1culatin* what a thrifty wife The maid will make . " Do not accuse our rustic here too hastily , in the rather homely picture he makes ; for sometimes it is the way of homely things , that their poetry is not seen , only because it is deepest . The main distinction between him and the more plausible romantic class of suitors is , that his passion has penetrated beyond the fancy , into the reason , and made the sober sense itself a captive . Do you say that a man has not a heart because it is shut up in the // casement of his body and is not seen , beating on the skin ? As little reason have you here to blame a fault of passion , because it throbs under the strong , defensive ribs of prudence . It is the froth of passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces-the truth of it that pierces inmost realities . So , I suppose , our poetess would say that her young gentleman of homespun thinks of a wife , not of a holiday partner who may come into his living in a contract of expenditure . He believes in women according to God 's own idea , looks to her as an angel of hclp , who may join herself to him , and go down the rough way of life as it is , to strengthen him in it by her sympathy , and gild its darkness , if dark it must be , by the light of her patience and the constancy of her devotion . The main difference is , that the romance comes out at the end and was not all expended at the beginning . The close necessities of these more primitive days connected many homely incidents with marriage , which however , rather heighten the picturesque simplicity than disparage the beauty of its attractions . The question of the outfit , the question of ways and means , the homely prudence pulling back the heroics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic at last ; all these you will readily imagine . I suppose many of my audience may have heard of the distinguished Christian minister , still living in the embers of extreme old age , who came to the point , not of a flight in the winter , but of marriage , and partly by reason of the Revolution then in progress , could find no way to obtain the necessary wedding suit . Whereupon , the young woman 's benevolent mother had some of her sheep sheared and sewed up in blankets to keep them from perishing with cold , that the much required felicity might be consummated . K*t the schools ,  --  we must not pass by these , if we are to form a truthful and sufficient picture of the homespun days . The school-master did not exactly go round the district to fit out the children 's minds with learning , as the shoemaker often did to fit their feet with shoes , or the tailors to measure and cut for their bodies ; but , to come as near it as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and the wood for the common fire was supplied in a way equally primitive , viz. , by a contribution of loads from the several families according to their several quantities of childhood . The children were all clothed alike in homespun , and the only signs of aristocracy were , that some were clean and some a degree less so , some in fine white and striped linen , some in brown tow crash ; and , in particular , as I remember with a certain feeling of quality I do not like to express , the good fathers of some testified the opinion they had of their children by bringing fine round loads of hickory wood to warm them , while some others , I regret to say , brought only scanty , scraggy , ill-looking heaps of green oak , white birch , and hemlock . Indeed , about all the bickerings of quality among the children centred in the quality of the wood-pile . There was no complaint , in those days , of want of ventilation ; for the large open fireplace held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows took in just enough air to supply the combustion . Besides , the bigger lads were occasionally ventilated , by being sent out to cut wood enough to keep the fire in action . The seats were made of the outer slabs from the sawmill , supported by slant legs driven into and a proper distance through augur holes , and planed smooth on the top by the rather tardy process of friction . But the spelling went on bravely , and we ciphered away again and again , always till we got through Loss and Gain . The more advanced of us , too , made light work of Lindley Murray , and went on to the parsing , finally , of extracts from Shakespeare and Milton , till some of us began to think we had mastered their // tough sentences in a more consequential sense of the term than was exactly true . Oh , I remember ( about the remotest thing I can remember ) that low seat , too high , nevertheless , to allow the feet to touch the floor , and that friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enthusiasm and awaken the first sense of power . He is living still , and whenever I think of him , he rises up to me in the far background of memory , as bright as if he had worn the seven stars in his hair . ( I said he is living ; yes , he is here to-day , God bless him ! ) How many others of von who are here assembled , recall these little primitive universities of homespun , where your mind was born , with a similar feeling of reverence and homely satisfaction . Perhaps you remember , too , with a pleasure not less genuine , that you received the classic discipline of the university proper , under a dress of homespun , to he graduated , at the close , in the joint honors of broadcloth and the parchment . Passing from the school to the church , or rather , I should say , to the meeting-house-good translation , whether meant or not , of what is older and more venerable than church , viz. , svl iagoguc-here , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably it stands on some hill , midway between three or four valleys , whither the tribes go up to worship , and , when the snow-drifts are deepest , go literally from strength to strength . There is no furnace or stove , save the foot-stoves that are filled from the fires of the neighboring houses , and brought in partly as a rather formal compliment to the delicacy of the tender sex , and sometimes because they are really wanted . The dress of the assembly is mostly homespun , indicating only slight distinctions of quality in the worshipers . They are seated according to age , the old king Lemuels and their queens in front , near the pulpit , and the younger Lemuels farther back , inclosed in pews , sitting back to back , im pounded , all , for deep thought and spiritual digestion ; only the deacons , sitting close under the pulpit , by themselves , to receive , as their distinctive honor , the more perpendicular droppings of the word . Clean round the front of the gallery is drawn a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . The pulpit is overhung by an august wooden canopy , called a sounding-board-study general , of course , and first lesson of mystery to the eyes of the children until what time their ears are opened to understand the spoken mysteries . There is no affectation of seriousness in the assembly , no mannerism of worship ; some would say too little of the manner of worship . They think of nothing , in fact , save what meets their intelligence and enters into them by that method . They appear like men who have a digestion for strong meat , and have no conception that trifles more delicate can be of any account to feed the system . Nothing is dull that has the matter in it , nothing long that has not exhausted the matter . If the minister speaks in his great coat and thick gloves or mittens , if the howling blasts of winter drive in across the assembly fresh streams of ventilation that move the hair upon their heads , they are none the less content , if only he gives them good strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , stolid faces , great thoughts are brewing , and these keep them warm . Free-will , fixed fate , foreknowledge absolute , trinity , redemption , special grace , eternitygive them anything high enough , and the tough muscle of their inward man will be climbing sturdily into it ; and if they go away having something to think of , they have had a good day . A perceptible glow will kindle in their hard faces , only when some one of the chief apostles , a Day , a Smith , or a Bellamy , has come to lead them up some higher pinnacle of thought , or pile upon their sturdy mind some heavier weight of argument-fainting never under any weight , even that // which , to the foreign critics of the discourses preached by them and others of their day , it seems impossible for any , the most cultivated audience in the world , to have supported . These royal men of homespun-how great a thing to them was religion ! The district school was there , the great Bellamy is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and between is close living and hard work , but they are kings alike in all ! True there was a rigor in their piety , a want of gentle feeling ; their Christian graces were cast-irQn shapes , answering with a hard metallic ring . But they stood the rough wear of life none the less durably for the excessive hardness of their temperament , kept their families and communities none the less truly , though it may be less benignly , under the sense of God and religion . If we find something to modify or soften , in their over-rigid notions of Christian living , it is yet something to know that what we are they have made us , and that , when we have done better for the ages that come after us , we shall have a more certain right to blame their austerities . View them as we may , there is yet , and always will be , something magnificent in their stern , practical fidelity to their principles . If they believed it to be more scriptural and Christian to begin their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish and other eastern nations , at the sunset on Saturday , their practice did not part company with their principles-it was sundown at sundown , not somewhere between that time and the next morning . Thus . being dispatched , when a lad , one Saturday afternoon in the winter , to bring home a few bushels of apples engaged of a farmer a mile distant , I remember how the careful , exact man looked first at the clock . then out the window at the sun , and turning to me said : " I can not measure out the apples in time for you to get home before sundown. you must come again Monday " ; then how I went home , venting my boyish im patfence in words not exactly respectful , assisted by the sunlight playing still upon the eastern hills , and got for my comfort a very unaccountably small amount of specially silent sympathy . I have never yet ascertained whether that refusal was exactly justified by the patriarchal authorities appealed to , or not . Be that as it may , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , for one , that I recall the honest , faithful days of homespun represented in it , days when men s lives went by their consciences , as their clocks did by the sun , with a feeling of profoundest reverence . It is more than respectable-it is sublime . If we find a more liberal way , and think we are safe in it , or if we are actually so , we can never yet break loose from a willing respect to this inflexible , majestic paternity of truth and godliness . Regarding , now , the homespun age as represented in these pictures of the social and religious life , we need , in order to a full understanding or conception of the powers and the possibilities of success embodied in it , to go a step farther ; to descend into the practical struggle of common life , and see how the muscle of energy and victory is developed , under its close necessities . The sons and daughters grew up , all , as you will perceive , in the closest habits of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by small bargains sharply turned , which many suppose to be an essential characteristic of the Yankee race , is yet no proper inbred distinction , but only a casual result , or incident , that pertains to the transition period between . In these olden times , these genuine days of homespun , they supposed , in their simplicity , that thrift represented work , and looked about seldom for any more delicate and sharper way of getting on . They did not call a man 's prop- // or another as being worth so much ; conceiving that he had it laid up as the reward or fruit of his deservings . The house was a factory on the farm , the farm a grower and producer for the house . The exchanges went on briskly enough , but required neither money nor trade . No affectation of polite living , no languishing airs of delicacy and softness in-doors , had begun to truake the fathers and sons impatient of hard work out of doors , and set them at contriving some easier and more plausible way of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as men whom the wives and daughters had dressed for work ; facing all weather , cold and hot , wet and dry , wrestling with the plow on the stony-sided hills , digging out the rocks by hard lifting and a good many very practical experiments in ' mechanics , dressing the flax , threshing the rye , dragging home , in the deep snows , the great wood-pile of the year s consumption , and then , when the day is ended-having no loose money to spend in taverns-taking their recreati on , all together , in reading , or singing , or happy talk , or silent looking in the fire and finally in sleep  --  to rise again , with the sun , and pray over the family Bible for just such another good day as the last . And so they lived , working out , each year , a little advance of thrift , just within the line of comfort . The picture still holds , in part , though greatly modified by the softened manner of in-door life , and the multiplied agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , on the whole , a hard and over-severe picture , and yet a picture that embodies the highest points of merit , connects the noblest results of character . Out of it , in one view , come all the successes we commemorate on this festive occasion . No mode of life was ever more exnensive ; it was life at the expense of labor too stringent to allow the highest culture and the most proper enjoy-639 ment . Even the dress of it was more expensive than we shall ever see again . Still it was a life of honesty and simple content and sturdy victory . Immoralities , that rot down the vigor and humble the consciousness of families , were as much less frequent , as they had less thought of adventure , less to do with travel and trade and money , and were closer to nature and the simple life of home . If they were sometimes drudged by their over-intense labor , still they were kept by it in a generally rugged state , both of body and mind . They kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character . The mothers spent their nervous impulse on their muscles , and had so much less need of keeping down the excess , or calming the unspent lightning , by doses of anodyne . In the play of the wheel , they spun fibre too within , and in the weaving , wove it close and firm . They realized , to the full , the poet 's picture of the maiden , who made a robust , happy life of peace , by the industry of her hands . " She never feels the spleen 's imagined pains , Nor melancholy stagnates in her veir*s ; She never loses life in thoughtless ease , Nor on the velvet couch invites disease ; ITer homespun dress , in simple neatness lies , And for no glaring equipage she sighs ; No midnight masquerade her beauty wears , And health , not paint , the fading bloom repairs . Be it true , as it may , that the mothers of the homespun age had a severe limit on their culture and accomplishments . Be it true that we demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the rugged necessities they bore . Still there is , after all , something very respectable in good health , and a great many graces play in its look that we love to study , even if there be a little show of toughness in their charms . How much is there , too , in the sublime motherhood of health ! Hence come , not always , I know , but oftenest , the THE AGE OF HOMESPUN. // heroes and the great minds gifted with volume and power and balanced for the manly virtues of truth , courage , persistency , and all sorts of victory . It was also a great point , in this homespun mode of life , that it imparted exactly what many speak of only with contempt , a closely girded habit of economy . Harnessed , all together , into the producing process , young and old , male and female , from the boy who rode the plow-horse , to the grandmother knitting under her spectacles , they had no conception of squandering lightly what they all had been at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce . They knew too exactly what everything cost , even small things , not to husband them carefully . Men of patrimony in the great world , therefore , noticing their small way in trade , or expenditure , are ready , as we often see , to charge them with meannesssimply because they knew things only in the small ; or , what is not far different , because they were too simple and rustic to have any conception of the big operations by which other men are wont to get their money without earning it , and lavish the more freely because it was not earned . Still this knowing life only in the small , it will he found , is really anything but meanness . Probably enough the man who is heard threshing in his barn of a winter evening , by the light of a lantern ( I knew such an example ) , will be seen driving his team next day , the coldest day of the year , through the deep snow to a distant woodlot , to draw a load for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haggles for a half-hour with the merchant over some small trade , is yet one who will keep watch , not unlikely , when the school-master , boarding round the district , comes to some hard quarter , and commence asking him to dinner , then to tea , then to stay over night , and literally boarding him , till the hard quarter is passed . Who now , in the great world of money , will do , not to say the same , as much , proportionally as much , in any of the pure hospitalities of life ? Besides , what sufficiently disproves any real meanness , it will be found that children brought up , in this way , to know things in the small-what they cost and what is their valuehave , in just that fact , one of the best securities of character and most certain elements of power and success in life ; because they expect to get on by small advances followed up and saved by others , not by sudden leaps of fortune that despise the slow but surer methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homespun , for example , sets off for Hartford , or Bridgeport , to exchange the little surplus of his year 's produc tion , carrying his provision with him and the fodder of his team , and taking his boy along to show him the great world , you may laugh at the simplicity , or pity , if you will , the sordid look of the picture ; but , five or ten years hence , this boy will probably enough be found in college , digging out the cent 's worths of his father 's money in hard study ; and some twenty years later , he will be returning , in his honors , as the celebrated Judge , or Governor , or Senator and public orator , from some one of the great States of the republic , to bless the sight once more of that venerated pair who shaped his beginnings and planted the small seeds of his future success . Small seeds , you may have thought of meanness ; but now they have grown up and blossomed into a large-minded life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . And just here , I am persuaded , is the secret , in no small degree , of the very peculiar success that has distinguished the sons of Connecticut , and , not least , those of Litchfield County , in their migration to other States . ft is because they have gone out in the wise economy of a simple , homespun training , expecting to get on in the world by merit and patience , and by a careful husbanding of small advances ; // secured in their virtue , by just that which makes their perseverance successful . For the men who see the great in the small , and go on to build the great by small increments , will commonly have an exact conscience too that beholds great principles in small things , and so form a character of integrity before both God and man , as solid and massive as the outward successes they conquer . The great men who think to be great in general , having yet nothing great in particular , are a much more windy affair . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unrecorded history of the times gone by . We must not think on such an occasion as this that the great men have made the history . Rather is it the history that has made the men . It is the homespun many , the simple Christian men and women of the century gone by , who bore their life-struggle faithfully in these valleys and among these hills , and who now are sleep*ng in the untitled graves of Christian worth and piety . These are they whom we are most especially to honor , and it is good for us all to see and know , in their example , how nobly fruitful and beneficent that virtue may be , which is too common to be distinguished , and it is thought of only a the worth of unhistoric men . Worth indeed it is , that worth which , being common , is the substructure and the prime condition of a happy , social state , and of all the honors that dignify its history-worth , not of men only , but quite as much of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **ry turn of my subject , how the age gone by receives a distinctive character from the queens of the distaff and the loom , and their princely motherhood . Let no woman imagine that she is without consequence , or motive to excellence , because she is not conspicuous . Oh , it is the greatness of woman that she is so much like the great powers of nature back of the noise and clatter of the world 's affairs , tempering all things with her benign influence only rhe more certainly because of her silence , greatest in her beneficence because most remote from ambition , most forgetful of herself and fame ; a better nature in the world that only waits to bless it , and refuses to be known save in the successes of others , whom she makes conspicuous ; satisfied most , in the honors that come not to herthat " Her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land . " . One thing , at least , I hope : that , in these illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dignity of work . How great an honor it is for the times gone by , that when so many schemes are on foot , as now , to raise the weak ; when the friends of the dejected classes of the world are proposing even to reorganize society itself for their benefit , trying to humanize punishments , to kindle hope in disability , and nurse depravity into a condition of comfort  --  a distinction how magnificent ! that our fathers and mothers of the century past had , in truth , no dejected classes , no disability , only here and there a drone of idleness , or a sporadic case of vice and poverty ; excelling , in the picture of social comfort and well-being actually realized , the most romantic visions of our new seers . They want a reorganization of society ! - something better than the Christian gospel and the Christian family state ! - some community in hollow-square , to protect them and coax them up into a life of respect , and help them to be men ! No , they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of savings , to encourage them and take the wardship of their cause . They knew how to make their money , and how to invest it , and take care of it , and make it productive ; how to build , and plant , and make sterility fruitful , and conquer all the hard weather of life . Their producing process took everything at a disadvantage ; for they had no capital , no machinery , no distribution of labor , nothing but wild forest and rock ; but they had mettle enough in // their character to conquer their defects of outfit and advantage . They sucked honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock . Nay , they even seemed to want something a little harder than nature in her softer moods could yield them . Their ideal of a Goshen they located , not in the rich alluvion of some fertile Nile , but upon the crest of the world , somewhere between the second and third heaven where Providence itself grows cold , and there , making warmth by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competence and wealth than the Goshen of the sunny Nile ever saw . Your condition will hereafter be softened , and your comforts multiplied . Let your culture be as much advanced . But let no delicate spirit that despises work grow up in your sons and daughters . Make these rocky hills smooth their faces and smile under your industry . Let no absurd ambition tempt you to imitate the manners of the great world of fashion , and rob you thus of the respect and dignity that pertain to manners properly your own . Maintain , above all , your religious exactness . Think what is true , and then respect yourselves in living exactly what you think . Fear God and keep his commandments , as your godly fathers and mothers did before you , and found , as we have seen , to be the beginning of wisdom . As their graves are with you , so be that faith in God which ennobled their lives and glorified their death an inheritance in you , and a legacy transmitted by you to your children .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
