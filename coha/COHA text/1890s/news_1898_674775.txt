txt In ordinary times the resignation of a Cabinet officer would have attracted a good deal of attention and the politicians would elaborately speculate as to the effect the change would have on the various factions of the party in power . But the dropping out of Mr. GARY from the Post Office Department , with his replacement by Mr. CHARLES E. &mu,; excites comment only because of the rumor circulated  --  among others , we regret to say , by The Evening Post  --  that it was caused by Mr. GARY 'S opposition to the policy of the Administration and his stubborn desire for peace . This rumor was promptly denied by Mr. GARY himself , who must be considered final authority even by those who would not believe the statement made from the President through the ordinary White House agency . Probably , on the whole , the Cabinet gains by the change . Even in full health Mr. GARY was not a strong man in the Cabinet . He had no special qualifications for his own department and none that made him a very valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were those of a conservative business man , not accustomed to or particularly interested in the larger aspects of public affairs . As far as the Post Office Department goes , Mr. SMITH will bring to it greater activity and a journalist 's capacity for mastering a relatively new subject . In the position of adviser to the President he will enjoy the particular confidence of his chief ; he will qwq much energy and ambition . The report that Secretary SHERMAN Was to resign is not confirmed , which is a pity . It was bad enough to have him cumber the foreign office at a time when delicate questions preceding war were constantly arising . It is far worse when questions may at any time come up of equal or greater delicacy and requiring prompt consideration and decision . It is getting to be an old story , and so long as there is no sign of action by the Pres- . Went the country will probably continue its wearily patient attitude , but a Secretary of State who thinks it of more importance to go home to luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of European Ministers at the American foreign office is liable at any moment to do or say something which the country can not tolerate . Why Mr. insists on running this risk , why he is content that the most important office in the Government should not merely be crippled but imperiled by the condition of its head , is past our comprehension . It admits of no creditable explanation . It creates a situation that at best is ridiculous and humiliating and that easily may be extremely dangerous . There is no hope that Mr. SHERMAN will give up the office except under pressure , and apparently he is in a position to resist any pressure that the President thinks it prudent to exert . Possibly Mr. HANNA , who is the only human being who has profited by the mortifying condition of affairs , could devise means to relieve the President , but he shows no inclination to do so . Sooner or later the President must act . Why not now ?                @ @ @ @ @
