It is a steel saw , weighing 110 tons , that will out a nickel-steel armor plate as an ordinary saw cuts a plank . These armcr plates range in weight from eight to thirty-eight tons , and reach a length of twenty feet and a thickness of twenty Inches . The armor of a modern war vessel can not be put on like a sock all in one piece . It is built on the frame of the ship , something like the scales on a fish .

This has been done heretofore with the planing machines , which , slowly and laboriously , a shaving at a time , out them down to the desired shape . This saw has a blade 7is feet in diameter , geared from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tilting table , which is adjustable to any angle and presented to the edge of the saw endwise . The forward motion of the carrying table thrusts the plate steadily against the teeth . and an angular slab of ( sold nickel-steel weighing perhaps a dozen tons is taken off like the slab off a pine log . It will be used also for cutting plates into any desired dimension &; With the revival of naval construction the problem of providing heavy armor rapidly has troubled more than one Secretary of the Navy and challenged the enterprise of American manufacturers . This is the latest contribution to its solution , and comes opportunely at the time when Chairman Herbert of the Naval Appropriations Committee is arguing against authorizing the construction of any additional battle ships because there has been delay iu furnishing armor plate . Tnis saw will be the first of its kind used in this country . It is an Improvement on a similar tool used in the Krupp Cannon Works at Essen , Prussia . It cost about $35,000 and will be set up early next month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
