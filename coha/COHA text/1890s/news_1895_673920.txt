txt We make some important additions this morning to our list of the increases of wages granted since the latter part of March , the seventh installment of which was published on the 27th ' ult . The acceptance in the bar-iron industry of the new wage scale prepared by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers will have the effect of increasing wages in many mills for the benefit of thousands of employes , because this is a sliding scale , based upon the price of bar iron , and that price has recently been increased by two advances of $2 per ton each . In the Southern iron district the sharp increase of the price of foundry pig iron ( now $0.73 as against $7 before the beginning of the upward movement ) has carried up with it , by the terms of the wages contracts , the wages of 11,000 miners ( increased 13 per cent. ) and the wages of a large number of men employed at the furnaces . Among other prominent concerns doing business elsewhere which have granted increases in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2,000 men ; the Lackawanna Iron and Steel ** men ; several woolen factories , and two large cotton mills at Lewiston , Me . The Reading Railroad Company has promised to restore the old scale in its shops on or before Oct. 1 . It is no longer practicable to state exactly the number of companies and firms which have made increases , owing to the fact that the adoption of new scales in certain branches of the iron industry has affected a large number of plants in each branch . The full number of manufacturers in each branch , however . can not be included in the enumeration , because there are some concerns which are not governed by the scales , new or old . Our purpose is to be guided by all accessible information as to the number , and to be conservative where estimates must be made . Our totals on the 27th ult. were 345 companies or firms and about 232,000 employe s . These ' did not include the sheet-iron and tin-plate mills affected by the new scales , or their 32,000 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance for the bariron and other mills by which the new scales have been accepted , we have now a total of not less than 315,000 employes and not less than 430 employing concerns .
