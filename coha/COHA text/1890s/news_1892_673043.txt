txt Tho angel of peace did not come very near the German Catholic Congress to-day . The-article in Monday 's issue of THE TIMES has surprised the English-reading portion of delegates , priests , and higher dignitaries . THE TustEs 's correspondent learns on good authority that early this morning , even before pontifical mass was celebrated in St. Peter 's , an effort was made by a few of the more secretive and conservative priests to have the aggressive character of the proposed speeches resubmitted to censorship and modified . The effort certainly frilled as far as the German speakers were concerned , in spite of the fact that Archbishop Corrigan himself had counseled moderation for the sake of prudence . The diversity of sentiment , or . to speak more correctly , the diversity in methods of expressing sentiments , was clearly shown at the pontifical high mass . A German doctor of divinity named A. Hotter had been chosen to deliver the sermon during the mass . This sermon was not the inspiration of the moment . but had been carefully prepared , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered copies of it were offered for sale at the price of 10 cents a copy . The sermon was delivered and printed in the German language . Among other things this reverend father said : " We . indeed , do not believe In that sickly nationalism which , after the manner of Gallicanism , it Is proposed to revive in this country under the name of Americanism . This is a bugbear good enough to frighten children and catch fools . But they who labor for this purpose labor in vain . " The German name has too good a sound in this country to be belittled by such know-nothing attempts , which arise from hatred and despair .. " We repeat what we have said before , that no one shall dare to overthrow our public schools , and if the attempt should be made we would gather under the banner of the Biehops of the provinces of . miiwaukee and Chicago . Let the hand be accursed that strikes at our German Catholic schools . " This German speech was in very strange contrast to what Archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Young Men 's Society , and , while declaring his thorough sympathy with the purposes of the congress , expressly disavowed Cahenslyism , ? ? as misinterpreted by its enemies . " He protested , in language stronger than he is wont to use . that Catholics wore loyal to American Institutions . Ho claimed that the very fact of a man beingla good Catholic and loyal to St. Peter wasproof suniceent of his Americanism . At 3 o'clock in the afternoon there was a meeting of the Society of German Priests in America . Another evidence of the caution in certain quarters was the feet that a scheme existed to commit the priests to German Catholic colonization in some counties in the State of Texas . The question of whether it would be advisable to transplant the German institution of Catholic workingmen 's unions to this soil was the subject of a lively debate . It was decided to take steps in this direction and to give material support toward forming such associations . More definite plans in regard to this idea will be formed later . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members on the subject of the coming Columbus celebration . Tho meeting in the evening , which was held in Caledonian Park , was a most improssive one . It was also a very characteristic demonstration and stave the observer a good insight of the aims and purposes of the congress . The meeting was called to order by Dr. Herbormania of New-York City . He made quite an extended speech , and said much - which had been said before . When he referred to the Bennett law as an " infamous statute " and when he proclaimed the repeal of the law as a splendid Catholic victory , he was cheered again and again . m ? ' I do not know , " he said , " nor do I care . whether new struggles await ; all I wish to say is this : that we are not afraid of our enemies . " Applianse . After some more remarks of that kind the Chairman of the meeting introduced Gov . Abbott , whose appearance upon the platform was the occasion for prolonged cheers . Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked demagogism . " There is no public sentiment in this State , " said be , " which would take the child away from the parent who wants to educate him as ho thinks is best . 1 see no objection to the object of this congress if that object be , as has been asserted , to protect German-Catholic emigrants in their Utah after their arrival in this country . " The State has no right to Interfere with the religious convictions and traditions of Catholic families . " These words wore . of course , cheered to the echo , and the Governor retired . Bishop Nigger took occasion to thank the Governor for the expression of such sentiments . and said lie knew that the Governor 's words came from the depths of his heart . There was no room , the Bishop said . for any such law as the Bennett law in the State of New-Jersey . There were 27,000 children in Catholic uarochial schools in New-Jersey , and he proposed to keep thorn there . At the end of his remarks the Bishop administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received it kneeling devoutly . After the Bishop had ended , Dr. Herbermann introduced the chief speaker of the evening on the chief topic . The enter speaker was Mgr . Schroeder irom the Catholic University at Washington and the chief topic was the Roman question . Mgr . Schroeder was received with deateuing applause . He is a stout , stockily-built man , with a decidedly German cast of features . He looks more like the jocund " Prarrer " in the Tyrol than like a Monsignor in the Roman Church . But it was to become apparent in a very few minutes why the Pope had bestowed this honorable title on Prof. Schroeder . The Monsignor is a splendid orator , and his full , vigorous . guttural German voice reverberated mightily through the length and breadth of the vast halL Figuratively speaking . the Monsignor waved the papal flag all over the platform , and , though his audience was spellbound , there were some of his utterances which even this audience hesitated to applaud . The Monsignor started in by way of replying , in caustic tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , ho said , had not shrunk from saying that he degraded himself by participating in the deliberations of the German Catholic Congress and speaking in his native tongue . To those critics he wished to say that when the glory or the Church Is to be defended , the place of a catholic professor is to be with the defenders . The Monsignor referred to the truly Roman Catholic sentiment as expressed by the Governor . " We no not want to be more American than such Americans as the Governor of New-Jersey . " This was followed by uproarious cheers . " At the head of our demands , " said the Monsignor , " there is and there always will be this : restoration of the temporal power of the Pope . " There was very little applause at this , but it made the Mongnor all the bolder . ? ? I have nompatience. " he cried , " With those languid and lukewarm Catholics who would fain accept the loss of the Pope 's temporal power as an accomplished fact . " Raising his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after waiting a minute to enhance the oratorical effect , the speaker thundered : " The robbery of the Pope was a robbery of God . It seas u horrible sacrilege . Shame on those Catholic journals which keep silence on a subject like this ! Shame ou those Catholics who would turn the Catholic press into a dead factor by dodging the main issue of these times I There is a sickly sentimental nationalism abroad in this country , but wo are not afraid of it , ' whether it appear in the shape of an Italian Irredentist , or In the shape of a Chauvinist on the banks of the Seine , or in the shape of the ' patented , only . genuine Amore can . ' " There is no compromise with Liberalism on the question of the restoration of the temporal power . " The remarks of the Monsignor flavored strongly of his panegyrics on Cahenelyisin delivered among German friends iu Germany . In conclusion the speaker drew a pathetic picture of the ? Moines of the Pope in the Vatican , whom lie described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he was proud of his Cahenslyism. as long as such good Americans as Judge Dunn believed in Cahenslyism . " At the end of his . speech the Monsignor said that the Catholic- would still recognize the Pope as a temporal Prince , and then &dramatic; scene followed . " I propose . " cried the Monsignor , " three cheers for our Holy Father , Pope . and King , " ( " Papet and Koenig . " ) and while the audience cheered itself hoarse the Monsignor kept on shouting ? ? Papas and Koenig . " A very feeble and pointless speech followed . It was delivered by an obscure New-York lawyer . After a musical interruption the " Boy Orator . " a youth named Schilling from New York , was let loose , and he inflicted forty minutes of a well-studied essay on Columbus on the audience . Tho last speaker was Dr. August Kayser , from Detroit , a very prominent Catholic littdrateur of the Northwest . His speech was interesting , but dealt too much in ancient history . Toward the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic . " and the good old times of the Inquisition . He also invoked curses on the enemiesnf the parochial schools . He concluded with some very significant remarks about those who sought to spread error even in their own fold . WILLIAM ' M. RICHARDS DEAD . STRICKEN WITH HEART DISEASE WHILE ON AN ANNEX BOAT .

After a long period of peace , when our overburdened countrymen ask for relief and a restoration to a fuller enjoyment of their incomes and earnings , they are met by the claim that tariff taxation for the sake of protection is an American system , the continuance of which is necessary in order that high wages may be paid to our workingmen and a home market be provided for our farm products . These pretenses should no longer deceive. ? Grover Cleveland 's Leiter of Acceptance . FAILED TO RILL BIS SON-IN-LATV . BUT WOOD SHOT HIMSELF DEAD  --  END OF A FAMILY QUARREL . Jersey City Heights was the scene of another tragedy yesterday , the actors in which are wellknown members of society in that locality . George W.
