txt The approaching trial of the cruiser Philadelphia , which was launched last Autumn , becomes the more interesting because her contract substitutes speed for horse power as the guaranteed . element Which is to earn premiums for excess or forfeit penalties for shortcomings . The main advantage in this arrangement , which applies also to the San . Francisco and the other later vessels , is its dealing with the end and not with the means . The Government wants the speed , while the amount of engine power which is to produce that speed is the contractor 's business . If the indicated horse power is all right and the speed is yet far below what the Government needs , the former element is small consolation . On the other hand , if the speed is more than the Government expected , it can well afford to pay a premium for the excess , even if produced by less horse power than was supposed to be necessary . Bat while speed is what the Government - wants it also desires to be as sure of getting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calculated with precision . To determine speed with sufficient exactness by the patent logs is impracticable , as experience has shown . It has been suggested that , by taking the number of revolutions of the machinery necessary to go a carefullymeasured short distance , of a mile or two , under various conditions , a trial of four hours could be had anywhere . and the equivalent speed then calculated from those data . But probably the most satisfactory solution to all , and certainly to the public in general , would be the careful measuring off of a regular Government course in shore waters , perhaps in Long Island Sound or else south of Long Island , of sufficient extent to make going forth and back over it once a full trial of four hours . Observers , properly stationed , could determine the influences of tide , currents , and so on , and the cost would be a small matter considering that the Government or the contractor might be unjustly deprived of $50,000 by an error of even a quarter of a knot in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining speed .
