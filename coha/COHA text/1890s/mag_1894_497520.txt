DISFRANCHISED CLASSES . XVITH inconsiderable exceptions , the common sense of the human race , as expressed in civil government , has confined its prerogatives to men . When necessary to preserve an unbroken line in hereditary monarchies , women have been invested with sovereignty . In some communities , where property qualifications exist , they possess a limited right to vote , and to hold minor executive offices . To portray an idiot , a criminal in prison garb , an Indian in barbaric finery , a lunatic staring in frenzy , and a woman whose features indicate intelligence and refinement , and to entitle the representation , " American Woman and her Political Peers , " may beguile the unwary , but others will ask , Does the picture include all disfranchised classes ? and , Is their exclusion from the suffrage for similar reasons ? It does not include all . To complete the picture , might be added a portrait ofAlexand* Hamilton , who , at the appearance of trouble between Great Britain and the Colonies , when he was still a school-boy barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defense of the rights of the Colonies which were at first taken for the production of John Jay ; and who , when only twenty ,  --  and consequently not allowed to vote ,  --  was aide-de-camp to Washington . There would also be needed a portrait of one of the distinguished foreigners who , after a study of the Constitution of this country , have adopted it as their own , and yet , after arriving , are disfranchised for a term of years . Foreigners are disfranchised for a period of time assumed to be long enough for men of average ability to comprehend the institutions and interests , and to identify themselves therewith sufficiently to " have a stake in the country " ; criminals are not allowed to vote because , being foes to society and to the government , they have forfeited all claim to personal and PERILS OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE . political liberty ; insane persons and idiots are debarred , being incompetent to understand ; Indians , on account of their tribal claims to an independent sovereignty , and other causes peculiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under twenty-one years of age are not permitted to vote because it is assumed that the average male has not the knowledge and stability of character wisely to exercise the franchise until he has had twenty-one years of life in the land of his birth . Woman is not refused admission to the suffrage on any of these grounds . The picture is not true to life , and the ideas which it is designed to suggest confuse rather than elucidate the question whether women should be eligible to vote , and hold office , upon the same terms as men . Whether the suffrage shall be conferred upon any class of men or women can not be decided exclusively upon the question of natural rights . These do , indeed , require the protection of all in the enjoyment of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , so long as the same are exercised in a manner compatible with the rights of others . The arrival of a second man upon a desert isla.i* x*uld necessitate a whole series of compromises which , if not accepted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fligl**war to the death . In this country it is agreed that the majority of voters shall rule . What fundamental principle gives to two millions the absolute right to rule over two millions less one ? As at the age of seventeen some are better qualified for the suffrage than many at forty , what absolute natural right decrees that none shall exercise the franchise until twenty-one years old ? These , and many other provisions , are compromises to which the people submit for the sake of the results . Should a citizen change his residence from one State to another , he must remain there a specified time before he can vote ; nor could he , one day after legally changing his residence , return and cast a ballot where he had lived all his life . If born in Canada , though brought over the line when an infant , he could never become President . Also , every citizen must vote at such times and places as the law prescribes . Nor can one unavoidably detained from his legal residence , even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and navy , or in the Federal Congress , demand a subsequent opportunity , or be permitted to deposit a sealed ballot in advance of the time , forward the same , or vote by proxy . FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIETY . AN advocate of woman suffrage declares that its opponents " must show that it is incompatible either with the best conception of the State , or with the nature of womanhood . " While the burden of proof should rest upon those who would change the universal practice , I hold , and will present the grounds for the belief that to impose direct responsibility in this particular upon women is incompatible with the nature of womanhood , and with the best conception of the State . There is a feminine , as well as a masculine , soul ; a spiritual sex , as well as a corporeal . Frederic Harrison , in contrasting men and women , justly says , " Not one man in ten can compare with the average woman in tact , subtlety of observation , in refinement of mental habit , in rapidity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perseverance , in passive endurance , in dealing with the mmutest surroundings of comfort , grace , and convenience " He predicates of man , as distinguished from woman , " a greater capacity for prolonged attention , intense abstraction , wide range , extfaordinary complication , immense endurance , intensity , variety , and majesty of will . " From the same difference arise the virtues and vices , respectively , of the sexes* modified by different degrees of physical strength . If there be no such feminine nature as distinguished from the masculine ; * if the abstraction of the mental and spiritual elements peculiar to woman , and their being replaced by those characteristic of man , would make no radical and harmful difference in the constitution of society , there is no reason for exempting women from the responsibilities of government . On closely considering the State , it appears that the fundamental fact is not most frequently the subject of discussion . The political economist occasionally refers to it , the statesman and legislator deal with a few of its phases , it is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various details in a thousand forms , butit is seldom comprehended as a whole . That fact is that the individuals who form the State are constantly changing , are proceeding , in fact , across the earth , finally disappearing , rather than permanently domiciled upon it . Nevertheless , the State endures because there are constantly fresh arrivals through the fami lies into which society is divided . The State directly takes no cognizance of these immature beings , who , though human , are without strength or understanding . Their parents are their rulers , responsible for their support , and exercising the prerogatives of government , issuing mandates , requiring submission ; permitted to chastise , imprison , and to direct their actions in numberless ways . It depends upon the parents to train them in such a manner as to qualify them for the duties of citizenship , according to the statutes and laws of the land . Only when parents are incapable or unwilling to discharge their responsibilities does the State take cognizance of the situation . In proportion as this State within a State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , and prosperous . It is the fountain of private , and the source of public , morality . Whatever may be said of a few minds of a peculiar structure , lifelong partnerships for better or worse could not be maintained by two natures of the same kind , debating all questions in the same plane , with no natural predominating tendency . The coherence and permanence of the family depend upon the difference in the mental and emotional constitution of men and women . The family is a union of two manifestations of a common human nature , masculine and feminine of soul as well as body ; molding , governing , and guiding the children , each after its own manner , and diffusing through society the blended influence of wife , mother , daughter , sister , and husband , father , son , and brother . The bearing of these principles upon the relations of wives and mothers to the suffrage is that to govern in the State would unfit woiwan for her position in the family . It is mere sophism to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballotbox could not produce such a result . Unless women are to be treated like children , and furnished with the ballot by men , it is not the mere dropping of a piece of paper , for it implies the whole mode of thinking , feeling , and acting , of which a vote is the concentrated expression . " The vote is the expression of government ; voting is governing . " To vote intelligently is to think and act in the imperative mood ; and to be qualified as voters , girls must be trained to think , feel , and act in the spirit of boys . To avoid the force of this , it would be necessary to show that women will not be affected in this way , or that , should they be , no harm will result . John Stuart Mill admits that it will produce this effect , and asserts that women are held " in subjection " in the family , and should be emancipated . Wendell Phillips said , " No one can foresee the effect ; therefore the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " under all possible circumstances feminine instincts will preserve woman . " " Plunging in " without a high probability that the effect will be good is never wise , except when destruction impends over the existing situation . To assume that either men or women will remain unchanged in their intellectual , moral , and emotional susceptibilities , whatever their situation , is contrary to the facts of evolution , environment , and culture . In countless individual cases , and even in nations , woman has shown a capacity to rise or fall , a susceptibility to moral and intellectual modifications not surpassed , if equaled , by men . Not only would the governing spirit become a part of her character , greatly obstructing the discharge of the duties of home , but it would make her position there an insupportable restraint . Man is naturally self-reliant ; woman may , in an emergency , develop self-reliance and complete independence ; but is naturally disposed either to coalesce in the determining tendency of her husband , or to control it by persuasion . Imbued with the governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as would he if similarly placed . This is avowed by many advocates of woman suffrage , and held up as a result to be desired . The more consistent go fearlessly to the end , and define marriage as a civil contract to be terminated at the will of either party , and society as a collection of independent units instead of an assemblage of families . That there are exceptions to the ideal family , here assumed as the nucleus of society , is true . Some women rule their husbands ; a larger number through the misfortune , weakness , or wickedness of the husband are obliged to support the family , and there are many single women and widows . These exceptions to the general law often have much to bear ; but not so much as to justify the overthrow of the whole structure with a view to rebuild upon exceptions . Every female child must be presumed eligible to wifehood and motherhood ; therefore the whole sex should be left to the exercise of that kind of influence for which their nature and relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of society . An argument drawn from exceptions may be very plausibly affirmed . Suppose a movement to enact a law requiring the training of all children in public institutions . In its support it might be maintained that there are numerous orphans , that many children have lost one parent , and that many parents are cruel , intemperate , incompetent , or unfaithful ; that relatively few feel , and conscientiously and intelligently discharge , their responsibilities . These propositions are indisputable : how then shall the scheme to require all children to be educated by the State be shown to be untenable ? Only by affirming that the general law of nature is that parents must be responsible for their offspring . To remove the children of those willing and able to train them , because of these exceptions , would be cruel and unjust ; and such a wholesale destruction of home life is not necessary , because the general rule is that parents , with all their imperfections , do train their children in a manner better adapted to promote the public weal than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by private philanthropy , or by special statutes which are compatible with the effectual working of the general law . The same method of reasoning vindicates the conclusion that the general law necessary for the preservation of the family should not be overthrown in order that unmarried women and widows might be introduced into political life . Nor would a specific statute admitting single women to the suffrage , and excluding married women therefrom , be expedient or right ; for then another evil of stupendous proportions would result , namely : the putting of a premium upon the unmarried or childless condition , since such women would have much more time and strength for the political arena than wives and mothers , and could gain many more personal , pecuniary , and political advantages . NOTABLE REVER5AL5 OF OPINION . IT was a deep and serious consideration of these things which led some of the greatest of men to reverse their opinions after having been strongly in favor of woman suffrage , or inclined to espouse it . Horace Bushnell , when assured that the principles of progress which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopened the question . After protracted thought he was forced to the conclusion that it would be " a reform against nature . " John Bright , the patriot , the tried and valued friend of every movement for the general benefit of woman , accustomed to equality of women in Friends ' meetings , was one of those who on May 20 , 1867 , voted in favor of Mr. Mill 's amendment to strike out of a reform bill the word man , and insert the word person . Nine years afterward , namely , in March , 1876 , he spoke against the enfranchisement of women . When charged with having changed his opinions , he said that he gave Mr. Mill the benefit of the doubt , and sympathized with him in a courageous stand , and in a letter published in " The Woman Question in Europe , " by Theodore Stanton , he wrote : // I can not give you all the reasons for the view I take , but I act from the belief that to introduce women into the strife of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to our own sex no possible good could arise . When women are not safe under the charge or care of fathers , husbands , brothers , and sons , it is the fault of our non-civilization , and not of our laws . As civilization founded on Christian principles advances , women will gain all that is right for them to have , though they are not seen contending in the strife of political parties . To this he adds personal testimony : In my experience I have observed evil results to many women who have entered hotly into political conflict and discussion . I would save them from it . I am , respectfully yours , JOHN BRIGHT . Goldwin Smith is also one of those who voted with Mr. Mill . He was led to change his opinion by considerations similar to those adduced by Mr. Bright , and adds that another important reason was that he found " that those women whom he had always regarded as the best representatives of their sex among his acquaintances were by no means in favor of the change. *1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former position , and maintains that there are fundamental reasons forkeeping the spheres of the sexes distinct . He had formerly argued the matter " from the point of view of a general principle of individual rights , " but he finds that this can not be sustained , as he " discovers mental and emotional differences between the sexes , which disqualify women for the burdens of government and the exercise of its functions . " Mr. Gladstone , * who had sometimes spoken as though he thought the change might have more to be said in its favor than against it , was appealed to two years ago in the most desperate crisis of his life by those women in England who demand the suffrage offering their support if he would avow himself in favor of the principle . He sat down to investigate it in the light of the bill then proposed in parliament , " Extending Parliamentary Suffrage to Women , " but confined to unmarried women , and after pointing out the impropriety of that proposal says : I speak of the change as being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I am bound in considering this bill to take into view not only what it enacts , but what it involves . . . .

I woman on the same footing in regard to Parliamentary elections as the individual man . She is to vote , she is to propose or nominate , she is to be designated by the law as competent to use and to direct , with advantage not only to the community but to herself , all those public agencies which belong to our system of parliamentary representation . She - not the individual woman marked by special tastes , possessed of special gifts , but the woman as such - is by these changes to be plenarily launched into the whirlpool of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , and such as it is to be in the twentieth century . - A permanent and vast difference of type has been impressed upon woman and man respectively by the Maker of both . Their differences of social office rest mainly upon causes not flexible and elastic like most mental qualities , but physical and in their nature unchangeable . I , for one , am not prepared to say which of the two classes has the higher , and which the other , province , but I recognize the subtle and profound character of the difference b4ween them . - . . I am not without fear lest , beginning with the state , we should eventually have been found to have intruded into what is yet more fundamental and sacred , the precinct of the family , and should dislocate or injuriously modify the relations of domestic life . . . - As this is not a party question , or a class question , so neither is it a sex question . I have no fear lest the woman should encroach upon the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite her unwittingly to trespass upon the delicacy , the purity , the refinement , the elevation of her own nature , which are the present sources of its power . I admit that in the universities , in the professions , in the secondary circles of public acti*n , we have already gone so far as to give a shadow of plausibility to the present proposals to go farther ; but it is a shadow only , for we have done nothing that plunges the woman as such into the turmoil of masculine life . Upon Bishop John H. Vincent , the founder of Chautauqua , the consideration of this subject has naturally been forced , and to it he has given years of reflection , closely following the influence of modern general and higher education upon society , and in particular upon the home . In former years he was an advocate of woman suffrage ; but though enthusiastically devoted to the spread of knowledge , and having distributed diplomas to thousands of women who have pursued the extended course of reading of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In response to a request for a concise statement of the grounds which led to the change of his views , I received the letter which appears as a foot-note. ' find some worthy women defending it , but the majority of our best women , especially our most intelligent , domestic , and godly mothers , neither ask for nor desire it . The instinct of motherhood is against it . The basal conviction of our best manhood is against it . The movement is at root a protest against the representa // AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENTS WEIGHED . THE previous considerations , if well founded , will be sufficient to deter every thoughtful citizen who believes the family to be the foundation and safeguard of all that is valuable in civilization from attempting an experiment so dangerous ; yet an examination of the popular phrases relied upon to prepare the way for the plunge seems necessary . It is alleged that " it is obviously fair and right that those who obey the laws should have a voice in making them ; that all who pay the taxes should have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent women until women shall have legally consented to it , and this they have never done . " But if it is better to exempt them from the responsibilities of government , that the influence which they ' are naturally qualified to exert , and which is essential to the well-being of society , may not be diminished , it would not be " fair and right " to give women the same kind of voice in making laws that men have . Woman 's influence in forming the characters and principles of the law-makers insures care for her . " No taxation without representation " as an abstract principle i 's just , but it does not follow that the representation must be identical . The authors of the Declaration of Independence , the framers of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights , did not perceive any incongruity between declaring that " all men are born free and equal , " that there should be " no taxation without representation , " that " governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed , " and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Taxation is not levied upon the property of men and women respectively upon different principles , but upon property as such by whomsoever held . The property rights of woman are better protected now than they could be if she were actively engaged in politics . Not long since , tive relations and functions by virtue of which each sex depends upon and is exalted by the other . This theory and policy , tending to the subversion of the natural and divine order , must make man less a man , and woman less a woman . A distinguished woman advocate of this suffrage movement says , " We need the ballot to protect us against men . " When one sex is compelled thus to protect itself against the other the foundations of society are already crumbling . Woman now makes man what he is . She controls him as babe , boy , manly son , brother , lover , husband , father . Her influence is enormous . If she use it wisely , she needs no additional power . If she abuse her opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now without measure , will be limited to the value of a single ballot , and her control over from two to five additional votes forfeited. a lady of rare intelligence , arguing in favor of the suffrage , stated that it was proposed to pave a street in which she lived , contrary to the judgment and wishes of the property-hold .. ers , most of whom were widows and single women . She attributed the scheme to " recklessness on the part of men , most of whom paid no taxes . Had she and her friends been able to vote , such a thing would not have been attempted . " When asked concerning the outcome , the response was that she and a few other interested women " went to the leaders of both parties , and easily persuaded them to defeat the proposition . " She did not appear to percetve that if she had been a voter her influence would have been confined to members of her own party . Should it be said that this principle , if admitted , would justify slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery was selfaggrandizement by individuals , its method the violent restraint of personal liberty . But the motive which relieves woman from government is the belief that the exercise of the suffrage by her will work an injury to herself and to the family , and thereby to the State . The proposition that men can not represent women until they have legally consented to it is specious , but not sound . Who has ever been asked whether he consents to the government that exists here ? That government was established before the present inhabitants were born . Under it the supreme power inheres in adult male citizens . The consent of the governed is and must be taken for granted , except as changes are made by constitutional methods , until a revolution arises . Then all questions sink out of sight save this , " Shall the government stand ? " and that question must be decided by the arbitrament of war . Itis affirmed that " capacity indicates sphere ; woman has a capacity to vote intelligently , therefore she should be empowered to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot would increase her influence as it does that of man . " There are various acts for which The curse of America to-day is in the dominated partizan vote  --  the vote of ignorance and superstition . Shall we help matters by doubling this dangerous mass ? Free from the direct complications and passions of the political arena , the best women may exert a conservative and moral influence over men as voters . Force her down into the same bad atmosphere , and both man and woman must inevitably suffer incalculable loss . We know what womnn can be in the " com . * in " riots , ' ' and on the " rostrum. ** Woman can , through the votes of men , have every right to which she is entitled . All she has man has gladly given her . It is his glory to represent her . To rob him of this right is to weaken both . He and she are just now in danger through his mistaken courtesy . JOHN H. VINCENT . TOPEKA , Kansas , April i8 , 1894. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked or compelled by the law to perform . If it be said , Why not leave the question to her judgment and instincts ? it is because the qualifications of voters must be prescribed by law . If the population of the globe consisted exclusively of men or women , to confer the ballot upon any who had been without it would increase their dignity and authority . But since it is composed of both , and woman*s influence is not derived from authority , or her true dignity symbolized by the ballot , the clenched fist , or the drawn sword , it would add nothing to her power . The claim is made that " woman suffrage has worked beneficially wherever tried . " It was tried in NewJersey . On July 2,1776 , the provincial assembly conferred the suffrage upon women ; in 1797 seventy-five women voted , and in the Presidential election of i 8oo a large number availed themselves of the privilege . At first the law was construed to admit single women only , but afterward it was made to include females eighteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the spring of 1807 a special election was held in Essex County to decide on the location of the courthouse and jail . Newark and vicinity struggled to retain the county buildings , Elizabethtown to remove them . The contest waxed warm , and , according to a paper on " The Origin , Practice , and Prohibition of Female Suffrage in New Jersey , " read by the Hon. William A. Whitehead , Corresponding Secreta*ry of the New Jersey Historical Society , It was soon found , though only women of full age , possessing the required property qualification , were permitted by judges of election to vote , that every married woman in the country was not only of " full age , " but also " worth fifty pounds proclamation money clear estate , " and as such entitled to vote if they chose . And not only once , but as often as , by change of dress or complicity of the inspectors , they might be able to repeat the process . In Acquackanonk township , thought to contain about three hundred voters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interest of Newark . One woman voted three times . Her name was Mary Johnson , and she cast her first vote under that name . Afterward , as a somewhat stouter-looking woman , she voted as Mary Still , and later in the day as a corpulent person whose name was Mary Yet . The legislature set aside the election as fraudulent , and the whole State was so disgusted that an act was passed restricting the suffrage to white male citizens twenty-one years of age . It was tried in Utah . Introduced by the Mormons , who designed by it to maintain their ascendancy over the Gentiles , the women supported not only polygamy wherever they had an opportunity , but anything else suggested by the Mormon hierarchy . On March 22 , 1882 , the Federal Congress passed an act deciding that no polygamist , or any woman cohabiting with such , could take part in any election . this left the wives of monogamists , and unmarried women , in possession of their vote ; but the Edmunds-Tucker bill , designed to destroy polygamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , withdrew the suffrage from all women in Utah . " It has been triedin the great State of Wyoming , where it has worked so beneficially that the legislature has unanimously adopted a resolution of commendation . " The entire population of the State of Wyoming , according to the census of 1890 , is only 60,705 , of which 39,343 are males and 21,362 females . The largest city is Cheyenne , with a population of i 1,690 , and the next , Laramie , which has 6388 . Besides these there was only one town with a population of more than 3000 , and only one with more than two and less than three , and only four with more than ooo and less than two . Of the population of the State , 16,291 are between five and twenty years of age , and there are only 27,044 males of voting age in the State ; and this sparse population is scattered over an area twice that of the State of New York . According to Judge Cary of Wyoming the women consist of less than twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half of them go to the polls . " The complacency with which the legislature unanimously praises itself and its constituents has often been paralleled , but in the absence of details can hardly be regarded as the best testimony of which the case admits . None of the questions comprehended in the government of dense populations and vast cities is brought to the test . Citizens so generally isolated are practically a law to themselves . Pauperism would not be likely to exist under such conditions ; vice in many sections could be practised without attracting attention ; crowds at elections , in the absence of people enough to make a crowd , would be difficult to assemble . Unless the State has been grossly slandered , various troubles have occurred within a few years approximating the gravity of civil war . There is no unusual restraint upon the sale of liquor , and little attention is paid to enforcing such laws as women might be supposed to be specially interested to maintain . Without intending to reflect in a wholesale way upon the officers elected in that State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , show that , as a whole , they do not merit any unusual eulogium . But the population is too small , and // the conditions are too peculiar , to make the experiment of any value ; nor is the legislative testimony of importance when it is considered that any class , male or female , the commendation of whose influence might be under consideration , contains a sufficient number who would execute vengeance at the polls upon those who would venture to take a negative position . " Women are better than men , and therefore would make better laws , and would reform politics . " To show that women are better than men it is customary to present statistics of the number of the sexes respectively in prisons and in churches . Undoubtedly more than two thirds of the imprisoned criminals of the country are men , and probably more than two thirds of the communicants of the churches are women . But that this indicates that women are naturally better than men it is easier to assert than to prove . The majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurous lives , away from home . Men have excessive physical energy , which frequently involves them in fierce conflicts . When they commit crimes they are more likely , under the present regime , to be convicted ; for juries dislike to convict women , especially of crimes punished by long terms of imprisonment or death . Men 's crimes are generally of violence , the result of excess , or distortion of those natural characteristics which in normal degree and legitimate use give them the power of defense and aggression . Women 's abstention from crimes of violence is due to those characteristics which fit them for the persuasive influence which in their normal condition they exert.1 The same differences affect their attendance at church . The majority of church-going women spend their lives during the week at home , so that to attend religious meetings is a pleasant variety . Most men spend their lives away from home in laborious exercises , for which they find little relief in attending church , except when sustained by high religious motives . That under ordinary circumstances the instincts of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt ; but how far their temperaments would affect the character of special enactments , and how far their personal prejudices and prepossessions would affect their political action , are practical questions of moment . " Women will always vote against war , and thus put an end to it in the world . They will not send their husbands , brothers , fathers , and friends to the slaughter . " Does history support this statement ? WheriWith these general views of men and women in respect to crime , etc. , Frances E. Willard seems to agree ; for in an article entitled " The Woman 's Cause is Man 's Cause , " in the " Arena " for May , 1892 , she ever there has been a war , women have been as much interested as men . They have even encouraged their husbands , fathers , brothers , and lovers to enlist , and would have despised them if they had not .

This follows only when the normal dissimilarity in the constitution of the sexes- " a difference but not a scale of inferiority or superiority " - is ignored or underestimated . The proper characterization of such culture is the lower education . iv . INSURMOUNTABLE OBJECTIONS . THE practical objections to woman suffrage can be most clearly stated in detail . Universal suffrage exists in the United S/a/es , with the exception of the classes hereinbefore specl/led . It is ati unreasonable expectation that this policy will be changed . If women are to be admitted to the suffrage , all of sound mind , of legal age , not disfranchised by the effect of crime or other special causes applying equally to men , will be entitled to vote . This will add the more than three millions of negro women , all naturalized women of foreign birth , all domestic servants - in a word , all women without respect to intelligence , character , or race , except the Chinese and Indians . In the whole country it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than double it . Similar considerations apply to jury duty , which is a concomitant of the ballot . That the nation has gone so far in a dangerous path does not make it necessary to proceed farther . **41;90;TOOLONG the abstention of women from political work and excitement are not diminished but increased by the complexity of modern civiliza/ion . Exceptional cases of voluntary endurance of physical and mental strain , exhibited by the triumph of certain women in the contests of scholastic life , or in bearing unusual burdens in business , should not divert attention from the usual facts of personal or domestic life , or from the fact that a large proportion of the best women in youth , middle life , and age will be unable to respond to demands upon them at set times , in storm or calm , for the different forms of service involved in voting and holding of- says : " We do not claim that this is hecause woman is inherently better than man ( although his voice has ten thousand times declared it ) ; we are inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // flee , or in securing the qualifications for the one or the other . Here and there a physician may evoke smiles and compliments from advocates of the suffrage for women by declaring that he knows of no anatomical or physiological impediment to the assumption by women of the duties of political life . But the medical faculty as a whole have no sympathy with his sycophancy , and the common sense of the race , and the observation and experience of most women , concur with them rather than with those who would render legal and necessary the participation of the whole sex in the agitations and exposures of campaigns and elections . Woman sz*ffrage can not achieve what its advocates expect . They think that it will reform public morals , close the saloons and other places of evil resort , and realize absolute prudence , honesty , and economy in management . Laws that do not carry the votes of a majority of the men of a community can not be executed . Law-abiding citizens require no force to induce obedience ; but those disposed to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . There is a natural instinct in man which leads him to submit to persuasion by women , and to resist force applied by them . It can not be eradicated by philosophy , refinement , or religion , and in every generation reappears with undiminished vigor . If women were admitted to political life , the tendency would be for both parties to pass all kinds of laws to please women , which would be dead letters unless they carried the judgment of a majority of the male citizens . In the absence of this , to enforce them would involve a change in the character of the government in the direction of despotism . Religious feuds would affecipolitical 4/emuch more than under present circumstances . It is of immense importance to the welfare of this country that the separation of Church and State be complete . The feelings of women upon the subject of religion are so intense that the franchise , in a large majority of instances , would be exercised under the power of religious prejudice . John Bright , in one of his most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing there is no doubt : the influence of pnest , parson , and minister will be greatly increased if this measure is passed . " Chivaby , with its refining influence over men , must pass away when women becomepoliticians . It is not a favorable portent that of late it has become customary for the advocates of woman suffrage to disparage that chivalrous feeling which causes normal men , wherever modern civilization exists , to treat women with deference , and to be ready to extend them needful aid . At present one of the chief refining ele ments of society is the respect felt for women as such by men . Even those who voluntarily form evil associations still esteem the ideal woman . The passing or decline of this sentiment is equally unfavorable to both ; for it will accustom men to resist the influence of women . That it will be undiminished when the fierce conflicts of party politics are involved is an unwarranted hope . All special courtesy to women grows out of the recognition of a kind of influence peculiar to them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they contend on the same plane with men in the political arena . There are many indications that it lessens in proportion as women come forward to compete with men in public life and in business . In the latter case it is an incidental result of a necessity ; but it will be the natural consequence of a condition when women appear in politics . In England , when women first appeared upon the hustings , they were received with the old chivalry , but in recent elections , the contest being fierce , all respect has disappeared . Noted women were treated most disrespectfully in the very heart of London , and people of all parties agree that England has never seen so much participation of women , or such rude treatment of them , as in the last election . In Wales Mrs. Cornwallis West tried to quell a disturbance among the electors who refused to hear Colonel West speak . She obtained a momentary hearing , but the disorder revived , and she exclaimed with much heat , " I am an Irish woman , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found men capable of refusing to hear a woman who was pleading a cause . " She was silenced by yells and hisses , and was finally compelled to retire from the platform . The introduction of women into political 4fe will increase its bitterness . That politics create violent feuds is too evident to be questioned . At present they are modified by the undisturbed relations between the wives , mothers , daughters , and sisters of the combatants . When the struggle has been decided at the polls , these social relations serve to bring about a calm , and the resumption of personal harmony . This was admirably stated by Horace Bushnell : Hitherto it has been an advantage to be going into our suifrages with a full half , and that ( when left to its normal environment and habits ) the better half morally , as a corps of reserve left behind , so that we may fall back on this quiet element , or base , several times a day , and always at night , to recompense ourcourage , and settle again our mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no reserve any longer , that we go into our conflicts taking our women with us , all to be kept heating in the same fire for weeks or months together , without interspersings of rest , // or quieting times of composure . We are to be as much more excited of course , as we can be , and the women are of course to be as much more excited than we as they are more excitable . Let no man imagine that our women are going into these encounters to be just as quiet or as little nerved as now , when they sit in the rear , unexcited , letting us come back to them often to recover our reason . Theyare to be no moremitigators now , but instigators rather , sweltering in the same fierce heats and commotions , only more fiercely stirred than we . It is the very distinctive qualities culminating in an exquisite sensibility , the source of woman 's charm in private and family and social life , which , exposed to the attrition and agitations of party conflicts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liabilities have been illustrated where women have come into anything analogous to political life . The feud that existed for years between two wings of the Woman Suffrage Association in the United States is ancient but still instructive history . The XVoman 's Christian Temperance Union , organized for the promotion of an end in which all were agreed , managed by leaders to whom all are accustomed to defer , would not be expected to have any serious difficulty . But when a feud arose which ostensibly began because of a divergence of opinion with respect to the relation which the Union should sustain to political parties , it speedily became intense , and a distinguished woman , the leader of the minority , more than intimates concerning the national president , that , in all her great work she has been but seeking a background for her personal exploits , and a theater for the exercise of her wonderful powers and accomplishments . To this , by order of the executive committee , a reply was prepared by a sub-committee of four women of national recognition , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sting of innuendo : Whatever values has won as chairman of the Women 's Republican National League , as one of the famous " spell-binders , " and wife of a Republican official , she has lost the faith of her old comrades in her sincerity , the chaplet of their admiring love , and the crown of leadership in the grandest body of women known in the world . The closest approximation to political life on a national scale ever made in this country was the National Board of Lady Managers of the World 's Fair . These were women of high character and social influence , most of them accustomed to various forms of public life , selected because of their standing in the States whence they came . A large proportion of them at all times spoke and acted in such a manner as to command universal respect , and their work as a whole secured the approbation of the country . But the Board had honors to confer , awards to make , and patronage to distribute . Discord arose between the secretary and the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woman suffrage . This controversy lasted for months , threatening to embroil the country . Jealousy of the president 's failure to introduce some of her colleagues to the Duchess de Veragua caused a stormy scene . Later , another charged a woman in higher office with instructing the presidents of the various meetings to exclude her from participation in the speaking . Owing to various bitter quarrels among the members , and factional opposition , the president intimated her intention to resign . It must be remembered that the president was a woman of tact and rare ability as a presiding officer . On one day , after a long altercation , accompanied by many personal contradictions , the Board stopped business , and the members left the hall in confusion without adjourning . A sectional war broke out , when a lady exclaimed with reference to the nomination of jurors : " New York has eight representatives and North Dakota none . I want to know the reason why . There is something crooked going on here , and I am going to find it out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged injustice . And later , in open debate , one delegate charged another with being " an arrogant , malicious , injurious , and vindictive woman , " which caused intense general excitement accompanied by ejaculations and tears . For several days the disturbance was renewed ; but peace was finally made , and the account of the controversy was expunged from the records . Such was the effect of these scenes that some of the members of the Board reversed their opinion on the desirableness of woman 's entering political life . Further illustrations appeared during the recent canvass in the State of New York for petitions to strike out the word male from the Constitution , when a counter-movement was begun by women . The protestants were characterized by educated ladies in public assemblies as " traitors to their sex , " " copperheads , " " betrayers of the cause of woman , " and such was the intensity of the feeling that these terms and phrases evoked general applause . The women who presumed to resist the innovation were characterized by one of their sisters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites who have mentally retrograded . " It will place a new and terril'le s/rain upon the family relation . The ratio of marriages relatively to the number of the population is // diminishing ; the number of divorces has been increasing alarmingly for the past thirty years . They are most numerous in sections of the country where there has been a persistent and almost fierce demand for the ballot . The introduction of political disputes and party work into family life will develop and increase incompatibility , a prolific cause of separations , infidelity to the marriage contract , and divorce . To this it has been responded : " There has always been more contention over religion than over politics , yet often the wife is a member of one church , and the husband of another or of none ; and yet the family is not disrupted , and it is evident from the seeming concord of the household that the two have agreed to disagree . " That the family can bear existing strains does not prove that it could endure all that it has and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men generally wish their wives , unless they become fanatics , to be religious , or do not seriously object to it . But there is a radical difference between political excitement and any other . A political difference means that the most intense feelings shall be excited and kept at fever heat for several weeks or months , liable to culminate in a direct act of opposition , the wife going to the polls against her husband , and he against her , exchanging glances of sympathy with life-long political opponents , perhaps coiiperating in active opposition . The wife may be working and voting against her husband 's most intimate business or personal friends , and endeavoring to secure the passage of laws especially obnoxious to him . In cases of disagreement , where there are children , each parent would endeavor to surpass the other in capturing recruits at the family altar , the table , and the fireside . At the end of the conflict the defeated would be left without the sympathy of the other ; and not only without the sympathy , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be considered merely or chiefly with respect to established families , united " by the reciprocal ties of friendly intercourse , " through many years down to the time of the introduction of woman suffrage . The strain will be most felt whenever and wherever the tie is weakest , whether the cause be the inexperience and impulsiveness of early married life , or the accumulated incompatibilities which test the self-control of many . To resort to the assumption that women will generally vote as their husbands do " is to renounce most of the considerations advanced in favor of the movement . To invest her with the responsibility of voti ; *g will diminish the real tower of woman in speech . At present she may say what she will ; men hear , and , without subjecting her words to too close a scrutiny , are influenced by her spirit . Require her to vote , identify her with a party , and in some instances she will grow timid ; where she refuses to restrain herself , she will become an impediment to party success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their party conflicts will deprive them of that power by which they now leaven public sentiment . In an argument in favor of giving the suffrage to woman , a senator of Massachusetts brought forward as an example of intellectual and moral fitness for the franchise Mrs. Clara Leonard , whom he justly characterized as the highest living authority on private and public charities . Mrs. Leonard has recently thus expressed her estimate of the value of the ballot to woman : It is the opinion of many of us that woman 's power is greater without the ballot , or possibility of office-holding for gain , when , standing outside of politics , she discusses great questions on their merits . Much has been achieved by women for the anti-slavery cause , temperance , the improvement of public and private charities , the reformation of criminals , and by intelligent discussion and influence upon men . Our legislators have been ready to listen to women and carry out their plans when well formed . It may reasonably be expected to deteriorate the moral tone of most of the women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active part in politics ; and it will introduce dangerousforms ofcorruption . The l ) rincipal causes of political immorality are the desire for power , for " spoils " in money and office , bribery* craft , party and personal prejudice . Is it reasonable to believe that women who become political leaders , and intensely excited in political campaigns , will escape the influence of these demoralizing elements ? Certainly it will not be maintained that women are destitute of ambition , that they are above the influence of prejudice or prepossession , that personal favoritism can never warp their judgment , that money , or what it procures , has no charm for them . While some - in the aggregate , manywould resist every temptation , preserve their womanliness , and illustrate in high places all the virtues , is certain . But to subject the entire sex to such influences would inevitably lower its moral tone . When women vote generally ,  --  and if they are not to vote generally the agitation is useless ,  - -  all classes will need to be instructed and led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , as there are among men . Women who aspire to be leaders , or are made such by their constituents , will be compelled to associate for political purposes with other wo // men similarly related to the party . At present the morals of society are largely preserved by the fact that a woman of doubtful character is not admitted to the society of women of unspotted reputation . It is easy to maintain such an attitude now ; it would be impossible in a general participation of women in politics . Also that leading political women will be brought into confidential relations with men occupying similar relations in the same party is a consequence of the proposed revolution which would not long b* delayed . Its effect upon domestic peace , and public and private morality , could not be salutary . A RATIONAL FORECAST . SHOULD the suffrage be extended to women the grant can never be recalled . Experiments in legislating upon economic questions , even if unwise , need not be permanently harmful , for they may be repealed ; but in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if bad , are exceedingly dangerous . They will develop a class lowered in tone , or deriving personal , pecuniary , or political advantages from the new environment , who will vehemently declare that the effect of the innovation is beneficial , and resist all efforts to return to the former state . Should the duty of governing in the State be imposed upon women , all the members of society will suffer ; children , by diminished care from their mothers ; husbands , from the increase of the contentions , and the decline of the attractions of home ; young men and maidens , from the diminution or destruction of the idealism which invests the family with such charms as to make the hope of a home of one s own , where in the contrasts of the sexes life may be ever a delight , an impulse to economy and virtue  --  but the greatest sufferer will be woman . Often those who recollect her genuine freedom of speech , " the might of her gentleness , " the almost resistless potency of her look and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence of woman on manliness , reciprocated by man 's reverence for womanliness ; while " the new generation , to whom such sweet recollections will be unknown , will blindly rave against their fate or despondently sink under it , as women have never done ( from similar causes ) under the old regime . " Meanwhile the office-holding , intriguing , campaigning , lobbying , mannish woman will celebrate the day of emancipation ,  --  which , alas , will be the day of degradation ,  --  when , grasping at sovereignty , she lost her empire . The true woman needs no governing authority conferred upon her by law . In the present situation the highest evidence of respect that man can exhibit toward woman , and the noblest service he can perform for her , are to vote NAY to the proposition that would take from her the diadem of pearls , the talisman of faith , hope , and love , by which all other requests are won from men , and substitute for it the iron crown of authority . J. AL Buckley . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles were written independently , and have not been changed since they were sent to the authors in order to enable them to prepare the postscripts which follow-which are also written independently of each other. - EDITOR C. M. POSTSCRIPT BY SENATOR HOAR . J HAVE read Dr. Buckley 's paper entitled I- " The Wrongs and Perils of Woman Suffrage . " It does not seem to me to make it necessary that I should restate my own argument . The reading of the paper has given me great pleasure . It is , in my judgment , the strongest argument ever made on that side . All patriotic persons , whatever their present opinion , must desire that this great step should not be taken without seriously weighing everything that can be said against it . Dr. Buckley has discussed powerfully and clearly what seem to me the true points of the controversy : " Will it be a bad thing for woman that woman should help govern the State ? " Will it be a bad thing for the State that woman should help govern it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the portion of his paperheaded " Disfranchised Classes . " He says that the common sense of the human race , with inconsiderable exceptions , has confined the prerogatives of civil government to man . But in general the common sense of the human race has confined the prerogatives of government to a very few men - to monarchs , noblemen , aristocracies , oligarchies . We are at present addressing an audience who are agreed that what is largely the common sense of the human race is entirely mistaken in its opinion , as expressed in existing civil governments , or the civil governments of the past . So we surely need not occupy time or space in debating whether we should exclude women from a share in the gov // eminent of the republic in which manhood suffrage is the law , because the common sense of the human race has agreed that nearly all mankind , whether masculine or feminine , should be excluded from a share in the government . Our question is , whether women should help in selfgovernment , not whether , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a few are born to rule , it is better that the ruler should be of one sex or the other . Dr. Buckley denies that voting is a birthright . This denial he extends to all persons ; not merely to idiots , lunatics , persons under the age of discretion , and foreigners not attacned to the government , or not familiar with its principles . His readers will easily see that this claim is essential to his argument . So , we are fairly entitled to insist that all persons who think a share in the government to be a birthright shall , if no reasons but Dr. Buckley 's stand in the way , come to our conclusion . It can hardly be worth while to take much space in making an argument to persons who accept the American Constitution , State and National , as founded on sound principle , or in debating over again what our grandfathers settled . I do not , also , care to take much more time than I have already taken in dealing with the authority of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofgovernment , disapprove conferring the ballot on women . I have endeavored to show already that Mrs. Leonard 's practice is against her theory , and that she is mistaken only as she misunderstands what is proposed . Dr. Buckley quotes a sentence from her to the effect that woman 's power is greater when , standing outside of politics , she discusses great questions on their merits . I do not think she is standing outside of politics when she discusses great political questions on their merits . I do not think she is standing outside of politics when she manages a government hospital or a normal school . I do not see how , when itis proposed to the people that some important change shall be made in these political instrumentalities , that after saying " yes " in a report , or a magazine , or a letter in a newspaper , and giving her powerful and cogent reasons , she or anybody is to be harmed if , when the vote is counted , her vote shall not be excluded . Mrs. Leonard votes when she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Hale votes when she is a member of the Board of Trusteesof the great hospital for the insane at Worcester . Other ladies vote in the Board of Education . They exercise their power by direct vote when they manage these great political instrumentalities . Will it harm either of these ladies any more to do the same thing in the town or ward where they live under the quiet security of the Australian ballot ? So we come to what I am glad to see Dr. Buckley considers the chief question , which he has dealt with so admirably and powerfully . " Do we propose anything likely to injure womanhood , or anything likely to injure the Republic ? " I am afraid I shall do Dr. Buckley 's argument injustice if I attempt to sum it up in a few lines . But of course that is all I can do here . The argument is , if I understand it , that if women take a share in governing the State they are so far to control other wills by an authority which is submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrained , and obey because they are subjugated and not because they are persuaded . Women now , Dr. Buckley says in substance , exercise their control in the family as wives , mothers , or daughters , by reason of an influence which the person who submits to it is perfectly free to disregard . But the ruler of a State governs by reason of a power which the person controlled by it is not at liberty to disregard or disobey . Now he says that for women to substitute the habit of government by authority for the habit of influence by persuasion will destroy the sweet nature of womanhood itself . Dr. Buckley says a great deal more than this , which I have not time to deal with . But I select only the point which has made the most impression upon me . It seems to me we shall find the answer to this proposition by inquiring whether the function of voting bears such a proportion to the other influences that form and affect the character , that it will tinge and color the whole character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tinge from the general character of the person who exercises it . If Lucy Stone had voted , would her character have become arrogant , quarrelsome , dishonest , ambitious , intriguing , because there is danger that political activity will create a temptation to indulge in these vices , or would the function of voting , as discharged by Lucy Stone , have been characterized by sincerity , patriotism , calmness , wisdom , sweetness , and unselfishness ? Now I affirm that in mankind , in general , the function of voting takes its hue and tincture from the general character of the person who exercises it , and that the general character of the person who exercises it is not changed by the temptations which attend the struggle for political power . Voting and politics , to most men , are but a small and insignificant portion of life . They do not change opinions , or control the character of the citizen ; but they take their character from the character that he brings to them . The German who has lived under the iron rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived as a peasant under the heel of the Englishman , the Englishman who has lived under the hooped rel ) ublicanism by which the Englishman governs himself , and with that arrogant disregard for human right with which the Englishman deals with other nations - each , when he comes here , brings to his American citizenship the quality which he gained at home , and does not change it when he takes his share in our reL ) ublicanism . It may be added , also , that the function of motherhood is a function of absolute authority , perhaps the most absolute that one human being exercises over another . Dr. Buckley narrates the story of the old New Jersey election frolic . He gives also some amusing narrations of some more recent , and rather undignified scuffles in which ladies have engaged . But these can be matched a thousand times by like scenes in deliberative bodies controlled by men . I am afraid even ecclesiastical assemblies are not free from them . I suppose Dr. Buckley does not seriously contend , because of the example he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should disband , or that woman should not manage it any longer . No person desires to change the essential character of American womanhood . It is a character whose beauty , dignity , grace , sweetness , and power come from causes with which the giving or denying to women of a share in the government of the State has nothing to do . It will not , in my judgment , be affected in the slightest degree for the worse if her vote shall be counted . On the other hand , when she shall be admitted to complete citizenship , these qualities of American womanhood will become more and more the qualities of American citizenship itself . George F Hoar . POSTSCRIPT BY DR . BUCKLEY . THE courteous admission of Senator Hoar that opponents of woman suffrage among men are not influenced by " the tyrant 's desire to keep the rule of the State to themselves , " but " chiefly an honest desire for the good of the State , and an honest desire for the welfare of woman , " deserves recognition . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laws concerning a married woman 's relation to property and other subjects , by the " law-making sex . " He might have added that where women are concerned law-makers are more than willing to rectify every real injustice and grant any reasonable request . Woman suffrage , in his opinion , is " the change of a relation which has existed from the foundation of the earth " ; yet upon this , the greatest political and social revolution , he generalizes without critically estimating the question of the value and elements of the influence of the sexes respectively under the existing order of things . The typical man and the typical woman are contrasted by the senator in this passage : " Man values the objects of his affection for the comfort and dignity and benefit that comes to him from them . Woman values herself only for the comfort which she can be to the objects of her affection . " Were this description of woman true to nature , no other argument against woman suffrage would be needed , for it would imply absolute incapacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of both sexes . That the majority of the women of the counVOL . XLVIII. - 79. try do not desire the suffrage is by no means " the chief reason " for withholding it . But the fact that it is so contrary to their instincts , intuitions , and sense of need that they do not wish it is a weighty reason for not imposing it upon them . The reference to Turkish ladies is not relevant , since they are deprived of the information accessible to American women . The framers of the constitution of Massachusetts were not ignorant of the logical results of their principles . But they knew that every principle has its limits , and , when forced beyond them , mutilates or smothers some other truth . The Essex Convention , meeting at Ipswich in 1778 to consider the proposed new constitution and form of government , was particular to say that women were left unfranchised " not from a deficiency in their mental powers , but from the natural tenderness and delicacy of their minds , their retired mode of life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the world which is necessary to qualify them for electors . " Rufus Choate 's tribute to the discrimination of character " by the collective womanhood of a people like our own " is just . But should she be compelled to " talk and think of measures , of creeds in politics , of availability , of strength to carry the vote , " what reason is there to believe that her vision will not be dimmed or distorted by the medium through which she looks ? It is a suggestive phenomenon that General Butler was the l ) articular admiration of a large number of women , conspicuous aspirants to // political life , who often commended him from the platform and in the press . The senator concedes that there are large domains of legislation and administration from which " it would be better to exclude women as a whole than to admit them as a whole , because the great mass will be so little fitted for them , " but affirms that this is true of the great majority of men . This , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overcome , not increased by the addition of an immense number of voters whom he grants are destined to remain in the same condition . To say that the same arguments which the advocates of woman suffrage have to meet have been used against every extension of suffrage merely acts as an opiate to thought , unless it be clearly proved that they do not now apply . Every important change , good or bad , has been opposed . The proposed extension isradically unlike any that has preceded it . My eminent colleague in this comparison of views asks his opponents to " find fourmasculine figures whom they will like to select as leaders or companions rather than " those he names . Emerson and Whittier were idealists , neither qualified for leadership in politics or statesmanship , though a multitude rejoiced to come within the influence of their inspiration and elevating impulses . The deliverance of Mr. Lincoln was made at the very outset of his career , and so far as is known , though paying many a beautiful tribute to woman , he never referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that the temperament of women was such as to make it more difficult to compose public feuds among them than 1 Tn response to an inquiry , Mr. John G. Nicolay , private secretary , and one of the authorized biographers of Mr. Lincoln , writes : " I know of no allusion or reference by Mr. Lincoln to the question of female suffrage , ex*cept that made in the card printed in the Sangamon Journal under date of June 13 , 1836 ( and among men . When the possibility of carrying out his conciliatory methods of reconstruction was under consideration , he remarked to the President of the Sanitary Commission that he expected more trouble from the women than from the men , and closed the conversation with these words , " Bellows , you take care of the women , and I will take care of the men . " Itis not necessary to journey outside the senator 's own paper to find two women worthy to be compared with Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell and Mrs. Howe . These are Mrs. John Ware , whom he declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons in this country of either sex , " and Clara Leonard , " another of the women who are the pride and ornament of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . " Both these ladiesstrongly and conscientiously disapprove of woman suffrage . To these I add the name of " the most useful and distinguished woman that America has produced , " whose influence is felt throughout the world upon every sphere of philanthropy , and is preserved in the laws of every civilized nation , Dorothea L. Dix . She saw the rise of the American woman-suffrage movement , studied it in its advocates , arguments , sentiments , and tendencies , and rejected it . The " divine discontent " which its leaders were and are endeavoring to kindle in the hearts of women she deemed merely one of the ever-changing forms of human unrest . Her biographer states that she believed in " woman 's keeping herself apart from anything savoring of ordinary political action . She must be the incarnation of a purely disinterested idea , appealing to universal humanity , irrespective of party or sect. " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 7 ) . This is the passage quoted by Senator Hoar . So far as I know , the topic is nowhere else mentioned in his writings , speeches , or letters , nor did I ever hear him refer to it in conversation either directly or indirectly . "
