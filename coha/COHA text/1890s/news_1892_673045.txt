txt Among the marvels of modern surgery few are more striking than the liberties medical men now take with that strange substance which is the seat of life and thought . Wounds once deemed certainly fatal are now inflicted readily for curative processes . An epileptic 's writhings , the twisting of his face , or the distortion of his limbs are to the surgeon 's eye signs where he must sink his knife and saw to give relief to impeded or diseased growth or circulation . On the skull 's surface nothing may be visibly wrong , but with his pencil the surgeon marks out on the skin to a fraction of an inch the area where he must look for the clot or tumor which has disordered the functions of thought or speech or motion . It is a new phrenology , which promises a new future to . hat art introductory to all arts , the art ' of teaching . It is not intended that knowledge can even be yet injected , like some vaccine , against ignorance ; nor that errors of temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor that a Swedish-movement cure of , diseased gray matter is possible . It is only meant that better knowledge of how the brain works must modify methods of education , which has heretofore been conducted in utter ignorance of the organ sought to be developed . Dr. H. T. PERSHING has suggested these ideas in the studies which he has made of the brain processes of language , and which he has published in Popular Science . Words may obviously be either heard or seen , according as they are spoken or written or printed . Now , the doctors know that four brain centres are concerned in these functions of the mind . For this purpose no attention is now paid to the mental machinery of thought or passion . Nothing is now considered but how a man 's brain apprehends language . When the auditory centre is stimulated he naturally hears , and when the visual centre acts he sees the print or manuscript . When he sends an impulse to the speech centre he speaks , and he writes when the writing centre operates . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain has been mapped , so that the seat of these sensations can be found . Beyond this what really is singular is the interdependence and co-operation of all these functions . It might be thought that when a man heard he heard , and there was an end of it . But not in the least so . There are those who having ears hear not . The sound may be perceived , but the hearing is not complete unless the sound is understood . Thus , if " orange " be uttered and heard , at once and automatically all the associated brain centres place before the mind its stored perceptions of an orange 's form , flavor , color , and so on . Not until that has been done is " orange " really heard . The first time that sound is perceived it has no meaning , and its meaning grows vivid only in proportion as oranges are familiar to sight , taste , smell , and touch . Disease affords the proof that the apparently simple act of hearing is thus complex . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet its communications with the other language centres be broken . In that ease a man may be word deaf . He hears , in a way , just as a color-blind man sees . in a way . But he no more knows what he hears than the color-blind man knows what he sees . In much the same fashion a man may be word-blind . He can still see ordinary objects , but the print of his own language may be like Sanskrit . Or if the motor speech centre is defective , the power to talk may be injured or lost , although the other language centres may be in working order . To use an illustration , the four language centres are related something like subscribers on a telephone circuit , and the auditory centre is " Central . " Not until a word has been heard and stored in the mind 's treasury can the speaking centre impel its utterance . Not until the mind has stored an idea of an object will the auditory centre awake to the thrill of the sound which denotes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these columns through the marshaling of his proofs that these are facts ; but perhaps groundwork enough has been laid to illustrate the application of this knowledge of brain processes to the teaching of language .. Language has been taught ever since OLIN slew his brother , and yet , perhaps there is no other branch of teaching about which there is so little agreement as to the best method . Dr. PRRSHING lays basis for saying with conviction that language , living or dead , native or foreign , should be taught through the ear , and not through the eye . To the mind a sound is as real as an image to the eye . But a sound recalls the thing itself , whereas visual language recalls to the mind not the thing , but a word or sign of the thing , removing apprehension one step and weakening it decidedly . Thus a child reading speaks the words . Its visual centre alone can not give the frequent or vivid impulses which automatically flash from the " Central " auditory area . As the faculties are practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound for the sound itself , and thus reading ; aloud ceases to be a help to understanding . And . just as the child . titters a printed - word in order to place it before its mind 's eye , Actin aospilsing .. vogarbAisir is it . naeln3 , when it is feasible , to place actually in view the thing represented by the uttered word. ; It is not at all a weak expedient ; it is strictly scientific to thus niarry sight and sound , knowing that each faculty will thus stimulate the other , and . help to quick and accurate utterance . without which no language is mastered . By this time it will be seen why the dead languages are so very dead . They are mainly ' taught by the eye , and by the symbols of sounds , instead of by the ear , and by the sounds themselves . That this method is so much a failure as to be something like a swindle every college student knows . It is a failure , not because it is not honestly taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built that way . The brain centre of speech and the centre of ideation are not connected directly , but through the auditory centre . By stimulating it the other language centres are automatically stimulated . That is nature 's way , and this is the light which surgery throws on one problem of education .
