IY. - TO HIS OWN REPUTATION . By B. L. Godhin. first condition of all permanent associations of men , however primitive , is that each member should , in a greater or less degree , enjoy the confidence and good opinion of his fellows . No social organization , however rudimentary , could hold together for any great length of time unless the majority of those composing it were satisfied that they had in common certain ideas about the things which most concerned the safety and welfare of the community . This common stock of ideas need not be , and , as a general rule , has not been , what civilized men call morality . Civilized notions of right and wrong may have but little , if any , place in it . But it always imposes certain obligations in the matter of fidelity to custom , and of mutual help and succor in times of danger , necessity , and tribulation , the nonfulfilment of which calls forth some sort of social penalty . In all pursuits of tribal life , whether the particular undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merrymaking , or marrying , the savage is expected to behave in the manner prescribed by the customs and traditions of the community , so that his fellows may depend on him . No man in the tribe can keep his social place unless the other members are able to foresee how he will act under any given set of circumstances . This is the necessary basis of all gregarious existence , even that of animals . Buffaloes or wild horses could not live in herds , or wolves hunt in packs , or wild geese fly in flocks , without some sort of general understanding or agreement as to gregarious conduct , violation of which would entail death , or expulsion , or desertion . Darwin and Spencer think that out of this gregarious sympathy and co-operation grew civilized morality , as a neces sary result of the working of the social instinct . Whether this view , or the opposing one that morals are the creation of the Divine will , be the correct one , makes little difference for my present purpose . What is certain is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends , created the very first form of individual property , the earliest of individual belongings , in the shape of social repute . No matter how far we go back in the earlier forms of society , even in those in which individual ownership of material things can hardly be said to exist , in which lands are held for the common tribal benefit , and even game is turned into the common tribal stock , we find that there is always one thing which is each man 's *eculiuni , which , though of no use to anyone else , is to him the most valuable thing on earth , namely , the estimation in which he is held by the other men of the tribe with regard to the principal social virtue . I say " the principal social virtue , " because every community , civilized or uncivilized , arranges social virtues on a scale of its own . At the top of the list it places the virtue which it considers most important to its own existence and prosperity . In barbarous or military communities physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved for the successful fighting man , and the deepest scorn heaped on the man who shrinks from fighting . Courage was , in truth , the only foundation for respectability all over Europe in the Middle Ages , except in the commercial Republics , where it was supplemented , if not supplanted , by financial probity . To-day it has sunk into a very secondary position in all commercial communities , and has been almost lost sight of in others , as is shown by the disappearance of the dueL In the former , in order to be respected by his neighbors , a man must , as a gen // eral rule , be peaceable , or what is called " law-abiding ; " that is , not only slow to quarrel , but ready when he does quarrel to have his dispute settled by the courts . He must be truthful , that is , must be a man whose account of what he professes to know or have seen , and whose promises with regard to what he will do in future , may be relied upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must be the husband of one wife and live with her in amity . If he has children , he must make such provision for their wants as his means will permit , and give them a decent education . If he is engaged in a trade or profession , he must carry out his contracts faithfully , and answer all expectations for which he has given reasonable cause . If he is an employer , he must treat his workmen with consideration and pay them their wages duly . He must , too , be ready to bear cheerfully his share of such burdens , whether in money or labor , as sudden or unforeseen occasions , whether of good or evil fortune , may impose on the community to which he belongs . He must , furthermore , be what is called " a good neighbor , " that is , be ready to interchange with those who live near him not only the small courtesies called for by mere propinquity , but the larger offices of charity created by sickness or misfortune . It will thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectability have multiplied . At the beginning valor constituted a sufficient claim to social consideration . As the arts spread and the social organization grew more complex , and opinion became more powerful , a man had to increase the number of his titles to the esteem of his neighbors . But there never has been any period when these titles were not among his most valuable possessions , or in other words , when what people thought of him was not , almost as much as tangible property , or even more than tangible property , necessary to the comfort and happiness of his life . Shakes-peare 's " Who steals my purse steals trash ; t is something , nothing ; T was mine , t is his , and has been slave to thousands ; But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him , And makes me poor indeed is but the poetic expression of the idea of all societies , savage or civilized , that have ever existed , that a man 's social standing was the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the loss of which would greatly impair , if not destroy , the satisfaction derivable from all other kinds . Now , where does the value of this social consideration to the community lie , apart from the satisfaction which it gives to each man 's own self-esteem ? In other words , why had he at one time to defend it himself with the sword , and why does the community now undertake to defend it for him through the courts ? The first reason is , that the love of reputation is the most powerful motive to good conduct-perhaps the very strongest guarantee the community has for the good conduct-of the citizen . The approval of a man 's own conscience is , of course , also a powerful one , but that it acts with anything like the same force on the great bulk of any community , we have not and can not have any proof . What the power of conscience is in any individual case , nobody knows but the man himself . For the state of his moral nature , we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in refusing to pay much attention to this story until it is supported by a long course of visible good works . " By their fruits ye shall know them** is as sound a rule of jurisprudence as of moral philosophy . Practically , it is to the desire of social approval , and the corresponding fear of social reprobation , that every community owes most of its protection from disorder and fraud , tind most of its improvement on the moral side . No legislator depends on the courts and police for more than a very small part of the public peace and progress . Nearly the whole of that portion of every population to which the State looks for its general welfare and security-that is , the intelligent and industrious portion - are acted on strongly by the desire for the applause and good will of their neighbors , comparatively very little by the fear of the penal code . Outside // the class in which crimes of violence are commonest , the ignorant , the vicious , and disorderly , the largest part of the penalty , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keen suffering which comes from the social disgrace which they entail on the offender and his family . For offences which do not entail such social disgrace , like those committed , as it is said , for conscience sake , such as succoring fugitive slaves in this country , or the refusal of Anglican clergymen in England to obey the civil courts in matters of ritual to-day in England , the jail has no terrors whatever . A very large part of our immense structure of commercial and financial credit is maintained by the same sanction . Of course , the fear of business ruin , which would follow failure to keep positive engagements , is the greatest support of financial fidelity and exactness ; but for protection against that great mass of trickery and sharpness which is possible without absolutely putting credit , in the strict technical sense of the term , in peril , society has to rely in the main on the general love of approbation . The purity of the sexual relation is largely preserved in the same way . The law in some countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it punishes unchastity in none . It is the testimony of all competent observers that the penalties directed against adultery , where they exist and are enforced , have little or no deterrent effect , owing to the difficulty of proof , and the unwillingness of the injured party to appear as a prosecutor . In practice , the only legal defence of the marriage relation is divorce , which is , in nine cases out of ten , something which the gullty party desires or , at all events , does not fear . The most effective deterrent from matrimonial infidelity , next after consideration for the children , is fear of social reprobation . This is the one terror of the dissolute , or depraved , or lightminded , and thus does most for the maintenance of the family bond . Many , however , who acknowledge that legislation in defence of domestic purity is useless unless supported by a strong public sense of its value , forget that this public sense of its value must , in order to act as a sanction , pass out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of judgment on conduct ; that is , it must take the form both of praise and blame of individuals . It must be converted into positive approbation of the good husband or wife , and positive and expressed condemnation of the unfaithful husband or wife . It is this sentiment in this form which , more than any marriage vows , or any form of legal penalty , keeps down matrimonial irregularities , and compels large numbers of persons to support matrimonial infelicity with patience and resignation . It will thus be seen that the interest of the State in keeping alive the love of social approbation is immense . The dangerous men , whether high or low in every community , are the men who do not feel it , or feel it only in a very slight degree . Next we may ask , what does social consideration or reputation do for the individual ? What rights , privileges , or immunities does it procure him , apart from the satisfaction it may give his vanity or self-esteem ? It gives him in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family from the knowledge that his neighbors think well of him . The extent to which this enters into a man 's happiness , of course , varies in individuals , but next after assured subsistence , it forms , to nine men out of ten , the chief reason for loving life , for clinging to one 's own birthplace and country , and for reluctance to emigrate or fix one 's abode among strangers , whose opinion of one has still to be formed . A disgraced man is , to all intents and purposes , a man beginning a life of exile , and one of the sorrows of early struggling youth lies in the fact that people have not yet formed any estimate of the young man 's character or capacity . Reputation , in fact , surrounds a man with an atmosphere of peace and hopefulness which he enjoys unconsciously , very much as he enjoys health in bright , clear weather ; and his family live in it and benefit by it hardiy less than he does himself . In the next place , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shares his interest with other people . // A man of good reputation is listened to with a deference which nothing but actual power can procure for a man of poor reputation . His advice , too , is taken with a readiness which his ability or experience may not always warrant , because there is a strong disposition in human nature to infer wisdom from goodness-a conclusion which is generally true in spite of the contempt often felt and expressed by " practical men " for the opinions of moralists , like clergymen and philosophers , and in spite of the frequent exhibitions of incapacity in ordinary affairs of life made by men of undoubted purity and simplicity of character . Influence , of course , follows power , whether it be the power of wealth or of office , without much reference to the character of the holder ; but it is enormously increased and strengthened by popular belief in a man 's sincerity , kindliness , and honesty , and may , by the same help , survive the loss of both fortune and place . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the place to a large extent of capital . Every man whose character is held in high estimation by his neighbors , can always command more credit than his visible means will warrant ; that is to say , he can borrow to an extent which a mere examination of his assets would not justify . His promises are treated as if they were cash , although the manner in which they can be converted into cash may be unknown to those who trust him . In fact , if reputation were taken from under the fabric of modern commercial credit , the result would be an immense financial collapse . The larger part of it is built up on the assumption that the word of certain men is literally " as good as their bond , " or , in other words , that they feel moral obligations more strongly than legal ones . Illustrations of this proposition can be found in nearly every pursult and calling . A lawyer 's professional value is greatly increased by public confidence in his character ; so is a doctor 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this confidence from a purely commercial point of view can hardly be estimated until a man loses it ; then , and then only , can it be seen how much it had done for him . That particu lar men have been and are able to achieve worldly success in certain occupations without it , is doubtless true , and a matter of common observation ; but it will be found in nearly every such case that the absence of reputation has been compensated for by some rare peculiarity of mind or temperament . To illustrate or enforce this theory by examples would be easy , but it would carry me into personalities which would hardly be warrantable in a paper of this sort . The value of reputation to the individual , and the importance to the state of having him estimate it highly , being made clear , it remains to consider what does , can , or might the state do to protect him in the enjoyment of it . The reluctance of the state to do anything whatever , has been one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invention of printing that libel has become an important subject to the legislator or jurist . Spoken slander , in the days before pamphlets and newspapers , was of trifling importance , and the punishment or repression of it was left , as attacks on property were at a still earlier period , to the victim himself by means of the duel or single combat , or some sort of corporal chastisement . The idea that this class of injury is most appropriately punished by personal violence has in fact survived down to our own day . There still lingers in the minds of the public , even in this country and in England , where the duel has died out , the notion that , though one ought to rely exclusively on the police and the courts for the protection of one 's goods and chattels , yet there is certain peculiar fitness in protecting reputation or privacy against libel or intrusion by the cudgel or the horsewhip . That there is a certain pusillanimity in seeking redress for such wrongs in the courts only , has only very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thrashing " of libelous editors has been witnessed in New York within the present generation . There is , too , a very remarkable survival of this idea in the theory on which the common law first based its procedure in the criminal prosecution of libel . That theory was that the state was only called in to concern itself with libel // or slander as a criminal offence , because it was likely to lead to a breach of the peace . Out of this grew the apparently absurd , but really perfectly logical , dictum , " the greater the truth the greater the libel , " because the truer it was , the more likely it was to lead to what Southerners call " a difficulty . " It was , in short , only when the person libelled seemed likely to seek redress vi et armis , that the law felt called upon to interfere ; but this was a distinct advance on the earlier view that the law need not concern itself at all with such quarrels . It fell a long way short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is as much the duty of the state to provide security for reputation as for property , and that it is , moreover , the interest of the state to do so , a man 's regard for his reputation being one of the chief guarantees of social order and progress . This duty of punishing slander as a crime exists apart from , and is independent of , the duty of furnishing the citizen with means of recovering from the libeller pecuniary compensation for the injury done , when the extent of such injury is ascertainable in terms of money . There are certain cases in which damage computable in money is presumed by the law to have resulted from the slander , as when a clergyman is accused of intemperance or profligacy ; a lawyer of dishonesty ; a merchant of insolvency ; or a doctor of ignorance . In all such cases it is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove any loss resulting from the slander . The law says loss must have resulted from it , and the only question the jury have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved , is the question of amount . In oVher cases , where damage is not presumed , the plaintiff has to prove his damage , but the jury are allowed a large discretion in the matter of estimating it . They can take into account his mental suffering , or the frequent repetition , as an aggravation ; or they may , on the other hand , freat an apology , or the absence of malice , a good intention , as a mitigation of the damage . In fact , the whole matter of libel and slander is in the hands of the jury . The law , as laid down by the judge , has now very little control over it . The juries are to-day the true and untrammelled protectors of private reputation and , it may be said also , the true censors of the press . It is they who really decide what may and may not be written or said about a man 's reputation . Cases of real slander , however , now very seldom come before them . Actions for words spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earlier history of the country they occupied a good deal of the time of the courts , even in the remoter districts . There are two probable reasons for this . One is that local life is now much less isolated than it used to be . Even the inhabitants of farms and country villages are in much closer communication with outer world and much more occupied with large external events than formerly . They are , therefore , much less concerned about each other , and pay less attention to each other 's sayings and doings , and are less sensitive to unkind or malicious speeches . The other reason is that , when anyone wishes seriously to damage reputation nowadays , he inevitably seeks to put it in a newspaper , as the channel through which he can obtain most publicity , and make his attack most seriously felt . Consequently , it is newspaper libel which furnishes nearly all the cases on which juries are required to pass . In one way this makes their task easier ; in another harder . In actions for oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting at the words actually spoken , owing to the defective memory or bad faith of witnesses . In cases of printed libel there can be no dispute about the language constituting the libeL But the question of libel in newspapers is attended with a difficulty of another sort , and a much more serious one . Newspapers are not only collectors of news in the ordinary sense of the term , they are also the chaunels through which the citizen gets nearly ? ll his knowledge of the working of his government , and of the character , aims , and deeds of the men who carry it on , or seek to influence it . This fact generally increases the responsibility of juries , by the importance it gives to the // question of " privilege . " As an English writer on jurisprudence * has well said : " A notoriously bad man has not a legal right to be respectfuly described in speech or writing as a good man has . A man doing an important public act , or addressing a literary treatise to his fellow-countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of harsh and severe critics , even though their general intention be unkindly , but not accompanied by that vehement desire , or distinct consciousness of doing evil , which alone the law denounces . For general public reasons it may *e , that no man has a right entitling him to close the mouths even of the severest critics of his conduct in the course of his administration of public justice ; in that of the deliberations of the Legislative Assembly , or in certain other more private circumstances , as in the course of tendering confidential advice with respect to trustworthiness for important employments . " When we add to these considerations another and most important one-the extent to which the government , as well as those large quasi-public enterprises , the railroads , is carried on or regulated by discussion , mainly through the newspapers , it is easy to see how difficult is the task imposed on jurors in our day of defining the exact limits of individual right in the matter of security for reputation . And it is also , for the same reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public mind as to what is libelous and what is not . No two juries are likely to take the same view of any case of libel . This is notoriously true , when the libel has any relation to politics , or when the decision in it is likely to have any political influence or effect . It is then of the most importance , to either plaintiff or defendant , to have the jury composed , wholly or in the main , of persons of his own way of thinking on public questions . Nothing is more striking in the way in which men judge newspaper criticism , than the difference it makes , whose ox is gored . Whether condemnation is too severe , or whether the limits between public and private * Amos 's Systematic View of the Science of Jurisprudence , p. 293. character have been overstepped in any particular comment on a man in public life , is apt to be decided by most men under the influence of party predilection . A low view of one 's opponents , personally as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in , or strong interest in , party politics . It grows up imperceptibly , and often becomes incapable of eradication , and is a strong stimulus , and sometimes a powerful protection , for newspaper attacks on reputation . But perhaps the most powerful agent in instigating such attacks , and securing for them a certain indulgence or impunity , is the increasing importance of elections in those States which have adopted universal suffrage . Not only is the mass to be moved much increased and increasing in bulk at parliamentary or presidential elections ; but the interests dependent on the result of the election are increasing in the same ratio . The effect of this is to give to electioneering , as has been often remarked , the unscrupulousness of actual warfare , and to create among partisans on both sides a strong disposition to connive at , or at all events to condone , any excesses however great which seem likely to influence the issue , for this result is now tremendous . A general election in France , England , or the llJnited States to-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of officeholders , the command of great fleets and armies , and the spending of revenues which would , even a century ago , have seemed fabulous in amount . The chief engine in effecting this transfer is the press , for even orators now reach the public through the press , and of course , the pressure to resort to any assertion or insinuation which can by any chance influence even a hundred votes , is very strong , in many cases overwhelming . The defences which in ordinary times surround private character , or separate public from private life , are apt in the midst of a political canvass to be treated as of no more account , by the directors or managers on either tide , than the paling round a private garden by the commander of a battGry going in to action in a real welfare . // The countenance given to forgery of documents , or-if this be too strong a phrase  --  the easy acceptance accorded to suspicious documents for the purpose of blackening the character of political opponents , within recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking illustration of the fierceness of political contests , and of the readiness with which any means of influencing public opinion may be resorted to at critical periods . Legal prevention of this is difficult to furnish as long as , under our jury system , the jurymen have to be partisans who have themselves been taking part in the fray . At present there is no punishment for forgery which does not aim at the transfer of property , or at the escape from pecuniary liability . But forgery which has for its direct or indirect object the deception of voters at an election touching the character and aims of a candidate , is fully as great an offence against the community at large as fraud committed for the purpose of pecuniary gain . It can only be repressed , however , by making those who use a forgery without reasonable exertions to ascertain its real character , share to some extent in the responsibility of the actual concoctors of it . This latter is apt , in most cases , to be a paltry person , who has little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discovery , and yet it is he only who now has , in case of discovery , any legal penalty to fear . Everybody who turns his labor to account in the press or in the platform ought to be exposed also to criminal pursuit . There is nothing more important to the state than that the voter should have accurate knowledge as to the character and history of the men whom he puts into important official places ; and attempts of any kind to prevent his getting it , or to furnish it to him in a spurious condition , are quite as fit objects of punishment as attempts to prevent his voting according to his conscience through corruption or intimidation . Finally , there ought to be provision made for the more speedy trial of libel cases , because slander is the one form of personal injury the consequences of which gain in severity by mere lapse of time . After a robbery or a physical assault , the victim , if the injury be not fatal or he is not stripped of everything he possesses , begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reputation not only does not heal , but grows deeper every day which goes by before the appearance of some formal and public refutation of the slander . Each day adds to the number of those who hear it and believe it , and for the same reason , to the number of those whom the refutation of it can not reach . It is , therefore , of the last importance to the injured person that the means of redress should be easily attainable in point of time ; but it is also of importance to newspapers that these means of redress should not be so easily attainable pecuniarily that they should offer temptations to blackmailers , or to excitable or morbid persons , to begin proceedings which the courts are sure to treat as frivolous . One of the facts of human nature which all legislators dealing with the question of libel have to take into consideration , is its greater readiness to receive and circulate stories detrimental than stories creditable to reputation . The saying that " a lie makes its way across lots , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is more applicable to calumnious attacks on character than to any other form of falsehood . A piece of news which throws some kind of disrepute on a person , particularly if he is well known , or occupies a place of any prominence , although it may not be generally believed , is diffused much more rapidly than one which would raise him in popular esteem . Rochefoucauld 's well - known saying that , " we take a secret pleasure in the misfortunes of our best friends , " has been explained , by those who acknowledge its truth , by the general desire for superiority , no matter how acquired , with which we are all consciously or unconsciously animated . The love of scandal has possibly the same source . It for the moment raises the narrator above his victim , or at all events pulls the victim down to his level , by revealing some great or small imperfection . The old scaridalum magnatum , or libel on peers and other great personages , of the English law , although an absurdity in modern democratic eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish calumny with a shining mark , and that the dragging down of the mighty has been not unpleasing sport to the natural man in all ages . Consequently , a disposition to attack reputation is the form of lawlessness which survives longest in all civilized communities , and is most difficult to deal with by legislation . Closely allied to it , and in fact growing out of it , is the disposition to intrude on privacy . Privacy is a distinctly modern product , one of the luxuries of civilization , which is not only unsought for but unknown in primitive or barbarous societies . The savage can not have privacy , and does not desire or dream of it . To dwellers in tents and wigwams it must always have been unknown . The earliest houses of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors in England , even among the Thanes , consisted of only one large room in which both master and mistress , and retainers , cooked , ate , and slept . The first sign of material progress was the addition of sleeping-rooms , and afterward of " withdrawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of the household to escape from the noise and publicity of the outer hall . One of the greatest attractions of the dwellings of the rich is the provision they make for the segregation of the occupants . All of the improvements , too , of recent years in the dwellings of the poor , have been in the direction , not simply of more space , but of more separate rooms . The old proverb which says that " Poverty makes us acquainted with strange bed-fellows , " is but the expression of the universal desire of civilized man to have within reach a place in which he can , when the fancy seizes him , be alone , and out of the reach of society . In no way does poverty make itself more painfully felt by people of refinement or cultivation , than in the loss of seclusion and the social promiscuousness which it entails . To have a house of one 's own is the ambition of nearly all civilized men and women , and the reason which most makes them enjoy it is the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little publicity should surround their daily lives . The famous dictum of Coke , " A man 's house is his castle , et domus sua cuique tutissirnum refugiurn , " " his castle and fortress as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose , " is but the expression in terms of politics of the value attached by the race to the power of drawing , each man for himself , the line between his life as an individual and his life as a citizen , or in other words , the power of deciding how much or how little the community shall see of him , or know of him , beyond what is necessary for the proper discharge of all his duties to his neighbors and to the state . And this recognition by law and custom of a man 's house as his tutissirnum refugium , his place of repose , is but the outward and visible sign of the law 's respect for his personality as an individual , for that kingdom of the mind , that inner world of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in which every man who is worth much to himself or others , passes a great deal of time . The right to decide how much knowledge of this personal thought and feeling , and how much knowledge , therefore , of his tastes , and habits , of his own private doings and affairs , and those of his family living under his roof , the public at large shall have , is as much one of his natural rights as his right to decide how he shall eat and drink , what he shall wear , and in what manner he shall pass his leisure hours . Of course , the importance attached to this privacy varies in individuals . Intrusion on it afflicts or annoys different persons in different degrees . It annoys women more than men , and some men very much more than others . To some persons it causes exquisite pain to have their private life laid bare to the world , others rather like it ; but it may be laid down as a general rule that the former are the element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , and that which the state is most interested in cherishing and protecting . Personal dignity is the fine flower of civilization , and the more of it there is in a community , the better off the community is . It is the only form of self-respect which does not " take on airs , " and which possible . It is not one of the incidents of life in a camp , or a barrack , or in a man-of-war , or in a tenement-house , or a caravan . It can never become a social force without putting within the reach of those who seek it or care for it , the means of defending it . The chief enemy of privacy in modern life is that interest in other people and their affairs known as curiosity , which in the days before newspapers created personal gossip . As soon in the progress of civilization as men left the tent , or wigwam , or tribal dwelling , and retreated into private houses , a desire on the part of their neighbors to know what was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has flourished ever since the world over . There is a story of the traveller in the hotel in the Western mining town , who pinned a shirt across his open window to screen himself from the loafers on the piazza while performing his toilet ; after a few minutes he saw it drawn aside roughly by a hand from without , and on asking what it meant , a voice answered , " We want to know what there is so darned private going on in there ' ? " The loafers resented his attempts at seclusion in their own rude way , but they did it under the influence of a feeling which runs through all social life in our world . Curiosity , in its larger and nobler aspect , lies at the root of Western , as distinguished from Oriental , civilization . In its smaller , pettier , and more ignoble shape , it became the passion of the Paul Pry and the scandal-monger . Everybody who feels this latter , or social curiosity , as we may call it , is more or less ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eager to know all he can about his neighbor 's private life , and yet the private lives of our neighbors form the staple topic of conversation in most circles in the absence of strong intellectual , political , or commercial interests . This eagerness may be defended on the ground that the love of gossip is after all human , and that everything that is human concerns us deeply . The most absorbing topic for the bulk of mankind must always be other men 's doings and sayings , and it can hardly be denied that there is some substance in this apology . But as long as gossip was oral , it spread , as regarded any one individual , over a very small area , and was confined to the immediate circle of his acquaintances . It did not reach , or but rarely reached , those who knew nothing of him . It did not make his name , or his walk , or his conversation familiar to strangers . And what is more to the purpose , it spared him the pain or mortification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of oral gossip about him which simy*ly made him ridiculous , or trespassed on his lawful privacy , but made no positive attack on his reputation . His peace and comfort were , therefore , but slightly affected by it . In all this the advent of the newspapers , or rather of a particular class of newspapers , has made a great change . It has converted curiosity into what economists call an effectual demand , and gossip into a marketable commodity . The old Paul Pry whom our fathers despised and caricatured , and who was roundly kicked and cuffed on the stage for his indiscretions , has become a great wholesale dealer in an article of merchandise for which he finds a ready sale , and by which he frequently makes a fortune . In other words , gossip about private individuals is now printed , and makes its victim , with all his imperfections on his head , known hundreds or thousands of miles away from his place of abode ; and , what is worst of all , brings to his knowledge exactly what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus inflicts what is , to many men , the great pain of believing that everybody he meets in the street is perfectly familiar with some folly , or misfortune , or indiscretion , or weakness , which he had previously supposed had never got beyond his domestic circle . It is no defence for this state of things to say that the passion for notoriety of any kind has been fostered to such an extent by this wide diffusion of printed gossip , that there is a large number of people who do not dislike it , but on the contrary put themselves in the way of having their private life explored by the press . They are a small minority at best , and their taste must be recognized // as a depraved one , which even if the legislator does not discourage , he is not bound to take notice of at all , or to make its gratification easy . But it is not easy to say in what way a legislator could protect privacy , or prevent any intrusions into it , which do not plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in other words , which do not amount to what the law defines as libel . Press laws , more than any others , have to be supported not simply by the opinions but by the manners of the community . One of the effects on manners of a free and unbridled press , and of a great multiplicity of newspapers , is undoubtedly to lessen public sensitiveness to spoken or printed ridicule , or abuse , or depreciation , and consequently to lessen popular sympathy with the victim of it . In France a man can le*gally prevent or punish the mere mention of his name in any disagreeable connection , if he be not in political , literary , or artistic life . He can at once stop newspaper gossip about him , even though it be harmless gossip ; that is , he can forbid the publication of information of any sort about himself or his affairs . But in France the law on this subject is supported by a sensitiveness to ridicule or insult which has probably never existed in any AngloSaxon country , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed by the ' number and enterprise of the newspapers and the extremely democratic condition of American society . To provide legal protection for those who still retain it would , therefore , in the absence of popular sympathy , be very difficult . Juries , as I have said , are the real censors of the press , and juries are apt to be made up of men who , though they will punish actual damage to a man 's reputation , are not disposed to make much account of mere wounds to his feelings or his taste . The influence on manners , too , of the eagerness of notoriety is inevitably great in a society in which there are no distinctions of rank and no recognized social grades . To be widely known for some reason or other , or for any reason , is the one distinction which seems within every man 's reach , and the desire for it is sufficiently widely diffused not only to diminish popular sympathy with people who love the shade of private life , but to some extent to make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is only one remedy for the violations of the right to privacy within the reach of the American public , and that is but an imperfect one . It is to be found in attaching social discredit to invasions of it on the part of conductors of the press . At present this check can hardly be said to exist . It is to a large extent nullified by the fact that the offence is often pecuniarily profitable . It is frowned on severely by society at the outset , before it has fairly begun to pay , but as soon as the offender is able to show that it is bringing him in a large revenue , it is rapidly condoned or overlooked , and he takes rank among the successful business men of the community , and finds his claim to whatever honors wealth brings with it ; if not universally acknowledged , acknowledged sufficiently to more than compensate him for any previous discomfort . This amounts to saying that the responsibility for the excesses of the press in this direction , must fall in the last resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of success in life , and the possession of it as , to some degree , a justification of the means employed in acquiring it . As long as the moneygetting talent holds the field against all other competing talents , in the race for distinction of every kind , we shall probably not see any great change in the attitude of the press on this subject . This supremacy of the pecuniary reward over all other rewards , as an incentive to exertion , can hardly be permanent , but it is one of the phenomena of the present day , which can not be overlooked in any discussion of the defences thrown by law or opinion around the reputation or privacy of individuals . // By Octave Thanet .
