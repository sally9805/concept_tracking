txt Christian K. Ross , the father of Charles Ross , whose abduction on July 1 , 1874 , from his parents ' home became a matter of world-wide interest and still remains largely an unsolved mystery , died early this morning at his residence in Germantown , aged seventy-four years . The abduction of Charles Ross , who was a beautiful child , practically wrecked the life of his father , and from the time the boy was stolen , nearly twenty-three years ago , life seemed a burden to the once bustling business man . On July 1 , 1874 , Charlie Ross , then four years old , while playing in front of his father 's home , in Germantown , near Philadelphia , was taken into a buggy by two men under pretense of taking him for a ride , and carried beyond the reach of parents , as well as detectives . The father immediately offered a reward of $500 for his return , but this only elicited an anonymous communication in which It was stated that he could not be returned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " personal " in The Philadelphia Ledger that he was ready to negotiate to the extent of his ability . In a circular letter issued nine days after the abduction by the Philadelphia police the following description is given of the two men engaged in the abduction : " One wore a broad-brimmed straw hat , much worn and sunburned . The other wore a high-crowned , dark straw hat . One had a light , sandy mustache , and a rather red nose and face , was about thirty years of age , and 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high . The other was about 5 feet 10 inches high , and wore a full brown beard . " With such a description it was not at all surprising that many cases of mistaken identity followed . Arrests were made all over the country , but notiaing came of any of them . Finally the city authorities of Philadelphia offered a reward of $20,0uo for " such information as would lead to the recovery of the boy and the arrest and conviction of his abductors .

On the 28th of September , 1874 , Pinkerton announced that the case had got the better of him , and that he was willing to relinquish the reward of $20,000 . It came out at this time on the testimony of the family physician that Mr. Ross was " in a condition of prostration in - which he was unable to concentrate his thoughts or express his meaning . " In the meantime the work of " discovering " the stolen boy went on in the same unsatisfactory manner . Finally a number of clues led the police of this city to believe that William Mosher and James Douglass , two notorious river thieves , were the kidnappers . The two men were killed at Bay Ridge , L. I. , on Oct. 14 , 1874 , while trying to burglarize a house . Mr. Ross issued a circular , in which he expressed the belief that the two dead burglars were the abductors of his son , and offered a reward of $5,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was on Dec. 23 , 1874 .
