txt Before leaving for New York this afternoon Gov . Roosevelt made it clear that he had not the slightest objection to its being known that he expected to see Senator Platt while in the city , and that to consult with the Senator was one of the main objects of his visit . Had Mr. Platt remained in Washington the Governor would have gone to New York anyway to keep his other engagements , but he is glad to be able to combine the two . He expects to see other Republican leaders also , while in the city , Mr. Choate , Mr. Root , and Mr. Low among the number , and he will consult with them , as with Mr. Platt , first about the choice of a Superintendent of Public Works , and then , if there is time , about matters of legislation , such as the New York police question . The Governor is not frightened by the cry that he is breaking all precedents by going to New York - to consult with politicians . He does not care whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accord ' with the policy he has laid down and studiously pursued so far , of consulting the representative men of his party on matters where he feels the need of advice before making up his own mind .

Platt or Mr. Odell or John Proctor Clarke or Eiihu Root or Seth Low , and it is not convenient to have them come here , he will go down to New York to meet him . He will try to " bunch " these matters with such private business as may call him to the city from time to time , so as to accomplish four or five or half a dozen separate missions with one journey . . He expects to make no effort to keep any of them secret or to pass them off as on " purely personal " business , nor will he have any objection to its being known exactly whom he goes to see , whether it be Mr. Platt or some one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks , might as well be understood now , so that there may be no misconception or needless excitement when he takes a notion every now and then during the next two years . to run down to New York for a day or two . The Governor has not picked out successors to the three State Tax Commissioners whose terms expire this month , and he said to-day that he had not decided whether or not he would name a New York City . man on the new board . He had been assured by Controller Roberts that the presence of a city man on the board could not have helped things from a city point of view in the past . The whole question of the alleged inequalities of taxation is one the Governor has not been able to go into fully , however , and until he does he will withhold any positive action . TWELFTH NIGHT FESTIVITIES . The Governor Attends the Celebration of the Century Association . As soon as Gov . Roosevelt reached the city yesterday afternoon he- went to the home of his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until to-morrow night . He will then return to Albany .

Gen. Avery D. Andrews called later and joined the Governor at dinner . After dinner several ocher friends called , and the party conversed.for an hour or more , and then the Governor and Gen. Andrews drove in a cab to the Century Association , at 7 West Forty-third Street . It was pouring rain when they arrived ; but a number of the members of the association , in masquerade costumes , rushed to the door to meet the Governor . The celebration was described as a special revel , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his Court , which consisted of jesters , poet laureate , marshals , heralds , pages , and men at arms , wore costumes of the period of Charles I. A band of minstrels sang old English carols , and the ceremonies were conducted by a Master of Revel . Joseph H. Choate was King of the evening . Among some of the prominent men present were Whitelaw Reid , D. 0 . Mills , and prominent business men and members of the bar and bench . At the door were stationed three stalwart colored men costumed as Sheiks , and they divided their time in keeping out outsiders and piloting the merrymakers to the beer tunnel . On one side of the entrance was the legend , " Some men are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them ; take to thyself the trick of singularity . " As Gov . Roosevelt entered the club this was pointed out to him , and he read it and laughed . A theatrical entertainment was provided by the members , and at its conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presented with elaborate ceremony . The music , verses , plays , and costumes were the Products of different members , and the costumes were rich and varied .

He remained in the club till long after midnight . He made an informal talk , which was applauded .
