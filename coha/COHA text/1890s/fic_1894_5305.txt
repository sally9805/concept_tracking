WILLIS CAMPBELL Mrs. Campbell : " Now this , I think , is the most exciting part of the whole affair , and the pleasantest . " She is seated at breakfast in her cottage at Summering-by-the-Sea . A heap of letters of various stylish shapes , colors , and superscriptions lies beside her plate , and irregularly straggles about among the coffee-service . Vis-a-vis with her sits Mr. Campbell behind a newspaper . " How prompt they are ! Why , I did n't expect to get half so many answers yet . But that shows that where people have nothing to do but attend to their social duties they are always prompt  --  even the men ; women , of course , reply early anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town the men seem to put it off till the very last moment , and then some of them call when it 's over to excuse themselves for not having come after accepting . It really makes you wish for a leisure class . It 's only the drive and hurry of American life that make our men seem wanting in the convenances ; and if they had the time , with their instinctive delicacy , they would be perfect : it would come from the heart : they 're more truly polite now . Willis , just look at this ! " Campbell , behind his paper : " Look at what ? " Mrs. Campbell : " These replies . Why , I do believe that more than half the people have answered already , and the invitations only went out yesterday . That comes from putting on R.S.V.P. I knew I was right , and I shall always do it , I do n't care what you say . " Campbell : " You did n't put on R.S.V.P. after all I said ? " He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell : " Yes , I did . The idea of your setting up for an authority in such a thing as that ! " Campbell : " Then I 'm sorry I did n't ask you to do it . It 's a shame to make people say whether they 'll come to a garden-party from four till seven or not . " Mrs. Campbell : " A shame ? How can you provide if you do n't know how many are coming ? I should like to know that . But of course I could n't expect you to give in gracefully . " Campbell : " I should give in gracefully if I gave in at all , but I do n't . " He throws his paper down beside his chair . " Here , hand over the letters , and I 'll be opening them for you while you pour out the coffee . " Mrs. Campbell , covering the letters with her hands : " Indeed you wo n't ! " Campbell : " Well , pour out the coffee , then , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I shall not do it . I 'm going to open them every one before you get a drop of coffee  --  just to punish you . " Campbell : " To punish me ? For what ? " Mrs. Campbell hesitates , as if at a loss what to say . " There ! you do n't know . " Mrs. Campbell : " Yes , I do : for saying I ought n't to have put on R.S.V.P. Do you take it back ? " Campbell : " How can I till I 've had some coffee ? My mind wo n't work on an empty stomach . Well  --  " He rises and goes round the table towards her . Mrs. Campbell , spreading both arms over the letters : " Willis , if you dare to touch them , I 'll ring for Jane , and then she 'll see you cutting up . " Campbell : " Touch what ? I 'm coming to get some coffee . " Mrs. Campbell : " Well , I 'll give you some coffee ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after what you 've said . " Campbell : " All right ! " He extends one hand for the coffee , and with the other sweeps all the letters together , and starts back to his place . As she flies upon him , " Look out , Amy ; you 'll make me spill this coffee all over the table-cloth . " Mrs. Campbell , sinking into her seat : " Oh , Willis , how can you be so base ? Give me my letters . Do ! " Campbell , sorting them over : " You may have half . " Mrs. Campbell : " No ; I shall have all . I insist upon it . " Campbell : " Well , then , you may have all the ladies ' letters . There are twice as many of them . " Mrs. Campbell : " No ; I shall have the men 's , too . Give me the men 's first . " Campbell : " How can I tell which are the men 's without opening them ? " Mrs. Campbell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Come , now , Willis , do n't tease me any longer . You know I hate it . " Campbell , studying the superscriptions , one after another : " I want to see if I can guess who wrote them . Do n't you like to guess who wrote your letters before you open them ? " Mrs. Campbell , with dignity : " I do n't like to guess who wrote other people 's letters . " She looks down at the table-cloth with a menace of tears , and Campbell instantly returns all the notes . Campbell : " There , Amy ; you may have them . I do n't care who wrote them , nor what 's in them . And I do n't want you to interrupt me with any exclamations over them , if you please . " He reaches to the floor for his newspaper , and while he sips his coffee , Mrs. Campbell loses no time in opening her letters . Mrs. Campbell : " I shall do nothing but exclaim . The Curwens accept , of course  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is one , at any rate . The New York Addingses do , and the Philadelphia Addingses do n't ; I hardly expected they would , so soon after their aunt 's death , but I thought I ought to ask them . Mr. and Mrs. Roberts , naturally ; it was more a joke than anything , sending their invitation . Mrs. and the Misses Carver regret very much ; well , I do n't . Professor and Mrs. Traine are very happy , and so am I ; he does n't go everywhere , and he 's awfully nice . Mr. and Mrs. Lou Bemis are very happy , too , and Dr. Lawton is very happy . Mrs. Bridges Dear Mrs. Campbells me , and is very sorry in the first person ; she 's always nice . Mr. Phillips , Mr. Rangeley , Mr. Small , Mr. Peters , Mr. Staples , Mr. Thornton , all accept , and they 're all charming young fellows . " Campbell , around his paper : " Well , what of that ? " Mrs. Campbell , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ; I was n't talking to you . The Merrills have the pleasure , and the Morgans are sorrow-stricken ; the  --  " Campbell : " Yes , but why should you care whether those fellows are charming or not ? Who 's going to marry them ? " Mrs. Campbell : " I am . Mrs. Stevenson is bowed to the earth ; Colonel Murphree is overjoyed ; the Misses Ja  --  " Campbell , putting his paper down : " Look here , Amy . Do you know that you have one little infinitesimal ewe-lamb of a foible ? You think too much of young men . " Mrs. Campbell : " Younger men , you mean . And you have a multitude of perfectly mammoth peccadilloes . You interrupt . " She goes on opening and reading her letters . " Well , I did n't expect the Macklines could ; but everybody seems to be coming . " Campbell : " You pay them too much attention altogether . It spoils them ; and one of these days you 'll be getting some of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mrs. Campbell , with affected distraction : " What are you talking about ? I 'd refer them to you , and you could kill them . I suppose you killed lots of people in California . That 's what you always gave me to understand . " She goes on with her letters . Campbell : " I never killed a single human being that I can remember ; but there 's no telling what I might do if I were provoked . Now , there 's that young Welling . He 's about here under my feet all the time ; and he 's got a way lately of coming in through the window from the piazza that 's very intimate . He 's a nice fellow enough , and sweet , as you say . I suppose he has talent , too , but I never heard that he had set any of the adjacent watercourses on fire ; and I do n't know that he could give the Apollo Belvedere many points in beauty and beat him . " Mrs. Campbell : " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Greenway , who 's staying with her , and  --  yes ! here 's one from Mr. Welling ! Oh , how glad I am ! Willis , dearest , if I could be the means of bringing those two lovely young creatures together , I should be so happy ! Do n't you think , now , he is the most delicate-minded , truly refined , exquisitely modest young fellow that ever was ? " She presses the unopened note to her corsage , and leans eagerly forward entreating a sympathetic acquiescence . Campbell : " Well , as far as I can remember my own youth , no . But what does he say ? " Mrs. Campbell , regarding the letter : " I have n't looked yet . He writes the most characteristic hand , for a man , that I ever saw . And he has the divinest taste in perfumes ! Oh , I wonder what that is ? Like a memory  --  a regret . " She presses it repeatedly to her pretty nose , in the endeavor to ascertain . Campbell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Willis , you are delightful . I should like to see you really jealous once . " Campbell : " You wo n't , as long as I know my own incomparable charm . But give me that letter , Amy , if you 're not going to open it . I want to see whether Welling is going to come . " Mrs. Campbell , fondly : " Would you really like to open it ? I 've half a mind to let you , just for a reward . " Campbell : " Reward ! What for ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , I do n't know . Being so nice . " Campbell : " That 's something I ca n't help . It 's no merit . Well , hand over the letter . " Mrs. Campbell : " I should have thought you 'd insist on my opening it , after that . " Campbell : " Why ? " Mrs. Campbell : " To show your confidence . " Campbell : " When I have n't got any ? " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's no use trying any sentiment with you , or any generosity either . You 're always just the same ; a teasing joke is your ideal . You ca n't imagine a woman 's wanting to keep up a little romance all through ; and a character like Mr. Welling 's , who 's all chivalry and delicacy and deference , is quite beyond you . That 's the reason you 're always sneering at him . " Campbell : " I 'm not sneering at him , my dear . I 'm only afraid Miss Rice is n't good enough for him . " Mrs. Campbell , instantly placated : " Well , she 's the only girl who 's anywhere near it . I do n't say she 's faultless , but she has a great deal of character , and she 's very practical ; just the counterpart of his dreaminess ; and she is very , very good-looking , do n't you think ? " Campbell : " Her bang is n't so nice as his . " Mrs. Campbell : " No ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious look ! And his nose and chin are perfectly divine . He looks like a young god ! " Campbell : " I dare say ; though I never saw an old one . Well , is he coming ? I 'm not jealous , but I 'm impatient . Read it out loud . " Mrs. Campbell , sinking back in her chair for the more luxurious perusal of the note : " Indeed I shall not . " She opens it and runs it hastily through , with various little starts , stares , frowns , smiles of arrested development , laughs , and cries : " Why  --  why ! What does it mean ? Is he crazy ? Why , there 's some mistake . No ! It 's his hand  --  and here 's his name . I ca n't make it out . " She reads it again and again . " Why , it 's perfectly bewildering ! Why , there must be some mistake . He could n't have meant it . Could he have imagined ? Could he have dared ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured into  --  But of course not . And Mr. Welling , of all men ! Oh , I ca n't understand it ! Oh , Willis , Willis , Willis ! What does it mean ? " She flings the note wildly across the table , and catching her handkerchief to her face , falls back into her chair , tumultuously sobbing . Campbell , with the calm of a man accustomed to emotional superabundance , lifting the note from the toast-rack before him : " Well , let 's see . " He reads aloud : " ' Oh , my darling ! How can I live till I see you ? I will be there long before the hour ! To think of your asking me ! You should have said , " I permit you to come , " and I would have flown from the ends of the earth . The presence of others will be nothing . It will be sweet to ignore them in my heart , and while I see you moving among them , and looking after their pleasure with that beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , mine , mine ! " " Oh , young lord lover , what sighs are those For one that can never be thine ? " I thank you , and thank you a thousand times over , for this proof of your trust in me , and of your love  --  our love . You shall be the sole keeper of our secret  --  it is so sweet to think that no one even suspects it !  --  and it shall live with you , and if you will , it shall die with me . Forever yours , Arthur Welling . ' " Campbell turns the note over , and picking up the envelope , examines the address . " Well , upon my word ! It 's to you , Amy  --  on the outside , anyway . What do you suppose he means ? " Mrs. Campbell , in her handkerchief : " Oh , I do n't know ; I do n't know why he should address such language to me ! " Campbell , recurring to the letter : " I never did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  ends of the earth  --  others will be nothing  --  beautiful thoughtfulness  --  mine , mine , mine  --  our love  --  sweet to think no one suspects it  --  forever yours . ' Amy , these are pretty strong expressions to use towards the wife of another , and she a married lady ! I think I had better go and solve that little problem of how he can live till he sees you by relieving him of the necessity . It would be disagreeable to him , but perhaps there 's a social duty involved . " Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , Willis , do n't torment me ! What do you suppose it means ? Is it some  --  mistake ? It 's for somebody else ! " Campbell : " I do n't see why he should have addressed it to you , then . " Mrs. Campbell : " But do n't you see ? He 's been writing to some other person at the same time , and he 's got the answers mixed  --  put them in the wrong envelopes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell , studying her with an air of affected abstraction : " Her curiosity gets the better of her anguish . Look here , Amy ! I believe you 're afraid it 's to some one else . " Mrs. Campbell : " Willis ! " Campbell : " Yes . And before we proceed any further I must know just what you wrote to this  --  this Mr. Welling of yours . Did you put on R.S.V.P. ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Yes ; and just a printed card like all the rest . I did want to write him a note in the first person , and urge him to come , because I expected Miss Rice and Miss Greenway to help me receive ; but when I found Margaret had promised Mrs. Curwen for the next day , I knew she would n't like to take the bloom off that by helping me first ; so I did n't . " Campbell : " Did n't what ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Write to him . I just sent a card . " Campbell : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear . I must lose no time in destroying Mr. Welling . Do you happen to know where I laid my revolver ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , Willis , what are you going to do ? You see it 's a mistake . " Campbell : " Mr. Welling has got to prove that . I 'm not going to have young men addressing my wife as Oh their darling , without knowing the reason why . It 's a liberty . " Mrs. Campbell , inclined to laugh : " Ah , Willis , how funny you are ! " Campbell : " Funny ? I 'm furious . " Mrs. Campbell : " You know you 're not . Give me the letter , dearest . I know it 's for Margaret Rice , and I shall see her , and just feel round and find out if it is n't so , and  --  " Campbell : " What an idea ! You have n't the slightest evidence that it 's for Miss Rice , or that it is n't intended for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody is authority but Mr. Welling . And I 'm going to him with the corpus delicti . " Mrs. Campbell : " But how can you ? Remember how sensitive , how shrinking he is . Do n't , Willis ; you must n't . It will kill him ! " Campbell : " Well , that may save me considerable bother . If he will simply die of himself , I ca n't ask anything better . " He goes on eating his breakfast . Mrs. Campbell , admiring him across the table : " Oh , Willis , how perfectly delightful you are ! " Campbell : " I know ; but why ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Why , taking it in the nice , sensible way you do . Now , some husbands would be so stupid ! Of course you could n't think  --  you could n't dream  --  that the letter was really for me ; and yet you might behave very disagreeably , and make me very unhappy , if you were not just the lovely , kind-hearted , magnanimous  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hello ! " Mrs. Campbell : " Yes ; that is what took my fancy in you , Willis : that generosity , that real gentleness , in spite of the brusque way you have . Refinement of the heart , I call it . " Campbell : " Amy , what are you after ? " Mrs. Campbell : " We 've been married a whole year now  --  " Campbell : " Longer , is n't it ? " Mrs. Campbell : "  --  And I have n't known you do an unkind thing , a brutal thing . " Campbell : " Well , I understand the banging around hardly ever begins much under two years . " Mrs. Campbell : " How sweet you are ! And you 're so funny always ! " Campbell : " Come , come , Amy ; get down to business . What is it you do want ? " Mrs. Campbell : " You wo n't go and tease that poor boy about his letter , will you ? Just hand it to him , and say you suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , and that you wish to restore it to him , and then  --  just run off . " Campbell : " With my parasol in one hand , and my skirts caught up in the other ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , how good ! Of course I was imagining how I should do it . " Campbell : " Well , a man ca n't do it that way . He would look silly . " He rises from the table , and comes and puts his arm round her shoulders . " But you need n't be afraid of my being rough with him . Of course it 's a mistake ; but he 's a fellow who will enter into the joke too ; he 'll enjoy it ; he 'll  --  " He merges his sentence in a kiss on her upturned lips , and she clings to his hand with her right , pressing it fondly to her cheek . " I shall do it in a man 's way ; but I guess you 'll approve of it quite as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what I like about you , Willis : your being so helplessly a man always . " Campbell : " Well , that 's what attracted me to you , Amy ; your manliness . " Mrs. Campbell : " And I liked your finesse . You are awfully inventive , Willis . Why , Willis , I 've just thought of something . Oh , it would be so good if you only would ! " Campbell : " Would what ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Invent something now to get us out of the scrape . " Campbell : " What a brilliant idea ! I 'm not in any scrape . And as for Mr. Welling , I do n't see how you could help him out unless you sent this letter to Miss Rice , and asked her to send yours back  --  " Mrs. Campbell , springing to her feet : " Willis , you are inspired ! Oh , how perfectly delightful ! And it 's so delicate of you to think of that ! I will just enclose his note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know that it ever went to the wrong address . Oh , I always felt that you were truly refined , anyway . " He passively yields the letter , and she whirls away to a writing-desk in the corner of the room . " Now , I 'll just keep a copy of the letter  --  for a joke ; I think I 've a perfect right to "  --  scribbling furiously away  --  " and then I 'll match the paper with an envelope  --  I can do that perfectly  --  and then I 'll just imitate his hand  --  such fun !  --  and send it flying over to Margaret Rice . Oh , how good ! Touch the bell , Willis ; " and then  --  as the serving-maid appears  --  " Yes , Jane ! Run right across the lawn to Mrs. Rice 's , and give this letter for Miss Margaret , and say it was left here by mistake . Well , it was , Willis . Fly , Jane ! Oh , Willis , love ! Is n't it perfect ! Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation , and be all mixed up by it , and now when this note comes , she 'll see through it all in an instant , and it will be such a relief to her ; and oh , she 'll think that he 's directed both the letters to her because he could n't think of any one else ! Is n't it lovely ? Just like anything that 's nice , it 's ten times as nice as you expected it to be ; and  --  " Campbell : " But hold on , Amy ! " He lifts a note from the desk . " You 've sent your copy . Here 's the original now . She 'll think you 've been playing some joke on her . " Mrs. Campbell , clutching the letter from him , and scanning it in a daze : " What ! Oh , my goodness ! It is ! I have ! Oh , I shall die ! Run ! Call her back ! Shriek , Willis ! " They rush to the window together . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to their man , and now nothing can save me ! Oh , Willis ! Willis ! Willis ! This is all your fault , with that fatal suggestion of yours . Oh , if you had only left it to me I never should have got into such a scrape ! She will think now that I 've been trying to hoax her , and she 's perfectly implacable at the least hint of a liberty , and she 'll be ready to kill me . I do n't know what she wo n't do . Oh , Willis , how could you get me into this ! " Campbell , irately : " Get you into this ! Now , Amy , this is a little too much . You got yourself into it . You urged me to think of something  --  " Mrs. Campbell : " Well , do , Willis , do think of something , or I shall go mad ! Help me , Willis ! Do n't be so heartless  --  so unfeeling . " Campbell : " There 's only one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it to Welling , and get him to help us out . A word from him can make everything right , and we ca n't take a step without him ; we ca n't move ! " Mrs. Campbell : " I ca n't let you . Oh , is n't it horrible ! " Campbell : " Yes ; a nice thing is always ten times nicer than you expected it to be ! " Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , how can you stand there mocking me ? Why do n't you go to him at once , and tell him the whole thing , and beg him , implore him , to help us ? " Campbell : " Why , you just told me I must n't ! " Mrs. Campbell : " You did n't expect me to say you might , did you ? Oh , how cruel ! " She whirls out of the room , and Campbell stands in a daze , in which he is finally aware of Mr. Arthur Welling , seen through the open window , on the veranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , seems to be fixed to the spot where he stands . II MR . WELLING ; MR . CAMPBELL Campbell : " Why , Welling , what the devil are you doing there ? " Welling : " Trying to get away . " Campbell : " To get away ? But you sha' n't , man ! I wo n't let you . I was just going to see you . How long have you been there ? " Welling : " I 've just come . " Campbell : " What have you heard ? " Welling : " Nothing  --  nothing . I was knocking on the window-casing to make you hear , but you seemed preoccupied . " Campbell : " Preoccupied ! convulsed ! cataclysmed ! Look here : we 're in a box , Welling . And you 've got us into it . " He pulls Welling 's note out of his pocket , where he has been keeping his hand on it , and pokes it at him . " Is that yours ? " Welling , examining it with bewilderment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May I ask , Mr. Campbell , how you came to have this letter ? " Campbell : " May I ask , Mr. Welling , how you came to write such a letter to my wife ? " Welling : " To your wife ? To Mrs. Campbell ? I never wrote any such letter to her . " Campbell : " Then you addressed it to her . " Welling : " Impossible ! " Campbell : " Impossible ? I think I can convince you , much as I regret to do so . " He makes search about Mrs. Campbell 's letters on the table first , and then on the writing-desk . " We have the envelope . It came amongst a lot of letters , and there 's no mistake about it . " He continues to toss the letters about , and then desists . " But no matter ; I ca n't find it ; Amy 's probably carried it off with her . There 's no mistake about it . I was going to have some fun with you about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whom did you send Mrs. Campbell 's letter to ? " Welling : " Mrs. Campbell 's letter ? " Campbell : " Oh , pshaw ! your acceptance or refusal , or whatever it was , of her garden fandango . You got an invitation ? " Welling : " Of course . " Campbell : " And you wrote to accept it or decline it at the same time that you wrote this letter here to some one else . And you addressed two envelopes before you put the notes in either . And then you put them into the wrong envelopes . And you sent this note to my wife , and the other note to the other person  --  " Welling : " No , I did n't do anything of the kind ! " He regards Campbell with amazement , and some apparent doubt of his sanity . Campbell : " Well , then , Mr. Welling , will you allow me to ask what the deuce you did do ? " Welling : " I never wrote to Mrs. Campbell at all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't come . It seemed so formal to write . " Campbell : " Then will you be kind enough to tell me whom you did write to ? " Welling : " No , Mr. Campbell , I ca n't do that . " Campbell : " You write such a letter as that to my wife , and then wo n't tell me whom it 's to ? " Welling : " No ! And you 've no right to ask me . " Campbell : " I 've no right to ask you ? " Welling : " No . When I tell you that the note was n't meant for Mrs. Campbell , that 's enough . " Campbell : " I 'll be judge of that , Mr. Welling . You say that you were not writing two notes at the time , and that you did n't get the envelopes mixed . Then , if the note was n't meant for my wife , why did you address it to her ? " Welling : " That 's what I ca n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as great a mystery to me as it is to you . I can only conjecture that when I was writing that address I was thinking of coming to explain to Mrs. Campbell that I was going away to-day , and should n't be back till after her party . It was too complicated to put in a note without seeming to give my regrets too much importance . And I suppose that when I was addressing the note that I did write I put Mrs. Campbell 's name on because I had her so much in mind . " Campbell , with irony : " Oh ! " III MRS . CAMPBELL ; MR . WELLING ; MR . CAMPBELL Mrs. Campbell , appearing through the portiere that separates the breakfast-room from the parlor beyond : " Yes ! " She goes up and gives her hand to Mr. Welling with friendly frankness . " And it was very nice of you to think of me at such a time , when you ought to have been thinking of some one else . " Welling , with great relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell ! I was sure you would understand . You could n't have imagined me capable of addressing such language to you ; of presuming  --  of  --  " Mrs. Campbell : " Of course not ! And Willis has quite lost his head . I saw in an instant just how it was . I 'm so sorry you ca n't come to my party  --  " Campbell : " Amy , have you been eavesdropping ? " Mrs. Campbell : " There was no need of eavesdropping . I could have heard you out at Loon Rock Light , you shouted so . But as soon as I recognized Mr. Welling 's voice I came to the top of the stairs and listened . I was sure you would do something foolish . But now I think we had better make a clean breast of it , and tell Mr. Welling just what we 've done . We knew , of course , the letter was n't for me , and we thought we would n't vex you about it , but just send it to the one it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Welling , though we did n't intend to ; but if you 'll accept our congratulations  --  under the rose , of course  --  we wo n't let it go any further . It does seem so perfectly ideal , and I feel like saying , Bless you , my children ! You 've been in and out here so much this summer , and I feel just like an elder sister to Margaret . " Welling : " Margaret ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Well , Miss Rice , then  --  " Welling : " Miss Rice ? " Mrs. Campbell , with dignity : " Oh , I 'm sorry if we seem to presume upon our acquaintance with the matter . We could n't very well help knowing it under the circumstances . " Welling : " Certainly , certainly  --  of course : I do n't mind that at all : I was going to tell you , anyway : that was partly the reason why I came instead of writing  --  " Campbell , in an audible soliloquy : " I supposed he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't interrupt , Willis ! Well ? " Welling : " But I do n't see what Miss Rice has to do with it . " Mrs. Campbell : " You do n't see ! Why , is n't Margaret Rice the one  --  " Welling : " What one ? " Mrs. Campbell : " The one that you 're engaged  --  the one that the note was really for ? " Welling : " No ! What an idea ! Miss Rice ? Not for an instant ! It 's  --  it 's her friend  --  Miss Greenway  --  who 's staying with her  --  " Mrs. Campbell , in a very awful voice : " Willis ! Get me some water  --  some wine ! Help me ! Ah ! Do n't touch me ! It was you , you who did it all ! Oh , now what shall I do ? " She drops her head upon Campbell 's shoulder , while Welling watches them in stupefaction . Campbell : " It 's about a million times nicer than we could have expected . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . Well , young man , you 're done for ; and so are we , for that matter . We supposed that note which you addressed to Mrs. Campbell was intended for Miss Rice  --  " Welling : " Ho , ho , ho ! Ah , ha , ha ! Miss Rice ? Ha  --  " Campbell : " I 'm glad you like it . You 'll enjoy the rest of it still better . We thought it was for Miss Rice , and my wife neatly imitated your hand on an envelope and sent it over to her just before you came in . Funny , is n't it ? Laugh on ! Do n't mind us ! " Welling , aghast : " Thought my note was for Miss Rice ? Sent it to her ? Gracious powers ! " They all stand for a moment in silence , and then Welling glances at the paper in his hand . " But there 's some mistake . You have n't sent my note to Miss Rice : here it is now ! " Campbell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Campbell took a copy "  --  Mrs. Campbell moans  --  " she meant to have some fun with you about it , and it 's ten times as much fun as I expected ; and in her hurry she sent off her copy and kept the original . Perhaps that makes it better . " Mrs. Campbell , detaching herself from him and confronting Mr. Welling : " No ; worse ! She 'll think we 've been trying to hoax her , and she 'll be in a towering rage ; and she 'll show the note to Miss Greenway , and you 'll be ruined . Oh poor Mr. Welling ! Oh , what a fatal , fatal  --  mix ! " She abandons herself in an attitude of extreme desperation upon a chair , while the men stare at her , till Campbell breaks the spell by starting forward and ringing the bell on the table . Mrs. Campbell : " What are you doing , Willis ? " Campbell : " Ringing for Jane . " As Jane appears : " Did you give Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPBELL ; WELLING ; CAMPBELL Jane : " No , sir ; I gave it to the man . He said he would give it to Miss Rice . " Campbell : " Then it 's all up . If by any chance she had n't got it , Amy , you might have sent over for it , and said there was a mistake . " Jane : " He said Miss Rice was out driving with Miss Greenway in her phaeton , but they expected her back every minute . " Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , my goodness ! And you did n't come to tell me ? Oh , if we had only known ! We 've lost our only chance , Willis . " Jane : " I did come and knock on your door , ma'am , but I could n't make you hear . " Campbell : " There 's still a chance . Perhaps she has n't got back yet . " Jane : " I know she ai n't , sir . I 've been watching for her ever since . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Campbell : " Well , then , do n't stand there talking , but run at once ! Oh , Willis ! Never tell me again that there 's no such thing as an overruling providence . Oh , what an interposition ! Oh , I can never be grateful and humble enough  --  Goodness me , Jane ! why do n't you go ? " Jane : " Go where , ma'am ? I do n't know what you want me to do . I 'm willing enough to do anything if I know what it is , but it 's pretty hard to do things if you do n't . " Campbell : " You 're perfectly right , Jane . Mrs. Campbell wants you to telegraph yourself over to Mrs. Rice 's , and say to her that the letter you left for Miss Rice is not for her , but another lady , and Mrs. Campbell sent it by mistake . Get it and bring it back here , dead or alive , even if Mrs. Rice has to pass over your mangled body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Mrs. Campbell gasps in ineffective efforts to reinforce her husband 's instructions : " I will that , sir . " V MRS . CAMPBELL ; WELLING ; CAMPBELL Campbell : " And now , while we 're waiting , let 's all join hands and dance round the table . You 're saved , Welling . So are you , Amy . And so am I  --  which is more to the point . " Mrs. Campbell , gayly : " Dansons ! " She extends her hands to the gentlemen , and as they circle round the breakfast-table she sings , " Sur le pont d'Avignon , Tout le monde y danse en rond . " She frees her hands and courtesies to one gentleman and the other . " Les belles dames font comme ca ; Les beaux messieurs font comme ca . " Then she catches hands with them again , and they circle round the table as before , singing , " Sur le pont d'Avignon , Tout le monde y danse en rond . Oh , dear ! Stop ! I 'm dizzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , while the men continue solemnly circling by themselves . Campbell : " It is a sacred dance : " Sur le pont d'Avignon  --  " Welling : " It 's an expiation : " Tout le monde y danse en rond . " Mrs. Campbell , springing from her chair and running to the window : " Stop , you crazy things ! Here comes Jane ! Come right in here , Jane ! Did you get it ? Give it to me , Jane ! " Welling : " I think it belongs to me , Mrs. Campbell . " Campbell : " Jane , I am master of the house  --  nominally . Give me the letter . " VI JANE ; MRS . CAMPBELL ; WELLING ; CAMPBELL Jane , entering , blown and panting , through the open window : " Oh , how I did run  --  " Mrs. Campbell : " Yes , yes ! But the letter  --  " Welling : " Did you get it ? " Campbell : " Where is it ? " Jane , fanning herself with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Mrs. Campbell : " Had she got back ? " Jane : " No , ma'am . " Campbell : " Did Mrs. Rice object to giving it up ? " Jane : " No , sir . " Welling : " Then it 's all right ? " Jane : " No , sir . All wrong . " Welling : " All wrong ? " Campbell : " How all wrong ? " Mrs. Campbell : " What 's all wrong , Jane ? " Jane : " Please , ma'am , may I have a drink of water ? I 'm so dry I ca n't speak . " Mrs. Campbell : " Yes , certainly . " Campbell : " Of course . " Welling : " Here . " They all pour glasses of water and press them to her lips . Jane , pushing the glasses away , and escaping from the room : " They thought Mrs. Campbell was in a great hurry for Miss Rice to have the letter , and they sent off the man with it to meet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Campbell : " Oh , merciful goodness ! " Welling : " Gracious powers ! " Campbell : " Another overruling providence . Now you are in for it , my boy ! So is Amy . And so am I  --  which is still more to the point . " Mrs. Campbell : " Well , now , what shall we do ? " Campbell : " All that we can do now is to await developments : they 'll come fast enough . Miss Rice will open her letter as soon as she gets it , and she wo n't understand it in the least ; how could she understand a letter in your handwriting , with Welling 's name signed to it ? She 'll show it to Miss Greenway  --  " Welling : " Oh , do n't say that ! " Campbell : "  --  Greenway ; and Miss Greenway wo n't know what to make of it either . But she 's the kind of girl who 'll form some lively conjectures when she reads that letter . In the first place , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Rice in that affectionate strain  --  " Mrs. Campbell , in an appealing shriek : " Willis ! " Campbell : "  --  And she naturally wo n't believe he 's done it . But then , when Miss Rice tells her it 's your handwriting , Amy , she 'll think that you and Miss Rice have been having your jokes about Mr. Welling ; and she 'll wonder what kind of person you are , anyway , to make free with a young man 's name that way . " Welling : " Oh , I assure you that she admires Mrs. Campbell more than anybody . " Mrs. Campbell : " Do n't try to stop him ; he 's fiendish when he begins teasing . " Campbell : " Oh , well ! If she admires Mrs. Campbell and confides in you , then the whole affair is very simple . All you 've got to do is to tell her that after you 'd written her the original of that note , your mind was so full of Mrs. Campbell and her garden-party that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cut in and say that when she got the note she knew it was n't for her , but she never dreamed of your caring for Miss Greenway , and was so sure it was for Miss Rice that she sent her a copy of it . That will make it all right and perfectly agreeable to every one concerned . " Mrs. Campbell : " And I can say that I sent it at your suggestion , and then , instead of trying to help me out of the awful , awful  --  box , you took a cruel pleasure in teasing me about it ! But I shall not say anything , for I shall not see them . I will leave you to receive them and make the best of it . Do n't try to stop me , Willis . " She threatens him with her fan as he steps forward to intercept her escape . Campbell : " No , no ! Listen , Amy ! You must stay and see those ladies . It 's all well enough to leave it to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything  --  except cause the whole trouble . " Mrs. Campbell : " I am very sorry , but I ca n't help it . I must go . " Campbell continues to prevent her flight , and she suddenly whirls about and makes a dash at the open window . " Oh , very well , then ! I can get out this way . " At the same moment Miss Rice and Miss Greenway appear before the window on the piazza . " Ugh ! E  --  e  --  e ! How you frightened me ! But  --  but come in . So gl  --  glad to see you ! And you  --  you too , Miss Greenway . Here 's Mr. Welling . He 's been desolating us with a story about having to be away over my party , and just getting back for Mrs. Curwen 's . Is n't it too bad ? Ca n't some of you young ladies  --  or all of you  --  make him stay ? " As Mrs. Campbell talks on , she readjusts her spirit more and more to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweetest politeness . VIII MISS RICE , MISS GREENWAY , and the OTHERS Miss Rice , entering with an unopened letter in her hand , which she extends to Mrs. Campbell : " What in the world does it all mean , Mrs. Campbell , your sending your letters flying after me at this rate ? " Mrs. Campbell , with a gasp : " My letters ? " She mechanically receives the extended note , and glances at the superscription : " Mrs. Willis Campbell . Ah ! " She hands it quickly to her husband , who reads the address with a similar cry . Campbell : " Well , well , Amy ! This is a pretty good joke on you . You 've sealed up one of your own notes , and sent it to Miss Rice . Capital ! Ah , ha , ha ! " Mrs. Campbell , with hysterical rapture : " Oh , how delicious ! What a ridiculous blunder ! I do n't wonder you were puzzled , Margaret . " Welling : " What ! Sent her your own letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Is n't it amusing ? " Welling : " The best thing I ever heard of . " Miss Rice : " Yes . And if you only knew what agonies of curiosity Miss Greenway and I had suffered , wanting to open it and read it anyway , in spite of all the decencies , I think you would read it to us . " Campbell : " Or at least give Miss Rice her own letter . What in the world did you do with that ? " Mrs. Campbell : " Put it in my desk , where I thought I put mine . But never mind it now . I can tell you what was in it just as well . Come in here a moment , Margaret . " She leads the way to the parlor , whither Miss Rice follows . Miss Greenway , poutingly : " Oh , may n't I know , too ? I think that 's hardly fair , Mrs. Campbell . " Mrs. Campbell : " No ; or  --  Margaret may tell you afterwards ; or Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How very formidable ! " Mrs. Campbell , over her shoulder , on going out : " Willis , bring me the refusals and acceptances , wo n't you ? They 're up-stairs . " Campbell : " Delighted to be of any service . " Behind Miss Greenway 's back he dramatizes over her head to Welling his sense of his own escape , and his compassion for the fellow-man whom he leaves in the toils of fate . IX MISS GREENWAY ; MR . WELLING Welling : " Nelly ! " He approaches , and timidly takes her hand . Miss Greenway : " Arthur ! That letter was addressed in your handwriting . Will you please explain ? " Welling : " Why , it 's very simple  --  that is , it 's the most difficult thing in the world . Nelly , can you believe anything I say to you ? " Miss Greenway : " What nonsense ! Of course I can  --  if you 're not too long about it . " Welling : " Well , then , the letter in that envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of one . " Miss Greenway : " The copy ? " Welling : " But let me explain . You see , when I got your note asking me to be sure and come to Mrs. Curwen 's  --  " Miss Greenway : " Yes ? " Welling : "  --  I had just received an invitation from Mrs. Campbell for her garden-party , and I sat down and wrote to you , and concluded I 'd step over and tell her why I could n't come , and with that in mind I addressed your letter  --  the one I 'd written you  --  to her . " Miss Greenway : " With my name inside ? " Welling : " No ; I merely called you ' darling ' ; and when Mrs. Campbell opened it she saw it could n't be for her , and she took it into her head it must be for Miss Rice . " Miss Greenway : " For Margaret ? What an idea ! But why did she put your envelope on it ? " Welling : " She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , in her hurry , she enclosed that in my envelope , and kept the original and the envelope she 'd addressed to Miss Rice , and  --  and that 's all . " Miss Greenway : " What a perfectly delightful muddle ! And how shall we get out of it with Margaret ? " Welling : " With Margaret ? I do n't care for her . It 's you that I want to get out of it with . And you do believe me  --  you do forgive me , Nelly ? " Miss Greenway : " For what ? " Welling : " For  --  for  --  I do n't know what for . But I thought you 'd be so vexed . " Miss Greenway : " I should n't have liked you to send a letter addressed darling to Mrs. Curwen ; but Mrs. Campbell is different . " Welling : " Oh , how archangelically sensible ! How divine of you to take it in just the right way ! " Illustration : MR . WELLING EXPLAINS . Miss Greenway : " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take such a thing in the wrong way ! " Welling : " And I 'm so glad now I did n't try to lie to you about it . " Miss Greenway : " It would n't have been of any use . You could n't have carried off anything of that sort . The truth is bad enough for you to carry off . Promise me that you will always leave the other thing to me . " Welling : " I will , darling ; I will , indeed . " Miss Greenway : " And now we must tell Margaret , of course . " X MISS RICE ; then MR. and MRS . CAMPBELL , and the OTHERS Miss Rice , rushing in upon them , and clasping Miss Greenway in a fond embrace : " You need n't . Mrs. Campbell has told me ; and oh , Nelly , I 'm so happy for you ! And is n't it all the greatest mix ? " Campbell , rushing in , and wringing Welling 's hand : " You need n't tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard every word . I congratulate you , my dear boy ! I 'd no idea she 'd let you up so easily . You 'll allow yourself it is n't a very likely story . " Welling : " I know it . But  --  " Miss Rice : " That 's the very reason no one could have made it up . " Miss Greenway : " He could n't have made up even a likely story . " Campbell : " Congratulate you again , Welling . Do you suppose she can keep so always ? " Mrs. Campbell , rushing in with extended hands : " Do n't answer the wretch , Mr. Welling . Of course she can with you . Dansons ! " She gives a hand to Miss Greenway and Welling each ; the others join them , and as they circle round the table she sings , " Sur le pont d'Avignon , Tout le monde y danse en rond .
