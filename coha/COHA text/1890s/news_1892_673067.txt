txt The letter of ex-Judge LYNDE HARRISON of Connecticut announcing his reasons for voting for Mr. CLEVELAND this year - will be found . in our columns this morning . It is a very frank and interesting statement . Mr. HARRISON , like so many men of prominence who have followed the same course . has been always a Republican . Ho has been elected by that party to each branch of the State Legislature , and . - was at one time Speaker of the House of Representafives . In 1884 ho was Chairman of the Republican State Committee . In the confusion arising over the disputed Governorship of Connecticut , Mr. HARRISON was intimately acquainted with all the facts , and his present change of party is largely based on his conviction of the necessity of a radical reform in State affairs . On national affairs , he has parted with the Republican Party for two reasons  --  one that its policy of high tariff is carried too far ; the other that the party is hopelessly wrong as to a Federal election law . " - Upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a Republican of the Garfield school , but not of the clan . I believe that all taxation should be limited to the necessities of the Government , and revenue should be the primary object sought ; that in the adjustment of the tariff the interests of American labor should be carefully considered , and that rates of tariff taxation should he lowered , rather than increased , in times of peace . That was the position of the Republican Party under the Administrations of GRANT , HAYRS , GARFIELD , and ARTRUR , Within the last four years the Administration has dragged the party away from its old position on this subject . " Ile finds the actual position of the Democrats and Mr. CLI:vr , LAND nearer the " old position " of the Republicans than that of the Republicans themselves . So he goes with Mr. CLEVELAND and the Democrats . As wo have many times pointed out , men of this stamp do not leave their party ; they stand fast to its avowed policy and principles which the party has abandoned . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good and much evil to be reaped from the Republican policy . The worst of that policy is that it is " designed for use in one part of the country only . " New-England would resent it , and we have no right to force on the South what we should resent . Moreover , everything done in that direction has wrought mischief : " If the party managers since 1877 had never made any attempt to interfere ' with elections at the South by Federal election laws , or by declarations on that subject in the national platforms , the whites of the South would have divided long ago , and some of the Southern States might to-day have been carried by a body of white men acting under the auspices of tilt , National Republican Party . " Mr. HARRISON reviews the history of the past two years in Connecticut and says : " The candidates nominated by the Republicans for the State offices are personally worthy citizens , but they stand in this election in an unfortunate position . A vote for them is a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wrong committed upon the Demooratio candidates elected in 1S90 is a deadly blow at the most sacred rights of self-government . If it is not rebuked at the polls a precedent will have been established fraught with grave danger to our institutions in the future . A bold , bad game has been played in the last two years . It may be played for higher stakes , in a bolder fashion , and by worse men in the future , if the people indorse the actions of the last two years . I am proud of the political history of our State , which , until 1891 , has been free from all taint of fraud . Because I would keep it so , I deem it my duty to vote for the Democratic candidates for the State offices , and this I would do whatever my views were upon national polities . " Judge HArtrasow 's letter strikes us as candid and logical . We believe it will be very effective .                @ @ @ @ @
