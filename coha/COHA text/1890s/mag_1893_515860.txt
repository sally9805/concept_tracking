BY GEORGE PARSONS LATHROP . THIRTY years ago the state of affairs in the New York world of art ( a " world " only by courtesy ) might largely have been summed up in one word " Dusseldorf . " At least it was from that little ex-duchy and its famous academy that the ruling influence came . We had the Dfisseldorf Gallery , a pseudo-Gothic and churchlike wooden building down on Broadway , outwardly as brown as the tone of the pictures it contained ; and for a while the torch of illumination seemed to consist of tallow , a favorite order of subjects being candle-light effects , varied occasionally by ghastly moonlight contrasts . Painters who were not allured by this taper tried to follow , in the good or bad old way , Flemish and Italian masters of the great period , or else modelled upon the English story-telling school , or patiently sought to reflect American landscape in compositions that betrayed no distinct foreign lineage , yet , it must also be said , showed little of native force or of originality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak and superficial ; the genre work of the time was of a thin , crude sort , which could not now gain attention ; and Henry Tuckerman 's later dictum would have applied equally well then : " Our painters have no individual , unmistakable manner , like that of every well-known foreign painter . " There came a bright October day in 1863 when a short procession of gentlemen , brought up in the rear by two school - boys ( of whom the writer w .. *s one ) , formed at the Century Club , and marched up Fourth Avenue to the corner of Twenty-third Street , where the cornerstone of the present Academy of Design was laid . That was a time of civil war and turmoil ; and I remember how Parke Godwin , making a speech at this ceremony , eloquently compared the advance which art was about to make in America to the new life it had sprung into amid the popular struggles of the Netherlands . Faith was needed to accept his prophecy , but the occasion really was the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its new building a local pre-Raphaelite movement began to show how much headway it had gained . Its leaders , one of whom was T. C. Farrer , brother of Henry Farrer ( since distinguished as a water-colorist and a piesident of the Water-color Society ) , were inspired by Ruskin ; they sympathized with Millais in his earlier phase , and with Holrnan Hunt ; and their zeal for uncompromising truth to nature , as they saw it , was almost religious in its intensity . These New York pre-Raphaelites opened their tubes and poured out upon the astonished public a flood of green and violet paint . Their landscapes bloomed with unmitigated verdure . They were disposed , also , to abolish perspective as the nation had abolished slavery . Distant trees were rendered with minute attention to species and structure ; rocks and pebbles were viewed as through a lapidary 's glass ; mountains were often finished with a texture smooth as satin . Yet , although our pre - Raphaelites never rose to the making of great pictures , and did afterwards mostly forsake what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valuable service by stirring up reaction against dull precedent and blind conventionality . They brought into their art , as practised here , that love for humble beauty , for clear vision , and fidelity in describing or interpreting nature which Wordsworth had victoriously championed in poetry . The movement was only an episode , and the old methods persisted side by side with it ; yet changes resulted gradually . Distantly , and in part , it was a precursor of the impressionist wave which at the present hour bears up so many brilliant young artists , and overspreads our gallery walls with luminous or bizarre color . The Academy building , too , anticipated by a long interval , and almost alone , that architectural progress which was yet to be realized ; for it was one of the first artistic efforts in secular architecture in post-Revolutionary New York . But the institution itself was not at first adequate to the demands of new and vigorous growth in local art . Ten years after the pre-Raphaelites appeared , and when they had entirely dispersed or found their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to landscape , most of it sadly lacking character // and style . There was an astonishing absence of competent figure-painting and interesting theme or composition . Then , suddenly , a number of strong young men who had profited by improved training abroad , who had quietly strengthened the sinews of their individuality in Europe and at home , were admitted to the spring exhibition of 1874 . The effect was , for that period , startling . Their canvases were like windows unexpectedly opened upon a fair and hopeful prospect . They showed us figures well drawn and solidly painted ; powerful portraits ; bold effects of atmosphere ; a rich tone and rugged handling in landscape , all but unknown in American work until then . It is true that here and there among the older artists were sturdy and progressive men  --  to name only two - like George Inness and Eastman Johnson , to either of whom , if discussed according to his merit , a separate paper should be devoted . Inness , whose work still delights us , was from the first a vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great massiveness and sincerity ; and his eye in later years has pursued the subtleties of color in nature with a keenness that enables him to remain modern among the moderns . Eastman Johnson , though once exposed to Dusseldorf influence , long since found a distinctive manner of treating scenes of American country life in Nantucket and elsewhere , and afterwards put forth his strength in portraits with an energy and skill not yet diminished . Others there were and are who might here receive encomium . But , on the whole , the Academy of 1874 was a revelation of novel forces coming into play . The next year the representatives of these forces were largely excluded . This resulted in the forming of a new body , the Society of American Artists , which has become an established power , and in its fifteen annual displays has succeeded in bringing out collections marked by great freedom , variety , and striking initiative . Among the foremost of the earlier New York contributors were Walter Shirlaw , William M. Chase , Wyatt Eaton , A. H. Thayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. XV . Dewing , Will H. Low , Duveneck , George Fuller ( of Boston ) , J. M. Whistler , John S. Sargent , and J. Alden Weir , with the sculptors Augustus St. Gaudens and Olin Warner and others . The list , of course , has been immensely added to in successive seasons . A brief review of these facts is essential to an understanding of the way in which that amazing change which has taken place as to matters of art in New York , even within less than twenty years , came about . No doubt , as Mr. F. D. Millet reminded us not long ago , the Philadelphia exhibition of 1876 prompted a general artistic interest all over the country , to which the whole nation is much indebted . But it should not be forgotten that New York had for a long time been working steadily though slowly towards the organization and the advancement of artistic elements and aims , that these had been defined , and the road of progress had been entered upon , before the Centennial Exhibition took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were perhaps the most prominent for a while ; but some of the members were equally imbued with French theory and example , and others drew in equal measure from living masters of various nationalities . Each , however , had some special bent natural to himself . The common principle uniting the members then as now appears to be that each picture , of whatever scope-realistic , impressionist , fanciful , or ideal-should spring from a purely graphic ( not literary ) motive , should reveal some direct original insight into the subject , instead of being conventional or derivative , and should be thoroughly carried out according to some one of the generally recognized standards of skilful technique . A simple and gen eral distinction between the leaders of the older group and those of the newer school is , that the former painted down to a fiat surface , and spread their pigments with a thinness that made it difficult to forget how purely artificial the representation was . The later leaders have elaborated the texture . They have explored the mysteries of the most varied brush-work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops short of mere imitation . They have learned the fine meaning of " values , " and recognized , as it never was truly recognized in this country before their time , the vital importance of good drawing and modelling ; not drawing that makes itself apparent as an academic exercise , but by thorough knowledge and representation of form // conveys a sense of solid life or vital motion , and can also bring to the eye poetic interpretations of nature , of the human figure , or of imaginative moods and ideas . If this explanation seems vague , circumspice , and you will see the distinction in their work , and the difference between it and that which preceded theirs . Finally , the exponents of the modern tendency , instead of moulding all their observations of real things to some preconceived model of what a picture or a sculpture should be , hold themselves more in readiness to respond sensitively to any phase of nature , animate or inanimate , which may appeal to them as curious , beautiful , interesting or inspiring , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life and truth vividly , dexterously , and harmoniously . If ever we are to build up a great national art , in the sense that France possesses one , it must be on this broad plane which reconciles all clashing of individual manner and style , all diversities of schools and groups , in a common desire to reach the highest goal according to the highest principles and laws of art , with a**od deal of liberty for all in seeking those principles . It is interesting to note that while one organization of artists develops out of another , or possibly replaces it in some respects , no single body gains absolute control . The drift of things seems to be rather to bring them all into a sort of amicable diversity if not into federation . Their common aim becomes continually clearer , and is more intelligently followed , by comparison or co-operation among the different fraternities . The Academy , though apt to lag , slowly improves , gradually bringing the younger men into its membership , and the Water-color Society , now in its twenty-sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in range , rich in interest . When it was founded , water-color painting was hardly known in New York , and had no hold upon the public . Yet so rapid was the development of this taste , and of the capacity among artists to meet it , that in fifteen years not only was a home market established , but it also became possible to send to London a large collection of American watercolors , which was received with most cordial praise in that centre of the art . Hundreds of clever painters , men and women , now contribute in this field , where formerly there were but a few dozen . Of these , without attempting to make a complete list even of the chief , one may instance E. A. Abbey , F. Hopkinson Smith , William A. Coffin , A. T. Bricher , Carroll Beckwith , Fidelia Bridges , Charles Parsons , Henry Farrer , Harry Fenn , George Wharton Edwards , Walter Palmer , W. Hamilton Gibson , Frederic Dielman , Childe Hassam , Bolton Jones , Alfred Kappes , William H. Lippincott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Platt , William T. Smedley , Albert E. Sterner , Samuel Colman , Louis C. Tiffany , T. W. Wood , A. H. Wyant , and R. Swain Gifford . The New York Etching Club , also , is making strides with the needle by the co-operation of such excellent craftsmen as J. Alden Weir , Alexander Schilling , Charles A. Vanderhoof , J. M. Falconer , C. A. Platt , Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moran , Carlton T. Chapman , Swain Gifford , Charles E.Whittemore , and others . Reginald Coxe also has made many important etchings . The Salmagundi Club , which began its career informally in 1871 , gradually rose to eminence by its large and brilliant displays of charcoal , sepia , and other drawings and pictures not dependent upon colors . It outlived the London Black-and-White Club , and once reached the " paying point , " after several exhibitions which were financially disastrous , though meritorious . But it yielded finally to the inevitable lack of public appreciation for artistic production that relies upon light and shade only ; and it has resolved itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on view once a year , in their own gallery , some of their color - work . The Painters in Pastel-a smaller group , formed some eight years ago by Blashfield , Chase , Robert Blum , Ulrich and Francis Jones-have justified their choice by using pastel in its most enlightened application as a medium for broad and luminous effect full of a tropically floral bloom , as radiant as watercolor , and still more ethereal . Further , we have the Architectural League , which has given five or six exhibitions that exemplify the extraordinary advance of our architects in skill , taste , and learning within a brief period ; and to these shows have been added examples of stained glass , decorative designs , embroidered hangings , American ceramics , and designs for book-covers . Each new society discovers and fulfils // a function of its own . The same is true of organizations among students . By far the most important of these is the Art Students ' League , * founded in 1875 , with a membership of only twenty - five or thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand students men and women . The institution is of the simplest yet most efficient and practical sort  --  a school governing itself democratically , and meeting until last autumn in hired lofts or roughly fitted rooms . The fees are moderate ; and those who have once attended the classes may , by paying a small sum annually , share in the government , thus aiding further in the self-support of a great organization which has grown into power without gifts of money or any extraneous help . The teachers have always been artists of unquestioned eminence and ability ; for example , Shirlaw , Chase , Freer , Brush , Weir , Kenyon Cox , Carroll Beckwith , Siddons Mowbray , Dielman , Willard Metcalf , J. H. Twachtman , and the sculptors Augustus St. Gaudens , Daniel C. French , and J. S. Hartley . Instruction is given in drawing and painting from the antique , the head , the nude figure , from the model in costume ; in sketching ; and in modelling in clay from both cast and life . Classes assemble in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is made available for study being extraordinary . To instance the life classes alone , there are five daily , occupying nineteen hours , which is more than any other school in the world provides . It will be clear to every one that , with these conditions , the League has done incalculable good ; and , in fact , it is altogether the most powerful and active academic art school in America , as also the school of highest standard . Perhaps aroused somewhat by this example , the teaching department of the Academy of Design has been raised latterly to a pitch of merit that it had not attained seventeen years ago , when , indeed , the hopes which rested chiefly upon it were far from thriving . Charges at the Academy are nominal . Yet , though the instructors also are of the best-Will H. Low , Edgar M. Ward , Dielman , and Thos . Eakins  --  the school there suffers under a great disadvantage of imperfectly lighted basement rooms , not well suited for * Fully described by Dr. John C. Van Dyke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The teaching at the Metropolitan Museum was formerly directed towards the industrial side , including carving and carriage drafting and construction , but it has now assumed a purely artistic character . Sculpture is one of the branches here , as at the League , and a thorough course in architecture is added . So , too , besides antique and life classes , there are others for illustration and etching and for ornamental design . Lectures are given on anatomy , design , the history of art , among the instructors being J. Q. A.Ward , H. Siddons Mowbray , J. Carroll Beckwith , Charles A. Vanderhoof , Harper Pennington , and Arthur L. Tuckerman . The lectures are free , and the class prices for a school year are only from $15 to $25 . This school numbers about 200 pupils , and the Academy of Design about the same , while the Free Art School for Women in the Cooper Institute receives nearly 270 . The Free Night School of Art in that institute records an attendance of about 570 persons , with 830 more debarred by want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must always be given largely to commercial and industrial uses of art , so far as free pupils are concerned , such as designing , illustrating , retouching of negatives and positives , coloring photographs , etc . But special " pay classes ' * have been formed , in which an artistic training of wider scope may be had , under such excellent guides as Swain Gifford , J. Alden Weir , George De Forest Brush , and several others , men and women , all thoroughly accomplished . Architecture and modelling , however , are not embraced in this course . Mrs. Carter , principal of the Woman 's School , reports valuable and inspiring results of the school 's relations with industrial art and influence upon it . Many of the pupils are actively engaged in practical illustration , or teach elementary art in other schools and classes , while carrying on their own studies at the Cooper . Others sell their designs to manufacturers in considerable quantity ; and an association of recent graduates has in a single year built up an important business in buying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aesthetic quality of domestic industrial work . A number of students in the painting class , also , are exhibiting in various galleries , and selling their canvases // 744 with no little success . Another importaut addition to our resources for higher art education is the School of Architecture in Columbia College , conducted by Professor *AT R. Ware . A private institute also has been formed independently by one artist , with the express purpose of educating taste among manufacturers of decorative fabrics-carpets , wall-papers , silks , stuffs , and so on - by training designers and creating a direct traffic between the school and the mart . Through all these enterprises a web is weaving that brings together more and more the artist , the artisan , and the business man who has use for art . Mr. Chase 's summer school of out-door painting , on the Shinnecock Hills , Long Island ( already including a hundred pupils ) , is an outgrowth of New York a ; nd of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences . Taking the chief art schools of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall find that there are in New York at present hardly less than 2500 professional students of art , and perhaps even more than that number . Out of such an aggregate of earnest endeavor must come a great deal of meritorious performance . As to demarcations between groups of artists , it is not always possible to draw fixed lines . There have been other painters besides Inness who have failed to grow old , and have unfailingly kept themselves open to new light , new ways of looking at things . Such a one is Winslow Homer , in some sense the most racy , most American , of our painters . One marvels at the self-reliance with which he long ago set out to jot down unreservedly , with cheerful disregard of tradition , exactly what he perceived in American scenes or persons , on the farm , the lake , the river , along the sea-shore . Half a generation before the watchword of " impressionism " was uttered , he had struck its note over and over again , - crudely , perhaps , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a singular fascination . John La Farge , quite dissimilar in quality , has always moved with the vanguard , and has steadily upheld the standard of poetic figure composition and rich coloring of the inborn sensitive kind . Examples of his religious mural paintings may be seen in St. Thomas 's and the Ascension ( Episcopal ) churches , on Fifth Avenue . His " Ascension , " in particular , would have gained for any foreign painter a reputation little less than world-wide ; but when an American does this sort of thing it is passed over in comparative silence , as though his nationality were in itself enough to relegate him to a lower plane , no matter how fine his work . George De Forest Brush , first equipped by G*r6me , has not grown into any new style , but , on the other hand , has carefully studied North American Indians , and found in them the themes for some remarkable works , such as his " Mourning a Brave "  --  a squaw wailing over a red chief 's body on a snow-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors and a Munich manner , has not changed perceptibly , and has gone on doing excellent things , including imaginative etchings and some elab* orately good illustrations to Goldsmith 's " Hermit . " William M. Chase , on the other hand , who began in the manner of Munich , emerged from it before long , and has developed on several sides in almost equal degrees . He is one of the most versatile and prolific painters of the day . Always masterly , he has , we may say , unfolded with his later growth a more brilliant coloring . He shines as an original and decorative portraitist , a clever manipulator of still life , and in landscape has given us many canvases which convey local New York scenes and color with fine precision . F. D. Millet , a medalist of Antwerp , widely known as a war correspondent and story-writer , and in his earlier pictures a strong realist , has refined his style to a polished representation of Greek figures , of English landscape or interior , and of Knickerbocker life . George W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished himself by honest and graceful quality in decoration . Blashfield , for the most part , remains romantic and ideal , with a fondness for the classic and the mediæval ; and Wyatt Eaton , with a poetic genius that seems but half acclimated here , produces interesting compositions , and portraits of a semi-mystical quality . Will H. Low , despite his French training , has shown a vivid realization of New England subjects , as in his " Skipper Ireson 's Ride , " yet leans rather to the poetic and the decorative , as in his illustrations for Keats 's " Lamia , " and in his many charming // and effective wall-paintings of figure subjects . Kenyon Cox , beginning with landscape , original and fresh in treatment , tends more and more to study of the figure and to imaginative composition . The firm grasp and substantial texture of Inness accompany that heritage of talent which George Inness , Jun. , discloses , in serious work that deals with the human form as well as with landscape and the horse . Sincere , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subtle yet broadly handled " The Rain , " which lately won the $2000 Prize Fund award . In the direction of what might be called historic genre relating to Puritan New England , Douglas Volk some time since distinguished himself by episodes interestingly conceived . T. W. Dewing gives us a quite different outlook upon another region , where modern landscape appears , but is misted over with a pleasant dimness that transfers it to legendary distance . Against this the forms of tall young women in flowing draperies stand out , vital yet dreamlike . His large easel pictures , and so too his decoration , of which he has put forth some fine examples , are , if one be permitted the phrase , rhythmic or musical in color and design . Contrasted in one respect with the men who have derived and adapted their art from abroad is Alfred Kappes . He acquired his cornpetence of power entirely at hQme ; but his studies in humble negro life and New York beggardom , characteristic and original , hold their own in most comparisons for truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who for a while seemed to be rather homogeneous , C. F. Ulrich , Louis Moeller , and Henry Alexander . Ulrich 's " Glass-blowers of Murano " ( American Art Association prize of 1886 ) is a fixity in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and very creditably denotes his style . These men , besides cultivating a very minute finish , evinced a desire to use local American themes ; but Mr. Ulrich , at least , has left us and made his home in Germany . Then we have William Gedney Bunce , mirroring Venice in scores of opulent color arrangements ; Rosina Emmet Sherwood and Dora Wheeler Keith , whose striking portraits and decorative work have vindicated the ability of women for some of the most difficult achievements . J. H. Twachtman , who conjures up pel lucid visions of twilight landscape , or irradiates his canvas with impressionist glimpses , has lately given much time to pastel-work of an exquisite quality , and his productions are especially prized by his confrires . The vein of Robert Blum , again , is different ; but his delicatesketchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop upon the picture surface as lightly as flower petals . W. L. Picknell , for his part , seems inclined to deal with nature as forcibly as it does with us . His landscapes abound in firm reality , tempered yet heightened by the skill with which they give dignity to the most prosaic bit of earth . Another robust painter is Edgar M. Ward . J. Francis Murphy and his wife contemplate out-door scenes with a gentler eye , and dream visibly of spring or autumn vistas , rainy eves , or smouldering sunsets . With differences of touch and tone , Bolton Jones , Bruce Crane , and Francis Jones place before us open sketches of wooded meadow and brook-side . Much the same order of effect engages Appleton Brown , who is fond of lucid skies flecked with white , wind-blown clouds . Both Robert C. Minor and A. H. Wyant have brought to us many sterling reproductions from the forests and upland of the Adirondacks . D. W. Tryon , also , with great dexterity and sympathy , develops the picturesque worth of simple home landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho rarely fails to please the eye with his unaffected presentation of glowing sunset or land-andwater outlooks . Among marinists , while it is impracticable to make a full list here , it seems proper to speak of Reginald Coxe , a painter of much originality , and of M. J. Burns , whose transcripts , full of verve and alert observation , are known not only in the galleries , but through magazines and books as well . To this brief summary many other names might be attached , a few among them being Edward Gay ( another prizeman ) , Harper Pennington , W. Van Boskerek , and Francis Day . In the Moran family we have five representatives of talent : Thomas Moran , with his Turneresque color compositions from Mexico and the Yellowstone ; his wife , a successful etcher ; Edward Moran , painter of marine ; and Edward 's two sons , Percy and L6on , who have caught the fancy for dainty eighteen th-century costume-figure subjects . In figure and genre of another sort , T. // W. Wood 's homely New England interiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has won popular regard with his studies of street boys ; J. W. Champney pleasantly interprets gentle sentiment and out-door picturesqueness , and W. T. Smedley is successful in representations of quaint character and cleverly conceived domestic episodes . This distinction is shared by Gilbert Gaul , who has at times specialized his work , in addition , by painting war subjects . Irving R.Wiles and Willard L. Metcalf not only delineate the figure with a controlling knowledge , but also display subtlety in the expression of character . Imperfect though the present enumeration must be , Dielman should be included in it . His pictures are always attractive features of the exhibitions , and he has done much illustrative work of a high character . H. Siddons Mowbray , with his delicate , sometimes half - allegorical figure compositions , admirable in color and drawing , stands among the very first . In portraiture , which often gives scope to the greatest powers of an artist , we have John S. Sargent , who , when he consents to revisit this country from Paris , finds more than enough commissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily at the head of American portrait-painters , and it would be superfluous to particularize here the magnificent qualities of his work . They have been widely noted and commended both at home and abroad , where his fame is perhaps even greater than in this country . He can hardly be said to belong to New York , yet he figures prominently in our artistic growth , for much of his work has been done here ; he is a member of the Society of American Artists , and a frequent contributor to its exhibitions . William Dannat is another of our vigorous portraitists resident abroad , and is the potent master of a dramatic modern style . Eastman Johnson has already been mentioned . Abbott Thayer 's portraits , in a somewhat low key of color , long since made their distinctive mark , by a certain mingled sensitiveness and firmness , a quick seizure of salient features , and delicate sympathy in reproducing face , form , and , if one may say so , the spirit or temperament of the human being . The work of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this field , also , Wei r and Chase have done a great deal , with marked success ; Beckwith 's portraits have great charm , variety , and skill ; and all three of these men have often shown specimens of their portraiture at the Paris Salon with flattering results . Of J. W. Alexander 's productions in this kind , many have been highly effective ; and Benjamin F. Porter succeeds in pleasing the popular eye with a picturesque disposition of his subjects . The several artists here named differ in style to an extraordinary degree , and exemplify the breadth of range to which portraitpainting has attained . After upholding for a number of years the tradition of sober color and the gospel of gray in portraits , ideal figures , or other subjects , J. Alden Weir-together with J. H. Twachtman-has latterly taken the lead in that American impressionist movement which represents the acme of innovation , the highest tide of high light and brilliant tint , the aggressive purpose to bring painting face to face with nature uncompromisingly . His transcriptions of landscape under this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of harmonizing according to an artificial theory , the impressionist tries to give an accurate rendering of objects on the basis of " color values " only ,  --  the harmony of contrast or agreement which he thinks must become apparent if he sets everything down with relentless precision . Black is exiled , brown put under restrictions . Violet , blue , gray , or encrimsoned shadows are boldly reproduced ; yellow sunlight is no longer an object of fear ; moonlight effects are placed in evidence with all the surprising force of sundry hues that the actuality contains . The same principle applies to portraits and to landscape . It is possible to carry the enthusiasm of a new artistic cult too far ; and sometimes , one must admit , the impressionists overshoot the mark with their violent spottiness . But Mr. Weir frequently induces conviction by the frankness , joined to adroit skill , with which he arrays his color values , and in his " Open Book "  --  a poetic female figure exquisitely posed on a hill-side that leans up to an opalescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something which not only accords with the , highest key of coloring in nature , but is also captivatingly ideal . Leonard Ochtman may also claim insight into those phases of landscape // which are so refreshing when painted without shrinking from the infinite complications and beauties of light and color . Of this group , also , Childe Hassam is a sturdy member , who has evoked startling and often lovely visions from the streets and parks of New York , or from sea and sky . Theodore Robinson and William S. Allen take part strongly in the same movement . It is not a strictly original movement , for it follows that of Monet and other French impressionists . Yet one can not but remark its vast superiority to the pre-Raphaelite agitation of 1865 . Frederic Remington does not belong to the same category , but may aptly be named here for the reason that he too applies himself to matters close at hand , studying and rendering nature with uncompromising realism . He has made himself universally known as a sort of pictorial field-marshal of the army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southwest , or in training-camps and post forts . Remington , furthermore , covers a broad range of territory and of interest in his reproductions of Mexican subjects , and of Indians , trappers , and voyageurs in the Northwest and Canada . On this line of observation Mr. R. F. Zogbaum needs no heralding . He stands at the front with an equipment of knowledge concerning both army and navy , of the past as well as the present , which is unrivalled . Th. de Thulstrup , also , has gained a distinct place as a depictor of military types , and of themes relating to navy life or yachting . Like Remington and Zogbaum , he gives much , or most , of his energies to illustration , chiefly in black and white . Illustration , in fact , is one of the most pronounced developments of art in New York , and we may say that the opportunities opened to it have supplied one motive force-a stimulus of no small value . Mr. E. A. Abbey , whose work has been so often analyzed and lauded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place for inventiveness , a modern - mediæval sense of poetry and humor , and quaintly delicious qualities of line as well as of light and shadow . In sharp contrast to the gossamer fineness or the reliance upon decisive lines of Abbey 's drawing are the solidly wrought representations of colonial or early colonial themes with which Howard Pyle alternates his other decorative voL . LXXXVI. - NO. 515. - ti designs in outline , and his dramatic scenes of earlier English and American life . C. S. Reinhart 's graphic notes of current life in various lands we are all familiar with as a sort of illuminated picture-prose , that sheds new light on common scenes by its quick accentuation of character , and its mingling of dash with precision . The tendency of C. D. Gibson seems to be somewhat in the same direction ; while W. Hamilton Gibson excels in delicate renderings of flowers , landscape , and insect life . In addition , we have Harry Fenn , fertile and pleasing in handling the picturesque , with Frederic B. Schell , J. 0 . Davidson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . Among illustrators who have made their mark decidedly in character study and humorous conceits are A. B. Frost , E. W. Kemble , H. W. McVickar , W. A. Rogers , and Oliver Herford . The comic weekly Life gave occasion to some of these , and to Albert E. Sterner and Van Schaick . Joseph S. Pennell has won a wide appreciation by his light , graceful , very discerning sketches of European architecture , rural scenery , and garden places . On the other hand , a remarkable example of native growth is that of Mary Hallock Foote , whose talent has found play in treating landscape and figure subjects purely American . Alice Barber Stephens should be noted as an American woman who has distinguished herself in illustration . There is no room to do more than add here the names of Alfred Brennan , Harper Pennington , W. Taber , H. D. Nichols , Otto H. Bacher , Chester Loomis , and Francis Jones . Not only these , but many also among the painters of whom we have spoken supply illustrations constantly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three other serial publications have been powerful incentives to this kind of work , which could not have come into existence without such agency . And these periodicals , besides , have brought the art and practice of engraving in New York to a point of excellence which is admittedly unsurpassed in Europe . Periodical publications devoted exclusively to art on the highest plane have uniformly failed in the United States . But the Art Amateur and the Art Interchange have succeeded in obtaining solid support ; and both of them perform a good mission in spreading artistic taste , // and in reproducing ornamental or decorative designs made by professionals and students . Illustration , however , is apt to be regarded as a secondary thing by some artists , who even contend that it is , in any form , wholly apart from painting proper . Without going into this dispute , we may turn for a moment to the special province of two artists who , while frequently occupied with black and white , have demonstrated ( like Mr. Cox and Mr. Low ) that illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting . These are Mr. F. S. Church and Mr. Elihu Vedder . Mr. Church has struck upon a trail of fancies conceived in a happy freak of unsophisticated myth and veritable spritedom . But when we touch that orbit of ideas lying outside the present actual , it is Mr. Vedder who towers highest . Many years have gone by since he first stirred up public attention with the sinuous tail of his exceedingly ingenious and original sea-serpent ; and he has risen from that to many weird conceptions of a mystic sort , as in his famous designs for Omar Khayy*m 's " Rub*iy*t . " His abode , though , is Rome , and he can be claimed for New York only by former residence and practice of his art here and occasional visits . None the less he exemplifies a scope of painting imagination which American artists rarely attempt . Albert P. Ryder , however , comes into relationship with this order of thought or fancy in some of his pictures . Colorists are born , not made , and Mr. Ryder is one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to him is made the medium of poetic imaginings , or of a fascinating treatment of the actual which throws over it a singular glamour , and has won much favor . Enough has now been said to indicate the breadth and variety of current American pictorial art in New York . Assuredly it can no longer be said that " our painters have no individual , unmistakable manner . ' * Our artists do clearly manifest their separate trends of temperament , thought , and taste , and the plane of knowledge and technical competence which they occupy now is a much loftier and solider one than formerly . Here , then , we have the vital elements of a true American school . To make a national school it is not necessary to be contracted or purely local . Enriching our artistic soil by every means ob tamable , we should leave the flower of originality to spring up as it will and take its own form . Meanwhile it is of good augury that in the few collections which have been made of American paintings , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get an impartial effect from it , the strength , freshness , and independence displayed are very remarkable . But it must be admitted that they still fall short as to large imaginative quality , and seldom embody great or serious ideas with grandeur of design or in broadly dramatic compositions . This is probably less their fault than that of the conditions and the lack of a sufficient demand . Perhaps the most remarkable exception in the high field of religious creation or interpretation is that of Frank Vincent Du Mond , a young man who , after training in the Art Students ' League and in the Julian acad*mie at Paris , has only within three years distinguished himself both at the Salon and in New York by paintings and drawings of an exquisite spirituality and purified realisni , representing the true Christian simplicity and insight . Our decorative artists and those painters who have occasiona*1ly turned to decoration in a high sense , have acquitted themselves with credit to their own skill , and to the wisdom of those who have chosen to encourage native art in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly to the adornment of house interiors were John La Farge , Francis Lathrop , and Louis C. Tiffany , who have also developed the making of stained-glass windows to a degree of excellence not equalled at this day in Europe . Frederic Crowninshield and others followed similar paths ; and among those painters of what are commonly called easel pictures , who have taken a considerable share in decorative work , are Dewing , Low , Millet , Maynard , Frank Fowler , Robert Blum , and Blaslifield . Charles Volkmar , turning from pictorial work , devotes himself to designing and manufacturing artistic pottery and tiles . So strong , indeed , is the tide of decorative art that J. W. Alexander , distinguished as a specialist in portraiture , has now given up that branch for a time , and joined the cohort of decorative designers and painters who beautify walls and ceilings . Many other ar // tists constantly show their preference for producing something adapted to these same purposes . At their hands American decoration has already come to represent a high order of work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas let into panelled spaces ) . This tendency is a most promising one . All painting on a large scale , whether of the so - called " historical " kind or dealing with religious themes-by the very necessity of the case and the requirements of effect in the places which it is meant to fill-verges upon the decorative , or becomes entirely decorative , so far as the art of it is concerned . Hence decoration is a factor which must play a very important part in the further and larger development of American painting and sculpture . Its influence is of the best , also , because it carries fine art into the resorts of every day , whether in drawingroom or dining-room at home , in business buildings , legislative halls , hotels , and halls for public assembly . The increasing appreciation for artistic decoration as an element of one 's familiar surroundings is curiously manifest in the rage which has grown for beautifying hotel interiors according to approved principles , and even for collecting pictures , often of rare merit , by native and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful vestibules where " front " and the room-clerk reign supreme . All this may indicate only a superficial mood  --  a sense merely of the advertising value of art in the house  --  and the attempts at decoration in these places are sometimes no more than gaudy travesties of the ideal . Still , the things done are frequently excellent , and the general result is not a lowering of art , but a gradual lifting up of the popular taste . Sculpture , too , in addition to its function of producing portrait busts , public statues , monuments , " ideal " figures , medallions , " allegorical " groups , and so on , has a direct bearing on both exterior and interior decoration , which thus far is recognized by patrons only to a small extent . Much might be said of the sculptors whose accomplishment and fame have dignified as well as brightened the record of their art in New York ; but I am limited to mere mention here of J. Q. A. Ward , Augustus St. Gaudens , Olin L. Warner , Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macmonnies , E. J. Kelly , F. Edwin Elwell , and O'Donovan . Some of these have worked hand in hand with architects ; and the transformation that architects of the illumined kind , building for great artistic as well as commercial aims , have effected in the last eight or ten years is enormous and all but magical . We have a few fine churches , many strongly designed , thoroughly constructed , and impressive business edifices , insurance and press buildings , club-houses , public halls , hotels , and towering " apartment** piles , some of which are magnificent . A vast amount remains to be done , however . The principle of - designing groups of adjacent buildings with a view to harmonious and pleasing total effect has now been carried out in a few instances , and approximated in several . But not until such ideas are acted upon more fully ( without , of course , reducing them to dulness of stereotype ) , nor until architects are sustained by far-sighted property-owners , who in putting up splendid buildings are willing to co-operate among themselves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , can New York hope to become an outwardly beautiful artistic city . As an educator and stimulator , the Metropolitan Museum has rendered immense service . It began in the Union League Club , in 1869 , with a small association of public-spirited , enlightened citizens , among whom were John Taylor Johnston , H. G. Marquand , R. M. Hunt , George William Curtis , Robert Hoe , Jun. , William Cullen Bryant , J. Q. A. Ward , and others , representing in the best sense commerce , law , literature , painting , sculpture . Chartered in 1870 , it has grown into a great public institution of incalculable benefit . A good many of us humbler art-lovers remember how it was domiciled in 1873 in the stately old brownstone Douglas mansion on Fourteeth Street west of Sixth Avenue , with a few meagre collections . But it went bravely on , regardless of lukewarm praise , of doubts , indifference , or sneers . To-day it owns millions of dollars ' worth of most valuable art collections , and occupies its own capacious building in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first year of its existence the number of visitors was 5500 . In 1891 this had risen to 901,203-not so very far short of a million . Its growth is due in large // measure to the untiring munificence of private individuals-bankers , merchants , railroad millionaires-without whose gifts in kind and large donations of money it could not have prospered . But the people also , through the Legislature , have given liberally to its support . The Loan Exhibitions which it has assembled constantly have done a great work in cultivating public taste ; its permanent contents ( though needing to be still increased ) supply a vast amount of teaching as well as pleasure ; and its plaster-cast collection , by virtue of a sumptuous endowment , will soon be the largest in the world . As the Museum is the great storehouse and record-room of art , ancient , media*-val , or modern , so the new Fine Arts Society will be a central fountain , one may say , in the field of actual production . The formation of this body is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , at least so far as co-operation goes , and a closer union fostered by a common abode and aims in common . The constituent forces are the Society of American Artists , the Architectural League , the Art Students ' League , and the Society of Painters in Pastel . Each of these will keep its own integrity and have separate quarters under the one roof of the Fine Arts Building , an arrangement which , with the galleries that they share together , will naturally quicken sympathy among them and lead to federated action . There are gathered in this union three hundred artists and architects of established ability and distinction , with perhaps four hundred students who are leading their classes and give promise of fruitful careers . The prophecy of the organizing committee , therefore , is hardly too sanguine , that it " is destined to become the art power of the country " ; more especially since painters , sculptors , and architects have themselves invested in the enterprise a capital of $50,000 , while other gentlemen have contributed some $150,000 more as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cornelius and George Vanderbilt , Andrew Carnegie , Henry G. Marquand , D. 0 . Mills , C. P. Huntington , John D. Rockefeller , Robert Goelet , C. T. Barney , John D. Archbold . And not the least merit of the plan is that , when gentlemen of this kind enter substantially into an artistic union , the practical stimulation of American art in the future is assured . For some time past various prizes and endowments have been offered from one source or another for the encouragement and development of American art in New York , such as the Haligarten and Clark prizes , and the Harper Fund for lectures at the Academy ; also the Elliott and the Suydam medals to pupils there . The most deserving student in the Academy school receives a special prize of $750 . In the Society of American Artists exhibitions we have the annual Webb and Shaw prizes . Then again for two or three years a group of patrons awarded a purchase prize in exhibitions held under the auspices of a firm of dealers , and the winning pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different cities . This principle of purchase is a wholesome one ; and no doubt a portion of Mr. Carnegie 's princely endowment of $50,000 a year to the Pittsburg Library for buying American paintings will be expended in New York . Another great step has been taken by the establishment , through the initiative of Mr. J. A. Chanler , of a scholarship amounting to $900 a year , bestowed annually upon some young American artist to enable him to study for several years in Paris . These beneficent aids are deserving of all praise . Yet there are two cardinal points which we ought sharply to impress upon ourselves in summing up the situation . One is , that patrons and collectors should apply themselves earnestly to the pleasant and creditable duty of buying and ordering American works on their merits , in preference to foreign works . A single anecdote will exemplify fairly the state of artificial selection now too prevalent . An American purchaser asked the advice of a distinguished French painter who was visiting New York as to what picture he should buy in a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an American artist , the price of which was *300 . But the name of the American artist was ( we will say ) Toodles . " Oh , " said the patron of art , " I do n't want to hang in my house a picture by a man named Toodles . Why not get that Lerolle over there ? It 's about the same size . " " But , " said the French artist , " it is not so good as Toodles 's , and the price is $1500 . " " Never mind , " replied the American magnate . " When I show the picture to // my friends , I want to be able to say it 's a Lerolle-not a Toodles . " And forthwith he bought the Lerolle , at $1500 , against his foreign adviser 's advice . A curious commentary on this typical incident is the fact that , quite lately , an agent has been in this country trying to gather a large collection of American pictures for exhibition at Munich next year , and a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their capital a number of representative modern American paintings . These agents from abroad do not care whether the artist 's name is Toodles or Yuba Bill . Europeans already appreciate American works of art better than our own people do . The second point is , that we should no longer regard art education in New York as merely elementary . We have to-day every facility for instructing and moulding the young artist , and not only completely grounding him in all the elements of his art , but also carrying him far along the road toward the highest accomplishment . Our painter instructors are men thoroughly trained and equipped , who , besides their knowledge of foreign tradition and practice , have strong individuality , and their work shows great original merit . All that they have acquired they are willing and able to impart to others . They are , moreover , imbued with distinctly American temperament and ideas ; and the competent pupil who goes - forth from their hands is already an artist , who needs only time , experience , and perhaps travel to shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York are fed from other art and museum schools throughout the United States , and ultimately get the pick of nearly all the best young men and women . The Empire City is already an art centre , very much alive , and will continue to grow greater and more active . What is most needed now is a recognition of this fact , and a vivid sense on the part of business men and connoisseurs that the best and most far-sighted thing they can do , for themselves as well as for art , is to patronize American artists lavishly and sincerely , patriotically , yet with discrimination , and with an independent taste for what is good and genuine that should not lean upon foreign fashion . Instead of sending young artists abroad to receive their education , we ought to see that it is now quite possible to nearly complete their education here . Then we should assist a few of the selected to go to Europe on " travelling scholarships , " simply to mature , to broaden their views , to stimulate the creative faculty by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different countries for a while ; very much as young French painters and sculptors are sent by government to Rome , and young musicians to both Rome and Germany . Government , in the United States , can not as yet be counted upon to do itself the honor of encouraging art in such wise . But the Fine Arts Society and the subscribers to the Chanler Scholarship will doubtless rise to the occasion . Fine art must be treated finely in every way , if we would have it flourish at its best . Commercial necessity , of course , can not be ignored in its affairs ; but where business comes into contact with it the ordinary business standard should give way to a higher principle of cordial generosity , which is as essential to the well-being of national art as dew is to the flower . It is to be hoped , and reasonably to be expected , that when the new Fine Arts Society gets fully under way it will bring about a more direct , appreciative relation on the part of the stimulators , or buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the community . Then perhaps we shall be saved from any further humiliation of seeing American painters forced , as even the best frequently are , into auction salesa ruinous expedient , to which European professionals of similar standing are never driven . We need very much a stronger infusion of that spirit of synipathy which goes to make what we call an " atmosphere . " Then , too , the elements of excessive haste and impatience , which disfigure our civilization , are drawbacks upon the achievement of ripe and enduring results in this domain of ideal reality . Artists in all branches are constantly " rushed " by their impetuous , restless employers or patrons , and are expected to deliver their work on the same methodical plan that a rolling-mill turns out iron or the merchant ships an invoice of cotton . We can crowd artists , no doubt , and extract from them a specified amount of labor and material in this way ; but we lose a great deal by preventing them from putting into their fabric those enriching elements of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best things can not come into existence . Even for our churches , including most Catholic temples also ( which it might be supposed would especially insist upon the highest excellence in picture , statue , relief , or in glass - work and carving ) , it seems to be considered more important to get a particular piece of artistic creation into place by a date fixed , than to secure something which will outlast all dates and days , or at least continue to be a credit and glory while it exists . I trust that before long Americans will perceive that this is a false economy of time , as the beating down of prices for the best work is also false economy of money in matters of art . Gold can buy nearly every appearance of sumptuous art , but it can not buy the perfect reality , unless it be given unstintedly , and be accompanied with a freely offered bonne main of patience , ideal interest , and entire sympathy . This may seem , to the wholly commercial mind , foolish . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has got to be acknowledged and acted upon before we can reach the true goal . The principle once accepted by a considerable number of people , we shall find that the United States can lead the world in fine art , and that New Yorkwithout injury to other cities , and with no necessity for mutual envies - may , by living up to its opportunity , become the chief capital in our republic of the beautiful .
