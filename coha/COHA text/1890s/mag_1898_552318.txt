SOME PROFESSIONAL SWIMMERS . By William Everett Cram . NOT the least interesting portion of the wild life that still holds its own on the borders of civilization is that of the birds and beasts that spend their days in or about the water . But unfortunately it is just this group of aquatic and semi-aquatic creatures that has suffered the severest persecution from man ; the birds on account of the peculiar flavors which their flesh acquires from the character of their food , and the beasts for their fur , which in order to keep out the water must possess just those qualities of closeness and glossy surface demanded by fashion . The muskrat or musquash and the black duck , however , furnish two typical representatives of the class that may still be found in considerable numbers xvher*ver the conditions are to their taste . Not that either of them has escaped its share of persecution , nor apparently because of any especial cunning or intelligence on their part . The habits of both have been so carefully noted by their pursuers that one hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they are well worth studying for all that , though to see them to advantage one must reach their haunts before sunrise . One frosty morning in April of last year I was walking along the bank of Old River , a quiet , sedgy stream , half swamp and half mill-pond , winding about and doubling back upon itself in the shadow of the evergreens , with several smaller and equally crooked swampy brooks joining it here and there , each with its own particular fog-bank at sunrise , when through an opening in the pines I caught sight of // a black duck motionless on the water , staring with outstretched neck at a large muskrat swimming past within a yard of him . The ripple caused by the muskrat surrounded the duck and spread beyond him , but the bird 's eyes were fixed on the little furry head as it glided along , and when at last the muskrat touched the bottom and waded ashore to crouch on the wet bank and nibble at something it held between its paws , the duck , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musquash and not a mink at all , evinced considerable relief and straightway fell to feeding . Presently , however , it turned about and paddled off to where a half dozen others of its kind were pattering about in the shallow water and mud beneath the opposite bank . This was on what is known as Great Swamp Run , a dozen rods from where it joins Old River . I then turned my steps towards the latter to see what might be going on in that direction , but almost immediately heard a warning note from the ducks I had just left , and looking up saw a female red-shouldered hawk sweeping along fifty feet above the water with her head turned first towards one bank and then towards the other . The ducks were silent until the hawk had passed and then quacked as if to warn any others in the vicinity . The hawk alighted for a moment on a dead tree and then , resuming her flight , disappeared in the woods . She was hardly out of sight when a pair of ducks , male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little island over which the hawk had just passed and within a few rods of the tree on which she was perched . Whether the ducks settled down into the water or concealed themselves among the bushes on the island I am unable to say , and I was a good deal disappointed at not having any of them in sight when the hawk first appeared . They seemed to forget the whole affair immediately it was over and exhibited no concern regarding the pos sible return of their enemy . Feeding and swimming together , the pair passed around the further side of the island and came into sight again at its upper end . On hearing the faint report of a gun five or six miles away , both stopped instantly with heads erect and rigid , looking for all the world like pieces of driftwood or broken alder stems . The female was the first to resume a more easy attitude and begin feeding again , her mate still looking warily in the direction from whence the sound came , till at last , assured that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress his feathers with his bill , stretching his wings and shaking his plumage into order generally . Then as if struck by the same impulse both started out into midstream , side by side , the drake slightly in advance . They took a rapid , direct course up stream , without apparent effort , leaving a silvery wake behind them that spread out and died away into ripples among the rushes they had just left . Passing my hiding place , they vanished around the point , and for a little while I neither heard nor saw anything of them . Then of a sudden there was a loud splash and alarmed quackings and the whistle of their wings growing fainter in the distance . Soon they came flying back within twenty yards of me down stream and into the woods . As it was quite impossible that I could have been the cause of their alarm , I crawled cautiously along towards the point , hoping to discover something of interest , but failed utterly ; whatever it was that had frightened them , there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild duck 's standpoint . So I retraced my steps to where I had left the other ducks and the musquash . The latter had disappeared , but the ducks were there and were fairly making the water boil with their diving , coming together from time to time as is their habit , with soft chatterings , crowding up to // each other until the whole flock had the appearance of a single object hardly larger than a bushel . But the sun had now risen above the tree tops and , shining directly in my face , made it difficult to distinguish anything beyond the flashing area of disturbed water with black objects sliding about over it . So I deliberately rose and walked down the bank , discovering myself to the entire company , which at once sprang into the air with a tremendous splashing and quacking , accompanied by two other flocks that I had failed to see until now , the whole forming a band of thirty-three or four , which kept swinging and circling about over the woods for ten minutes or more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at times high above gun-shot and again rushing along close down among the tree tops , showing silvery white or dusky according as the upper or under surface of their wings became visible . A little muskrat hardly half the size of the one I had seen , and evidently a good deal frightened by the commotion , came hurrying through the water and , although I walked directly towards him along the bank , refused to take the slightest notice of me in any way , but , swimming out into Old River , crossed to the other side and popped into a hole beneath the roots of a pine . Further down , where the stream becomes narrow and deep and the banks rise abruptly from the water without any fringe of rushes and sedge , I saw another swimming along near the opposite bank . On coming to a tussock , he clambered to the top of it and , after snuffing about for a few seconds , carefully lowered himself into the water again without a splash , to repeat the performance at the next tussock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into midstream , he commenced diving in deep water , remaining several minutes beneath the surface each time , and usually coming up about a rod from where he went down . He dived with a peculiarly easy rolling motion , and his fur , which was in splendid condition , looked dry and glossy in the sunlight whenever it was out of water for an instant . He looked at me deliberately several times , but , in spite of the fact that I was walking about openly within fifteen yards of him , showed no alarm at my presence . Whatever he was diving for , he evidently was not very successful , and leaving him still at it I strolled on between the trunks of the pines . But the muskrat 's tameness had made me careless , and I started a pair of ducks from their breakfast without having seen them on the water . The following morning the ducks behaved very differently . Perhaps they fancied that they had exposed themselves too recklessly the day before and determined to keep a stricter watch in future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first intimation I had of their presence was the noise made by one of their number springing into the air from behind a clump of trees . He made but a single circuit , and coming within thirty yards , his shot-gapp 'd wings showing clearly against the sky , steered off towards the northeast . He must have warned the others in some way , for before I came in sight of them they rose together and , instead of flying about overhead as on the previous morning , followed the first upstream . There is a bridge of rough stones across the mouth of Great Swamp Run , but the opening has become partly filled by falling stones and earth and more water flows over it than beneath it . As I was crossing I saw a musquash crouching in the grass on the shore of a little island eight or ten rods away . Presently he stretched himself and , sliding into the water , came swimming in my direction , evidently with the intention of crossing over to the further bank of Old River as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came until within ten yards , when he turned about and started off , looking // hack over his shoulder at me as he went ; but as I remained perfectly motionless he turned again and came swimming back and forth before me sometimes hardly a dozen feet away . He was without question the same little fellow I had seen on the previous morning , for he swam in the same peculiar way , with the whole line of his back and tail out of water and never a curve in his spine . His fur was in poor condition , there was a spot in the middle of his back where it was almost worn off , and here was a miniature pool of water , a tablespoonful perhaps , held in place by the longer fur and loose skin of his sides , rolling about like quicksilver with his every movement , but never spilling and always full whenever he came up from a dive . He soon began swimming in much smaller circles , as if trying to locate some particular spot , and at last stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so out into the river ; but presently he came up again on the same side as before . He did this several times , but without success , though one would hardly suppose that he would have much difficulty in finding the opening if there really was any . Before diving he always stopped short and floated for an instant , perhaps to get his lungs well filled with air , and then doubling his head beneath him went down with a plunge . After the third dive he swam almost to my feet and , after looking at me steadily for a few seconds , turned abruptly and swam back to his island , first to a muskrat house that stood there partly hidden in a clump of alders , and then back to the spot where I first saw him . Here he landed and , facing about , stood looking in my direction as if waiting for my departure ; so I took the hint and crossed over . As I did so , a single duck came flying out of the east seventy yards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sent out by the first party , for there were no feathers lacking from his wings . After two or three turns , coming lower and lower each time , he pitched and the next instant splashed into the water a few hundred yards upstream . At the next bend a innsquash was busily occupied with his breakfast . He first came ashore towing a sweet flag which he had cut off close to the root . It was very amusing to see* him eat it ; he began at the bottom , and , sitting up and gripping it firmly with his fore paws , crowded it into his mouth and swallowed it faster than would seem possible for an animal of his size . A song sparrow came hopping along the bank towards him , and I wondered if he would try to catch it , for they usually display a decided fondness for meat of any kind ; but the sparrow evidently did not regard him as a dangerous enemy , for he hopped fearlessly to within a foot of him , whereupon the musquash , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and paddled over to an old stump that stood a few yards from the bank , where he began nibbling at the willow shoot and young hardhack that grew there , but not finding it quite to his taste came back and , climbing up the steep bank to the foot of a cluster of young pines , fell to browsing on the leaves of wild rose bushes and sweet briers . He stood upon his hind feet bracing himself with his tail , and with his hand-like fore paws passed the branch rapidly before his mouth , biting off the clusters of leafy buds as they came along . The birds were now giving warning upon all sides of a hawk in sight , and a large one at that , but the muskrat , although now at a considerable distance from the water , took no notice of the general outcry , and even when a crow sailed over with high pitched , angry cawing refused to look up from his meal , until at last , having apparently satisfied himself , he climbed down to the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . Either muskrats really have no cause to fear the larger hawks , or this one was especially dull witted , for // most wild animals are quick to take advantage of the alarm notes of birds of any kind . One would suppose that the red-tailed hawk at least would sometimes pounce on them when mousing about the meadows , but in the reports of the investigations made by the Agricultural Department at Washington concerning the food of hawks and owls , I can not recall a single instance where a muskrat had been eaten . When their homes are flooded by heavy rains they may sometimes be seen abroad in great numbers , and at such times they show considerable cleverness in concealing themselves even in the most unpromising situations . One of their favorite tricks on scenting danger is to sink into the water and come up beneath a drifting mass of rubbish , sometimes the merest handful bei1 g made to serve . I am convinced that sometimes when no other concealment offers one will take a wisp of long grass in its teeth and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allow the loose ends of the grass to drag back over it for protection . They usually do this sort of thing close to the bank where the current is slowest ; on being disturbed they dive with a slight splash and re appear a few feet away in the same position , with only the slightest ripple to betray them . At other times , when the wind is blowing , you may see one floating on his stomach with his tail held stiffly in a horizontal position , perhaps an inch above the surface of the water , evidently to serve the purpose of a sail ; they manage somehow to hold themselves at right angles to the direction of the wind , and make considerable headway without any visible exertion . When the water has reached such a height that only the tops of the highest of their houses appear above the surface , they hud ( Ile together on every place of safety in such numbers that the pothunter is sometimes able to kill a half dozen or more at a single shot . I once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that wild ducks can display in the face of danger . It was on a dark , cloudy October afternoon before a storm , with the wind blowing in fitful , uncertain gusts from all points of the compass , but mainly from the northeast . I was following the course of Old River , keeping the wind at my back as much as possible , when I espied the heads of half a dozen black ducks among the reeds fifty yards ayvay . I stood perfectly still , hoping that they would come together and enable me to kill more than one of them at a shot , for I was little better than a pot-hunter myself in those days ; but they refused to move , so I fired at the nearest , expecting to get * shot at the others as they rose . foi ducks can only rise by flying against the wind which would bring them almost over my head . But in spite of the crashing report and the shot that MUSKRAT. // 330 BIJFFLE-HEADED DUCK . must have gone cutting through the reeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flurry of wind strike the water to the southward . It came brushing across the river , leaving a fan-shaped track of trembling water behind it . As it reached the ducks , they spun about like weather cocks on the water , and went up into the air and away out of danger ; but the unhappy bird I had aimed at was wing-tipped and only succeeded in rising a few feet before he splashed back helplessly into the water , whereupon he started at the top of his speed for the bank and took refuge beneath the low growing junipers that at this point cover the ground for acres . I searched for him until it grew so dark as to make it absolutely hopeless and I was obliged to give it up for the time being . The next morning there was snow on the ground , and I started out , hoping to find the wounded bird by his tracks ; but some otters that had been sliding and playing about on the bank were -* - before me , and feathers a n d a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to tell of the tragedy . It is remarkable that so large an animal as the otter should still hold its own in comparatively thickly settled districts throughout the country , and be practically unknown to any except naturalists and a few others . I have talked with old trappers who have followed the business for years and could tell correctly at a glance the age and sex of the creature that made each mink , muskrat and fox track on the snow , and how long each track had been made ; but though they knew that otters were killed in their neighborhood nearly every season , and occasionally destroyed or carried off their traps , they had but the vaguest idea of the character of the BLACK DUCK . // animal itself or its habits , nor could they describe or recognize its track in the snow , though it is quite unlike that made by any other creature in these parts and once seen and recognized can not be mistaken for anything else . Thoreau in his diary , under date of December 6 , 1856 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seen by him on the ice of Fairhaven pond and Concord river . After reading it one seems to have learned all that there is to learn concerning the winter habits of otters . In Thoreau 's day otters were evidently no more abundant or generally known than at present ; nor but were so persistently trapped and hunted that at last the race seemed on the direct road to extinction . Hunters no longer found their pursuit profitable and took it for granted that they were extinct in reality , giving them a chance to breathe in comparative safety . At the present day whenever one is killed it has usually strayed by mere chance into some mink or muskrat trap , concealed by freshet or rising tide more successfully than its owner could ever have hoped , or fallen to the lucky snapshot of a duck or fox hunter who is hardly aware of the value of his prize when he has secured it . The beaver appears to have vanished completely from this part of the country , except * , where protected in game preserves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness . In some of the western streams and in parts of Canada it is still fairly abun dant , and according to some authorities is no longer diminishing in numbers . In Europe it is still more of a rarity than in this country . A few scattered pairs only are said to linger in parts of Poland , Russia and Germany , and along the streams that flow from the Ural mountains . In one of the parks owned by the emperor of Austria , a small colony has been so carefully protected as not to have diminished materially in numbers , though like all the other European beavers of the present day they never build houses or dams after the manner of the American species , but dwell in burrows along the banks of the rivers . According to tradition , however , their habits were formerly the same . They evidently discovered that the conspicuousness of their works only too often -* iliDII " 11 * 6&lt; XVOOD DUCK . do their habits appear to have changed in any way since then . They still follow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course may lie between cultivated fields instead of tangled swamps and forests where trees that had died of sheer old age far outnumbered the living ones . In winter they still coast down hill on the snow crust by moonlight , as they did before the country was settled , but keeping a sharper lookout for steeltraps than formerly , their wariness in this direction at the present day being something wonderful , which probably accounts for the fact of their not having been entirely exterminated . A century or more ago they were very abundant in all parts of the country , ? v47* // attracted the attention of their enemies , and so adopted a humble mode of living . The mink closely resembles the otter , but is only about two feet in length . Its habits are similar , but it is much more generally known , the sale of its fur forming no inconsiderable portion of the income of many a trapper and farmer 's boy during the winter ; for unlike its larger relative it has not yet learned to avoid traps to any great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially eels , which it captures in warm springs and mudholes where they are bedded for the winter . I know of one spring under the steep river bank where the minks watch patiently until some unfortunate eel is brought into sight by the constant upward movement of the water , when it is quickly seized and dragged out upon the snow . But the struggle does not end here , for when the mink prepares to bear its victim away in triumph , the latter is apt to wind its body around that of its captor and generally succeeds in throwing him end over end more than once before being finally subdued and hauled away limp and unresisting across the snow , which when soft holds faithfully the entire history of the contest , from the first confused and hysterical flounderings at the edge of the water , to the triumphal march of the mink up the steep bank , with the eel dragging alongside . Of all our swimmers the wood duck is admitted to be the most beautiful , and it is doubtful whether its rival is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The combinations and contrast of rich metallic coloring and delicate tracery , with heavy , sharply defined dashes of intense black and white , are such that one fails to see how any change , even the slightest , could prove anything but disastrous . This splendid creature is not a rare visitor with us , but is almost the only wild duck content to remain here throughout the summer . Whenever it is sufficiently protected , it will nest in hollow trees and sail about over the surface of streams and mill ponds undisturbed by the movements of farmers and others in the vicinity . The blue-winged and green-winged teal are smaller and less gorgeously colored , but are beautiful birds for all that . They visit us in small flocks in spring and fall , and are generally so trusting and unsuspicious that they are being rapidly exterminated by the SHELDEAKE . SOME PROFESSIONAL SWIMMERS . HOODED MERGANSER. // shooters , many of whom , calling themselves sportsmen and scorning to shoot into a flock of quail or partridge on the ground , do not feel 2 LOON. themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left when motionless on the water . The sheldrakes or , more correctly , merganser are long , lean , fish-eating ducks , with narrow red bills with serrated edges . There are three species , the goosander , or buff-breasted sheldrake , the red-breasted sheldrake , and the hooded merganser . The first two are , * . fresh water birds in summer and sea birds in the winter . The other , which is much smaller , prefers the ponds and small creeks near the coast at all times when they are not frozen . All* three are hardy , warm-blooded birds , moving southward in the winter only far enough to avoid the ice , and following northward with the first signs of open water in the spring . The plumage of the males is mostly black and white , and that of the females brown . The buffle-headed duck , dipper-duck or diver is colored after the manner of the sheldrakes , and has somewhat similar habits , but is much smaller and more chunky , a little round-bodied water-fowl , that may sometimes be seen bobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in November , and like the sheldrakes forever diving and appearing again in unexpected places . The loon is seldom seen any longer in the fresh waters of southern New England , but still breeds in some of the ponds and lakes of northern New Hampshire and Maine . Toward autumn they follow the streams down to the sea , and spend the cold season on the salt waters . There are two little water birds , commonly known as water-hen and mud-hen , both fairly abundant on reedy streams and frog-ponds in the woods . The water-hen is in reality the pied-billed grebe or dabchick , and might be described as a little brown loon , swimming deep in the water and spending a large part of its time beneath the surface in pursuit of COOT . DABCHICK. // minnows and aquatic insects . The other is the American coot , a slatecolored bird that floats lightly on the water , and consequently looks much larger than it really is . In cloudy weather it may sometimes be seen moving abont over the wet mnd or slipping between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is generally nocturnal in its habits . There are a dozen or more other swimming birds that may occasionally be seen on almost any of the fresh waters of New England , but none of them are common , and unless the game laws supposed to protect them are more strictly enforced it will not be long before they cease to visit us altogether . I wish , in concl usion , to go back for a moment to the muskrat . One morning last October my drawing was early interrupted by an urgent call to the cellar , where I found my sister OTTER , keeping guard over what she per sisted in calling a " rat hole " in the bottom of a cupboard . But a rat hole five or six inches in diameter went beyond any experience of my own , and brought up visions of the gigantic sewer rats of Paris , particularly when I *was told that the rat that had the moment before entered it , dragging a large carrot after him , fitted it perfectly . We proceeded to investigate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the rat come forth , a muskrat , of course , though I failed to perceive that until after I had aimed a blow at his head , which fortunately missed him . Then round and round the cellar we went , the muskrat keeping the lead with his peculiar bobbing gallop . We tried to corner him in empty boxes and barrels , without success , until I caught up an old stone pot which he appeared to mistake for something of the nature of a burrow , for when I attempted to clap it over him he bolted into it and curled himself up at the bottom , when he was quickly made prisoner . - *1Z*N w ? C // There is a large spring in the field with a little brook leading from it to the river , and after carrying the muskrat half way down the hill we liberated him in the open field ; it seemed reasonable to suppose he would go towards the low ground and the water . But the perverse animal refused to do anything of the sort ; at first he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when finally shaken out upon the grass went charging back up the hill towards the house . It was useless to try to stop him ; he would rush fiercely at any one who tried to intercept his progress . Back to the cellar he went in spite of us ; to be finally captured in a nail keg . This time we carried him beyond the brook where it issues from the spring , and though he immediately started towards the house , the running water arrested him and plunging into it he waded along the spring and climbed down out of sight in the clear , cold water , which very sodn ceased to be clear , for he stirred up the entire bottom in his endeavor to find an exit in that direction . Failing in this he came up and , seating himself in the shallow water at the edge , began to wash and comb out his fur , which had become much ruffled and dirty in the course of his adventures . He did not appear to be alarmed at my presence , although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , however , he disappeared beneath the water and after that refused to show more than the tip of his nose and that only for a breath at very infrequent intervals . On returning to the cellar we discovered that he had carried off and eaten nearly a bushel of carrots , besides an indefinite quantity of potatoes , beets , turnips and celery . He had arranged a comfortable nest of leaves beneath the cupboard , and had apparently been dwelling there for a week at least . In the afternoon I went to the spring and found him a foot beneath the surface with his head wedged between two boards that had been driven into the mud at the bottom . Thinking that he must have become caught there and drowned I reached down and tried to dislodge him with my hand ; but when I grasped him by the tail he began to kick vigorously and , twisting himself away , attempted to hide in the mud at the bottom . So then I left him to his own devices , and the next morning found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably having made his way to the river and the colony of muskrats that dwell there .
