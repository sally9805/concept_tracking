txt C. S. Hall , President of the Farmers ' Alliance of Missouri , was asked if the Missouri Alliance would be represented at the Cincinnati Convention , and replied : " Not through any official act of mine . I have advised the order not to put themselves in an attitude that will commit them to the organization of a third political party at this time , and I hope it will not be necessary to do so at any time in the future . Sending delegates to the Cincinnati Convention would commit the Alliance to any action taken by that convention , and the controlling spirits of the convention will unquestionably be men who have for several years been laboring in third-party movements of various kinds . " " Do you look with favor upon the third-party movement within the Alliance ' ! " " I do not , for two reasons ; first , because our constitution is directly against partisan political action by the Alliance ; and seoond , because I should greatly prefer a more speedy remedy than a long and tedious one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of a third political party . Speaking for myself , I will say that I will not vote for or support any political party that will declare itself against the free coinage of silver , nor will I vote for or support any political party that will declare itself against the increase of the volume of money in the United States , nor will I support any political party that does not come out in its platform in favor of the removal of the present heavy tariff tax from the necessaries of life that the poor of our country must have . As I view it , the tariff issue is by far the most important issue before the people . "
