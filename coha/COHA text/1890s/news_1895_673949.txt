txt As a surpassingly grotesque illustration of our pension system , the ease of E. S. Smith , editor of The Williamstown Local , deserves appreciative attention . The details appear in The Oswego Palladium , though not as fully as might be desired . It seems that when Mr. Smith was two years old his father went to the war , and was shot . His widow survived him for only a short time . The sort grew up , and - until quite lately got along without any apparent difficulty by the use in divers honest ways of MS own unassisted hands and brains . Then he learned that some back pension - was due him  --  or at least might be obtained tinder the law  --  for the time that preceded his sixteenth year . Por this Mr. Smith at once applied , and he has just received the cheerful and comforting sum of *1,300 . Comment woukt be superfluous . Anniston , Ala. ; Antioch , La. , and Versailles , Icy. , are all representative Southern towns , each of which supplied highly interesting pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice , however , that only one of the three attracted attention in a cortfrnendable way . Anniston , which is a part of the New South , the South of progress , industry , and order , came to the front with an achievement to be proud of . Her iron manufacturers , competing with the rest Of ' this country and with - Europe , had secured an order from Japan for a big consignment of water pipes . There is not ? to be sure , much poetry or romance in water pipes , but they are profitable and respectable which are , qualities that attract capital and population ; much more than poetry and romance , beneelallY of the kind to which Antioch and ; Versailles seen still to cling . For those two towns are of the oldcwt of the Old South , the bad Old South of shotguns and bowie knives , of feuds and cowardly assassinations , of corn ? whisky and street brawls . The Picou brothers killed the O'Neal brothers at a church door in Louisiana , a drunken politician shot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between old and new was illustrated . It is a noteworthy difference , and a good many people , those looking for homes , and others , will make careful note of it . Some remarks that - recently appeared in this column about the many industries and trades with which the sudden and amazing popularity .. ) f the bicycle has seriously interfered have attracted the attention of a New-Yorker who has just returned from an extended tour through the West , and he writes to say that the men who have suffered most of all from the new machine were quite overlooked in the article to which reference has been made . To the list then given , he declares , there should be added that picturesque and , from the artistic point of view , admirable individual , the horse thief . According to our kindly informant , the horse thieves of Wyoming , Utah , Arizona , Montana , and , indeed , of the whole far West , have been reduced to a truly pitiable condition by the substitution of machines made in Eastern factories for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not that there are no horses left - to steal , but that the stealing of them no longer results in either excitement or profit . The once carefully guarded " bunches " of this kind of stock now wander over the ranges where end as they please , and it has come to such a pass that to purloin a door mat really takes more skill and courage than it does to rustle off a dozen well-broken cayuses . Three such animals were recently sold at Spanish Fork , Utah , for $2.15 , and while prices like that prevail nobody will take the trouble to get up lynching parties or waste cartridges in taking snap shots at men whose presence near the herds needs explaining . So the thieves , as self-respecting members of society , have been forced to look in other directions for a livelihood and that daily converse with danger and death to which they have become accustomed . This is saddening to contemplate .                    @
