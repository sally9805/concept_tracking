MARS . I. ATMOSPHERE . AMID the seemingly countless stars that on a clear night spangle the vast dome overhead , there appeared last autumn to be a new-coiner , a very large and ruddy one , that rose at sunset through the haze about the eastern horizon . That star was the planet Mars , so conspicuous when in such position as often to be taken for a portent . Large as he then looked , however , he is in truth but a secondary planet traveling round a secondary sun ; but his interest for us is out of all proportion to his actual size or his relative importance in the cosmos . For that sun is our own ; and that planet is , with the exception of the moon , our next to nearest neighbor in space , Venus alone ever approaching us closer . From him , therefore , of all the heavenly bodies , may we expect first to learn something beyond celestial mechanics , beyond even celestial chemistry ; something in answer to the mute query that man instinctively makes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in worlds other than his own . Hitherto the question has received no affirmative reply , although the trend of all latter-day investigation has been to such affirmation ; for science has been demonstrating more and more clearly the essential oneness of the universe . Matter proves to be common property . We have learnt that the very same substances with which we are familiar on this our earth , iron , magnesium , calcium , and the rest , are present in the far-off stars that strew the depths of space . Nothing new under the sun ! Indeed , there is nothing new above it but ever-varying detail . So much for matter . As for mind beyond the confines of our tiny globe , modesty , backed by a probability little short of demonstration , forbids the thought that we are the sole thinkers in this great universe . That we are the only minds in space it takes indeed a very small mind to fancy . Our relative insignificance commonly escapes us . If we reduce the universe to a scale on which we can conceive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good-sized pea , with a grain of mustard seed , the moon , circling about it at a distance of seven inches , the sun would be a globe two feet in diameter , two hundred and twenty feet away . Mars , a much smaller pea , would circle round the two-foot globe , three hundred and fifty feet from its surface ; Jupiter , an orange , at a distance of a quarter of a mile ; Saturn , a small orange , at two fifths of a mile ; and Uranus and Nep // tune , good-sized plums , three quarters of a mile and a mile and a quarter away , respectively . The nearest star would lie two hundred and thirty thousand miles off , or at about the actual distance of our own moon , and the other stars at corresponding distances beyond that ; that is , on a scale upon which the moon should be but seven inches off , the nearest star would still be as far from us as the moon is now . When we think that each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a grander scale than our own , we can not seriously take ourselves to be the only minds in the universe . But improbable as the absence of ultraterrestrial life in a general way is , up to the present time we have had no proof of its particular existence in worlds beyond our own . Whether the observations I am now to describe have revealed something on the point I shall leave the reader himself to judge , after laying the facts b*-fore him ; for it is with this in view that the present papers will deal with Mars , since any answer on this point is the most generally interesting outcome of a study of the planet . That the observations also disclose the fact that the hitherto accepted period of its rotation proves to be too small by the hundredth of a second is a matter of far greater moment , of course , but one which leaves the average man comparatively cool . That Mars , however , should be peopled by intelligent beings , although physically they be utterly unlike us , more goblins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantically , at least , to everybody . To determine whether a planet be the abode of life , two questions about it must be answered in turn : first , are its phy-. sical conditions such as to render it habitable ? and secondly , are there any signsJ of its actual habitation ? Unless we cad answer the first point satisfactorily , it were futile to seek for evidence of the second . * Both Jupiter and Saturn are ruddier than is commonly stated . In the air of Flagstaff , Arizona , the site of my observations , both of Of such planets as doubtless circle round other suns we as yet know nothing . Our search is perforce confined at present to the members of our own solar family . Now , when we scan them for answer to our first query , we find but two that promise even the possibility of an affirmative reply , Mars and Venus . All the others turn out , upon scrutiny , to lie beyond the pale , either because they are too big , or because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settles the matter . The giant Jupiter piques inquiry first by showing us great cloud-belts that recall our own equatorial and temperate cloud-zones . But further study discloses that his clouds are in kind quite unlike those of our earth . Neither the hour of his day nor the season of his year brings change in them . They slowly , very slowly , alter in appearance , indeed , but not in obedience to that central ruler that gathers and dispels our own . In short , the Jovian clouds are not sun-raised , but selfraised ones . It is heat inherent in Jupiter himself , not heat from the sun , that belts him about with his great girdles of cloud . We can even see , in all probability , his glowing inner self ; for Jupiter shows brick-red between his belts , like a molten niass . The same state of things is yet more strikingly instanced by Saturn ; for the tilt of Saturn 's pole is not very unlike that of the earth , and in consequence his equatorial regions are at times raised far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped far below it . Yet unlike the earth 's cloud-belts , his never travel northward when the sun goes north , nor followthe sun when he journeys south again . So far as the sun is concerned , the Saturnian cloud-belts are invariable . Like the Jovian , they owe their formation to the planet 's own heat . Like Jupiter , too , Saturn shows red beneath . ' From all this it is pretty plain that the giant them show conspicuously red between their belts . // planets are far from pleasurable abodes , as yet midway in evolution between actual suns and tenantable worlds ; too cooled down for the one state , and not yet cooled down enough for the other . Uranus and Neptune give evidence , also , of being in a chaotic condition , orbs informe , ingens , cui lumen ademptum , - no longer suns , but as yet quite unfit to support beings even distantly analogous to ourselves . With Mercury littleness is even more fatal to life ; for though the giant planets may perhaps , at some future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently never was , nor ever can be , peopled by beings in the least resembling us . Incapacity to quarter folk is included in the more general incapacity to hold an atmosphere ; for absence of atmosphere precludes the possibility of life as we know it . That a planet may be too small to have an atmospheric envelope we shall see more definitely later . That life , however , of a type of which we have no conception may not exist in all these orbs we must be wary of stating , for nothing is more dangerous than a general denial , except a particular statement . We are limited , therefore , in our present inquiry , to Venus and Mars . But Venus , contrary to her name , proves provokingly modest , the most modest of all the company of heaven , keeping herself so constantly veiled in cloud that we seldom , if ever , are permitted a peep at her actual surface . In consequence , beyond the fact that she has an atmosphere of considerable though not excessive density , we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , no such false modesty balks us at the outset . The planet named after the old God of War - satirically , it would seem , since he turns out to present characteristics quite the reverse of warlike - lets himself be seen as well as thirty-five millions of miles of separation will allow . Now , to all forms of life of which we have any conception , two things in na ture are vital , air and water . A planet must possess these two things to be able to support any life at all upon its surface . Some articles that we might deem essential to well-being fall cosmically under the head of luxuries ; but air and water are necessities of existence . There is no creature which is not in some measure dependent upon both of them . How then is Mars off for air ? Fortunately for an answer to this question , air is as vital to change in the inorganic processes of nature as it is to those other changes which we call peculiarly* life . Atmosphere is essential not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 ' of any change whatever upon that planet 's surface . Without it , not only development , but decay would come to a standstill , when once all that was friable had crumbled to pieces under , the alternate roasting and refrigerating to which the planet 's surface would be exposed as it revolved upon its axis toward and away from the sun , Thsintegration once effected , the planet would roll , a mummy world , through space . Since atmosphere , therefore , is a sine qua non to any change upon a planet2s surface , reversely , any ) change upon a planet 's surface is proof positive of the presence of an atmosphere , however incapable of detection such atmosphere be by . direct means . Now changes take place upon the surface of Mars , changes vast enough to be visible from the earth . When properly observed they turn out to be most marked . We will begin with the look of the planet last June . Its general aspect then was tripartite . Upon the top part of the disc , round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared a great white cap , the south polar cap . The south lay at the top , because all astronomical views are , for optical reasons , upside down ; but inasmuch as we never see the features otherwise , to have them right side up is not vital to the effect . Below the white cap lay a region chiefly bluish-green , interspersed , however , with portions more or less reddish- // 3fars. ochre . Below this , again , came a vast reddish-ochre stretch , the great continental deserts of the planet . The first sign of change occurred in the polar cap . It proceeded slowly to dwindle in size . Such obliteration it has , with praiseworthy regularity , undergone once every two years for the last two hundred . Since the polar cap was first seen it has waxed and waned with clock-like precision , a precision timed to the change of season in the planet 's year . During the spring , these snow-fields , as analogy at once guesses them to be , and as beyond doubt they really are , stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this last opposition , down to latitude seventy , and even sixty-five south ; covering thus more than the whole of the planet 's south frigid zone . As summer comes on they dwindle gradually away , till by early autumn they present but tiny patches , a few hundred miles across . This year , for the first time in human experience , they melted , apparently , completely . This unprecedented event happened on October 13 , or forty - three days after the summer solstice of the southern hemisphere , a date corresponding to about the middle of July on earth . Evidently it was a phenomenally hot season on Mars , for the minimum of the polar patch is reached usually about three months after Martian midsummer . It will be noticed how nearly such melting parallels what takes place with our arctic ice-cap on earth . But the disappearance of the polar snows is by no means the only change discernible upon the surface of the planet . Several years ago Schiaparelli noticed differences in tint at successive oppositions , both in the dark areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might be due to the seasons . This year it has been possible to watch the change take place . From the Martian last of April to the Martian middle of August , the bluish-green areas have been steadily undergoing a most marked transformation . 597 There proves , in fact , to be a wave of seasonal change that sweeps over the face of the planet from pole to pole . We will examine this more in detail when we take up the question of water . For the present point it suffices that it takes place ; for it constitutes proof positive of the presence of an atmosphere . A moment 's consideration will show how absolutely positive this proof is ; for it is the inevitable deduction from the simplest of observed facts . Its cogency consists in its simplicity . It is independent of difficult detail or of doubtful interpretation . It is not concerned with what may be the constitution of the polar caps , nor with the character of the transformation that sweeps , wavelike , over the rest of the planet . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusive . Having thus seen with the brain as much as with the eye , and in the simplest possible manner , that a Martian atmosphere exists , we will go on to consider what it is like . The first and most conspicuous of its characteristics is its cloudlessness . A cloud is an event on Mars , a rare and unusual phenomenon , which should make it more fittingly appreciated there than Ruskin lamented was the case on earth . For it is almost perpetually fine weather on our neighbor in space . From the day 's beginning to its close , and from one end of a year to the other , nothing appears to veil the greater part of the planet 's surface . This is more completely the case than has hitherto been supposed . We read sometimes in astronomical books and articles picturesque accounts of clouds and mist gathering over certain regions of the disc , hiding the coast lines and continents from view , and then , some hours later , clearing off again . No instance of such blotting out of detail has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face has been scanned there almost every night , from the last day of May to the end of November , not a case of obscuration of any part of the central portions of the // planet , from any Martian cause , has been detected by any one of three observers . Certain peculiar brightish patches have from time to time been noted , but , with a courtesy uncommon in clouds , they have carefully refrained from obscuring in the slightest degree any detail the observer might be engaged in looking at . The only dimming of detail upon the Martian disc has been along its bright edge , what is technically called its limb . Fringing this is a permanent lune of light that swamps all except the very darkest markings in its glare . This limblight has commonly been taken as evidence of sunrise or sunset mists on Mars . But observations of mine during last June show that such can not he the case . In June Mars was gibbous , - that is , he showed a face like the moon between the quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then upon his own western side , lay the bright limb-light , stretching inward about thirty degrees . Since the face turned toward us was only in part illumined by the sun , the centre of it did not stand at noon , but some hours later , and the middle of the limb consequently not at sunrise , but at about nine o'clock of a Martian morning . As the limb-light extended in from this thirty degrees , or two hours in time , the mist , if mist it was , must have lasted till eleven o'clock in the day . Furthermore , it must have been mist of a singularly mathematical turn of mind , for it made a perfect semiellipse from one pole to the other , quite oblivious of the fact that every hour from sunrise to sunset lay represented along its edge , including high noon . What is more , as the disc passed , in course of time , from the gibbous form to the full , and then to the gibbous form on the other side , the limb-light obligingly clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as it did so , the eleven o'clock meridian swung from one side of the centre of the disc to the other . As it crossed the centre its regions showed perfectly clear ; not a trace of obscuration as it passed directly under the eye . It was evident , therefore , that Martian morning mists were not responsible for the phenomenon . To what , then , was the limb-light due ? At first sight , it would seem as if the moon might help us ; for the moon 's limb is similarly ringed by a lune of light . In her case the effect has been attributed to mountain slopes catching the sun 's light at angles beyond the possibilities of plains . But Mars has few mountains worthy the name . His terminator - that is , the part of the disc which is just passing in or out of sunlight , and discloses mountains by the way in which they catch the coming light before the plains at their feet are illuminated - shows irregularities quite inferior to the lunar ones , proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , the best explanation of the phenomenon seems to be that the Martian atmosphere itself is somewhat of a veil , and that this veiling effect , though practically imperceptible in the centre of the disc , becomes noticeable as we go from the centre to the edge , owing to the greater thickness of the stratum through which we look . At thirty degrees in from the limb the observer would look through twice as much of it as when he looked plumb down upon the centre of the disc ; in consequence , what would be diaphanous at the centre might well seem opaque toward the edge . The effect we are familiar with on earth in the haze that always borders the horizon , - a haze most noticeable in places where there is much water in the air . Here , then , we have a hint of what is the matter on Mars . Were his atmosphere charged with water-vapor , just such an effect as is observed should take place . This first hint receives independent support from another Martian phenomenon . Contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the thinness of its atmospheric envelope would lead us to expect , the climate of Mars proves // astonishingly mild . Whereas calculation from distance and atmospheric density puts its average temperature below freezing , thus relegating it to perpetual ice , the planet 's surface features show that the temperature is relatively high . Observation reveals the fact that the mean temperature must actually be above that of the earthi ; for not only is there practically no snow or ice outside the frigid zone at any time , but the polar snow-caps melt to a minimum quite beyond that of our own , affording the Martians rare chance for quixotic polar expeditions . Such pleasing amelioration of the climate must be accounted for , and aqueous vapor seems the most likely thing for the purpose ; for aqueous vapor is quite specific as a planetary comforter , being the very best of blankets . It acts , indeed , like the glass of a conservatory , letting the light rays in , and opposing the passage of the heat rays out . The state of things thus disclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turns out to agree in a most happy manner with what probability would lead us to expect ; for the most natural supposition to make a priori about the Martian atmosphere is the following . When each planet was produced by fission from the parent nebula , we may suppose that it took with it as its birthright its proportion of chemical constituents ; that is , that its amount of oxygen , nitrogen , and so forth was proportional to its mass . Dbubtless its place in the primal nebula would to a certain extent modify the ratio , just as the size of the planet would to a certain extent modify the relative amount of these elements that would thereupon enter into combination . Supposing , however , that the ratio of free oxygen and so forth to the other elements remained substantially the same , we should have in the case of any two planets the same relative quantity of atmosphere . But the size of the planet would entirely alter the distribution of this air . Three causes would all combine to rob the smaller planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hat* little shall have less . In the first place , the smallerthe planet , the greater would be its volume in proportion to its mass , because the materials of which it was composed , being subjected to less pressure owing to a lesser pull , would not be crowded so closely together . This is one reason why Mars should have a thinner atmosphere than is the case with our earth . Secondly , of two similar bodies , spheres or others , the smaller has the greater surface for its volume , since the one quantity is of two dimensions only , the other of three . An onion will give us a good instance of this . By stripping off layer after layer we reach eventually a last layer which is all surface , inclosing nothing . We may , if we please , observe something analogous in men , among whom the most superficial have the least in them . In consequence of this principle , the atmosphere of the smaller body finds itself obliged to cover relatively more surface , which still further thins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the smaller body , the atmosphere is less compressed , and , being a gas , seizes that opportunity to spread out to a greater height , which renders it still less dense at the planet 's surface . Thus for three reasons Mars should have a thinner air at his surface than is found on the surface of the earth . Calculating the effect of the above causes numerically , we find that on this a priori supposition Mars would have at his surface an atmosphere of about fourteen hundredths , or one seventh the density of our terrestrial one . Observation supports this general supposition ; for the cloudless character of the Martian skies is precisely what we should look for in a rare air . Clouds are congeries of globules of water or particles of ice buoyed up by the air about them . The smaller these are , the more easily arc they buoyed up , because // gravity , which tends to pull them down , acts upon their mass , while the resistance titey oppose to it varies as their surface , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater in the smaller particles . The result is that the smaller particles can float in thinner air . We see the principle exemplified in our terrestrial clouds ; the low nimbus being formed of comparatively large globules , while the high cirrus is made up of very minute particles . If we go yet higher , we reach a region incapable of supporting clouds of any kind , so rarefied is its air . This occurs about five miles above the earth 's surface ; and yet even at this height the density of our air is greater than is the probable density of the air at the surface of Mars . We see , therefore , that the Martian atmosphere should from its rarity prove cloudless , just as we observe it to be . So far in this our investigation of the Martian atmosphere we have been indebted solely to the principles of mathematics and molar physics for help , and these have told us something about the probable quantity of that atmosphere , though silent as to its possible quality . On this latter point , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for an Irish gentleman , Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney , has recently made an ingenious deduction from the kinetic theory of gases bearing upon the atmospheric envelope which any planet can retain . His deductioa is as acute as it appears from observation to be in keeping with the facts . It is this - The molecular theory of gases supposes them to be made up of myriads of molecules in incessant motion . What a molecule may be nobody knows ; some scientists supposing it to be a vortex ring in miniature , - something like the swirl produced by a teaspoon when drawn through a cup of tea . But whatever it be , the idea of it accounts for the facts . The motion of the molecules is almost inconceivably swift as they dart hither and thither throughout the space ocen pied by the gas , and their speed differs for different gases . It is calculated that the molecules of oxygen travel , on the average , at the rate of fifteen miles a minute , those of water vapor about twenty miles a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the enormous speed of a mile a second . But this average velocity may , in any particular case , be increased by collisions of the molecules among themselves something like sevenfold . What is more , each molecule of the gas is bound , sooner or later , to attain this maximum velocity of its kind merely on the doctrine of chances . When it is attained , the molecule of oxygen travels at the rate of one and three fourths miles a second , the molecule of water vapor at the rate of two and one third miles a second , and the molecule of hydrogen actually at seven miles a second , six hundred times as fast as our fastest express train . Now , if a body , whether it be a molecule or a cannon-ball , be projected away from the earth 's surface , the earth will at once try to pull it down again : this instinctive holding on of Mother Earth to what she has we call gravity . In the cases with which we are personally familiar , her endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , either on the thrower or on some other person . But even the earth is not omnipotent . As the velocity with which the body is projected increases , it takes the earth longer and longer to overcome it and compel the body 's return . Finally there comes a speed which the earth is just able to overcome , if she take an infinite time about it . In that case , the body would continue to travel away from her , at a constantly diminishing rate , but still at some rate , on and on into the depths of space , till it attained infinity , at which point the truant would stop , and reluctantly begin to return again . This velocity we may call the critical velocity . It is the velocity which the earth would cause in a body falling to it from an // infinite distance , since gravity is able to destroy on the way up just the speed it is able to create on the way down . But now , if the body 's departure were even hastier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annihilate its speed , and the body would travel forever away out and out , till it fell , probably , under the sway of some distant star . In any case , the earth would know the vagabond no more . As gravity depends upon mass , the larger the attracting planet , the greater is its critical velocity , the velocity it can just control ; and , reversely , the smaller the planet , the less its restraining power . With the earth the critical velocity is between six and seven miles a second . If any of us , therefore , could manage to become faster than this , socially or otherwise , we could bid defiance to the whole earth , and begin to voyage on our own account through space . This is actually what happens , as we have seen , to the molecules of hydrogen . If , therefore , free hydrogen were present at the surface of the earth , and met with no other gas attractive enough to tie it down by uniting with it , the rover would , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to bid good-by to earth , and start on interspacial travels of its own . That it should reach its maximum speed is all that is essential to liberty , the direction of its motion being immaterial . To each molecule in turn would come this happy dispatch , till the earth stood deprived of every atom of free hydrogen she possessed . It is a highly significant fact that there is no free hydrogen found in the earth 's atmosphere . With oxygen and water vapor , and indeed all the other gases we know , the case is different ; for their maximum speed falls far short of the possibility of escape . So they have stayed with us solely because they must . And , as a matter of fact , the earth 's atmosphere contains plenty of free oxygen , nitrogen , and the like . The actions of the heavenly bodies confirm this conclusion . The moon , for example , possesses no atmosphere , and calculation shows that the velocity it can control falls short of the maximum of any of these gases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all have promptly done so . Whatever the moon 's attraction for lovers , no gas was sufficiently attracted by it to stay . On the other hand , the giant planets give evidence of very dense atmospheres . They have kept all they ever had . But the most striking confirmation of the theory comes from the cusps of Venus and Mercury ; for an atmosphere would prolong , by its refraction , the cusps of a crescent beyond their true limits . Length of cusp becomes , consequently , a criterion of the presence of an atmosphere . Now , in the appearance of their cusps there is a notable difference between Venus and Mercury . The cusps of Venus extend beyond the semicircle ; Mercury 's do not . We see , therefore , that Mercury has no appreciable atmospheric envelope . Turning to the case of Mars , we find with him the critical velocity to be about three miles a second . This is , like the earth 's , below the maximum for the molecules of hydrogen , but also , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which we have reason to suppose that , except for possible chemical combinations , his atmosphere is in quality not unlike our own . Having seen what the atmosphere of Mars is probably like , we may draw certain interesting inferences from it as to its capabilities for making life comfortable . The first consequence is that Mars is blissfully destitute of weather . Unlike New England , which has more than it can accommodate , Mars has none of the article . What takes its place as the staple topic of conversation for empty-headed folk there remains one of the Martian m , ysteries yet to be solved . What takes its place in fact is a per***-*renity , such as we can scarcely conceive of . Although // over what we shall later see to be the great continental deserts the air must at midday be highly rarefied , and cause vacuums into which the surrounding air must rush , the actual difference of gradient owing to the initial thinness of the air must be very slight . With a normal barometer of four and a half inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual one . In consequence , storms would be such mild - mannered things that , for objectionable purposes , they might as well not be . In the first place , if we are right , there can be no rain , nor hail , nor snow in them , for the particles would be deposited before they gained the dignity of such separate existence . Dew or frost would be the maximum of precipitation that Mars could support . The polar snow-cap or ice-cap , therefore , is doubtless formed , not by the falling of snow , but by successive depositions of dew . Secondly , there would be about the Martian storms no very palpable wind . Though the gale might blow at fairly respectable rates , so flimsy is the substance moved that it might buffet a man unmercifully without reproach . Another interesting result of the rarity of the air would be its effect upon the boiling-point of water . Reynault 's experiments have shown that , in air at a density * of our own , water would boil at about 1270 Fahrenheit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water would be converted into steam on Mars . So low a boiling-point would make it impossible to cook anything in the open air . Boiled eggs could be prepared only under cover , and such people as liked their meat boiled would probably find it convenient to prefer it done differently . Fortunately , roasts would still remain possible . The lowering of the boiling-point would raise the relative amount of aqueous vapor held in suspension by the air at any temperature . At about 1270 the air would be saturated , and even at lower temperatures much more of it would evaporate and load the surrounding air than happens at similar temperatures on earth . Thus at the heels of similarity treads contrast . We may now go on to such phenomena bearing on the Martian atmosphere as show it to differ from ours . Some of them we are able more or less imperfectly to explain ; some we are not . Although no case of obscuration has been seen at Flagstaff this summer , certain bright patches have been observed on special portions of the planet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , by a wavelike process of generation , travel across the American continent , for example , is shown by the fact that they do not travel , but are local fixtures . Commonly , they appear day after day , and even year after year , in the same spots ; for identical patches have been observed by different astronomers at successive oppositions . To this category belong the regions known as Elysium , Ophir , Memnonia , Eridania , and Tempe . Still smaller patches , apparently more fugitive in character , have been seen this year by Professor W. H. Pickering . But the most marked instance of variability was detected in September last by Mr. Douglass , in the western part of Elysium . On September 22 and 23 he found this blissfully named region , as usual , equally bright throughout . But on September 24 he noticed that the western half of it had suddenly increased in brightness , and far outshone the eastern half , being almost as brilliant as the polar cap . When he looked at it again the next night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vanished , the western half being now actually the darker of the two . So fugitive an effect suggests cloud , forming presumably over high ground , and subsequently dissipating ; it also suggests a deposition of frost that melted on the next day . It is specially noteworthy that the canals inclosing the region , Galaxias and HyblmEeus , were not in any way obscured by the bright apparition . On the contrary , Mr. Douglass May , // found them perceptibly darker than they had been , an effect attributable perhaps to contrast . Although not storm-clouds , it is possible that these appearances may have been due to cloud capping high land . There are objections , however , to this view , as , in the first place , there is evidence that the Martian mountains are low ; in the second place that they would have to be phenomenally high to produce a change in temperature sufficient to condense the air about them and so cap them with cloud ; and in the third place that the air is not dense enough to support clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Douglass on November 24 , a bright detached projection , for which from measurement he deduced a height of thirty miles . This would seem to have been cloud . With regard to its enormous height , it is not to be forgotten that a few years ago , on the earth , phenomenal dust-clouds were observed as high as one hundred miles . Something more in the line of the explicable was a phenomenon observed in 1879 and in 1881 by Schiaparelli . From October , 1879 , to January , 1880 , he noticed certain bright patches which appeared to surround the north pole in a sort of crown , the pole itself being invisible . In 1881 he saw the same ramifications again , in apparently the same place . At this latter opposition the north pole was much better placed for observation , and be was able to mark a curious subsequent action in these spots ; for as time went on they gradually contracted toward the pole , till finally they consolidated into the north polar patch , which up to that time had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear till more than a month after the vernal equinox of the northern hemisphere . Here , then , we have a very curious phenomenon , a phenomenon which seems to indicate that the seasonal wave of change acts as a unit across the planet 's face ; that instead of a more or less continuous deposit of moisture at the pole , such as occurs on earth , Martian atmospheric conditions oblige such deposit to creep gradually with the season up into polar latitudes , where it appears first as a crown of frost , and does not envelop the pole and become a polar cap till it has got higher . No sooner has this happened than the advance of following warmer isothernis causes it to begin to melt . One deduction from this thin air we must , however , be careful not to make : that because it is thin it is incapable of supporting intelligent life . That beings constituted physically as we are would find it a most uncomfortable habitat is pretty certain . But lungs are not wedded to logic , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as we know , a being with gills , for example , from being a most superior person . A fish doubtless imagines life out of water to be impossible ; and similarly , to argue that life of an orde*r as high as our own , or higher , is impossible , because of less air to breathe than that to which we are locally accustomed , is , as Flammarion happily expresses it , to argue , not as a philosopher , but as a fish . To sum up , now , what we know about the atmosphere of Mars : we have proof positive that Mars has an atmosphere ; we have reason to believe that this atmosphere is very thin , - thinner at least by half than the air upon the summit of the Himalayas , - that in constitution it does not differ greatly from our own , and that it is relatively heavily charged with water vapor . In the next paper I shall take up the question of water upon the planet .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
