ARTICLE V.-PIIILADELPHIA : A STUDY IN MORALS . IT has been the habit of Philadelphia to plume itself upon being the most American city of America . Lacking the noisy metropolitan character of New York , without the assumed culture of Boston , and far removed from the loud aggressiveness of inland Chicago , it prided itself on its Americanism , and the claim is not without foundation . Here , if American liberty was not actually born , it was tenderly nursed through its experimental period and cared for through its full growth . Though the founding of the city goes back no further than the time of William Penn of estimable memory , whose religious instincts were not so firmly rooted that he disdained to cheat so ungodly a creature as the poor Indian , the historical associations of the city are of the most exalted order . Rome , Paris , Philadelphia , have had enacted in the midst of them more scenes that have influenced the history of humanity than any city of the world . And the memorable events that lifted Philadelphia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor less abiding in their consequences than those which distinguished her sister cities . No just estimate of Philadelphia is possible without keeping in view her historic associations and the important rank she holds by right of them , among American cities . As an active seat of right and liberty in the war for independence , Philadelphia has long retained an exalted rank . It is this which gives her claims for consideration to-day , and it is on this her citizens rest their reputation for Americanism . Americans , as a rule , do not appreciate the value of historic associations . They are constantly changing the names of their streets and houses with almost as much regularity as they change their clothes . The country is too young to yet have any relics of even a respectable antiquity , and intimate association with the spick and span new things of the new world breeds contempt for those which are simply old . Children , even before they are out of pinafores , assert an independence of their parents // that would be startling in an older community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national progressiveness . With the possible exception of Boston , the historic associations of Philadelphia are richer than those of any other American city , and they are therefore of the utmost importance in illustrating its history , life , and civic character . The men of 76 were animated by a holy zeal for liberty and for right . Their patriotism was spotted by no unmanly act ; no lust for spoil , nor for personal aggrandizement marred their efforts . They may not have all been heroes , they might not all have been as single hearted as their historians would draw them . Human nature is much the same among all people and in all times , but were there any who took part in the great events of that epoch , actuated by selfish or wrongful methods , they were lost in the mass of pure-minded patriots who made it famous . Midway between the northern and southern colonial cities , Philadelphia took the leading place in the struggle for independence , both by its position and the patriotism of its citizens . It was natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immortal declaration of independence should have been written and signed by the acknowledged representatives of the people . Though the American character lacks that impulsive sentimentality which so distinguishes the French , it is impossible to believe that the good folk of Philadelphia were not deeply impressed by the great events transpiring in the midst of them , nor is it strange that every relic of that age has been preserved with jealous care save when the inevitable demands of progress and the selfish greed of individuals has swept them away . At all events there is no American city in which the remains of national antiquity are more highly treasured , and it is a distinguished trait of the inhabitants that to this day , there is maintained a social hierarchy based on ancestral connections and colonial blood that is without a parallel in the land of the free , the place of refuge for the oppressed of all nations . However opposed to current traditions of American life such a fabric may be , it has at least the merit of indicating the regard in which the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families who trace their ancestry back beyond the foun // dation of American liberty is indisputable evidence of the number of good men and faithful citizens who have made Philadelphia their home . In a community in which wickedness reigned and worldliness was the motto , the falls from grace would have been too numerous to permit the establishment of an ancestral society . Thus with its historic memories Philadelphia has maintained a moral atmosphere of the purest order . The lofty example of the higher circles has made itself felt in all grades of society , and it is no exaggeration to say that few communities of its size can offer the same amount of uprightness to the square mile as Philadelphia . As a matter of fact it is impossible to be openly wicked in Philadelphia . Small boys when they want to learn to smoke or to do other forbidden things , are forced to seek the most secluded portions of the parks , or the utmost parts of the city . Notwithstanding its vast area , Philadelphia is really limited in extent . The dwellings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor alike have homes and houses of their own . But the business portion of the city and the streets most used by its inhabitants are small , narrow , and short . Business is concentrated in a few streets ; the large retail houses , offices , and even wholesale establishments must be within a certain area or they will not thrive . Everybody goes down Chestnut street and every one is constantly meeting every one else . IMlen of note acquire a familiarity which would be impossible in a city where business and professional life are more diffuse . But this remarkable publicity is not the only fact that helps to maintain public morality . The exclusive circles of Philadelphia are closely united by intermarriages ; the union of one of the ancient families with a representative of the new rich , which is becoming as characteristic of Philadelphia as of all other communities , excites almost as much attention and consternation as a royal misalliance would create in the most exalted circles of the old world . And so closely are the lines drawn that those members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes of Philadelphia maids , are regarded as being honored by being received into its oldest families . The proudest aristocracy of Europe is not bluer-blooded nor more exclusive than that of Philadelphia . // The blue blood of Philadelphia is its pride and its strength . Though its aristocracy draws the social lines with unprecedented closeness , its most distinguished members are foremost in every enterprise which concerns the honor and glory of the city . They pride themselves not alone upon their lineage , but upon their reputation as the guardians of the city 's most sacred associations . In every good work they are active leaders , and no public enterprise has been carried to a successful completion in which , if not the active originators , they have been the most active workers . Their purses are constantly open to the demand of public necessities , and the programme of every local enterprise is not much different from a list of Philadelphia 's social leaders . Their public spirit has endeared them to the whole community , and even those whom they view socially with abhorrence would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would affect their honor and integrity , their worth or their usefulness . No breath of scandal has yet touched them that has not moved the city to its foundations , and there is a charitable and well-meant effort to cover up any wrong-doing which might inadvertently have become public property . The reputation of the city must be maihtained at all costs , even though things be winked at that would be intolerable in less exalted personages . It is well to keep these facts in mind , for some recent events in Philadelphia have soiled its spotless reputation and cast the dark cloud of doubt upon the names of many who have been in the front rank of good works , whose public probity has been the highest , whose moral worth has been until now unquestioned . The details of the defalcation of the city treasurer in the early part of this year and the collapse of the Keystone National Bank can have little general interest to those who are not personally concerned in the scandals unearthed at the time . But when it is remembered that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia society and intelligence , they become public property . All events which throw light on the evolution of morals are of the utmost value to the student of society , and the incidents of the Philadelphia financial mess have shown that city in a new aspect which can not but deeply affect the influence it may have in // the future as the guardian of American ideas , as the possessor of the most sacred traditions of America , as the representative American city where good works abound not less than good men , and which for years has been held up to America and the world at large as the model community of the universe . Since the fall of Lucifer there has been no greater collapse than that of the late city treasurer of Philadelphia . He was a man who for years had been looked upon by the general public , the public by whom he was elevated to his high office , the public whose interests he betrayed , the public that rewarded him for his past good , and condemned him for his later evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a local reputation as an unselfish guardian of the city 's finances . From his seat in the city council chamber he had closely watched olThnding and suspicions officials . Long experience had made him familiar with every detail of mnnicipal finance , and when two years ago , he went before the people as a candidate for the office of city treasurer , there was a popular feeling that a just man could now be appropriately rewarded by his grateful fellow-citizens and that for once the right man would have the right office . He was elected , and for two years commanded the respect of the community by the able manner in which he performed the duties assigned him . A series of financial disturbances , which in a measure had been felt in all parts of the country , culminated in Philadelphia in the failure of the Keystone National Bank . Never had a financial institution been more wrongly managed , and its collapse revealed a state of rottenness almost unparalleled in financial history . Its most important immediate consequence was the revelation of the close connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embezzlement of a large amount of city and state funds . It is unnecessary to go further into the details of this story , but its value as a contribution to the history of Philadelphia morality is very great . It is well to remember the past record of the disgraced official and his local reputation , to understand the full significance of its later bearings , He was a poor man , his business was small , and , prior to his election , he had no credit , yet shortly after he had assumed office he had large // sums of money on deposit to his credit in numerous banking institutions , he loaned huge amounts to his brokers , and bought and sold stocks to great extent . His operations are known to have amounted to several hundred thousand dollars and his defalcation exceeded two millions . Sad as the fall of Mr. Bardsley was , the excuses put forth by those who had profited by his misdeeds are even more so . The criminal who is caught in his peculations is naturally regarded as the perpetrator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by endless public discourses on his misdeeds , and the vocabulary of the daily press was exhausted in exhibiting him in his imagined true light . Had his crimes been confined to himself , had no others been affected by them , his story , though sad enough , would have been but the history of a single man . As a matter of fact , the Bardsley defalcation has affected an entire community . Public men whose reputation has hitherto been untouched by the breath of scandal , have been shown in a new and unpleasant light , perjury and falsehood have been exhibited in instances that only a few months before would have been deemed incredible . The highest of the land have been drawn into the scandal , and the mischievous spirit of rumor has been active in spreading abroad the most scandalous reports . Much of this is pure rumor and imagination , but the noise of false allegations has not been lessened because it served to direct public attention from the aetnal scandals that were being done in full light of day . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal . His thefts and perjuries were unquestioned . Yet the men who had once been his political associates in the city councils , men whom once he had led and fascinated by his purity of thought and of purpose , condoned his crime sufficiently to exempt him from the disgrace of impeachment for high crimes and iuisdeiueanors committed in office . Practically this did not affect his final personal punishment ; but what a spectacle for the civilized world ! The city councils of Philadelphia meet in no less a structure than Independence Hall itself , a building consecrated by the most precious of American memories , a building which should all else in this country pass away , is worthy to be protected // by the last blood of its citizens , a building the very sight of which should instil fresh love of liberty and right into the breast of every living man , a building in which it should be impossible to commit a crime , above all to overlook one . Yet in the midst of these holy memories , in the center of the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people for their integrity and worth as the people 's representatives , who had every man of them sworn to preserve the city 's honor unharmed and untouched , made themselves the associates of a criminal by exempting him from a portion of his just punishment . Well may one ask if it was for this the men of 76 fought , if it was for this the pure patriots of a hundred years ago lived and died , that the scene of their most nwmorable event should be desecrated by their successors . But this is not all . The public conscience of Philadelphia , the once noted morality of her people illustrated in this transaction , were to receive further exemplification . Mr. Bardsley still continues the central figure of the story ; his crimes have performed no more important function than the unveiling of Philadelphia 's moral atmosphere . It was natural that a man who was thus publicly excused and permitted to depart from the office he had most shamefully abused , should expect still further consideration from the public he had wronged . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good and moral men who had profited by his misdeeds . The next chapter is indeed a strange one . It shows a long procession of Philadelphia bankers , brokers , men of unspotted reputation , in whose care the honor of the city would at any time have been gladly left , coming forward and solemnly taking oath before Almighty God that the large sums of money Mr. Bardsley had deposited with them , on which they were , many of them , wrongly allowing interest , represented his own personal fortune . The fact that this man before his election had been poor and so overwhelmed in debt that a semi-public effort was made to relieve him of his necessities by subscription , did not enter the minds of these eminent gentlemen , who lifted their eyes to heaven and could not see where money , which could only have been public money , came from . Even more amazing , more crushing in its effect than that shown by // the politicians of the councils , was this testimony , coming from the very salt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good men knew they might be found out and their sin made public property . It is small wonder , in view of such widespread corruption among the most unsuspected individuals , that Philadelphia has grown sick of her scandals and mighty efforts have been made to stem the tide of investigation which was bringing out unpalatable truths in unexpected quarters . It was natural that the chief criminal in the story should have found comfort in the morality thus revealed and , in the rapidly extending hosts of associates , have looked for still further consideration . It could well have been imagined that a city in which these things could have been brought to pass , almost anything in the way of an excuse would be accepted . Accordingly Mr. Bardsley asked the judge to deal lightly with him because he had not profited by any of his misdeeds , and because he was ignorant that it was wrong for him to treat public funds as his own until after he had paid them over to other officials , when , naturally enough , he could do nothing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered for the consideration of rational men , is difficult to understand . The law recognizes no such thing as ignorance , and it is the height of folly for a man whose entire life has been spent in the public service , to come forward after the eleventh hour and affirm that , in looking upon money paid him for taxes as his own , he committed no crime . It is impossible to conceive why a man who had used public money for his own personal advantage , had engaged in illegal and unwise speculation , should present a request that his crimes be overlooked because all his wickedness had not profited him so much as a single cent . It is altogether a new doctrine in morals that an offender is only guilty if his crimes be successful . The application of this principle would soon free our jails and penitentiaries of a host of would-be criminals whose chief cause for regret , which is heightened rather than diminished by their capture , is that they failed . Under such rulings life and property would soon be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large addition to the criminal ranks , if success alone was to be the criterion by which their crimes were to be judged . // A few months before , such excuses would have called down the indignation of the entire community had any criminal ventured to put them forth , but the man who had closely studied the moral atmosphere of Philadelphia was not afraid to insult the intelligence of her citizens still further , and surely the morality he had caused to be revealed justified him in his estimate . It is unnecessary to go further into this matter , as fortunately for the shattered honor of the city , these pleas were without effect . It is difficult to determine in this case which is the more depraved , the mind of the man who conceived such excuses , or the morality of a city which led even a self-confessed criminal to suppose that they might be accepted . In view of what went before it seems a narrow chance that they were not taken as full palliation for the crimes involved . Throughout the whole disgraceful episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scapegoat upon whom has been hurled the vials of public wrath , the indignation of an offended city . No language has been too severe with which to describe him and the crimes he wrought , and in the interest that has been focused upon him the public mind has overlooked many other events of importance . It is impossible to relate the incidents of the case without giving prominence to the fallen official , but his part in the transaction is small and insignificant compared with the light it throws upon the moral atmosphere of the most American of American cities . Party rivalry in America stops at no personal vituperation or distortion of facts , and not long ago the leading repnblican organ of Philadelphia kept prominently displayed before its readers a list of defalcating democratic officials , as if there were a direct connection between politics and crime and all criminals were democrats . Had Mr. Bardsley been the single victim of his operations his story would have been sad enough , but it acquires a new interest in the public men it has affected . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public ; but the meaning of the play is deeper and below the surface . It is unjust to him , it is unjust to Philadelphia to treat the case as relating to him only . His fall was bad enough , it was sufficiently shocking that a man who had once been a shining light in a community should have departed far from the paths of // truth and uprightness he had once so carefully traveled . His own errors relate to himself only and would have been relatively small had they affected him alone . They are much more serious when they are found , as they are , to affect a large portion of the people , when the best citizens gladly omit a portion of a just punishment and others see no harm in taking money that could not have been his . It is not John Bardsley that has injured Philadelphia , but her men of worth . It was not an erring city treasurer that hurt her , but the politicians and bankers who banded themselves to shield a notorious criminal , to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-suffering public by hiding their misdeeds in the greater crimes of one who had once been their friend and benefactor . There can be no wonder that absurd excuses should have been put forth in such a place . Philadelphia would do well to contrast her present with her past , to ask if the men of 76 would have done as those of 91 did , to compare the public spirit of a century ago with that of to-day . She should ask if it is seemly to crowd all imaginable crimes upon the shoulders of one man if thereby attention be diverted from more exalted criminals . She should ponder these things , and ponder them thoughtfully . The record of Philadelphia 's past greatness is untarnished . She stood then as a brilliant beacon guiding the hearts and hands of a mighty host . IMore than once since she has shown the world the patriotism and purity of her citizens . Her title as the most American of American cities has been hers not wrongfully . She has been the stronghold of the most progressive political party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works she stood among American cities without a peer . Now all is changed . Her boasted public morality has been swept away by the actions of a single man . Her most cherished citizens have been put to a crucial test and found wanting . In the greed for gain , undreamed-of crimes have been committed and a foul depravity exhibited where once all had been purity and brightness . The sins of Philadelphia have found her out . She that had once prided herself on her unspotted reputation has been shown to be no better than her rivals . In the rewalsion of feeling which naturally follows // such a discovery it may be unjust to condemn the city , which has held the most exalted rank among American cities , to the lowest place , but her fall has been great , and has carried with it great part of the fabric of American patriotism and morality . If goodness has departed from Philadelphia , the inquirer may well be disturbed to know where to find it throughout the length and breadth of the great western land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con* science in America . Certainly it sometimes exhibits itself under the strangest forms and in the most unexpected manner ; but the latest contribution of Philadelphia to American morality is most disheartening . It is not that one man has proven himself false , but an entire community . It is not one crime but many . It is not something that has been done in private , but in the full glare of the modern world , with its innumerable searching accompaniments of the telegraph and the public press . It was not done in a locality of depraved moral sense , but consummated in the very stronghold of uprightness and probity . It was not done by men of low tastes , by hardened criminals , but by men of education and culture . Were they unused to crime ? Was this their first fall ? Have they done nothing else wrong ? It is impossible to pursue the idea further . The fall of Philadelphia has been great enough without adding fresh torture to her citizens by suggesting additional wrong-doing . The descent of Philadelphia from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is one that well deserves the sympathy of the world . A departure from the path of truth by any person is a misfortune , and when an entire society is shown to be as foul within as it was once apparently pure without , it becomes a world-wide misfortune , and is doubly so when the community has been a source of light , the observed of all observers , the guardian of some of the most sacred relics of the human race . Had the events which recently transpired in Philadelphia taken place in some remote city of the Chinese empire , their influence upon the world at large would have been most insignificant . The city at the junction of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers occupies too conspicuous a position for any public event in it to pass unheeded . The whole world knows of her misfortune , but it has been the part that Mr. // Bardsley has taken in it that has been most industriously circulated . The pride of its citizens is still great enough to seek to hide the universal depravity in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural that this should be so , but it is nevertheless grossly immoral . At present it would seem that only on two grounds can Philadelphia be rehabilitated and again lifted to her once conspicuous position : ( 1 ) That it be no longer wrong to excuse crime because one has once associated with the criminal , and ( 2 ) that it is no longer wicked to tell lies . When the evolution of public morality has advanced to these points , then can Philadelphia once more become a shining light to the youth of the new world , and to the men of the old . Then in truth , shall we have a new morality and a new Philadelphia , when the traditions of the old are forgotten and its work lost in the abyss to which it has sunk .
