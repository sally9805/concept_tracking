txt A FRIEND once asked me for advice in relation to a place he had just inherited . He was one of those men who always set out and do the thing they want to do , and then ask for advice when it is too late . IJnsuspicious of the condition of affairs , I held forth at length on the questions of site and other equally important considerations connected with a small country place . Time passed and I received a pressing invitation to spend Sunday with him . Of course , on reaching the place , I naturally hoped to see some results of the advice so freely and earnestly given , for I had conceived a high regard for my friend , and did not want to see him go wrong and waste his money . To my surprise , I came upon a conspicuous example of most of the errors I had warned him to avoid . He divined something of the thoughts that must naturally pass through my mind , and began to explain that he had done most of this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest and explained to me carefully how the architectural style of his house , old colonial , required a formal treatment of the paths and roads , and that a certain grove of fine old shade trees had to be cut down to secure a desired view . What could I say ? The damage was done . I did not want to make my friend unhappy by insisting on his mistakes . Moreover , it would probably be lost effort , for it is just such serious mistakes , evident at once when attention is called to them , that the owner of the place will not see , because he thinks he can not afford to see them . Just think of it ! Here was a great river , a high bluff and a fine oak-grove-one of those groves that would have delighted the souls of the old Greeks or Abraham the Patriarch . It was only necessary to shift the situation of the house a hundred feet , and rearrange the paths and roads , and the desirable views would have been retained , and the grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and storm , but made a genuine artistic background for the house itself . As it was the grove was mutilated to get a vista , and the house stood off on the bluff , lonely and unrelated to the grove or any other of the best features of the place . There was little or nothing of the systematic composition of a picture which should characterize the arrangement of all country places , both large and small . I have referred to this country place of my friend to show the importance of selecting properly the site , not only that the architect may exhibit his house to advantage , but that the house may be duly co-ordinated with the distinctively interesting and artistically important features of the place . It should always be remembered in undertaking to select the site even on the smallest places that every plot or territory of ground has characteristics peculiar to itself , and to no other plot of ground ; that it is undulating in a certain way ; that it has agreeable or disagreeable outlooks ; in a word , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The true way to manage it , therefore , from the standpoint of one who wishes to develop the // entire beauty of his place , is to study all the features , good and bad , and tone down the bad ones and accentuate the good ones . More mistakes are made in selecting sites than in almost anything else in landscape architecture . People think of only some one important consideration of the arrangement , and forget everything else . The house is not the only important feature of the place . It should not be allowed to obtrude itself , to be a discord in the picture , and obscure other important and charming features . There are no definite rules , of course , that will always apply to the selection of a site for the house . Usually it should not be placed exactly in the middle of a place , or close to the front , and it should associate itself in some way with some considerable plantation of trees that may already exist . I am speaking of considerations that must be met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the best practice of the art of landscape gardening . But avoid being too conventionally artistic . Use common sense , and first of all make your grounds comfortable and convenient ; then do what you can for the a3sthetic . The latter may , in your opinion , be of the most importance , but the former , be sure , will , sooner or later , revenge itself on you for any undue neglect . Remember , I am speaking now of all country places , meaning thereby a lot that may be only 25 feet by 100 feet , or may be five or six acres . In any case you are devising a picture when you undertake to lay out your grounds , even in the most simple fashion ; and any arrangement that will develop and present with the best effect the most artistically valuable features , should be invariably chosen , though at first it may seem odd , and not in accordance with your conventional ideas of landscape gardening art . Any evident attempt at mere oddity is , of course , bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there may be an unusualness of treatment that seems odd , though in reality effective and harmonious , simply because it is uncon-ventionaL Take the carriage or foot entrances of a place as an illustration . Usually they are arranged at a little distance , twenty or thirty feet from the boundary lines of either side of the place , but frequently the most effective way to enter is exactly at the extreme corner of the lot , continuing across it . This is certainly not a conventional method , and yet it is an effective one . Having selected the site of the house , and entered the place in such a way as to develop and perfect its essential beauties and attractions , let us see what we should next consider in the arrangement of our grounds . Perhaps we can only have a foot-path on account of the small size of our place , and perhaps a carriage-drive may be admissible when we have grounds of two or three acres in extent . This path or drive should be laid out and constructed before the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plants is as dependent on the situation and grades of the roads and paths as on the location of the house . The first thing you must require of a road or path is that it shall reach the house by a sufficiently direct course to serve the general convenience of the place . Keeping this in view , a certain deviation may be allowed that will permit a better distant view , or the exhibition of some peculiar attraction of the lawn or plantations . As a rule , straight lines , absolutely straight lines , are to be avoided in landscape gardening . The slightest winding in a road or path almost invariably renders it more attractive . As with all rules , this one has its exceptions . It may be specially effective , under some peculiar circumstances , to arrange a straight avenue to the house , with a formal line of trees on either side ; or the architecture of the house may be such as to suggest on its immediate borders some form of the rectangular French or Italian style of gardening . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your roads or paths , and also equal reverse curvesthat is , curves that exactly repeat each other . The width of roads and paths is another // consideration that must necessarily depend on circumstances . Ordinarily , in a small country place , I have found a path of five feet and a road of thirteen feet ample , but it may be quite as reasonable in some cases to make the foot-paths eight feet and the carriagedrives fifteen feet . As to the question , How shall I construct my roads and paths ? much depends on the nature of the soil and on how much the paths and roads are to be used . Ordinarily it is wise to lay a foundation of broken stone six inches deep under all paths and one foot under drives for the sake of drainage , covering them with fine gravel and a little clay . Continuing the carriage - drive up to the front door , we are met by the question , Shall we make a circle or an oval for the convenience of turning ? Again , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suitable under certain circumstances . Ordinarily , however , we should avoid these forms , particularly the circle . There will be , usually , a tree or rock , or you can plant or place one , that will determine more or less the form of the turn . The shape is not of so much importance so long as it conforms to lines that will enable a carriage to turn with ease and without a tendency to i'un over the borders . I have found that such a turn should be at least forty feet across in its widest part , with its curves carefully adjusted to the easy turning of an ordinary carriage . Subsidiary roads for bringing supplies to the house should be , of course , minimized and kept out of sight as much as possible ; but if convenience requires them , no mere aesthetic considerations should prevent their employment . Paths should be likewise allowed only as a comparatively straight and easy way to reach a house or view . All roads and paths are , indeed , only admissible as means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always look better without them . They have no attractions comparable with that of grass , flowers , shrubs , and trees . This should be remembered whenever the question of making a path arises . On consideration , perhaps , you will find that you will have to sacrifice more than you will gain , and the path will stay unmade . On the same principle , try to minimize the area of the open , bare spaces necessarily made by the meeting and crossing of paths and roads . After the paths and roads are made , there comes the preparation and grading of the lawns . Manure heavily and plow or dig deeply , and the superior growth of your grass will abundantly repay you . If you want a perfect piece of greensward , even and free from weeds , let me commend to you the use of carefully selected sods . There is no other way of making such perfect grass ; but then , I must acknowledge , the lawn should be small or the expense of sodding must be necessarily great . In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made level for a foot or two at least , whatever the steepness beyond , should be sodded . You will hardly make grass-seed produce a good permanent border in a year or two along the immediate edge of a path or road . It will be trodden too much , or suffer greatly from other vicissitudes incident to such places . A word also should be said about the parallelism of the two sides of roads or paths . Ordinarily , as everyone knows , the width of a walk or road is kept the same throughout its extent . This is common-sense that is also conventional , but that does not preclude the wisdom of a systematic variation of the width of paths and roads wherever convenience requires . Perhaps a tree may force a widening , because the preservation of the tree is of more importance than the adherence to the conventional rule of parallelism of path- and road-lines . Sometimes , moreover , the necessity for a seat , or at least the space for the lingering of several pedestrians , will suggest a widening . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and different in his methods by frequently widening the paths , but simply that he should not be slavishly bound by a fancied necessity for adhering to the parallelism of roadand path-lines . In grading the lawn we should be largely governed by the original topography of the ground , by its special idiosyncrasy , of formation , if I may be allowed the use of such a term in this // connection . If the lawn be hollowing , do n't attempt to fill it up , if you are not troubled by difficulties of drainage ; and even then a land basin and a pipe led a short distance will often obviate this difficulty entirely . Sometimes even you will find it best in the interest of developing the peculiar character of the place to deepen the hollow of the lawn . Then again part of the lawn may be hollow and part convex , and yet you must not attempt to make it level . To say that a level lawn is not , under most circumstances , desirable , seems to be a paradox . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , in most cases , you will hardly be able to make a level , absolutely level , lawn , hard as ever you may try . Of course , you should smooth off the asperities of the surface and secure easy - flowing lawn contours . Sometimes you can improve the effect of the undulations by judiciously arranged planting . But never , or only in the rarest cases , plant the crown of the convex portions of your lawn and bottom of your hollows . You will only thereby lessen the attractive variety and picturesqueness of the surface . Every contour , every line of a well - arranged place , will be always changing to the eye , not abruptly and suddenly , but harmoniously and gracefully . There must be no monotony of line anywhere - in walks , roads , grass surface , or plantations . Concerning the plantations I should have much to say did space permit , for on them depends largely the successful composition and coloring of the place . The first thing to consider before you begin to plant is the adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except where you require for some reason a special outlook , the entire outside border of the place should be planted with a mass of trees and shrubs , making a hedge of irregular , waving lines . Ordinarily , too , there should be something like seven shrubs to every tree , the shrubs standing eight or ten feet apart and the trees forty to fifty feet . This rule applies , of course , to only large growing shrubs ; the smaller ones can be tucked in round about . It is an excellent plan to establish a lofty tree , like the elm , tulip , or poplar , at each marked angle of the place and at either side of the carriage entrance . It tends to give character to the entire lawn . If you have room enough , one of the ways of emphasizing certain interesting parts of your country place , and especially the pleasant home character of the house , is to establish a grove near that building . Set out the best shade-trees-elms , maples , beeches , tulip-trees , liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet apart so that they may grow into broad and lofty trees , dispensing abundant shade . Such a grove near the house will give perpetual delight throughout the year . Even in winter , during snowand ice-storms , you will find unfailing pleasure in contemplating the unexpected and magical effects of snow and ice in your grove , and moreover find comfort in seeking its protecting shelter if you have planted a few pines in the midst . Planting groves means to many people simply the setting out of a cluster of trees eight or ten feet apart and allowing them to slowly crowd each other to death . Properly managed , the grove may be the most delightful and admirable feature of all country places , except the smallest , and even there one great elm or beech may be a grove in itself . In adjusting the vistas by means of your planting , you should see that the longest lines of view are secured . Let them extend diagonally from corner to corner of your place if you can . It will give breadth and largeness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its attractiveness . Try also to mass your lawn into as large and open unplanted space as possible . It increases the much-to-be-desired breadth of the place . At all intersections of paths , at entrance-gates , etc. , there should be planted intermingled masses of trees and shrubs so arranged that the way for the paths and roads may seem to have been hewn through them . I have named some good trees , among which should have been included the white birch and yellow wood or cladastris tinctoria . Let me also give you the names of some thoroughly excellent shrubs , not merely // rare kinds , but such as you can readily find in most well-stocked nurseries . Here they are : Spirea opulifolia , California privet , Japanese snowball , common snowball , standard honeysuckles , weigelas , Philadelphuses , Japan quince , purple berberry , Thunberg 's spirea , lilacs , hydrangea paniculata grandiflora , white fringe , purple fringe , and golden elder . Do n't plant trees and large shrubs close to the house . It gives a crowded feeling and is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs may , however , be used effectively adjoining the house . They are not only beautiful in themselves , but they tend to mask the base of the house , where there is usually a sharp and uninteresting angle . A few specimens of shrubs and trees may be allowed to adorn the turn in front of the house , and those only immediately on the edge of the curves , so as to leave the green sward of the general surface of the turn open and free . If possible make the surface also slightly undulating here as elsewhere . Against one thing let me warn the reader , and that is the indiscriminate use of formal foliage or flower - beds on most lawns . They are apt to lend a garish and vulgar air to the place . Close to the house you may sometimes use one or two of these beds , but their bright red and yellow colors should be set a little on one side and not allowed to glare at one too much . I respect the universal delight in rich color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in proper relations to the whole picture . A discordant mass of color hurts the eye much in the same way as a voice or instrument annoys the ear when not used in harmony . It is far more harmonious and satisfactory in most cases to employ , instead of beds of geraniums and coleuses , the hardy herbaceous plants , such as phloxes , lilies of the valley , harebells , larkspurs , hollyhocks , blue gentians , and the like , tucked away in the edges of groups of trees and shrubs . I think I have now given a few important suggestions concerning some of the principles of treatment that apply alike to both small and large country places . But in order to illustrate better what I mean , I propose to ask the reader 's attention for a brief space to an account of the treatment of a small place of five or six acres situated on the banks of the East River , ten or fifteen miles from New York . See illustration , p. 309 . This place had a somewhat curious history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of New York bought it , probably because he was attracted by its bold position on a point or bend of the shore of the river . On this tract of land he planted at the time a considerable assortment of shade-trees and a few shrubs . There were elms , maples , beeches , poplars , lindens , pines , spruces , and other trees of similar character . In the course of time these trees grew to great dimensions , for the soil was naturally rich and mellow , and excellently adapted to the growth of trees . The place remained in the hands of the family of the purchaser , who has been long dead , for the term of a generation , until the tract became a great thicket of saplings interspersed with full-grown specimens . Here and there along the river bank was a grove of pine and other trees standing free , but in main part the tract was a close-set wilderness . A purchaser for the place finally came , eight or ten years ago , and undertook to make a home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tangle , although there were evidently fine trees scattered about . Many people would have started in with an axe and soon swept most of the wilderness away . But the present owner recognized capabilities and idiosyncrasies pertaining to the place that he thought charming , and therefore he proposed to develop them . The place was to be made a genuine woodland home a few miles from New York City . Let us see how he accomplished his purpose . In the first place , at the southwest corner there stood an enormous elmtree , just a few feet within the boundary line . This he conceived the idea of making the key-point of his entrance from the corner , thus turning the course of the drive diagonally across his land . Eventually the art displayed in carrying , this winding road , with the lines of a // gently flowing river , almost directly to the house , constituted one of the principal charms of the place . At first the road went into the thicket with a sharp curve around the elm , and then straight away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly around a " circle " or carriage sweep . By this means you saw nothing of the place and house until you had gone many yards beyond the entrance , and even then you only caught glimpses of the house till you came right upon it , whereas it was in reality all the time only a few yards away . Yet you did not feel shut in , because just after you left the elm-tree and passed the entrance of the winding foot-path that commenced here to skirt the place , a tennis - ground of an acre in extent spread out before you . This gave a charming effect of openness and let in at its farthest boundary the western sun and a noble view of the river . This was literally all the clearing that had been made , except in front of the house , where enough trees had been chopped out to prepare a small carriage turn about a grass plot forty feet in its largest diameter . The house was a low two-story structure utterly unpretentious , but comfortable and convenient . Near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable gardens in such a way that you would hardly discover it unless you were keeping a sharp look-out . A footpath meandered by an almost secret way from the house to the barn . An acre and a half would probably comprise all the land that had been cleared from the original seven or eight acres , and really you would hardly realize , except just about the house , that any trees had been removed , so deftly had the work been managed in order to retain the original spirit and chief beauties of the place . Do n't understand that there was not a great deal of work laid out , because there was ; but it was of a dainty , unobtrusive kind that simply developed and perfected existing charms . There was , for instance , not a formal flower or foliage bed on the place , but all along the borders of the woodland , skirting the tennis-ground , and in nooks everywhere along the walks that skirted the entire grounds , there were quantities of hardy herbaceous plants - harebells , irises , blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wild flowers of many kinds , besides those found growing naturally on the place . Shrubs , especially American shrubs , were planted along the same borders wherever weak spots in the foliage occurred . The only planting which was evidently made for ornament came close to the house , where with a background of woods grew irregular groups of rhododendrons and azaleas , with two or three choice and beautiful specimens of evergreens of low growth . The walk skirting the place was a mere narrow foot-path two or three feet wide , that sought all the most beautiful spots on the banks of the river which bounded the tract on two sides . At the points where the views were finest the path was widened for rustic seats , from which one might gaze at ease on the near and distant stretches of shining river . The rest and repose and perfect woodland charm of the spot , looking out on the river laden with numerous busy craft , was possessed of a unique charm that I have not words to express . There was a pine - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and airy , with the branches far up and a clean carpet of brown needles beneath , and as the wind played the peculiar tune of the pines and the glimpses of the river flashed near by , I often thought that here was a grove before which one might well lift one 's hat in reverence . There was nothing careless or unkempt about the place . It was tidy , the plants were thriving , the grass was vigorous and well kept , and the branches of the great trees were duly pruned ; and yet it was all so unobtrusively natural that the wood-robins and other birds seemed to make it their home instinctively . But the estate I have described was originally wooded and level and situated on the banks of a great busy river . Let us consider for a few moments a place in Madison , N. J. , where the original conditions were different . It will serve to suggest , and perhaps solve , for the reader several other prob // lems that are likely to confront him . See illustration , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house stood on a high knoll that sloped down steeply to a lake of an acre and a half in extent . A stone bridge crossed a narrow stream a few yards in length , which connected this pool of water with a larger one above . In order properly to solve the problem of treating a high hill with the house on the apex and a pond below , the carriage-road was carried around a pearshaped turn in front of the house . This turn was about forty feet in its largest diameter . Branch roads started out from this main road for the convenience of reaching the back of the house and the barn and stables . The points where these branches tapped the main road were , of course , heavily planted with shrubs and trees , so as to partially conceal the presence of the minor drives and the existence of the outbuildings . The main drive wound in one long curve around the easiest contour lines of the hill , thus securing , comparatively good grades for a road traversing a steep hilly territory . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs were thrown across both sides , in order to mask the exact nature of the changes , and please by their variety and unsuspected nature . On reaching the bank of the lake the road was carried along at a sufficient distance from the water , ten or fifteen feet , to enable water-loving trees and shrubs to grow , such as willows , poplars , alders , etc . After winding along the bank four hundred or five hundred feet , ' the road finally came out on the main highway through a heavy stone gate covered with Japan ivy ( Ampelopsis tricuspidata ) and masked with groups of trees and shrubs . The road , which , after crossing the stone bridge , ran northeast along the base of the house-lot hill , was bordered inside the fence by an irregular plantation or hedge of trees and shrubs ; and up around the house were scattered large shade-trees , such as elms , maples , beeches , and lindens . The shores of the lake were further decorated here and there on prominent parts with water - loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of the lake were carefully sodded , so that the greensward dipped everywhere into the water . Standing on the road a little this side of the bridge , and looking on the still surface of the lake , one could see the whole green hill-side with the house and trees charmingly mirrored . Both ends of the stone bridge , I should have said , were masked with trees and shrubs and vines . The place just considered was about seven acres in extent and on a hill . I will now ask the reader to consider a place of similar size situated in the same region of New Jersey , which consisted of a deep hollow instead of a hill , and had no water or water views . The whole interior of this place was charmingly varied with natural groves of oak interspersed with a few pines . See illustration , p. 311 . The general character of the main part of the interior had been left untouched , except that some of the trees in the lowest part had been cut out to reveal the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out the general principle I have endeavored to impress on the reader already in this paper , that he should seek as much as possible . to increase the variety of the surface , that is , make , if anything , the hills higher and the valleys deeper . At certain points of the heavily bordering woodland two or three fine views were opened to the blue hills in the extreme distance . The entrance to this place was arranged in a somewhat peculiar fashion . It came on the extreme outside edge of the valley or bowl at a point nearest the highway . A hundred feet or so within the grounds the drive reached the house , which stood on a small level platform of made earth extending out to a sharp declivity and just allowing enough space for the house and drive and a turn around beyond it . The view from the front door was charming , and a walk winding along the exterior lines of the place revealed many beautiful spots . No planting in this case was used , except about the gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The existing attractions of valley and native plantations were greater than any that could be added , and additions would proba // ably be somehow out of harmony with the naturalness of the scene . To this end pruning , fertilizing , and the sowing of grass-seed were practised yearly . Of a similar hilly character was a place I once helped to arrange in Lenox , Mass . Its peculiarities were its smallness of size and nearness to an important highway , where ill the fashion passed by . It was only an acre in extent , but was elaborately constructed of rocks , terraces , and the most rare and choice specimen trees and shrubs that could be obtained . The land originally sloped sharply down from the street , so that the house perforce was raised upon high walls and terraces on three sides . In front the land , however , was filled up so as to be comparatively level , sloping only moderately up to the street . There were rare and beautiful evergreens , such as the varieties of silver firs , pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese maples , etc . For the sake of variety the carriage-road wound , with one or two comparatively sharp curves , a hundred feet or so along the front of the house , and so around a carriage turn made by a widening of the road , and out at the other gate . The stable stood near this gate , but was well masked with large VOL . XJ. - 32 trees and shruba . Behind the house , on the level spaces made by the terraces , was arranged a flower - garden consisting chiefly of herbaceous and annual flowering plants , set out specially for the purpose of securing plenty of flowers for gathering . This place , by means of the variety of the curves of its roads , the number of its interesting features of trees , shrubs , flowers , and greensward , and , in a word , by its possession of a great share of landscape beauty in a comparatively small space , was and remains a model of its kind . There was another country place of moderate dimensions that I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was situated near both the Harlem and the Hudson Rivers , and commanded fine distant views , and had the same high , hilly character as the place in New Jersey . See illustration , p. 313 . This place , however , though seven acres in extent , had no lake , and had a large formal vegetable garden and distant barns and stables . There were many large and fine evergreens on the place , and the main road has been led to the east door where a turn is provided . It then passes on by the house and a short distance down towCountry Place of Six Acreo on Long Island . // A Country Place of Seven Acres with Pond in the Midst of Open Country . ENGRAVED BY WITTE. // ard the barn , where another turn is secured on comparatively level ground . The space allowed by the steep slope directly in front on the other side of the house , and once used for a contracted turn , has been therefore thus abandoned . Broad lawns have been kept open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large croquet ground has been laid out , with a summer-house beyond . The barns have been all shut out with masses of foliage , and the boundary lines with irregular hedges of trees and shrubs . One peculiarity of this place was its groups made up of some single kind of shrub ; that is , you will find here a great group of weigelas , there one of spireas , and yonder one of snowballs . I do not say that any one of these groups was made up of only one kind of shrub , but that a large majority were of one kind . Merely dotting about on the lawn a great variety of trees and shrubs , one or two of a kind , is rarely comparatively level and inclined to be slightly monotonous in general effect . It was in a town , on a public street , and its width was one hundred and fifty feet and its depth four hundred and fifty . Apparently there was not much variety to be secured ; yet much was really attained . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side of the place . Notice how this arrangement gave a comparatively wide lawn on your right hand as you entered the place . Trees and shrubs , of course , shut out your view just at the gate , but in a moment a half-acre lawn opened out with a tree , or two and a background of shrubbery . A smaller lawn lay across the road to the left hand , and then about a hundred feet from the entrance the road divided right and left into two branches , which , after hugging the exterior boundaries of the place , enclosed an ample central lawn of another half acre . A Place of about Seven Acres in a New Jersey Hill Town . good lawn planting . You should have enough of a kind grouped together to properly exhibit its special mass effect . I once laid out a place in Kentucky that , I think , illustrated well what could be done on an acre or two that was On reaching the house , two hundred and fifty feet from the gate , the two winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side of the house to the stables , leaving on the way , in front of the kitchen door , an ample " N // widening for the carts of butcher and baker . Heavy plantations screened this road and its widening and allowed another open half - acre lawn , ornamented with choice single specimen trees , and backed by a portion of the same irregular hedge that surrounded the whole . There were magnolias , weeping beeches , weeping elms , red flowering horse-chestnuts and Kentucky coffee-trees . In front of the house across the road was a great wide - spreading American elm , and a little further on , bordering the drive , a rich-colored plant bed of coleus , geranium , and alternautheras . All along the drives , on either side , and about forty to fifty feet apart and ten feet back , grew fine shade - trees - the American linden , the tulip-tree , the purple beech , the liquid ambar , the Norway maple , and the white birch . Entirely around the place were planted irregular hedges of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at some agreeable view . Of yet simpler nature and more unpretentious character was a place I knew at Narraganset Pier , IR . I. Illustrated below . To remember that it was on the seashore , and was level , with sandy soil , is to bring its limitations within a small compass . The house had been originally arranged , more by accident than design , in the middle of the plot . In order , therefore , to secure comparatively wide and long open side lawns the two entrances were brought nearer together than usual , directly in front of the house , and only twentyfive feet apart . The drives then led , in a long , narrow horse-shoe shaped curve , a hundred feet to the front door . A back entrance was arranged at the extreme rear of the lot within ten feet of its limit , and by a straight road the butcher and the baker were led to an ample turn before the kitchen door . This road was well masked with shrubbery standing two or three irregular rows deep . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single Grounds of a House at a Summer Watering Place . // waving border of shrubs , with occasional shade-trees , extending around the exterior boundary of the place . A half dozen low shrubs were used near the house , such as the Japan rose , IRosa rugosa , Philadelphus aureus nanus , etc . By this arrann , enien t comparatively large lawns were secured and the greatest breadth of treatment possible under the circumstances . The grass was not very strong , but was kept green and fresh - looking by fertilizing and watering . The shrubs and trees , on account of their exposed seashore position , were the toughest and hardiest kinds , such as laurel-leaved willow , American elm , balsam poplar , honey locust , California privet , standard honeysuckle , spirea opulifolia , viburnum phcatum and V. dentatum , philadelphuses , weigelas , altheas , and hydrangea panienlata grandiflora .

Illustrated above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty feet deep and seventyfive feet in width or frontage on the street . Back from the street sixty feet stood the house , or houses , for the use of two brothers , with an open courtyard between . These houses were elegant and expensive . The rear yard , was , of course , small , but really deep enough for all practical purposes . And now let me explain the peculiarity of the treatment of the front-door yard of these two houses that made it much more attractive than most places of the kind . You will notice that if the yard , seventy-five feet wide , had been divided into two of thirty-seven and a half feet each , both would have been insignificant in size , but see the way the one common lawn was treated so as to give it the greatest possible apparent breadth and variety of effect . At three irregular points , about twenty feet apart , entrances for foot-paths were made , thereby disguising any sign of a dividing line between the two places , and giving each one a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common to both families was allowed to wind ( for all these paths wind ) . The outside paths clung close to the outer boundary , thus securing the greatest space possible for open lawns .

The turf being , after all , the most important feature of a city place , was also kept in the most exquisite order by incessant weeding and watering and by yearly fertilizing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
