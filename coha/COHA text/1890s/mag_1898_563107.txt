txt IT is a common illusion that history never repeats itself . To most persons the large events of each week seem like a revelation , the wranglings and twistings of politics are unprecedented , the blaze and passion of war are as thoroughly novel as the discovery of a new application of electricity . At a matter of fact , repetition is the rule rather than the exception . Similar conditions recur in every decade or generation , and almost the same results are produced in each instance . He knows little about our civil war who has not been interested by phases of that struggle which have recurred in recent experience , and yet it would be difficult to imagine two wars less alike superficially . Several of the old heroes have reappeared with new names and in strange surroundings . The McClellans and the Fremonts are on the way .

If dreamers and bigots could be disregarded , it would not be difficult for the liberal-minded people to argue and to come to an agreement upon a policy that would be both safe and progressive . The question is not whether we are to expand-for that is a matter of course , if we govern ourselves wisely for half a century longrr ; but it is : When , how and where can we extend our boundaries advantageously to our national welfare ? What we need now is information and rational speculation as to ways and means in relation to actual and prospective conditions . Seward was by far the best type of those who favored expansion in the ast generation . He was a man of facts as well as of imagina // 80 tion . The late Charles A.

" Some of Seward 's opinions about future territorial acquisitions were due to party consideration , but others were so prophetic as to be almost startling ; and nearly all his thoughts on the subject have a peculiar interest to us now . Fortysix years ago he said in the Senate in discussing the commerce of the Pacific : " Even the discovery of this continent and its islands , and the organization of society and government upon them , grand and important as these events have been , were but conditional , preliminary , and ancillary to the more sublime result , now in the act of consummation  --  the reunion of the two civilizations , which , having parted on the plains of Asia four thousand years ago , and having travelled ever afterward in opposite directions around the world , now meet again on the coasts and islands of the Pacific Ocean . Certainly , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred upon the earth . It will be followed by the equalization of the condition of society and the restoration of the unity of the human family . We see plainly enough why this event could not have come before , and why it has come now . A certain amount of human freedom , a certain amount of human intelligence , a certain extent of human control over the physical obstacles to such a reunion , was necessary . All the conditions have happened and occurred . Liberty has developed under improved forms of government , and science has subjected Nature in Western Europe and in America . Navigation , improved by steam , enables men to outstrip the winds , and intelligence conveyed by electricity excels in velocity the light . With these favoring circumstances there has come also a sudden abundance of gold , that largely relieves labor from its long subjection to realized capital . Sir , this movement is no delusion .

The century and a quarter has been divided into three periods of about equal length . The considerations i5irged in the different periods have had hardly any relation to one another . At first the questions were , how to establish independence through united action , and then how to give the new nation a chance to develop its resources . During about forty years prior to the civil war the interests of slavery influenced nearly every thought of // expansion and almost every problem in foreign relations . Since that war many have maintained that coaling stations and fortified harbors in different parts of the world are absolutely necessary to the proper maintenance and effectiveness of a navy . in the earliest period it was confidently expected that all the British Colonies on the continent would unite in the struggle for independence . Franklin 's plan of 1775 contemplated that Quebec , St. John 's , Nova Scotia , East and West Florida , and the Bermuda Islands could be enlisted in the cause . Persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American colonies . Adams , Franklin and others believed that without a union of all the colonies from the Gulf of Mexico northward , there could be no lasting peace . As late as 1785 John Adams wrote : " Canada and Nova Scotia must soon be ours ; there must be a war for it ; they know how it will end , but the sooner the better ; this done we shall be forever at peace ; till then , never . " But the real difficulties appeared in the opposite direction . All our rivers flowing into the Gulf passed through foreign territory . Spain then owned Florida and Louisiana . In 1800 Louisiana was ceded back to France . The interests of the settlers in the Ohio valley forbade that a European government should long command the natural entrance to this region . Most of the surviving leaders of the Revolution favored the acquisition of Louisiana territory or admitted that it was almost necessary .

There was a dispute as to whether what was known as West Florida , and held by Spain , had been re-ceded to France in 1800 and was therefore included in our purchase . The United States maintained the affirmative and made their claim good by taking possession in 1810 . Meantime a strong sentiment had developed in the South favorable to the acquisition of East Florida by whatever means might be necessary . Realizing from repeated invasions from the United States that East Florida could not be protected , Spain sold it in 1819 . There had also been a dispute about the boundary between Texas and Louisiana . Texas was vast , rich , and especially attractive to Southerners . At first the idea of getting more territory for slavery was little thought of . Henry Clay and Van Buren , as Secretaries *f State to John Quincy Adams and Jackson respectVOL .

" By the time of the Presidential campaign of 1844 nearly every one in the South was bent on adding Texas to our domain , while all the anti-slavery and most of the Whig sentiment of the North was opposed to it . The Democrats won , and annexation was said to have been ordered by the people . As it was doubtful whether two-thirds of the Senate would vote for a treaty to carry out the so-called order , Congress proceeded by joint resolution ; the President acted promptly , and the United States troops were soon ready to protect Texas . Then they moved forward to disputed territory and precipitated a war with Mexico . Our army of invasion was so overpowering that in 1848 Mexico was glad to sell California and New Mexico for $15,000,000 , rather than risk losing this sum , and still more territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treasury , stated in writing several years later , that the reason a larger portion of Mexico was not taken was because it was feared that to acquire more might prevent making slave States of even California and New Mexico . A dispute about the southern boundary of New Mexico was settled by the payment of $10,000,000 fo* a strip of about 45,000 square miles of Mexican territory . Seward had made a close study of the political forces and the tendencies of civilization on this continent , and his judgments were generally accurate . In 1853 he said : " This century has thus far exhibited two political processes , continually going on upon this continent . The first , that of general decolonization ; and the second , that of a decsy of Spanish-American power , and the aggrandizement of the United States of America . Spain ceded Louisiana to France in 1800 , and in 1803 France conveyed it to the United States .

Texas was for a time uninhabited , and seemed to promise that it would remain a barrier for New Spain or Mexico . against the United States . Becoming rapidly peopled , nevertheless , Texas asserted its independence ; and then the hopes of Mexico , for its own security and safety , rested upon the chance that // Texas might remain an independent power , or put itself under the sovereignty of some European State , which would prevent its annexation to the United States . But these expectations signally failed ; and , in 1845 , Texas came into the United States , with possessions then understood by most of us to reach only to the river Nueces . The war with Mexico , which grew chiefly out of that annexation , and out of the attending border question , resulted , as we all know , in the direct dismemberment of Mexico , and the annexation to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , together with the States of New Mexico and Upper California , by which the United States advanced to the bank of the Rio Grande , and across the continent to the shores of the Pacific Ocean . The United States , from the first , or from an early day , determined that there should be no European colonial power remaining on this continent which they could prevent or remove , and therefore they fostered a spirit of revolt in Mexico ; and when Mexico , in her revolution or after her revolution of 1821 , arrived at the point where she must definitely choose her form of government the United States recommeded to her , with success , the principles of Federal republicanism , which were adopted . " Assuming that all the States of Mexico might be soon annexed to the United States , he put these very pointed questions to those who recklessly insisted that what was likely to come some time might well come at once : " Those states can not govern themselves now ; can they govern them selves better after they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern them ? Pray , tell me how . By admitting them as equals , or by proconsular power ? If the one , you must have an army perpetually there to suppress insurrection . If the other , still you must have a standing army in the provinces , ultimately to come back and open the same disastrous drama of anarchy , civil war , desolation , and ruin at home , which the armies of Mexico have enacted there . If you bring them in as States , have you settled the question whether you are to govern them , or whether they are to exercise self-government , and so govern you ? - " These are no idle questions . They are coming upon us , and they will be here when Mexico , exhausted by Internal factions , and by resistance to your own suggestions , shall implore you to give her rest , and peace , and safety , by admitting her to your confederacy , as before long , in any event , she surely must and will do . That time is coming soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer that you want a passage across the continent by way of Tehuantepec .

Have you not more gold and silver than you can dig in a hundred years ? These dangers are real , but only real if precipitated . Time will speedily fill the regions which you already possess with a homogeneous population and homogeneous States ; yet even long before that event , so soon to arrive , shall have come , this nation will have acquired such magnitude , such consistency , such strength , such unity , such empire , that Mexico , with her one million of whites , her two millions of mixed races , and her five millions of Aztecs and other aborigines , can be received and absorbed without disturbing the national harmony , impairing the national vigor , or even checking , for a day , the national progress . " // That is , he favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our capacity for absorption . Purely sectional or political interests were in control when the acquisition of Cuba and of Canada was discussed at different times during the fifteen years prior to the civil war . It was mainly a struggle for the balance of power in the United States Senate . Some of the wisest public men since the early part of this century had believed that Cuba should be annexed at the first opportunity . Jefferson thought it desirable because it could be defended without a navy . In 1823 John Quincy Adams , as Secretary of State , declared that Porto Rico and Cuba were natural appendages to this continent , and that Cuba had become an object of transcendent importance to the commercial and political interests of our Union . He believed that it would naturally gravitate to the United States when released from Spain . Polk endeavored in vain to purchase it . After the election of Pierce the Democrats made its acquisition one of their chief aims . They tried negotiation , but when that gave no promise of success , they threatened and argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island if Spain would not sell it . In 1853 Senator Hale , of New Hampshire , called for extension northward , for a change , and moved to substitute the word " Canada " in place of " Cuba " in a resolution expressing sentiments favorable to our getting possession of that island . Seward and many other anti-slavery men would not have opposed annexations on the South if they had not felt bound to do all they could to prevent an increase in the number of slave States . The New York Senator 's most skilful tactics were barely sufficient to stem the tide on one or two occasions . Argument was avoided and ridicule and delays were introduced wherever possible . In 1859 the rivalry was between getting a vote on a homestead bill and a bill to buy Cuba . Seward made a telling epigram by saying that the question was one about lands for the landless freemen of the United States , as against one about slaves for the slaveholders of the United States . Wade called forth loud applause by condensing the idea into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggerless or lands to the landless ? " Shrewd Republican leadership and the growing excitement over domestic politics , especially in relation to affairs in Kansas and the John Brown raid upon Harper 's Ferry , prevented the Democrats from // 85 finding a way for the United States to secure the coveted island . At different times Seward showed that he expected this whole continent ultimately to become the possession of the United States . He was so confident of it that he did not wish it to be brought about hastily or by war . In 1846 he wrote to a political convention : " I want no war . I want no enlargement of territory , sooner than it would come if we were contented with a masterly inactivity . ' I abhor war , as I detest slavery . I would not give one human life for all the continent that remains to be annexed . But I can not exclude the conviction , that the popular passion for territorial aggrandizement is irresistible . Prudence , justice , cowardice , may check It for a season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American navy is hovering over Vera Cruz . An American army is at the heart of what was once Mexico . - . . Our population is destined to roll its resistless waves to the icy barriers of the north , and to encounter oriental civilization on the shores of the Pacific . The monarchs of Europe are to have norest while they have a colony remaining on this continent . France has already sold out . Spain has sold out . We shall see how long before England inclines to follow their example . It behooves us then , to qualify orselves for our mission . We must dare our destiny . " Speaking at St. Paul in the campaign of 1860 , he said : " Standing here and looking far off into the northwest , I see the Russian as he busily occupies himself in establishing seaports , and towns , and fortifications , on the verge of this continent , as the outposts of St. Petersburg , and I can say , Go on and build up your outposts all along the coast , up even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country-monuments of the civilization of the United States in the northwest . ' So I look off on Prince Rupert 's Land and Canada , and see there an ingenious , enterprising and ambitious people , occupied with bridging rivers and constructing canals , railroads and telegraphs , to organ .

' I can look southwest and see amid all the convulsions that are breaking the Spanish-American republics and in their rapid decay and dissolution , the preparatory stage for their reorganization in free , equal and self-governing members of the United States of America . " After the Republican victory of 1860 there was no longer any possibility of acquiring territory in the interests of slavery . Seward became Secretary of State , and was therefore in a position to express with more effect his ideas of territorial expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that confronted Lincoln 's administration in March , 1861 , and how procrastination and indecision were forced upon it . The radical Republicans wanted to reenforce Fort Sumter and elsewhere assert the national authority with vigor . Seward pleaded // for delay , believing that the Confederacy would soon collapse if dealt with peacefully and patiently . But the influence of the coercionists grew stronger , and by the end of March he saw that there was no longer any chance for his original policy . Just at that time it was learned that Spain had taken advantage of a revolutionary movement in the Republic of Santo Domingo and had raised her flag . It was also known that Great Britain , France and Spain were contemplating intervention in Mexico for the purpose of obtaining indemnities for past losses and perhaps to overthrow the republican government and to establish a monarchy under European protection . There was a strong suspicion that Russia was very friendly toward the Confederacy . Seward thought he saw an opportunity to escape a civil war by getting up a foreign one , between the Governments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more European powers on the other . So , on April 1 , he gave Lincoln a written outline of a policy for both foreign and domestic affairs . As to the former he said : " I would demand explanations from Spain and France categorically , at once . I would seek explanation from Great Britain and Russia , and send agents into Canada , Mexico , and Central America to raise a vigorous c*ontinental spirit of independence on this continent against European intervention , and if satisfactory explanations are not received from Spain and France , LI would convene Congress and declare war against them . " It is relevant here to assume the possibility of the consummation of this plan , and to imagine the result . If the Confederacy had forgotten its purposes and joined the continental movement , then there would have been a war in which the United States would have led the different peoples from the Isthmus to Hudson 's Bay against two or more European nations . If the forces of the Western Hemisphere had won , the United States would probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can speculate for himself as to what a grand , prosperous and stable government this mammoth confederation would , or would not , have been . Lincoln seems to have had a very decided prejudice in favor of keeping his eyes on domestic dangers , of executing the laws and of looking after the property of the United States . So he politely rejected Seward 's suggestions in lob , and ordered the preparation of expeditions for the relief of Forts Sumter and Pickens . Excepting an offer , shortly after this time , to buy Lower California of Mexico , Seward had no time or opportunity to think of // expansion until near the end of the civil war . In searching for blockade-runners and pursuing Confederate commerce-destroyers our naval officers had almost constantly lamented the lack of a harbor in the West Indies , where supplies could be kept , prizes taken and repairs made . Such a harbor would have been a great saving of time and money , and it would have been in no danger of seizure by the Confederates . So Seward looked about for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States since the war began . She owned three small islands near the eastern end of the West Indies-St . Thomas , St. John and Santa Cruz . St. Thomas was a central point for a very large portion of the commerce between North and South America , and between Europe and the ports of the Caribbean Sea . High naval authority then and since that time have pronounced it to be one of the best keys to the West Indies , and to command all of them . Admiral Porter called it " a small Gibraltar of itself , " and said that there would be no possibility of landing troops there , for the island was surrounded by reefs and breakers , and every point near which a vessel or a boat could approach was a natural fortification that could be defended with guns and a little labor . The harbor is one of the best in the We7st Indies . In January , 1866 , Seward made a careful inspection of St. Thomas and several other islands . The question was merely one of naval expediency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas 's area was only twenty-three square miles and its population was about fourteen thousand , and St. John 's size was but two square miles less and its population numbered not quite one thousand . Santa Cruz had a population of eighteen thousand and an area of seventy-four square miles . The negotiations had begun early in 1865 . After some long delays the sum of $7,500,000 was agreed upon as the price for St. Thomas and St. John . The inhabitants of St. Thomas voted almost unanimously for annexation . Denmark completed her part of the understanding , but before this had occurred the angry strife between Johnson and Congress had broken out , and Seward had become very unpopular on account of his support of the President . Moreover , an earthquake and a hurricane spread desolation over the island , just at the most unfavorable time . The project was easily ridiculed . The Senate did not even take a vote // on ratifying the treaty . Johnson 's administration expired and Grant 's was unwilling to adopt Seward 's work . Meantime the Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf of Samana for naval purposes . Later on Santo Domingo asked to be annexed to the United States . Seward endeavored to develop sentiment in favor of this . He also wished to bring Hawaii into the Union . But public attention was so much engrossed in ciomestic questions , and Congress was so ill-disposed toward the administration , that none of these aims could be realized . In one case , however , by tact and expedition , Seward was able to overcome all obstacles . In the Kansas-Nebraska debate early in 1854 he had asked : " What territories , even if we *tre able to buy or conquer them from Great Britain or Russia , will the slaveholding States suffer , much less aids us to annex , to restore the equilibrium ? " The idea of annexing Alaska was not original with him ; both Polk and Buchanan had taken some steps in that direction , but neither was very eager . After the end of the war , when Seward was thinking of national expansion , he naturally turned to Russia , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with France and Great Britain . There was no special theory as to any necessity of obtaining possession of Alaska . Its area was about nine-tenths that of the whole United States in 1783 . Its nearest point was four hundred miles , and its most remote one about five times that far , from the United States . To acquire so remote a territory was a startling change from previous practices in adding to our domain . Although it was not generally supposed that Alaska would ever be very valuable except on account of its fisheries and fur-bearing animals , it was recognized that $7,200,000 was not a large sum to pay , even if we obtained , as Seward 's detractors said , merely a land of polar bears and eternal winters . The Secretary himself was fully conscious of Alaska 's great resources . Everyone saw that there was no political risk involved . The population was sparse , and outside of a few settlements of thrifty Russians , it was entirely Indian . It was a foregone conclusion that if it increased , it would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or decreased , it could cause no serious difficulty . All are now agreed as to the wisdom of the purchase of Alaska . // Of all the truly great and patriotic statesmen of our history , Seward is among the last to be taken as an infallible guide . He had a great passion to be brilliant , original and dashing ; ordinary ideas had no charm for him . Some of his expressions in relation to expansion , if understood otherwise than as political philosophizing about a distant future , may be tinder in a time like the present . Other ideas of his are sober and may be very useful when we have to consider some new factors in the old question of national expansion.
