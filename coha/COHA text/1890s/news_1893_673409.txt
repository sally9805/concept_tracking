txt Two writers of sensational detective stories were in attendance yesterday at the murder trial of Dr. Henry C. W. Meyer to gather material for their peculiar romances , and from present indications they will be well rewarded for their trouble . A more remarkable story of crime and its ferreting out has never been told in any courtroom . A hint of what is to come was given yesterday when Assistant District Attorney opened the case for the people . He told for the first time , with all the details , the facts that the State will try to prove , and the most sensational yellowbacked novel never contained such an array of blood-curdling incidents as he paraded before the jury , which was finally secured at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon , after four days of incessant search among 700 talesmen . It had grown quite dark outside when Mr. prepared ? to proceed with the real beginning of the trial , and the great courtroom presented a most dramatic and impressive picture . Overhead a big swinging frame of gas jets threw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett , the embodiment of a dignified Justice . His iron-gray hair , and pointed , close-cropped beard , and his kindly eyes helped to make up the figure of a man who sits on the bench as an impartial Judge , with none of that bias against the defendant which so often characterizes the bench in criminal trials . Immeditely in front of the Judge the forces of the prosecution were grouped . Mr. was nearest the rail . Beside him sat District Attorney Nicoll , who will conduct the trial in person , and at his left was Assistant District Attorney Wellman , who will help along . Behind this group were the counsel for the defense , Charles W. Brooke , Dr. O'Sullivan , and Lewis S. Chanter , the young brother-in-law of Amelie Rives . Between them sat the defendant , whose personality is in itself sufficiently striking and peculiar to form the groundwork : of a weird detective story . His big , glittering gray eyes were fixed most of the time on the young lawyer who was laying at his door the circumstantial story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unparalleled . At times the gray eyes would flash indignantly , the square , haggard jaws , firmly closed at all times to repress evidences of nervousness , would grind together convulsively , and the high , white forehead would corrugate in a deep frown . Blow after blow was dealt at the prisoner by the prosecutor In his opening without eliciting any more pronounced symptom of disapproval from Meyer than this . But when Mr. said the man at the bar had been twice before tried for murder , the prisoner hissed out : " It is a lie , a dirty Ile . " " Sh ! " cautioned Dr. O'Sullivan , and Meyer quieted down again , making only one other remark afterward . This was when Mr. eIcIntyre pictured the condition of the body of the man Ludwig Brandt or Baum , whom Meyer is accused of having killed . The prosecution said a careful examination of the body had been made , and it was found to be fairly saturated with antimony and arsenic . " Why . " said Meyer with a sarcastic smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Brandt is alive and well to-day in Chicago . The statement is absurd . " Then the prisoner concentrated his attention once more on his accuser , only looking away now and then to exchange glances with his wife , who sat all day in the court , room . Almost the entire width of the room separated the couple who are jointly indicted for poisoning Brandt , but they seem to have a perfect system of communication by means of glances . Mrs. Meyer followed Mr. as closely as did her husband , and now and then , as the Assistant District Attorney would be particularly severe in his language , bringing an added , paleness to the prisoner 's sallow cheeks , she would flash over a look of consolation or of fiery indignation . Other than this the woman seemed little affected by the address . She sat unflinchingly in her seat , returning the glances of the curious who filled the courtroom with stolid indifference . Once or twice , when Mr. referred to her share in the alleged crime , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent . What the trial will yec develop to add to the sensational story already made public . Is purely guesswork , but at least two new and startling features were brought out yesterday . The most surprising was the information vouchsafed by Mr. that there is a man Beum who is still alive . The last heard of him , Mr. told the jury , he was in Jail in the City of Mexico serving a sentence for forgery . Brand t , the alleged murdered man who impersonated Baum in this city , had met Baum and Meyer in the Chicago jail . The other new development was in connection with Brandt , who , it is asserted by friends of the defense , will probably be produced alive , and will , on the witness stand , disprove conclusively that Dr. Meyer murdered him . This is probably an e x.aggera.t Ion , but there is no doubt that the defense will make an effort to prove that Brandt is alive , giving as an excuse for his non-production , the fact that he is afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attempting to swindle the insurance companies . This will be one of the severest tests of the prosecution 's case , the ability to prove that it was actually Brandt , who , as Gustave Joseph H. Baum , was buried from the flat at 320 East Thirteenth Street , where Meyer and his wife are charged with having committed their crime . To make this point clear to the jury . Mr. dwelt at great length in his opening on the first meeting of the principal characters in the alleged conspiracy . He spoke from 4:40 until nearly 7:30 . In order tnat Mr. might prepare himself for the opening , Judge Barrett adjourned court as soon as the last juror , who was found in the person of Albert W. Howes , was chosen . Until Mr. Howes 's acceptance it looked as if the jury box would not be filled at all yesterday . Two seats still remained vacant when court opened at 10:30 A. M. Shortly before recess at 1 o'clock John A. Kammerer , a cigar manufacturer at 667 Ninth Avenue , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Seat No. 11 . After him came a perfect stream of talesmen who were disqualified for one reason or another , until Mr. Howes 's name was reached . He is the publisher of a trade paper at 61 Frankfort Street , and lives in Fulton Avenue , near Pelham . Everybody drew a sigh of relief when he was accepted and sworn in , but for a moment it seemed as if the weary work of finding a jury was still to continue . Ambrose 0 . Neal . a manufacturer of steam heaters , at 218 Centre Street , is juror No. 5 . He complained to Judge Barrett that the weight of responsibility cast on him as a juror in such a serious and complicated case had already begun to weigh him down so heavily that he had been unable to sleep since he was chosen on Tuesday . His appetite had deserted him . and he was afraid that he would break down if he was forced to serve . He begged the Judge to excuse him . Judge Barrett summoned the lawyers on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion . Mr. Nicoll and Mr. Brooke united in a refusal to let Mr. Neal off , and the court ordered the case to proceed , after the short recess granted Mr. for preparation . In beginning his address , Mr. said that the insurance companies which had " hunted down this man at the bar " were entitled to the greatest praise at the hands of the public . " We will produce facts , " the prosecutor went on , " to show conclusively that this man before you deliberately and in cold blood poisoned a fellow-being . with small doses of antimony and arsenic . " Meyer , Mr. said , was regularly graduated as a homebpathic physician in Chicago in 187 &; He practiced there for eight years , and had a full knowledge of the effects of poisonous agents . Then Mr. told the story of Meyer 's alleged victim . " Ludwig Brandt came to this counttrryp eight or ten years ago , and settled in Chicago , " he said . " There he met Dr Meyer and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell completely under Meyer 's control , and the latter could do practically what he pleased with him . Brandt was a man of some intellectuality . He came of a family of distinction in Norway , but he was a black sheep , and was cast off . In Chicago he became an agent for the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Associaa tion . Meyer was the medical examiner of this association , and , because of fraudulent applications made up between Meyer and Brandt , they found themselves in the Chicago Jail together in March , 1890 . " There the conspiracy , which ended with Brandt 's murder , began . In this jail there was confined , at the same time with Meyer and Brandt , a man named Gustav Joseph Heinrich Baum . He was held on a charge of forgery . There was also in the jail one Charles Curtin , or Carl Muller , who later became August Wimmers , and whose testimony , corroborated at every point , will be presented to you . This quartet exchanged confidences . as a result of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of prison . Muller was sent to Joliet for one year , on a charge of using the malls for fraudulent purposes . Baum went to the same place for a year for forgery . Meyer and Brandt were discharged in April , 1890 . " In parting , Meyer told Muller to be sure and hunt him up after he served his time . I have a scheme , ' he said , ' by which we can make fabulous slims of money . ' The defendant and his wife visited Baum repeatedly while the latter was in Joliet , in order , as we will show , to learn all about his antecedents , for use in the conspiracy - vhich was even then hatching . in June , 1890 , Muller was released . He called on Meyer in Chicago . and the latter told him that his scheme was to swindle the life insurance companies of America .. After a. number of interviews , he told Muller : ' My scheme is to insure the life of the man Brandt , who was in jail with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in Joliet . ' " Muller was doubtful of success and matters dragged along for some time , until Meyer hunted Muller up and told him he had everything fixed . He told him he had intended to use Baum , but the latter was unreliable . He had been sent to jail in Cincinnati for forgery , and afterward went to the City of Mexico , where he was again arrested and landed in prison . " Mr. then told the story of how Brandt assumed the name Baum , took out the four life insurance policies in the Mutual , New-York , Etna , and Washington companies , and came to New-York with Muller . Dr. Meyer and Mrs. Meyer followed a week later , the latter assuming the name of Mrs. Emilia Baum . " This man , " exclaimed Mr. , striding up to the prisoner and shaking his hand at him , " married his own wife to Brandt to further the conspiracy . " Meyer met the speaker 's look defiantly , and Mr. turned to the jury again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 320 East Thirteenth Street , and came down to the time when Brandt , after hesitating for a long time , consented to take some croton oil to make himself sick enough to consult a doctor . " This oil . " Mr. Mclntye said , " was obtained on a prescription written by Dr. Meyer which we will produce . He got the man on his back . and then he began the process of poisoning him with antimony . Brandt trusted Meyer implicitly . The wretched man got weaker and weaker . Muller himself got alarmed finally . He asked Meyer whether he was going to kill Brandt instead of merely making him sick , and then receiving a dead body to substitute for Brandt , who was to be spirited away . " Muller noticed that Meyer gave Brandt anything to eat that the latter wanted He also noticed that every time Meyer gave his victim food he sprinkled it with some substance he took out of a vial . Finally Muller said to the doctor : ' What are you going to do with this man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him antimony , was the reply . " Then Mr. told the story already published of the final poisoning , when Meyer , it is alleged , gave Brandt three capsules filled with arsenic , which he bought in Jersey City . He also related the details of the hunt after the Meyers after they had collected two of the insurance policies . At the close of the address the jury was dismissed until 10:30 to-day , when the man Wimmers , or Muller , will be put on the stand as the first witness for the State .
