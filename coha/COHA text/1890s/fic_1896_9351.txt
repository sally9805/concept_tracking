Ochre goes to table . ) Who has been meddling with these bottles ? Be careful of those liquids , they are dangerous . ( Pete becomes restless . ) Never handle those bottles . Jasper . Jasper White I did n't drink any of it . ( Ochre turns and sees Pete 's face . ) Ochre . Mr. Yellow Ochre What on earth ails that picture ? Jasper . Jasper White I 've been touching it up . Ochre . Mr. Yellow Ochre You 've ruined it . Did you get any of the paint on your hands ? if you did Heaven help you ; that paint eats into the flesh , and in ten minutes the person dies . ( Pete groans . ) And that bottle is a solution of nitric and sulphuric acids  --  rank and deadly poisons . ( Pete rolls out from behind portrait shouting " Murder !
