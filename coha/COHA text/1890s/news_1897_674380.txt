txt From old and new readers have lately come many letters laden with praise of Tan TIMES . They bear gratifying testimony of the appreciation with which the efforts of its conductors to ? produce a newspaper acceptable to intelligent men and *omen have been rewarded . The Sunday Magazine Supplement of THE TIMES has met with much favor , which is reflected in a rather surprising increase in sales . That part of the community which enjoys text and pictures better when they reach a. reasonable standard of excellence has evidently found the Magazine Supplement an agreeable addition to the Sunday issue of the paper . The Saturday Book and Art Supplement has also found a place In the esteem of our readers , if we may judge by the expressions that reach us . But while it is a pleasure to know that these special features of the paper are admired , the evidence we have received that this community appreciates and demands a newspaper that is full of news and interesting yet clean is gratifying in the extreme . A practical method of expressing appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers has recently chosen is worth laying before the friends of the paper . They may think it of good example . A subscriber in another city , . finding Tan Tams a very satisfactory newspaper , was moved to commend its virtues to his friends , with such good results that one day he sent to this office a check covering the price of fifty annual subscriptions to THE TIMES . This is praise indeed . This is appreciation and encouragement . It is more effective than lamentation over the de , basement of the newspaper press , as manifested in certain conspicuous examples .
