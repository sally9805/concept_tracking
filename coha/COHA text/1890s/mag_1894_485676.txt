THIRTY-FIVE years ago , shortly after midnight in the morning of August 23 , 1927 , " the good shoemaker " and " the poor fish peddler " ? Nicola ? Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti ? went to their deaths in Massachusetts ' , electric chair in an execution that shocked the conscience of the civilized world . It is a tribute to the enormity of the deed that it gradually brought the electric chair in Massachusetts into virtual , disuse and that even today , more than a third of a century later , it still retains the power sharply to divide in bitter controversy those moved by the tragedy of colossal injustice and those unable to conceive that authority ever could have been so blind , so wrong , so utterly perverted . This clash between the conservative who clings to the sanctity of institutions and the liberal who clings to the sanctity of man is almost certain to be revived and stimulated to higher tempo by a new book by Francis Russell , Tragedy in Dedham : The Story of the Sacco-Vanzetti Case , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambivalence . Here one finds , if not quite all , then nearly all , of the reasons for the deep-seated belief held by so many . that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent ; and here one finds also Russell 's bland pronouncement that , had he been on the jury , he probably would have voted for their conviction . Here one finds Russell proclaiming that , from his own experience on a Dedham jury , he knew ? one thing ? he would never have trusted the opinions of experts who usually testify for the side that pays them ; and here one finds him relying in the end on the ? opinion of ballistics experts , whose partiality for the police had already been revealed , for his final split concluSion ? Sacco was guilty , Vanzetti was not . THE RUSSELL verdict is the laSt in ' a chain that , in recent months , has reappraised the Sacco-Vanzetti case from predominantly conservative viewpoints . The first of these late apologias for'the officials and institutions of Massachusetts appeared in 1960 in Sacco-Vanzetti : ' The ' Murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-long Boston corporation lawyer , who concluded that , of all great lies , " the Sacco-Vanzetti Myth is the greatest lie of all . " William F. Buckley , Jr , , of the Notional Review , taking the Montgomery book for his bible , promptly proclaimed in an article in the AMerican Legion Magazine that the trial had been fair and Sacco and Vanzetti Th , f . N.A.TiorT were guilty . In a , modification of this theme , James Grossman reasoned in . a January , 1962 , article in Com- ry that Sacco was guilty , Vanzetti innocent . Now Francis RUssell , fortified by new ballistics tests performed with the .32 caliber Colt foun ? on Sacco when he was arrested , reaches the same conclusion which he qualifies only to this extent : he is certain the Sacco gun was one of two used in the . brutal South Braintree holdup-murder , and if Sacco himself was n't there , he must at least have known who was . Such new assessments make it obvious that , after thirty-five years , the Sacco-Vanzetti case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , it poses now . Were two utterly innocent men executed because a conservative society condemned them for their radical beliefs ? Was justice twisted and perverted by those charged with its administration not because of what Sacco and Van-'ietti had done , . but because their beliefs made it seem that they were the kind of men who could have doneit and so they must have ? To ask such questions is to stir the old doubts and generate a compulsion , even at this late date , to hunt for the answers . THE Sacco-Vanzetti case can not be understood unless its basis is understood . It was not , as ' much Communist-inspired propaganda pictured it , a deliberate plot concocted by a capitalistic society to get rid of two dangerous immigrant anarchists . On the contrary , when it all started , the capitalistic society of Massachusetts was not even aware that ' two Men named Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were in existence . The entire Sacco-Vanzetti case Was a sheer accident of idea and circumstance , born in the brain of one man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first plank in the platform of what became Stewart 's theory re- ' suited ? from an abortive holdup . On December 24 , 1919 , four gunmen tried to ambush a payroll delivery truck in , Bridgewater . It was an amateurish , bungled attempt . The driver managed to jerk the ? payroll December 22 , 1962 truck across the streetcar tracks ; a convenient trolley intervened between truck and bandits ; and the three highwaymen , who had been blazing away at the truck from the street , leaped back into their dark touring car and escaped . They left behind them two , tenuous clues : their shotgun-firing leader was , a man with a dark mustache ; the license plates on the holdup car ( the number had been jotted down by an eyewitness ) had been stolen from Hassam 's garage in Needham. : Chief Stewart was still following the vague trail of the Bridgewater holdup when , in the middle of his cogitations , on April , 15 , 1920 , a far more heinous crime took place in South Braintree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already dedicated to the theory that the car used in Bridgewater was , a ' stolen Needham Buick , though two witnesses had identified it positively as a Hudson ) gunned down the paymaster and guard who had been carrying ' a ' $15,776.51 payroll to the Slater &; Morrill shoe factory in ' South Braintree . The holdup killers , shooting up the town and spreading tack 's on the road behind them to hinder pursuit , made , good their escape . As chance would have it , the South Braintree crime occurred at the precise moment when Chief Stewart , Pinkerton ? agents and immigration ' inspectors were turning up some curious angles that , Chief Stewart felt , might be related to the Bridgewater holdup - attempt . The Pinkertons had located an improbable witness who claimed to have invented a crime machine . One look into this unlikely gadget , according to , the inventor , would tell you just who committed any given crime . The Pinkertons , skeptical people , were n't very interested , in the crime machine , but they were decidedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up in the Italian , community . AcCOrding to this , the men involved in the Bridgewater holdup attempt had been Italian anarchists who had been living in a shack near , the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy . ) IN THE ' climate of the times , it was simple to picture anarchists as the authors of any and all crimes . U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer had launched his infamous Red raids , snaring in his indiscriminate dragnet all kinds of innocent bystanders . The anarchists had responded with widespread bombings of officials ' homes , and deportations of radicals were an almost daily occurrence . It was a frenzy in which Chief Stewart himself had participated . He had assisted the Immigration Service in ' arresting six Italians charged with spreading literature advocating the overthrow of the government . One of them had been a man named Ferruccio Coacci . Coacci had been employed in the Slater &; Morrill plant in South Braintree , but after he was released on bail to await deportation , he had quit his job . He was to ' have ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , 1920 ? the day of the South Braintree holdup-murders ? but he did not - show up . He later telephoned - immigration agents that his wife had been ill and he had stayed home to take care of her . Immigration contacted Chief Stewart , and the chief sent one of his men with an immigration inspector to an address in West Bridgewater where Coacci was living . NOW OCCURRED the series ' of events that triggered Chief Stewart 's suspicions . The Coacci family formerly lived in Quincy and had moved ' only relatively recently , , , to West Bridgewater , occupying space in a house rented by another Italian , Mike Boda . Mysteriously , when the immigration inspector and Chief Stewart 's patrolman called , it-became apparent that Coacci 's wife had ' not been so critically ill as to necessitate his absence in Boston on April , 15 . When the immigration official offered to have the deportation ' postponed for a week , Coacci would n't hear of it . He was packed and ready . to go ; he wanted , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see his sick father ; and he left with the immigration man , his wife and children crying on the doorstep ' behind him . In the moment that ' Chief Stewart learned from his deputy ' of this strange conduc't , the Stewart ' theory was born . " Something hit me , " he himself said in a 1952 interview . " The dates involved , the 15th deadline for , Coac-443 ci 's bond , the holdup and the phony illness . " ? Suspicion , so swiftly born , soon was fortified . The getaway Buick used in the South Braintree crime was found abandoned in a woods only about two miles from the house where Boda and Coacci lived . Its motor number showed that it was the Buick that had been stolen in Needham in November ? the car , Chief Stewart already was convinced , that had been used in the Bridgewater fiasco . The license plates it had carried in South Braintree had also been stolen in Needham , just as had the plates used on the car in the Bridgewater holdup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bridgewater and South Braintree holdups had been the work of the same gang ? and that Coacci probably had had a hand in , both . Unfortunately , Coacci was on the high seas , butBoda ' was still in West Bridgewater , still available , and Chief Stewart began to visit and question him . Not welcoming these attentions , Boda , skipped . But he left behind him a link : an old Overland car badly in need of repair . Chief Stewart , figuring that ' Bob . would return for the car , arranged with the garage man to tip him off . It'was a plan that was to produce two suspects of whom. , at the time , Chief Stewart had n't even heard . On the night of May 5 , 1920 , Bob . called for his Overland . He was riding in the side seat of a motorcycle driven by one Ricardo Orciani ; and , hovering in the background , were two mysterious , foreign-looking g strangers . The garage man stalled about turn- inb g over the car to Boda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orciani drove off into the night . The two mysterious ' ' Strangers simply walked away , ? crossed a railroad bridge and boarded a trolley . Chief Stewart , alerted by a telephone call , had them picked up . They were Sacco and Vanzetti . II NOW began the torturing of evidence ' to fit the requirements of theory . There had been five men in the South Braintree payroll murders ; and Stewart now had five suspects . 444 ? ? . Coacci , Boda , Orciani , Sacco. and Vanzetti . The Stewart theory was based on the proposition that the same five men had been involved at both Bridgewater and South Braintree , and authorities now set out to prove the validity of this idea . Sacco and Vanzetti , when arrested , were both armed , Sacco with a .32 caliber Colt , Vanzetti  --  with a .38 Har , rington &; Richardson . Sacco 's Colt had eight cartridges in the clip , one in the chamber ; in his pocket were twenty-three loose cartridges of various makes . Vanzetti 's gun was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells . ? Admittedly , in their first questioning , Sacco and Vanzetti both lied . Vanzetti insisted they had gone to Bridgewater on the night of their arrest to visit a friend whom he could identify only as " Poppy " and whose right name and address he admitted he did not know . Both Vanzetti and Sacco denied knowing Boda and Coacci ; Sacco denied knowing anything about a motorcycle ; he tried to explain the revolver in his waistband and the extra shells by saying he had thought he would have some fun with friends shooting at targets in the woods . The prosecution later was to build a cornerstone of its case on the contention that these transparent lies showed a " consciousness of guilt " when all they may really have shown was a consciousness of fear . The Red raids against anarchists were still going on . Only two days before the arrest of Sacco and - Vanzetti , an anarchist acquaintance , Andrea Salsedo , had plunged to his death from the window of the Department of Justice 's offices in New York where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contend that , as a result of Salsedo 's death and the unrelenting drive against anarchists ; they ' had been advised to collect and hide or destroy all incriminating radical ' literature possessed by themselves and their friends . It was for this purpose ; they said , that they had wanted Boda 's car , and they had lied when first questioned because they thought the police were persecuting them as anarchists and they did not want to involve their , friends . It is an , explanation at least as plausible as the state 's , . , ? , ? . dedication to " consciousness of guilt . " Convincing . as this Stewart theory Might sound in the abstract , - it ' - 6- gan encounter , , difficulties . almost the , : instant it , was spot-checked ' agairiSt ' fact . ' One of the , first and most significant of these conflicts involved the ; role of Orciani . The mo- ' , ? orcycle driver was . picked- ? up on , May 6i , 1920 , the ' day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified him as one of the holdup men at both Bridgewater and South Braintree , , and in ' Stewart 's - theory ' he was a key figure . Stewart has since , insisted ( as the prosecution , indeed , implied , at one Point , during the Sacco-Vanzetti that , Orciani was one of the gunmen who shOt doWn the South Braintree . ' guard , Alessandro , Berar-delli ; ' that he , snatched Berardelli 's gull ; a Harrington &; Richardson ; and that this ? , indeed , was the very , gun , found in Vanzetti 's pocket whenhe was arres ? ted ! ? IN THIS reconstruction of the crime , ' Orciani : Was certainly a pivotal figure , and ' so it is instructive to see : just what ' happened to him . arrested an May .6 , be , was freed on May 12 . Why ? Because the time card in. the small , foundry where he Worked , gave hini a , perfect double alibi ; it showed that he had been laboring at his regular job ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1920 , the dates of the Bridgewater and South , Braintree holdtips . ? ? Here , ' then , , at the very outset , a warhing ' ? lag ; was raised against ' the validity " of the . Stewart theory . With-Out Orciani , the theory could account for only four-men where - there bad to be five ; arid if Orciani , so vital figurein , Stewart 's calculatiOns , could bY ' ' a ' time ' caid diSprOve ' those calculations , then logic clearly says the rest of the case ? Of which he ? ? Was such . an integral . part . ' Was infinitely suspect . But once the , law embraces a theory and stakes its - reputatien Updn it , logic ' 1 ) 0 longer , operates ; rationalization takesoVer to sanctify what , danpot:otherWise be justified . ? Chief Stewart had the perfect rationalization , one , to which . he has clung ever since . Someone , he theorized ; " must have " punched the time Clock for : . , Orciani to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! t , ? . ? rhe NATION on o i . one day , but on two . It is a theory that Francis Russell seems to embrace in f otp , , - yet it is a theory that flies ? in , the face of reason . Anyone who-knows how hard police can work to substantiate a hot theory and vindicate their own brilliance knows full well that n6 effort would have been spared in combing the Norwood foundry where'Orciani worked to find his alleged accomplice and break down his alibi . And , indeed , the fact is that just such an effort was made  --  and it failed . Tom O'Connor , the short and chunky dynamo of a newspaper man who , first discOvered the manner in which Stewart had built his theoretical case ( See " New Light on an Old Story , " The Nation , Sept. 22 , 1926 ) , recalls the police effort well . The foundry in which Orciani worked was a relatively small one O'Connor says . It probably em , ? ployed something like twenty to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ? owners and OrDecemlier 24- ' 1962. ciani 's boss trying to prove that someone had given Orciani a time-card alibi . ' But they could n't do it . It would have been almost impossible in a small place like that , anyhow ; a man . would be missed . It 's not like a , ? shipyard with thousands on the payroll , where ' nobody would know the difference . But the Police tried so hard to prov , e their theory ' the worlcers finally got up in arms . I remember on one occasion ? I forget at just what stage of the ' case it was ? the workers threatened to leave their jobs en masse and picket in suppoft of Orciani . Can ' you imagine an entire factory doing this for an ' Italian immigrant if he was guilty ? : ? Official imaginations , once committed , proved equal to the task . The freeing of Orciani , , leaving a gaping hole in the Stewart version of events , did ' not shake faith in the overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ; , holdup man who , had . run out into the street , and fired , : both barrel 's Of a shotgun at the Bridgewater payroll truck . And , so Vanzetti went on trial in ' Plymouth . ? ? NOT UNTIL long years afterward , almost on the eve of the executions , did the indefatigable Tom O'Connor make a momentous discovery  --  one that virtually destroyed the credibility of eyewitnesses in the entire Sacco-Vanzetti case . The journalist learned that the Pinkertons had been active in the investigation from the beginning , and following , this trail he turned up original reports from Pinkerton agents about which prose7. cuting officials had been discreetly silent . One glance at these reports showed the reason for the reticence : the original recollections of eyewitnesses immediately after ? the event had little in common with the recoIlections they produced for the prosecution on the witness stand . One witness , who had said originally he " did not get , much of a look " and could n't describe the ; shotgun=. bandit 's face , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. Several others . originally had described the distinguishing feature of the shotgun-sharpshooter 's face ' as a black " close-cropped " ' mustache . Now there was nothing close-cropped about : Vanzetti 's mustache ; it was probably one of the most , luxuriant exhibits of its kind ever grown , and ' it drooped well down to the corners of his lips . And , so , in the court - testimony , a new word crept into the witnesses ' : lexicon . It is amazing how , so many witnesses bit on the same word ? " trimmed . " The mustache , they all said , looked as if - it might have been trimmed . Might have been ! No one , at any time ever produced any evidence that Vanzetti had ever indulged in such trimming , but ' in this case , ' against these anarchistic , radical foreigners , suggestion easily supplanted evidence . Vanzetti did not take the stand in his Own- defense at Plymouth ; relying entirely on alibi witnesses . These are usually as suspect and worthless as eyewitnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive , checkable point of reference . Vanzetti 's Was such a case . On December 24 , from long custom , ' Italian 445 immigrants dined on . eels , ' and so this day was a. big business day for : fish- , peddler Vanzetti , On the hour and day . Of : the Bridgewater- holdup ; indeed , . Vanzetti had such a demand for , eels that : he engaged his landlady 's thirteen-year-old son , Beltran-do Brini , to help him make deliveries on the streets of PlythOtith . Brini testified for . Vanzetti ; and even ' today , more - than forty years after the event , in , an interview with Francis Russell , he . appears utterly honest and conyiricing. ; , Documentary evidence , later ' discovered , ale() supports Brini in establishing that Vanzetti . ? not could not possibly have , been in , Bridgewater . Shortly before the executions , pompous Cadillac-dealer and Governor , Alvan T. Fuller sneered : in disbelief . at the Vanzetti alibi , - re- marking that the defense had not produced : one shred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators scoured , the BOston docks ; and finally , among the fiSh dealers with whom Vanzetti dealt , they , found one whose : records disclosed a shipment of eels to Vanzetti-7-a shipment that , in time , coincided-perfectly with Vanzetti 'S need to ' satisfy the traditional wants of his Italian clientele on December 24 . FROM these post-trial disclosures ; there ' can . be , n6 doubt of Vanzetti 's innocence in connection with the Bridgeivater case . The implications of this are devastating . For the Stewart theory , the whole basis of the prosecution , was founded on ' the ' idea that the BridgeWater and South ' Braintree-Jobs were linked and that ' the same five men ? Coacci , Boda , Orciani , Sacco and ' Vanzettiwere responsible for both . First Orciani had torn a huge gap ' in the theory ; Vanzetti , in. the Bridgewater case ; tears another. , But it is a tribute to the fanaticism with which officialdom , once cOmrnitted , acquires a vested interest in error that the theory stood as pristine in its purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Plymouth trial . His nemesis , Judge ? Webster Thayer , sentenced , him ' to twelve to fifteen years at hard , labOr . The first hurdle for the , prosecution had . been cleared . Ahead lay a second trial for , the Soutb Braintree ? murders ; ' ahead lay the path : to , the , ' electric chairs , 446 . THE TRIAL in the Dedhani ; . cOurihouse , was a replica . of ; the trial , in ' Plymouth , only on a ' vaster , more tragic'ind more prejudiced'scale . Life itself was now at stake for Sacco and Vanzetti . Reputations , too , were at stake for the officialdom of Massachusetts . In Tragedy , in Dedham , Francis Russell makes light of this final ' factor . His ; thesis is that the case , ' up to this time , had not attracted great - attention in the Massachusetts ' press ; it was not ' the binning ' issue it later became ; and , so District Attorney ' Frederick Gunn Katzmann , if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reputatiori . This is specious reasoning at best . A murder trial is ' the supreme drama of the American Courtroom . It generates its own unique atmosphere of tension . Gladiators battling for life . and death in the Roman - arena Perhaps ' created such drama , but nothing elset , The prosecution is ' asking the life I of a man ; it can not ask it unless it ' is ut- terly committed  --  it has to be right . Every spectator knows that life itself is the issue , and so every ' word every and eve witness acquires an importance ' no other words and nonther witnesses , in other circumstances , could ' ever acquire ; The air itself at vital moments becomes taut and electric , charged with passions , tense with the supremacy of the.issue ; and the ' opposing . lawyers and witnesses are prisoners of this atmosphere which makes the trial , while it lasts , the supreme event of their lives . In. such circumstances , they play for keeps . They play for blood . ' , To suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to have been physically ' present in the Dedham courtroom to know that a Katzmann who could have been fair and judicious , once he had cominitted himself to the contest , , is : a figment of RUssell 's : %imagination . Indeed , in his ' own honk , the evidenCe abounds . The times and the passions of the times , yohiCh Russell describes so well , rode herd upon , the verdict . Lest ' there , he any question , one has only to read the intemperate terances of the presiding judge , the deity , of the trial , ' the arbiter from whom the jury , inevitably takes many a cue : . From the opening day , it was - obvious to - observers : , in - the " courtroom that , for . Judge . WehsteriThay- , er , . Sacco and Vaniettif already ? had been , . judged - guilty : Newspapermen and fellow members of the , . bar were ... shocked by the intemperate , ? off-bench remarks he dropped while - the triallwas in progress : Even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able ; ' When a defense witness seemed to have scored a point , , the- judge - t()ok , over the questioning from the ! prosecu  --  ion , . harrying , the-unfortunate ' victim on the witness : stand with hectoring , luestions .. , , At one , point he . made a remark so prejudicial and outrageous that he- had it expunged from . the official , record and them ' demanded that newspapers , that had ! printed it , retract . Capping all , , of course ; was ' his final , famous remark after he . had ' denied defense , , motions- . for a new trial : " Did you see what -I did , with those anare.histie bastards- the , Other day ? " Such was the guardian of ? Massachusetts ; justice ; and it . is one of the most amazing-examples of bivalence in Tragedy in Dedham ? that Francis Russell , who. , repotts all these incidents , nevertheless can conclude that Thayer " made an ' effort to conduct the trial fairly " ? and can pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man nn the ' bench did not wear off O ? the jury . RUSSELL is ? eqUally , charitable toward District Attorney KatZniann , whom he describes as portipous man , but basically : an lion-est " : one . This is a verdict that , . it Would ' seem , can be reached- only by . , a . , strained definition of what constitutes , honesty . Katzmann , trying men for their lives , could put ... a . Pinkerton ' detective on the stand to ' testify ' from specially made ? " notes , " " notes , " never , closing ' the existence of those basic , original reports-that would have been so destructive to his case . Katzman , trying men for their liVeS , - ; could frame a . question which- . niisled judge and jury into'the belief . : that a fatal slug had been fired-from Sacco 's gun . Capt . William Proctor ; theState ; Police ballistics expert , disclosed in a post-trial affidavit that he had " repeatedly " told Katzmanri , he , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not believe the shot came from iSacco 's gun . So , Katzrnann ' had asked him-if it was , Consiaterit ' %With his ? ; Th'e ' NATION ' findings - that-  the , shot - came - from Sacco's. - gun - and , - since Sacco 's gun ? and the murder NA-reapon were  - -  both. caliber Col ts , - :Proctor. : Coul d. ? arid- : did : answer " Yes . " . But when Proctor filed his later affidavit for the ? fense ; exposing- the.fraud , ' Katzmann - Aid not ? deny it ; he denied ' only that Prottor - " repeatedly " ? ? ad ? told - him - he Aid ' not-think Sacco 's gu  --  n -- was the . ? murder ' weapon . One lias to ' ask : Is - this -- the kind . of ? man on- whom one ' bestows an ? accolade for honesty ?

Reading , it , one is struck- by the - confusions ' and -inconsistenciesof-the prosecution , by the palpable-weakness of-its-case . Against ? Vanzetti ; except for eyewitness testimony , there - was ' nothing ; ' and  --  ? against Sacco , not very much . The ? prosecution made a strehuous - effort to ? picture Vanzetti as ' the driver of- thelgetaway - Buick , only to see this thesis - shattered - on the lock of fact . First , - Vanzetti did not know - ? ' how- to drive. - Second , just ' too , many ? of the pitisecutiori 's own witnesses described the - driver as ' a pale , , thin-faced , sickly looking man  --  a descriptiOn : : that did:not fit-Vanzetti at all , but one that even Katzmann in the - ? end- had - to accept as valid . With ' Sacco ; the prosecution had somewhat better - luck because it had two specific items of ' what seemed like evidence .

But it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just two items of . factual evidence , neither of which ' could be reconciled . with the other : ' the - cap and the gun . TV THE dap which the prosecution had tried so hardto:tie to Sacco 's head , which seemed at the time of the trial such a per-Suasive bit of evidence , turned out to be the most dubious : evidence ? of all . In July , 1927 , shortly befOre the executions , Tom O'Connor solVed the mystery of the cap . He learned from ex-Chief Jeremiah-F . GalliVan , of Braintree , that the cap had been given to Gallivan two . days after the murder as one that had been found at the scene only the night before . Furthermore , that telltale tear in the back lining , of which the prosecution had made so much , had n't been there when the cap was found . Chief Gallivan had made that tear himself , he said , looking to see if there were any identifying marks on the underside of:the lining . Gallivan was convinced that the cap had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the head of some spectator ' milling around the scene afterwards , and he so testified , before , the ' Lowell Advis- , ory Coinmittee that Governor Puller had subsequently appointed . Chief Gallivan asked the committee : " Can any of you gentlemen make me believe that the hat lay there for thirty hours , with the state police , the local police and two or three thousand people there ? . . . Do you mean to tell me that that hat lay on the ground for thirty hours with the State police there looking for shells , prints and anything else they could find ? " These questions , it would seem , effectively disposed of the cap . But if more were needed , it may be found in an artist 's sketch reproduced in Russell 's book , showing Sacco trying on the cap in the courtroom . The cap perches ' on top of his head , a tight and ' apparently poor fit . And yet , aside from the cap , ' in the category of positive evidence , there ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most pbsitiYe evidence of all , arid it is one of the ironies of this tragic case that it'became the most ' ? uncertain . ' Ballistics tests identify- , a. gun .. They are held by police experts ' to ' be infallible . Each gun , the experts assert , develops its own individual rifling and imposes its own individual trade mark on the bullets ' it Mires . " About this there should be no queStion , but about this , in the case.at hand , there remain all kinds of questions . THE doubts begin with Captain Proctor . He was one of the first ? ballistics experts in the nation , making hi 's first test by shoving a bullet through the rifling of a gun . During the years , he ' had improved his technique and become the top-ranking expert in his field in Massachusetts . He knew that the fatal ' Berardelli bullet had been fired from a .32 caliber Colt like Sacco 's , but he did n't belieVe it had come from Sacco 's gun barrel . Even during the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Katzmann was trying the wrong men . And , on another occasion , he told his friend , Harry C. Attwill , Attorney General of Massachusetts , " They 've got the wrong men . " - After Captain Proctor made hi 's affidavit for the defense , it became quite the ' fashion  --  a technique Francis Russell Tadopts=to : queStion his ' : qualifications . as an expert . It became the fashion to suggest that he had " other reasons " ( and he may have had , as we shall see ) for believing in the innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti ? and that these reasons warped his pure scientific judgment . Whatever the truth of this , one of the oddest features of this case is the manner in which fate has dealt with the ballistics experts who have tried to show that the mortal bullet was fired from - Sacco 's Colt . The first of these experts to b'e deflated was Charles Van Amburgh , a firearms expert who testified positively that Sacco 's gun was the murder weapon . In 1924 ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amburgh 's qualifications were called into doubt ' in a Connecticut case . A Catholic priest had been shot through the brain on a ( Street ' in Bridgeport . A suspect was picked up . The suspect owned a gun of the same Make and caliber as the murder weapon .. Van Amburgh gave . a- positive opinion that the fatal slug , taken from , - the priest 's ' brain- had come froth the sirsPeces:Weapon . But other aspects of the case : began to : instill doubt in the ' mind , of ' Homer S. Cummings , later to become U.S Attorney General . ' Cummings , - fortified by dissenting ' reports from- six other ballistics , experts , - confronted Van Amburgh , got - him to : - - try to match the pictures ' by which he had compared- the marks on a test bullet with - those on the ? murder bullet  --  and ' demonstrated ? hat the comparison was most inexact , The suspect who , on Van Amburgh 's evidence , might have gone to the electric chair , was cleated. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddard , an expert who was one of the first to use ' a comparison microscope technique for bullet examination . Goddard entered the ' case du'r- ' ing the struggle to obtain a new trial for Sacco and Vanzetti . . He . con-eluded from his tests that the fatal Berardelli - bullet had been fired from Sacco 's gun and could " have been-fired from no other . Shortly after- ' wards , in 1927 ; Goddard was - tripped up in a Cleveland case . A-bootleggerhad ' been - murdered ; a- suspect . arrested . Cleveland , . police ' sent Goddard two of the murder-bulletS and several test bullets fired from the suspect 's gun ; Goddard ? gave ' it a  --  s his opinion that this gun had fired the fatal shot . Unfortunately , for - his ranking as an expert , the ? ' suspect subsequently proved , that he had noteven purchased . the gun until a month after the murder. : - SUCH contretemps , if they do not bring into question the entire science of ballistics , do at least - 'demonstrate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who make the tests . A com- : mitted expert - often ceases to - be ex pert . Though obviously aware of-this-.pitfall , Francis Russell decided to try to arrive at the final truth of the Sacco-Vanzetti case by arranging for a new , series , of ballistics tests with , ' Sacco 's gun . He tried , but failed , to secure an impartial expert from a national ballistics association . Finally , he selected two New Jersey experts ' : ' Jac Weller , Princeton realtor and ' - engineer , firearms consultant and honorary ' , curator , of the West Point fytuSetirrii and . Lt.-Col. , Frank W. Puy ( ILS ' . A ; , ' retired ) ; ? formerly ' in charge Of the ' firearms identifiCation , lahoratory of the-New Jersey State Police . ' Jury and Weller test-fired Sadco 's old pistol ? on October 11 , 1961 . , Subsequently , they submitted to Russell report in which they held that the mortal Berardellibullet " was fired in SaCco , , ' s . pistol and in 1i ? other : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that Russell conclticles Sacco was guilty , ' though Vanzetti was hot . FOR Russell , this new Verdict seems to ' remove all doubts , but for others there are reasons to be more skeptiCal . ' A major , reason is ' that Weller andjurY. coauthored . a revision of a standard : text , Firearms Investigatio77 , ' Identificatio7 ? avd Evidence , pUblished in. 1957 . In the preface , - they paid.personal ttibUte to Colonel Goddard , " who . generously gave us the benefit of his unique experience , " and in the . body of the text they also besto-Wed a. bouquet ; upon Van Ambingh for work that " was of great value to_the the cause of justice in the famous " .

One section of ' the : boOk , contributed-by the.MassachusettS State-Police. , contains comparison photographs of bullets designed to show that the Mortal slug , tame ; from ' , Sacco 's gun .

Speak persuasively for SacCO and Vanzetti. example , bac ' 1-1742er 1962 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' even in the atmosphere , of the trial , one might ' have thought would have spoken most persuas'ively for Sacco . Sacco , had testified that he had gone to Boston on April 15 to arrange-for his passport to Italy , and on the , train ride back he had sat across ; ? the . aisle from a man whom he s  --  diel not.know who had gotten off the train with him at Stoughton . Later , during the trial , Sacco recognized this , Man among the spectators in the courtroom . He turned out to be James Hayes , a mason and contractor ' in Stoneham and a town highway surveyor . Put on the stand , Hayes verified that he had been in Boston ' on April 15 ; he even had a time : hook , to prove . it , for , on that day , his brother had paid him $50 and he had gone into Boston to buy parts ' , for his car . He teStified , too , that he had been sitting in the train in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a man sitting across the aisle from him ; but he had n't paid any attention to the man , he had n't been aware of Sacco . His story , like many other details of the defense , has the ring of truth . To all of this , there must now be added one other vital item , ' the most important that . could be adduced  --  fingerprints . READING Russell 's - exhaustively researched book , anyone : familiar with police techniques is Struck at once by this enormous , significant , incredible gap in the prosecution 's evidence . The ' Buick getaway car , abandoned ' immediately after the South Braintree holdup , was found within two days . Since there was no testimony that any of the holdup 449 men were wearing gloves  --  in fact , there was abundant evidence to the contrafy , ? one witness even describing hOw'Sacco 's hairy hand had rested on the back of the front seatthere , ? should have been fingerprints . And ; ' if ' there had been , these should iiaTe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the murder car.:What had happened ? With the , cooperation of Torn O'Connor who , as secretary to the COrninittee for the Vindication of Sacco and Vanzetti , has devoted most of his lifetime to the case , I researched the contemporary newspaper files . These , quickly ; disclosed that finger- , , print experts had examined the Buick and , - apparently ' , had had considerable success . The ' Brockton Times of April 20 , 1920 , reported : " The car . was , bietight to the Brockton police garage in city Hall Square , from Where it was later taken to Boston ? by . the ? state officers . Photos of fingeiprints were-first-Made . " ( Italics added . ) ON THE following day , April 21 , The Brockton Times returned to the theme : It Wrote : The experts of the identification bureau , of the state police were busy today making records of the fingerprint tracings and photographs taken from the bandit auto at the Brockton police station Monday noon in an effort to learn by this system if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identity as a man known to the criminal identification ' bureaus of the country as a professional " gun " in holdup or other work . The wording ' of this paragraph would seem to indicate that several different sets of fingerprints had been obtained from the murder car . Significantly , the same news amide dis , closes that Captain Proctor himself Was at the time in overall charge of the detective Work . On April 25 , The Brockton limes was reporting that Captain Proctor and his detectives were hoping . the fingerprint . evidence would turn up some suspects . . " This work represents . one of the . keener elements of the . job of fixing the identiiy of the bandits , " the Times reported . " If fingerprints ? from the bandit car show . favorably in corn . - parison with those of any guninan 4S0 known to the ' criminal experts , a most ' valuable " - clue will have been ' obtained . " Clearly , fingerprints had been , secured in sufficient number and clarity to represent , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . Then , Out of the blue , as a result of Stewart 's theory , Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested . What happened next remains one of the most significant , yet generally ignored , aspects of the case . ' On May 6 , the day after the arrests , The Brockton Times reported that Inspector , George ' C. Chase was " at the State House " making a comparison of the fingerprints of Sacco and Vanzetti " with the fingerprint records taken off the South Braintree bandit car April 20 at the Brockton police station . " This reference , obviously , was no journalistic slip , for the following day the Times , in the last two paragraphs of a long story , spelled out the angle- involving- the comparison of fingerprints far more explicitly . It reported that a conference of officials of the district attorney 's office and high police officials had been held , and it added : Inspector George C. Chase has completed the comparisons of fingerprints taken since the arrest of the suspects and the marks obtained off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state police expert on criminal identification . Nothing is stated about the result . It is kept a close secret . . . . And it has remained a close secret ever since . From that day to this , fingerprints have never been mentioned in connection with the Sacco-Vanzetti case . In the six-volume , **30;2582;TOOLONG record of the trial and subsequent motions , there is no mention of . fingerprints . In all the books and literature on the subject , no writer appears to have been aware of this long-hushed-up matter of the fingerPrints . Francis Russell , when apprised of this gap in his account , dismissed it . " As for the matter of , the hidden firigerptint report that Mr. Cook ' makes ' so much of , " he wrote , " there isn ! t " any . The , fact is that the getaway car was ' driven and handled by , so many people before Ale , state police arrived to make fingerprint examinations that the result was negative . Any pertinent fingerprints had long since been obliterated  --  if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official version , but it simply does not square with the facts as they existed before the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti . On five different occasions , The Brockton Times made specific reference to the existence of fingerprints ; its information , obtained from police sources , indicated indeed that they represented the major hope for breaking the case . Then with the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti , " comparisons " were made  --  and , after that , silence . This has to be judged the single most important aspect of the Sacco-Vanzetti case ; for , in all its implications , it is utterly destructive of the prosecution 's thesis . Certainly , if Sacco 's and Vanzetti 's prints had been obtained from the murder car , the fingerprint evidence would have become the major , irrefutable item in the state 's arsenal of - proof . Obviously , Sacco 's and Vanzetti 's prints were not on . the ? murder car . This is negative evidence , but logic does not stop here . There had been five men in the Buick . Stewart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanzetti , but Boda and Coacci and Orciani as well , If Stewart 's theory was correct in any of its particulars , it ? is inconceivable that the fingerprints of some of those five would not have shown . HOW important this would have been to the prosecution , how gleefully the prosecution might have been expected to introduce such irrefutable , corroborative evidence may be understood only , if one un- - derstands how hard the state labored at the trial to support Stewart 's theory . At the outset , during an initial tour of the scene , the jurors were shown Coacci 's house , which was described to them as " the headquarters of the bandit gang . " During the trial , the prosecution strove desperately to spell out the links between Sacco and Vanzetti on the one hand , and Boda , Coacci- and Orciani on the other . Boda 's name is mentioned on thirty-two pages of the record , Or- ? ciani 's on eleven , Coacci 's on eight . Yet , in the end , even the state had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The NATION F.tingerprints should have , provided that proof , and the crowning hallmark ? of ' a , n ? unprincipled ? pr osectitiOn may be : ? fOund , .. in the extreme ? care the state ' took , , to avoid all ' mention of the issue . Lispector Chase ; , for arriPle ; was summoned to ' the:Witness stand . WO he asked what his ? : cOinp arison. ? ? stUdy . of the , fingerprints shoWed ? " He a was ? not . His , direct ex- , , rnination takes only a . ha page- of the record ; ? Ire was , asked only to'tell hQw Sacco and Varizetti ' were , . pboto , graphed . after : their arrest . N o questions ? were asked Chase or other police witnessds aboutthe develOpment of ' fingerprints , frcim : the . bandit : car -  - -  . the ? prints , that , as ? we learn from The .

Vanzetti , might have been obliterated : Tint it is ? hardly conceivable that the prints of all five men whom Stewart 's theory placed in the- Buick would fail to show ; nor is it conceivable that , if any of them had showed , the state would ' have refrained from introducing into evidence this vital corroborative detail to support its highly tenuous thesis . That fingerprints were never mentioned at the trial , before the Lowell Cominittee , before Governor Fuller  --  that they were buried and forgotten , never produced  --  can mean only one thing : those prints must have placed other men , men for whose presence the state could not account , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its running boards with Boda , Coacci , Orciani , Sacco and Vanzetti . ' Viewed in this perspective , the performance of Captain Proctor takes on new meaning and significance . He had been in complete charge of the investigation in its early stages . He knew about the fingerprints ; he knew what they did and , did n't dis= close . It is known that he warned Katzmina before the trial that Stewart had the wrong men , He mut-tered during the trial that Katzrnann. was trying ' the wrong men . It has Peceiiikr a , ' 1962 been generally assumed that this dissent by ; Proctor was based upon his ' skepticisin : , about the , ballistics , evidence and some vague feeling he had that a. ? profesSional underworld gang had ? pulled the South Braintree job . Unfortunately , , Proctor . died shortly after ' signing his post-trial . affidavit for the defense , : before ' he could be questioned by the Lowell Committee ; but the . discovery of the trail , of the long=suppressed fingerprints puts his couscientious demurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . captain Proctor was not just guessing about their innocence . Of a Certairity , ? he ' knew . WITH . THE conviction , the highest offiCials in , MassachuSetts achieved a vested ' interest in error . Throughout the World , ' MasSac  --  husetts and Massachusetts ' justice were being denounced , Communist agitators touched offs.angry demonstrations in front of ' American ? embassies abroad . Anarchist bombings at home menaced officials who had had any connection with the case . This , agitation , this violence , this virtual world-wide frenzy , forced the officialdoin of Massachusetts , like a turtle , into its hardened protective shell . Officialdom now , could not afford any frank acknowledgment of error ; it had to justify itself , it had to be right . And so Sacco and Vanzetti had to die . Admittedly , they were two quite different men : Sacco , more of . a peasant type , a man who had to work with his hands , a man more limited in intelligence than Vanzetti and the more , radical anarchist ( his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing of Attorney General Palmer 's home in Washington ) ; Vanzetti , the intellectual , the philoSopher , a poor fish peddler touched with genius and possessing , even in the unfamiliar English tongue , a poet 's feeling for the sheer cadence and beauty and meaning of words . Facing extinction for a critne , he had not .. committed , , he could express himself to ' Phil Stong , a visiting reporter , in word 's that have been compared for their eloquence the Gettysburg Address : If it had not been for this thing , ItijOt ' have live , out my life talking at street corners to scorning men .. I might have die , unmarked , unknown , a failure . Now we are not a failure . This is our career and our triumph . Never in our full life can we hope  --  to do such work for tolerance , for joos- , tice , for man 's onderstanding of man , as now we do by an accident . Our words  --  our lives  --  our pains  --  nothing ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoemaker and a poor fish peddler ? all ! That last moment belong to us ' that agony is our triumph . Francis Russell comments that even this final and ' hideous triumph was a delusion ; that ' Sacco and Vanzetti died believing that their ? artyrdom would further the cause of anarchism , a faith that is now utterly dead : In this he sees the final futility of their tragedy ; , but this , ' again , is not the whole story . For Vanzetti was not so far wrong when he envisioned that final moment of a ' hideous death as a force that would work " for tolerance , for joostice , . for man 's onderstanding of man . " Shortly after the executions that so shocked the world , the Massachusetts Council for the Abolition of the Death Penalty was formed . A prime mover in its organization was Mrs. Herbert H. Ehrmann , wife Of the assistant counsel for Sacco and Vanzetti , and the original support ' came from many conscientious citizens whose sense of justice had been outraged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched has gathered force in Massachusetts . On two occasions the Legislature actually passed bills softening the provisions of the first-degree murder statute , but the measures died on the Governor 's desk . What the council has not been quite able to accomplish by legislation , however ; it has virtually accomplished in practice by the force ' ? of public opinion . Executions in Massachusetts , as a result of its forceful campaigning , have diminished gradually in number ; and , since 1947 , the death penalty has not been invoked  --  the electric chair has sat silent and unused . It is no trifling legacy to have been left by " the good shoemaker " and " the poor fish peddler " who died " for tolerance , for joostice , for man 's ? onderstanding of man .
