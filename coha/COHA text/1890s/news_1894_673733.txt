txt We invite the attention of the hopeful members of the Hyde Association in Lockport and elsewhere , who have recently been informed that they " are in a fair way to obtain possession of the Hyde estate of $350,000,000 , " to the action of an English court in the case of James F. Jacques and Howell Thomas . Jacques was the American agent in London of certain persons in this country who believed they could establish their title to what was called the Townley , or Lawrence-Townley , estate . Considerable sums were contributed in this State , in Indiana , and in other States to the fund , which was to be used by Jacques in establishing the claims of the " heirs , " and it appears that this agent received in all more than $75,000 . He employed , or conspired with , an English solicitor named Howell Thomas , who succeeded in taking from Jacques the greater part of the fund . These two worthies having quarreled , their differences were taken into the courts , where the rascally character of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer , found guilty , and sentenced to penal servitude for five years . The prosecutors then found it to be their duty to proceed against Jacques , and both Jacques and Thomas were prosecuted last week upon the charge that they had obtained money fraudulently from persons in this country , who were led to believe that they were entitled to the Townley or Lawrence-Townley estate , the value of which has sometimes been represented to be $300,000,000 or $600 , - 000,000 , or even $800,000,000 . Each of the defendants was found guilty , and sentenced to be imprisoned at hard labor for one year and eight months . On the bench was Justice Hawkins , who remarked that the prisoners had been engaged in a vile conspiracy , and that he would add a heavy fine to the sentence of Jacques , if the latter had any money with which to pay it . Testimony in this trial was furnished by defrauded Americans , who went to London in order that they might procure the punishment of the scoundrel who had deceived and robbed them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only expectant and deluded " heirs " in this country who need to be enlightened by such proceedings as these in London , by the trial and conviction of the Rev. George William Burgoyne Howard , in Tennessee , and by other proofs of the fraudulent and illusory nature of the " foreign estate industry , " which-have repeatedly been published in these columns . Even in this city there are associations of otherwise intelligent persons who are still dece , ived by tales about these " estates , " which are situated in the moon and in no other place .
