CHEERFUL YESTERDAYS . IV . THE REARING OF A REFORMER . SOME years before the time when I entered the Harvard Divinity School , it had been described by the Rev. Dr. J. G. Paifrey , then its dean , as being made up of mystics , skeptics , and dyspeptics . This , being interpreted , really meant that the young men there assembled were launched on that wave of liberal thought which , under Emerson and Parker , was rapidly submerging the old landmarks . For myself , I was wholly given over to the newer phase of thought , and after a year of unchartered freedom was ready to concentrate my reading a little and follow the few appointed lines of study which the school then required . The teachers were men quite worth knowing ; and Dr. Convers Francis , especially , had a noted library and as dangerous a love of miscellaneous reading as my own . Accordingly , during the first year I kept up that perilous habit , and at the end of this time stayed out of school for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . There had just been a large access of books to the college library , and from that and the Francis collection I had a full supply . I read Comte and Fourier , Strauss 's Life of Jesus ( a French translation ) , and bought by economy a fine folio copy of Cudworth 's Intellectual System , on which I used to browse at all odd hours , keeping it open on a standing desk . I read Mill 's Logic , Whewell 's Inductive Sciences , Landor 's Gebir and Imaginary Conversations . Maria Lowell lent me also Landor 's Pentameron , a book with exquisite passages ; Alford 's poems , then new , and , as she said , " valuable for their simplicity ; and the fiery German verses of Hoffmann von Fallersleben , some of which I trans hated , as was also the case with poems from RUckert and Freiligrath , besides making a beginning with the Swedish poem Frithiof 's Saga , which Longfellow admired , and one of Fredrika Bremer ' s novels . I returned to Homer and Dante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin 's French translation , there being then no good English version . Some verses were contributed by me to The Harbinger , published at Brook Farm . My first poem , suggested by the fine copy of the Sistine Madonna which had been my housemate at Brookline , had , however , been printed in The Present , a short-lived magazine edited by my cousin , William Henry Channing ; being afterward , to my great delight , reprinted by Professor Longfellow in his Estray . My first prose , also , had appeared in The Present ,  --  an enthusiastic review of Mrs. Child 's Letters from New York , then eagerly read by us young Transcendentalists . I dipped ardently , about that time , into the easier aspects of German philosophy , reading Fichte 's Bestimmung des Menschen ( Destiny of Man ) with delight , and Schelhing 's Vorlesungen Uber die Methode des Akademische Studiunis ( Lectures on Academical Study ) . The influence of these authors was also felt through Coleridge 's Literary Remains , of which I was very fond , and in Vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician . A more perilous bool* was De Quincey 's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater , which ( loubtless created more of such slaves than it liberated : I myself was led to try some guarded experiments in that direction , which had happily no effect , and I was glad to abandon them . It seems , in looking back , a curious escapade jor one who had a natural dislike for all stimulants and narcotics and had felt no temptation of that // kind ; I probably indulged the hope of securing a livelier imagination . I rarely went to any house in Cambridge , except sometimes to Lowell 's , where his sweet wife now presided over the upper story of his father 's large house . She kept things as orderly as she could ; always cruising like Admiral Van Tromp , Lowell declared , with a broom at her mast-head . She had fitted the rooms with pretty devices of her own , and rocked her baby in a cradle of her planning , made of a barrel cut lengthways , placed on rockers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spears as the Lowell crest and three lilies as her own , with the motto " Puritas Potestas . " This cradle was for their first child , whose early death both Lowell and Longfellow mourned in song . The Lowells sometimes saw company in a modest way , and I remember spending an evening there with Ole Bull and John Weiss . Dr. Lowell , the father , was yet living , always beneficent and attractive ; he still sometimes preached in the college chapel , and won all undergraduate hearts by providing only fifteen-minute sermons . It was after this that he fell into a melancholy condition , described with thrilling power by his son in a poem , The Darkened Mind , - an experience which , with the subsequent deaths of the poet 's wife and children , saddened and repressed for years his naturally buoyant and exuberant nature . If I belonged in the first two categories of Dr. Palfrey 's classification of the Divinity School , I happily kept clear of the third , never having been a dyspeptic , though I lived literally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for purposes of necessary econ*omy and the buying of books . I kept up habits of active exercise , played football and baseball , and swam in the river in summer . There was then an attention paid to the art of swimming such as is not now observable ; the college maintained large bath-houses where now are coal-yards , and we used to jump or dive from the roofs , perhaps twenty feet high ; we had a Danish student , named Stallknecht , who could swim a third of the way across the river under water , and we vainly tried to emulate him . In winter there was skating on Fresh Pond . I must not forget to add that at all seasons I took long walks with Edward Tuckerman , then the most interesting man about Cambridge , leading a life which seemed to us like that of an Oxford don , and already at work on his Latin treatise on lichens . His room was a delightful place to visit , - a large chamber in a rambling old house , with three separate reading-tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleridge , and one for the Greek drama . He was the simplest-hearted of men , shy , short-sighted , and lovable ; the tragedy of whose life was that his cruel father had sent him to Bowdoin College instead of to Harvard , - a loss he made up by staying years at the latter , graduating successively at the Law School and the Divinity School , and finally taking his degree in the undergraduate department at what seemed to us a ripe old age . Another tonic in the way of cultured companionship was that of Elliot Cabot , fresh from a German university , - then a rare experience , - he being , however , most un-German in clearness and terseness . I remember that when I complained to him of not understanding Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason in English , he answered tranquilly that he could not ; that having read it twice in German he had thought he comprehended it , but that Meikeljohn 's translation was beyond making out . These men were not in the Divinity School , but I met their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravitated then as naturally to the Divinity School as now to the Law School ; even though , like myself , they passed to other pursuits afterward . I met there such men as Thomas Hill , afterward President of Harvard ; Octavius Frothingham ; William R. Alger ; // Samuel Longfellow and Samuel Johnson , who compiled at Divinity Hall their collection of hymns , - a volume called modestly A Book of Hymns , and more profanely named from its editors ' familiar names " The Sam Book . " Longfellow was one of the born saints , but with a breadth and manliness not always to be found in that class ; he was also a genuine poet , like his elder brother , whose biographer he afterward became . Johnson , a man of brilliant gifts and much personal charm , is now best known by his later work on Oriental Religions . It is a curious fact that many of their youthful hymns as well as some of my own , appearing originally in this heterodox work , have long since found their way into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant men in the Divinity School were afterward , like myself , in military service during the Civil War . One of them was James Richardson , whom Frothingham described later as " a brilliant wreath of fire-mist , which seemed every moment to be on the point of becoming a star , but never did . " He enlisted as a private soldier and died in hospital , where he had been detailed as nurse . The other had been educated at West Point , and had served in the Florida Indian wars ; he was strikingly handsome and mercilessly opinionated ; he commanded the first regiment of heavy artillery raised in Massachusetts , did much for the defense of Washington in the early days of the Civil War , and resigned his commission when Governor Andrew refused to see justice done - as he thought - to one of his subordinates . But all these companionships were wholly secondary to one which was for me most memorable , and brought joy for a few years and sorrow for many . Going through the doors of Divinity Hall I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed like a picturesque Oriental ; slender , keen-eyed , raven-haired , he arrested the eye and the heart like some fascinating girl . This was William Huribert ( originally Hurlbut ) , afterward the hero of successive novels , - Kingsley 's Two Years Ago , Winthrop 's Cecil Dreeme , and my own Malbone , - as well as of actual events stranger than any novels . He was the breaker , so report said , of many hearts , the disappointer of many high hopes , - and this in two continents ; he was the most variously gifted and accomplished man I have ever known , acquiring knowledge as by magic , - passing easily for a Frenchman in France , an Italian in Italy , a Spaniard in Spanish countries ; beginning his career as a radical young Unitarian divine , and ending it as a Roman Catholic and defender of despotism . The turning-point of Hurlbert 's life occurred , for me at least , when I met him once , to my great delight , at Centre Harbor , I being on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had several hours together , and went out on the lake for a long chat . He told me that he had decided to go to New York and enter the office of A. Oakey Hall , a lawyer against whom there was then , justly or unjustly , some prejudice . I expressed surprise and perhaps regret ; and he said frankly , " It is the parting of the ways with me , and I feel it to be necessary . I have made up my mind that I can not live the simple and moderate life you and my other friends live in New England ; I must have a larger field , and more of the appliances and even luxuries of existence . " This recalls what the latest biographer of Bayard Taylor has said of him : " The men of New England were satisfied with plain homes and simple living , and were content with the small incomes of professional life . Taylor had other aims . . . - Involved in the expense of Cedarcroft , he never knew the enormous value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse of either , but it brought failure to both , though Taylor , // with the tradition of a Quaker ancestry , and with less of perilous personal fascination , escaped the moral deterioration and the social scandals which beset Hurlbert , as well as his utter renunciation of all his early convictions . Yet the charm always remained in Hurlbert 's case . When we met at Centre Harbor , I remember , he was summoned from dinner on some question about stage arrangements ; and the moment he had shut the door a lady of cultivated appearance got up hastily from her chair and came round where I was sitting . She said breathlessly , " Can you tell me who that is ? We came here in the stage with him , and he has been perfectly delightful . I never saw such a man : he knows all languages , talks upon all subjects ; my daughter and I can not rest without knowing who he is . " I did not even learn the lady 's name , but years after I met her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only confirmed the instantaneous impression which Hurlbert made , - the whole thing suggesting a similar story about Edmund Burke . I have known many gifted men on both sides of the Atlantic , but I still regard Hurlbert as unequaled among them all for brilliancy ; even Lowell was not his peer . Nor can I be convinced that he was , as President Walker once said to me , when I urged Hurlbert 's appointment , about 1850 , as professor of history at Harvard , " a worthless fellow . " Among many things which were selfish and unscrupulous there must have been something deeper to have called out the warm affection created by him in both sexes . I strongly suspect that if , after twenty years of non-intercourse , he had written to me to come and nurse him in illness , I should have left all and gone . Whatever may have been his want of moral principle , he certainly had the power not merely of inspiring affection , but of returning it . I know , for instance , that while borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , -* not that I had then much to lend ; if he helped himself to my books and other small matters as if they were his own. , lie was not an atom more chary of the possessions that were his ; and I recall one occasion when he left a charming household in Boston and came out to Cambridge , in the middle of a winter vacation , on purpose to have a fire ready for me in my room on my return from a journey . I think it was on that very evening that he read aloud to me from Krummacher 's Parables , - a book then much liked among us , - selecting that fine tale describing the gradual downfall of a youth of unbounded aspirations , which the author sums up with the terse conclusion , " But the name of that youth is not mentioned among the poets of Greece . " It was thus with Hurlbert when he died , although his few poems in Putnam 's Magazine - Borodino , Sorrento , and the like - seemed to us the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the cool and keensighted Whittier read his Gan Eden , he said to me that one who had written that could write anything lie pleased . Yet the name of the youth was not mentioned among the poets ; and the utter indifference with which the announcement of his death was received was a tragic epitaph upon a wasted life . Thanks to a fortunate home training and the subsequent influence of Emerson and Parker , I held through all my theological studies a sunny view of the universe , which has lasted me as well , amid the storms of life , so far as I can see , as the more prescribed amid conventional forms of faith might have done . We all , no doubt , had our inner conflicts , yet mine never related to opinions , but to those problems of heart and life which come to every young person , and upon which it is not needful to dwell . Many of my fellow students , however , had just broken away from a sterner faith , whose shattered eggshells still clung around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used to say that his health was ruined for life by two struggles : first by the way in which he got into the church during a revival , and then by the way he got out of it as a reformer . This I escaped , and came out in the end with the radical element far stronger than the sacerdotal , so that I took for the title of my address at the graduating exercises The Clergy and Reform . I remember that I had just been reading Home 's farthing epic of Orion , and had an ambitious sentence in my address , comparing the spirit of the age to that fabled being , first blinded , and then fixing his sightless eyes upon the sun that they might be set free once more . Probably it was crude enough , but Theodore Parker liked it , and so I felt as did the brave Xanthus , described by Landor , who only remembered that in the heat of the battle Pericles smiled on him . I was asked to preach as a candidate before the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , then ostensibly of the Unitarian faith , but bearing no denominational name . Receiving a farther invitation after trial , I went there to begin my professional career , if such it could properly be called . There was something very characteristic of my mother in a little incident which happened in connection with my first visit to Newburyport . I had retained enough affection for the opinion of Boston drawing-rooms to have devised for myself a well - cut overcoat of gray tweed , with a cap of the same material trimmed with fur . My elder sisters naturally admired me in this garb , but implored me not to wear it to Newburyport . " So unclerical , " they said ; it would ruin my prospects . " Let him wear it , by all means , " said my wiser mother . " If they can not stand that clothing , they can never stand its wearer . " Her opinion properly prevailed ; and I was perhaps helped as much as hindered by this bit of lingering worldly vanity . My first actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore Parker had been , by the society itself : and this all the more because my ancestor , Francis Higginson , had been ordained in that way - the first of all New England ordinations - in 1629 . To this the society readily assented , at least so far as that there should be no ordaining council , and there was none . William Henry Channing preached one of his impassioned sermons , The Gospel of rro - Day , and all went joyously on , " youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm , " not foreseeing the storms that were soon to gather , although any sagacious observer ought easily to have predicted them . It must be borne in mind that during all this period I was growing more , not less radical ; my alienation from the established order was almost as great as that of Thoreau , though as yet I knew nothing of him except through The Dial . The more active interest of the various reformatory movements came gradually to supplant all abstract meditations . It must be remembered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called Transcendentalist body . There were the more refined votaries , who were indeed the most cultivated people of that time and place . But there was also a less educated contingent , known popularly as " Come-Outers , " - a name as familiar and distinctive as is that of the Salvation Army to-day . These were developed largely by the anti-slavery movement , which was not , like our modern civil service reform , strongest in the more educated classes , but was predominantly a people 's movement , based on the simplest human instincts , and far stronger for a time in the factories and shoe-shops than in the pulpits or colleges . The factories were still largely worked by American operatives , and the shoe manufacture was carried on in little shops , where the neighbors met and settled affairs of state , as may be read in Mr. Rowland Robinson 's delightful stories called Danvis Folks . Radi // calism went with the smell of leather , and was actually seething in such towns as Lynn and Abington , the centres of that trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Second Advent delusion just then flourishing . All these influences combined to make the Come-Outer element very noticeable , - it being fearless , disinterested , and always self-asserting . It was abundant on Cape Cod , and the " Cape Codders " were a recognized subdivision at reform meetings . In such meetings or conventions these untaught disciples were often a source of obvious inconvenience : they defied chairmen , scaled platforms , outroared exhorters . Some of them , as Emerson says , " devoted themselves to the worrying of clergymen , " proclaiming a gospel of freedom ; I have heard them boast of having ascended into pulpits and trampled across their cushions before horrified ministers . This was not a protest against religion , for they were rarely professed atheists , but against its perversions only . It must be remembered that the visible church in New England was not then the practical and reformatory body which it is to-day , - the change in the Episcopal Church being the most noticeable of all , - but that it devoted itself very largely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture times . Of the reforms prominent before the people , nearly all had originated outside the pulpit and even among avowed atheists . Thomas Herttell , judge of the Marine Court of New York city , who belonged to that heretical class , was the first person in America , apparently , to write and print , in 1819 , a strong appeal in behalf of total abstinence as the only remedy for intemperance ; and the same man made , in 1837 , in the New York Assembly , the first effort to secure to married women the property rights now generally conceded . All of us were familiar with the vain efforts of Garrison to enlist the clergy in the anti-slavery cause ; and Ste phen Foster , one of the stanchest of the early Abolitionists , habitually spoke of them as " the Brotherhood of Thieves . " Lawyers and doctors , too , fared hard with those enthusiasts , and merchants not much better ; Edward Palmer writing against the use of money , and even such superior men as Alcott having sometimes a curious touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now rather remarkable that the institution of marriage did not come in for a share in the general laxity , but it did not ; and it is to be observed that Henry James speaks rather scornfully of the Brook Farm community in this respect , as if its members must have been wanting in the courage of their convictions to remain so unreasonably chaste . I well remember that the contrary was predicted and expected by cynics , and the utter failure of their prophecies was the best tribute to the essential purity of the time . It was , like all seething periods , at least among the Anglo-Saxon race , a time of high moral purpose ; and the anti-slavery movement , reaching its climax after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law , was about to bring such qualities to a test . This agitation , at any rate , was so far the leader in the reforms of the day that it brought to a focus all their picturesque ingredients . There were women who sat tranquilly knitting through a whole anti-slavery convention , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self - controlled patience which we associate with Sisters of Charity ; and others who bore that uplifted and joyous serenity which now seems a part of the discipline of the Salvation lassies . There were always present those whom Emerson tersely classified as " men with beards ; " this style , now familiar , being then an utter novelty , not tolerated in business or the professions , and of itself a committal to pronounced heresy . Partly as a result of this unwonted adornment , there were men who // - as is indeed noticed in European Socialist meetings to-day - bore a marked resemblance to the accepted pictures of Jesus Christ . This trait was carried to an extent which the newspapers called " blasphemous " in Charles Burleigh , - a man of tall figure , benign face , and most persuasive tongue , wearing long auburn curls and somewhat tangled tempestuous beard . Lowell , whose own bearded condition marked his initiation into abolitionism , used to be amused when he went about with Burleigh and found himself jeered at as a new and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with six or eight tall brothers clustered around the one rosebud of a sister , Abby : all natural singers and one might say actors , indeed unconscious poems , easily arousing torpid conventions with The Car Emancipation and such stirring melodies ; or at times , as encore , giving The Bridge of Sighs , which seemed made for just the combination they presented . When , in this song , the circle of stalwart youths chanted , " Had she a sister ? " or when the sweet Abby , looking up with dovelike eyes at her guardians , sang in response , " Or had she a brother ? " it not only told its own story , but called up forcibly the infinite wrongs of the slave girls who had no such protectors , and who perhaps stood at that very moment , stripped and shrinking , on the auctionblock . On removing to Newburyport I found myself at once the associate of all there was most reputable in the town , in virtue of my functions ; and also , by a fatalityin temperament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phrase , " the Sisterhood of Reforms , " indicating a variety of social and physiological theories of which one was expected to accept all , if any . This I learned soon after my arrival , through the surprise expressed by some of my more radical friends at my unacquaintance with a certain family of factory operatives known as the " Briggs girls . " " Not know the Briggs girls ? I should think you would certainly know them . Work in the Globe Mills ; interested in all the reforms ; bathe in cold water every morning ; one of em is a Grahamite , " - a disciple of vegetarianism ; that faith being then a conspicuous part of " the Sisterhood of Reforms , " but one against which I had been solemnly warned by William Henry Channing , who had made experiment of it while living as city missionary in New York city . He had gone , it seemed , to a boarding-house of the vegetarian faithful in the hope of finding spiritually minded associates , but was so woefully disappointed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back upon the world 's people , as more carnal , possibly , but more companionable . Without a tithe of my cousin 's eloquence , I was of a cooler temperament , and perhaps kept my feet more firmly on the earth or was more guarded in my experiments . Yet I was gradually drawn into the temperance agitation , including prohibition ; the peace movement , for which , I dare say , I pommeled as lustily as Schramm 's pupils in Heine 's Reisebilder ; the social reform debate , which was sustained for some time after the downfall of Brook Farm ; and of course the new woman 's rights movement , for whose first national convention I signed the call in 1850 . Of all the movements in which I ever took part , except the anti-slavery agitation , this lastnamed seems to me the most important ; nor have I ever wavered in the opinion announced by Wendell Phillips , that it is " the grandest reform yet launched upon the century , as involving the freedom of one half the human race . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more temporary one , had the right of way , and must first be settled ; it was , moreover , by its nature a much simpler movement . Once recognize the fact that man could have no right of property in man , and the whole affair // was settled ; there was nothing left but to agitate , and if needful to fight . But , as Stuart Mill clearly pointed out , the very fact of the closer relations of the sexes had complicated the affair with a thousand perplexities in the actual working out ; gave room for more blunders , more temporary disappointments , more extravagant claims , and far slower development* It was in one respect fortun*te that most of the early advocates of the reform had served previously as Abolitionists , for they had been thereby trained to courage and self-sacrifice ; but it was in other respects unfortunate , because they had been accustomed to a stern and simple " Thus saith the Lord , " which proved less applicable to the more complex question . When it came to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished ; I never myself encountered an instance of it ; every man , woman , and child , whatever protestations might have been made to the contrary , was eager to grasp at freedom ; whereas in all communities there is a minority of women who are actively opposed to each successive step in elevating their condition ; and this without counting the merely indifferent . All the ordinary objections to woman suffrage , as that women have not , in the phrase of old* Theophilus Parsons , " a sufficient acquired discretion , " or that they are too impulsive , or that they can not fight , - all these seem to me trivial ; but it is necessary always to face the fact that it is the only great reform in which a minority , at least , of the very persons to be benefited are working actively on the other side . This , to my mind , only confirms its necessity , as showing that , as Mill says , the very nature of woman has been to some extent warped and enfeebled by prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was in the direction of the antislavery reform , however , that I felt the most immediate pricking of conscience , and it may be interesting , as a study of the period , to note what brought it about . There was , perhaps , some tendency that way in the blood , for I rejoice to recall the fact that after Judge Sewall , in 1700 , had published his noted tract against slavery , called The Selling of Joseph , the first protest against slavery in Massachusetts , he himself testified , six years later , " Amidst the frowns and hard words I have met with for this Undertaking , it is no small refreshment to me that I can have the Learned Reverend and Aged Mr. Higginson for my Abetter . " This was my ancestor , the Rev. John Higginson , of Salem , then ninety years old ; but my own strongest impulse came incidentally from my mother . It happened that my father , in his office of steward of the college , was also " patron , " as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant students , usually from the Southern States . This led to pleasant friendships with their families , and to occasional visits paid by my parents , traveling in their own conveyance . Being once driven from place to place by an intelligent negro driver , my mother said to him that she thought him very well situated , after all ; on which he turned and looked at her , simply saying , " Ah , missis ! free breath is good . " It impressed her greatly , and she put it into her diary , whence my eldest brother , Dr. Francis J. Higginson , quoted it in a little book he wrote , Remarks on Slavery , published in 1834 . This fixed it in my mind , and I remember to have asked my aunt why my uncle in Virginia did not free his slaves . She replied that they loved him , and would be sorry to be free . This did not satisfy me ; but on my afterward visiting the Virginia plantation , there was nothing to suggest anything undesirable : the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unexceptionable mariners ; and the white and black children often played together in the afternoon . It was then illegal to teach a slave to read , but one girl was // pointed out who had picked up a knowledge of reading while the white children were learning . The slaves seemed merely to share in the kindly and rather slipshod methods of a Southern establishment ; and my only glimpse of the other side was from overhearing conversation between the overseer and his friends , in which all the domestic relations of the negroes were spoken of precisely as if they had been animals . Returning to Cambridge , I found the whole feeling of the college entirely opposed to the abolition movement , as was that among my Brookline friends and kindred . My uncle , Mr. Samuel Perkins , had lived in Hayti during the insurrection , and had written an account of it which I read , and which was afterwards printed by Charles Perkins in the Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society . He thought , and most men of his class firmly believed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable insurrection . It was in this sincere but deluded belief that such men mobbed Garrison . When I once spoke with admiration of that reformer to Mr. Augustus Aspinwall , a frequent gu*st at my uncle 's house , he replied with perfect gentleness , sipping his wine , " It may be as you say . I never saw him , but I always supposed him to be a fellow who ought to be hung . " Mr. Aspinwall was a beautiful old man , who cultivated the finest roses to be found near Boston ; he had the most placid voice , the sweetest courtesy , and the most adamantine opinions , - the kind of man who might have been shot in the doorway of his own chateau during the French Revolution . If it had come in his way , he would undoubtedly have seen Garrison executed , and would then have gone back to finish clearing his roses of snails and rose-beetles . The early history of the anti-slavery agitation can not possibly be understood unless we comprehend this class of men who then ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two volumes of Pierce 's life of Charles Sumner which fully does justice to the way in which the anti-slavery movement drew a line of cleavage through all Boston society , leaving most of the more powerful or wealthy families on the conservative side . What finally determined me in the other direction was the immediate influence of two books , both by women . One of these was Miss Martineau 's tract , The Martyr Age in America , portraying the work of the Abolitionists with such force and eloquence that it seemed as if no generous youth could be happy in any other company ; and the other book was Mrs. Lydia Maria Child 's Appeal for that Class of Americans called Africans . This little work , for all its cumbrous title , was so wonderfully clear , compact , and convincing , it covered all its points so well and was so absolutely free from all unfairness or shrill invective , that it joined with Miss Martineau 's less modulated strains to make me an Abolitionist . This was , it must be remembered , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I longed to be counted worthy of such companionship ; I wrote and printed a rather crude sonnet to Garrison ; and my only sorrow was in feeling that , as Alexander lamented about his father Philip 's conquests , nothing had been left for me to do . Fortunately , Lowell had nlready gone in the same direction , under the influence of his wife ; and her brother , moreover , who had been for a time my schoolmate , had left all and devoted himself to anti-slavery lecturing . He it was who , when on a tour with Frederick Douglass at the West , was entertained with him at a house where there was but one spare bed . To some apologies by the hostess the ever ready and imperial Douglass answered , with superb dignity , " Do not apologize , madam ; I have not the slightest prejudice against color . " This was the condition of things I had left in Boston and Cambridge ; and when // I went to live in Newburyport the same point of view soon presented itself in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counted among its strong-* est supporters a group of retired sea-captains who had traded with Charleston and New Orleans , and more than one of whom had found himself obliged , after sailing from a Southern port , to put back in order to eject some runaway slave from his lower hold . All their prejudice ran in one direction , and their view of the case differed from that of Boston society only as a rope 's end differs from a rapier . One of them , perhaps the quietest , was the very Francis Todd who had caused the imprisonment of Garrison at Baltimore . It happened , besides , that the one political hero and favorite son of Newburyport ( for of Garrison himself they only felt ashamed ) was at that moment fighting slavery 's battles in the Mexican war . It now seems to me strange that , under all these circumstances , I held my place for two years and a half . Of course it can not be claimed that I showed unvarying tact ; indeed , I can now see that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact counted for little ; in fact , I think my sea - captains did not wholly dislike my plainness of speech , though they felt bound to discipline it ; and moreover the whole younger community was on my side . It did not help the matter that I let myself be nominated for Congress by the new " Free Soil " party in 1848 , and " stumped the district , " though in a hopeless minority . The nomination was Whittier 's doing , partly to prevent that party from nominating him ; and he agreed that , by way of reprieve , I should go to Lowell and induce Josiah G. Abbott , then a young lawyer , to stand in my place . Abbott 's objection is worth recording : if elected , he said , he should immediately get into quarrels with the Southern members and have to fight duels , and this he could not conscientiously do . This was his ground of exemption . Years after , when he was an eminent judge in Boston and a very conservative Democrat , I once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should feel just the same now . " Having been , of course , defeated for Congress , as I had simply stood in a gap , I lived in Newburyport for more than two years longer , after giving up my parish . This time was spent in writing for newspapers , teaching private classes in different studies , serving on the school committee and organizing public evening schools , then a great novelty . The place was , and is , a manufacturing town , and I had a large and intelligent class of factory girls , mostly American , who came to my house for reading and study once a week . In this work I enlisted a set of young maidens of unusual ability , several of whom were afterward well known to the world : Harriet Prescott , afterward Mrs. Spofford ; Louisa Stone , afterward Mrs. Hopkins ( well known for her educational writings ) ; Jane Andrews ( author of The Seven Little Sisters , a book which has been translated into Chinese and Japanese ) ; her sister Caroline , afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and others not their inferiors , though their names were not to be found in print . I have never encountered elsewhere so noteworthy a group of young women , and all that period of work is a delightful reminiscence . My youthful coadjutors had been trained in a remarkably good high school , kept by William H. Wells , a celebrated teacher ; and I had his hearty cooperation , and also that of Professor Alpheus Crosby , one of the best scholars in New England , and then resident in Newburyport . With his aid I established a series of prizes for the best prose and poetry written by the young people of the town ; and the first evidence given of the unusual talents of Harriet Prescott Spofford was in a very daring and original essay on Hamlet , written at sixteen , and gaining the first prize . I had also to do with the courses of lectures and con- // Puv is de Chavannes in Boston . certs , and superintended the annual Floral Processions which were then a pretty feature of the Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , I was as acceptable a citizen of the town as could be reasonably expected of one who had preached himself out of his pulpit . I supposed myself to have given up preaching forever , and recalled the experience of my ancestor , the Puritan divine , Francis Higginson , who , when he had left his church living at Leicester , England , in 1620 , continued to lecture to all corners . But a new sphere of ref ormatory action opened for me in an invitation to take charge of the Worcester Free Church , the first of several such organizations that sprang up about that time under the influence of Theodore Parker 's Boston society , which was their prototype . These organizations were all more or less of the " Jerusalem wildcat " de scription , with no church membership or communion service , not calling themselves specifically Christian , but resembling the ethical societies of the present day , with a shade more of specifically religious aspect . Worcester was at that time a seething centre of all the reforms , and I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; my evening congregations were the largest in the city , and the men and women who surrounded me - now almost all passed away - were leaders in public movements in that growing community . Before my transfer , however , I went up to Boston on my first fugitive slave foray , as it might be called , - not the Anthony Burns affair , but the Thomas Sims case , which preceded it , and which was to teach me , once for all , that there was plenty left to be done , and that Philip had not fought all the battles .
