txt WE HAVE been hearing during the past twenty years , and with greatly increased emphasis during the past ten , of the utter discredit which has overtaken the older political economy of Adam Smith , and Ricardo , and Mill , and Cairnes , and Say , and Cobden , and Bastiat . Their system , we have been told , is largely a deductive system , in which the premises are furnished by hypotheses which have no basis in the actual facts of industrial life , and are not verified either by experiment or observation . Not only are these premises not true of the world at large , but they are not true of any particular country in the world . They assume that the civilized world lives under the regime of competition , whereas there are only two or three countries which can be said , with any approach to accuracy , to do so . The " Economic Man " of iRicardo always buys in the cheapest markets , and always waits patiently until he can sell in the dearest , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his power to the cornmunitv . Moral considerations do not , in any degree , affect his business transactions . There is no place in his system for brotherly kindness or charity . It is inexpedient for the state to attempt to regulate him in any way , either by keeping him out of the cheapest market or impeding his access to the dearest . All he asks of it is to be left alone to deal with his fellow men in such manner as his own natural acuteness or his command of capital may permit . His one desire is to make all the money he can by every means not illegal . Laissez faire , laissez passez , comprises the sole and whole duty of the state towards him . Ricardo , who is the scapegoat who has to bear the burden of most of the sins of the old school , or who , at all events , figures most prominently in this discussion , has , it is said , built up his political economy on the desires and fears of an entirely mythical personage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . // This man does not represent the human race in general , or any particular part of it . He is a creature of the economist 's imagination . The facts of human life have not entered into his composition . The old political economy  --  the " Smithianismus , " as the Germans call it-has been based on the assumption that this economic man exists . It must be discarded when it is shown that he does not exist ; that his assumed motives and activities are not the law of industrial communities . A new inductive political economy must , therefore , take the place of this old deductive one , and must be based on the observation and careful accumulation of the facts of industrial life in civilized countries , either as they now exist or as they are historically recorded . As the economic history of every country differs in some degree from that of every other country , it follows that every country must have its own political economy and its own staff of expounders of the local science . This is , accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , an Austrian school , an English school , a Russian school , and an American school , which all differ in the matter of " method , " but all agree in repudiating Adam Smith and his economic followers , in denouncing laissez faire , laissez passez as an economic rule in being intensely " historical , " and in endeavoring to supply morality to trade through some sort of government interference , not as yet clearly defined . The scorn of the new schools for Smith and Mill and Ricardo is indeed almost bitter , but their differences about " method " - that is , about the exact nature of the mental processes by which they reach their conclusions-are already nearly as numerous as those of the metaphysicians , and are apparently likely to prove as barren . If Comte , who first flouted the pretensions of political economy to be considered a science , were now living , these differences would please him hugely as illustrations of the soundness of his position . A little volume on " The Scope and Method of Political Economy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cambridge University ( England ) , should be read by any one who wishes to get an adequate idea not so much of economical methodology as of the methodological confusion which reigns among the economists . He remarks truly " Economic science deals with phenomena which are more complex and less uniform than those with which the natural sciences are concerned ; and // its conclusions , except in their most abstract form , lack both the certainty and precision that pertain to physical laws . There is a corresponding difficulty in regard to the proper method of economic study , and the problem of defining the conditions and limits of the validity of economic reasoning becomes one of exceptional complexity . It is , moreover , impossible to establish the right of any one method to hold the field to the exclusion of others .. Different methods are appropriate according to the materials available , the stage of investigation reached , and the object in view ; hence arises the special task of assigning to each its legitimate place and relative importance . " ( P. 6 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions dra*yn by opposing schools , and their narrow dogmatism , have unnecessarily complicated the whole problem . The subject has become involved in heated controversies that have not only made it wearisome to unprejudiced persons , but have also done injury to the credit of political economy itself . Outsiders are naturally suspicious of a science in the treatment of which a new departure is so often and so loudly proclaimed essential . " ( P. 8 . ) This contempt for the " Economic Man " is the more remarkable because the members of the historic school themselves perforce make use of him . T*oscher , who may be called the chief of it , relies on him fully as much as Ricardo . Such phrases as these abound in him " The systematic effort of every rational individual in his household management is direc'ed towards the obtaining by a minimum of sacrifice of pleasure and energy a maximum satisfaction of his wants . " ( Vol. 1 , pp. 60-66 . ) " The incentive to ameliorate one 's condition is common to all men , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its imagination . It follows us all from the cradle to the grave . It may be restricted within certain limits , but is never entirely extinguished . " " All normal economy aims at securing a maximum of personal advantage with a minimum of cost or outlay . " ( P. 73 . ) " Self-interest causes every one to choose the course in life in which ha shall meet with least competition and the most abundant patronage . " ( P. 75 . ) " The abstraction according to which al men are by nature the same , different only in consequence of a difference of educatiod , position la life , etc. , cdi equally well equipped , skilful , and free in the matter of economic production and consumption , is one which , as Ricardo and Von Thunen have shown , must pass as an indispensable stage in the preparatory labors of political economists . " ( P. 105 . ) " The mathematical laws of motion operate in a hypothetical vacuum , and when applied are subject to important modifications in consequence of atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of our science ; as , for instance , those in accordance with which the price of a commodity is fixed by the buyer and seller . It also always supposes the parties to the contract to be guided only by a sense J *heir own best interest , and not to be influenced by secondary eonsideration** . P. 103. ) * The comparison of Ricardo 's Economic Man to the first law of motion is an old one , but it is as good to-day as * These quotations are all made from Lalor 's translation . // when it was first made . It is quite true , as far as human knowledge goes , that no body actually continues for an indefinite period in rectilinear and uniform motion . But it is also true that no real progress would ever have been made in astronomy or mechanics without the assumption that if a body were set in motion in a vacuum this is the way in which it would move . It is no less true that political economy , no matter how defined , can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who desires above all things , and without reference to ethical considerations , to get as much of the worlds goods as he can with the least possible expenditure of effort or energy on his own part . The fact that he is not humane or God-fearing no more affects his usefulness for scientific purposes than the fact that the first law of motion would carry a cannon ball through a poor man 's cottage . The theory of production , of value , and of exchange , all rests on his assumed existence . He supplies the raison d ' *21re of the whole criminal law and of a large part of the civil law of all civilized countries . Ethics , and religion in so far as it furnishes a sanction for ethics , exist for the purpose of deflecting him from his normal course . The well-known " Gresham 's Law , " which declares that the less valuable of two kinds of legal-tender money will drive the more valuable out of circulation , has been understood by some of our more ignorant bimetallists as meaning that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . But " Gresham 's Law 's is simply a deduction from observation of the working of the Economic Man 's mind when brought into contact with two kinds of currency of unequal value , and through our knowledge of the Economic Man we can predict its operation with almost as much certainty as the operation of a law of chemistry or physics . Ethics and religion , in fact , constitute the disturbing forces which make possible the organization and prosperous existence of civilized states . They have to be calculated and allowed for and their working observed , just as the disturbing force of gravity , or atmospheric or other resistance , has to be calculated , allowe ' -* I*or , and its working observed , in astronomy or mcchauV But this calculation would be impossible if the constan * *cndency were known . If the Economic Man were blotted out of existence , nearly all the discussions of the economists would be as empty logomachy // as the attempts to reconcile fixed fate and free will . That I am not here fighting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker , himself an economist of eminence , in a recent address before the American Economic Association , on " The Tide of Economic Thought , " gives the following as one of the reasons for the currency at this juncture of " the vaguest and wildest schemes for human regeneration upon an economic basis " " First . The economists themselves are largely resifinsible for this state of things , on account of the arbitrary and unreal character of their assumptions and the haughty and contemptuous spirit in which they have too often chosen to deliver their precepts . Especially are our American economists sinners above the rest in these respects . Long after even the English economists , who have been lordly enough , Heaven knows ! had importantly modified the traditional premises of the science to meet the facts of human nature , and had , with a wider outlook , admitted many extensive qualifications of the doctrine of laissez faire , the professors of political economy in the leading American colleges continued to write about the economic man of Ricardo and James Mill as if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editors of the journals and reviews which especially affected to exercise authority in economics , greeted with contumely every suggestion of an exception to the rule of individualism , from whatever source proceeding , for whatever reason proposed . Even the complete establishment of such an exception in the policy of half a dozen nations , and its triumphant vindication in practical working to the satisfaction of all publicists , all men of affairs , and even of those who had once been selfishly interested to oppose it , constituted no reason why these high priests of economic orthodoxy should accept it . " I might , if I had space , take serious exception to these allegations about the teachings of professors in American colleges , on the score of exaggeration , and also to the proposition touching the satisfaction of " all publicists and all men of affairs , " on the score of accuracy . But I am not concerned about this so much as about the statement that the English and other economists have " importantly modified the traditional premises of the science . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political e6onomy , in discussing which no man ever gets fully outside of his subject , he would at once recognize the fact that the premises of " a science can not be altered to suit any one 's fancy or convenience . Science means the law which regulates the succession of phenomena . Scientific investigation means an attempt by observation or experiment , or both , to get at this law . But it is only in theology or metaphysics that the scientific investigator creates his own premises , and makes hypotheses which account for nothing . In all other fields , political economy included ,  --  if // it be a science ,  --  the premises are furnished not by the logician , but by the phenomena of nature . Human society furnishes the economist with his phenomena , and therefore with his premises , He can , if he be a scientific man , no more modify them " iraportantly " or otherwise than he can by taking thought add a cubit to his stature . He cai , of course , as in any line of investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verifiable by observation or exueriment . But under all circumstances , and for all purposes , there is no getting away from the phenomena . You may dislike them , or wish they were otherwise , but accept them you must . You may approach them inductively by collecting on them for your premises , or you may approach them deductively by concocting a hypothesis or theory to explain them , but you must still apply them promptly to your conclusion to see whether they fit . I venture to assert that there is not a single economist of the old school , beginning with Adam Smith , who , as a scientific man , has not used both these methods with such success as his diligence and skill permitted . But in all economic investigation the first inquiry is , and , so far as it is economical , must forever remain : What will the Economic Man do when brought in contact with certain selected phenomena of the physical or social world ? And the more complicated the facts of the industrial and social world are , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to enable him to steer his way through the maze . The existing confusion in the economic world , which General Walker 's charge , quoted above , well illustrates , is due , apparently , to difficulty in getting the members of the new or historical schools to tell us in what character they appear . One can never tell , in listening to them , whether they are addressing us as scientific men or statesmen . Their air of authority is that of scientists , but the eager philanthropy of their utterances indicates that they are really would-be legislators . Their clothes are economical , but their talk is ethical . To take Roseher again as an example of the best-known and most moderate of them , one finds that what he has added to the work of the older economists , besides the illustrations supplied by an enormous erudition , consists mainly of theology and metaphysics . The new schools profess to know far more about the will of God , and about duty and the moral sources of happiness , and the ethical foundations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not contributed anything of practical importance to onr knowledge of the laws of value , of production , or of exchange , as extracted from the mind of the producer and purchaser . The test of science is that it enables one to predict consequences . Until our researches have enabled us to foresee exactly what will happen if something else happens , although we may have discovered valuable and interesting facts , we have not discovered a law . That the historical school have laid before us a large mass of interesting information about the industrial condition of various countries at various periods can not be denied , but I am unable to see in what their contributions to economical literature differ from the books of intelligent and observant travellers . Their great objection to the policy of laissez aire-t hat it permits a considerable amount of cruelty , oppression , and suffering , and that , in spite of its teachings , poverty exists on a great scale among the laboring classes-is an ethical or political , not a scientific , objection . It is simply saying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poverty " says-that they are cruel or unjust . It does not suggest any economical mo*de , in the scientific sense of the term , for improving the condition of the poor . Take as an example of our meaning General Walker 's announcement , in the passage we have just quoted , of " the complete establishment " of " an exception to the rule of individualism " ( we presume the regulation of factory labor ) " in the policy of half a dozen nations " " to the satisfaction of all publicists , all men of affairs , " etc . This exceptions let us observe , was first made in the country which has been supposed to be most influenced by the individualists . But no matter what its merits , or what its results , the fact remains that it is not an exception in the economic sense . It is a political or social measure , not an economic one . It is not a conclusion of economic science . It is a dictate of humanity or physiology or religion . It is a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed than to the restrictions on the use of public water or the municipal prohibition of the storing of gunpowder . It was opposed in the beginning not by economists , but by manufacturers who happened to be at the time strongly combating the kind of government interference with production which had been the rule in Europe ever since the middle ages . There is no foundation for the suggestion that in any six countries in the world the Economic Man has offered any soVOL . CUlL-NO. 419. // rious impediment to the kind of special interference with distribution for the benefit of the race which is known as socialistic legislation . The legislation has , as a matter of fact , begun earliest in England , where individualism has been supposed to be most powerful , and has gone on pan passu with the spread of the opinions associated with the name of Smith and Bicardo and Cobden . The only effect of these opinions on English legislation has been to abolish the former hindrances to exchange with foreign countries ; and those who advocated this have certainly not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry and on the condition of the working classes . In short , the new school of economists are rather politicians , using the word in its good sense , than scientific men . What mainly occupies them is legislation for taking away money from capitalists and distributing it among laborers . The earlier school may have paid too much attention to the problem of production . The later ones can hardly be said to pay any attention at all to production . With the efl*ct of their plans on production-that is , on the dividend which the earth yields every year to the labor of its inhabitants-they hardly seem to concern themselves . To talk of their championship of the working classes as being in any sense scientific would be au abuse of language . And I can not help thinking that General Walker 's ascription of the existing currency " of the vaguest and wildest schemes for human regeneration on an economic basis " to the economists - meaning by that the followers of Ricardo and Mill-is a curious misapprehension . It reads very like the criticism of the wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates throw any light on the matter , " the wild and vague schemes for human regeneration upon an economic basis " did not begin to spread or take hold of any civilized community with marked force or effect until after the convention of the " Katheder Socialisten " in Germany in 1877 , and the appc*arance of the historical school in Germany , England , and America . Professor Ingram 's attack on political economy in general in the " Encyclop*dia Britannica " undoubtedly gave somewhat of a blow to " Smithianismus , " but he only repeated what Comte had already said of the absurdity of supposing that there could be any such thing as economical science apart from the general science of sociology . He , however , greatly diminished the apparent value of the Economic Man , and helped // to start crowds of young professors and labor agitators and politicians in search of a new economy which would shorten hours of labor , raise wages , humble the employer , give the laborer a fair share in the luxuries of life , and eventually abolish poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regeneration through government interference , of the discredit of the older economists , and of the resulting economic confusion of which General Walker speaks , has been hastened by two other agencies of which he takes no notice . The charge that this confusion has been brought about through the bad manners of the old economists , and the hard-and-fast way in which they presented their theories to the multitude , shows that it is not science but politics which has been expected of them . The fact-if it be a fact-that the multitude refuses to listen to them any longer , and has gone off to worship new gods , does not prove that they have reasoned wrongly on the facts of society . It simply proves that their conclusions are unpopular . That a certain number of persons have gone into " the vaguest and wildest schemes for human regeneration on an economic basis " does not show that the assumptions of the old economists have been " arbitrary and unreal , " although it may show that their precepts have been delivered in a " haughty and contemptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is really what the new school does , it is impossible to decide , on any data now in our possession , whether the laissez faire system , as it is called , has been , or will be , successful or not . There is , nnhappily , no absolute test of success in economic legislation . All that the wisest legislator can look for as a sign of his success in dealing with economic problems is a reduction in the amount of discontent among the poor . To abolish discontent among the poor completely , in any country , is as hopeless a task as to abolish poverty , and no statesman attempts it . Whether he has succeeded in lessening discontent he can only ascertain approximately , by means of an inference from the increase of consumption as shown in statistics collected from varions sources . He concludes , d priori , that the poor are less discontented when they consume more of the necessaries and luxuries , because he has observed that , as a rule , physical comfort among the great bulk of mankind tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty that any particular kind of economict*l // legislation is the best possible , or has produced effects which no other kind would or will produce . It is here that the complexity of all sociological problems comes in to baffle the politician , and compels him , in the vast majority of cases , to legislate simply for the Economic Man , with whose needs and tendencies he is , as a rule , far more familiar than he is with the needs of the ethical man . So that if the new schools of political economy enter the field , as they are apparently doing , not as scientists , but as legislators , their attacks on the old one as politicians can not have any better basis than pride of opinion . It remains to be seen whether their plans for the promotion of human happiness are in any way superior to those of the old school or not . It seems to be forgotten that the paternal system of government , in which what is called " the state 's plays the part of an earthly parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale in various communities and at various periods of the world 's history , and with very poor success . I grant that it has not been tried under conditions as favorable as those which now exist . The experiment may now be made with greatly improved administrative machinery , with minute as well as wide knowledge of economic facts and tendencies , and under the watch of a powerful public opinion . But , on the other hand , the state has lost completely , in the eyes of the multitude , the moral and intellectual authority it once possessed . It does not any longer represent God on earth . In democratic countries it represents the party which secured most votes at the last election , and is , in many cases , administered by men whom no one would make guardians of his children or trustees of his property . When I read the accounts given by the young lions of the historical school of the glorious future which awaits us as soon as we get the proper amount of state interference with our private concerns for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York " the state ' consists of the Albany Legislature under the guidance of Governor Hill , and in New York city of the little Tammany junta known as " the Big Four , " I confess I am lost in amazement . I ask myself , How can anybody who attacks the old school with such vigor for its indifference to the facts of daily life be so completely oblivious of that most patent fact , that the capacity of the state // *o1 for interfering with people profitably has not grown in anything like the same ratio as the popular intelligence , and that there is nothing in which modern democracy is showing itself so deficient as in the provision of inspecting machinery-that is , in securing the faithful execution of its plans for the promotion of popular comfort ? The agencies which have really done most to discredit the older political economy with the masses , and to produce an efflorescence of wild schemes of social regeneration on an economic basis , are , as I have said , two in number . The first is the extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economical problems raised by the historical school since its appearance in 1877 . Its promises and denunciations have been flung into democratic communities in which , as in France , Germany , and England , the poorer classcs were just becoming aware of the extent of the power over the government which universal suffrage had put into their hands . In no country have " the masses , " in the modern sense of that term , ever been greatly concerned about political liberty , as the men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in this country and England understood it and fought for it ; that is , about the " division of the sovereignty between different bodies so as to prevent the growth of arbitrary power . The greatest political interest of that vast majority of the human race which is in but a small degree removed from want always has been , and probably always will be , the power of legislation over distribution . A good gover*1ment always has been to them a government under which trade is brisk , wages are high , and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seemed to them " a dismal science " has been that its teachings , in so far as it attempted to teach , discouraged reliance on the state for these things , and made the attainment of them dependent on individual character . I am not now discussing whether this doctrine was or was not pushed too far ; I simply say that it was the most natural thing in the world for the working classes of England , for example , which had been so long familiar with legislation for the direct benefit of the middle and upper classes , to receive with anger or suspicion the announcement that the care of any class by the state was a mistake , and that individual independence was the true rule of industrial life . When these classes , therefore , // found themselves invested through the suffrage with political power , it was inevitable that they should seek at once to improve their condition through legislation , and should receive with acclamation the news that a new school of political economy had been founded which taught as " science " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would , on application , put an end to unjust distribution . In short , the new departure which the new schools are all calling for is a new departure in politics , not in political economy . There is hardly a trace of science in their talk any more than in that of city missionaries . What they are asking us to do is simply to try a hazardous experiment in popular government . The second agency in producing the existing economic confusion , which , as it appears to me , General Walker overlooks , is the substitution in nearly all the churches of the " gospel of social endeavor , " as it has been called , for the old theological gospel . There are very few clergymen to-day who venture to expound in their pulpits what was formerly called the " Queen of the Sciences , " the science of Christian theology . This used to be their chief business . Of this science they were the acknowledged masters . They were supposed to have the key to the greatest of all earthly problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it furnished the chief interest of the intellectual world in all countries . When Dr. Lyman Beecher took the charge of a group of " anxious inquirers " out of the hands of Judge Gould at Litchfield , he did so as a professional man , just as a physician would have taken a case of ty.phoid fever out of the hands of an apothecary , and the church saw clearly the overwhelming necessity of the judge 's deposition . Probably nine out of ten of the members to-day would smile over the good doctor 's notion that his skill in dealing with spiritual suffering was , ex officio , any greater than the judge 's . In fact , authority has departed from the pulpit as a profession . Everybody nowadays acknowledges this , and clergymen feel it . They feel especially that they have failed in obtaining influence for revealed religion over the great masses of population congregated in modern cities , and yet it is these masses which have raised what is called the " labor problem , " and have produced the prodigious economic tumult which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who feel that the old gospel has lost its power // to soothe discontent and to account for social evils , should endeavor to get at the point of view of the laboring poor , and should in a large number of cases , through force of sympathy , come to share in their illusions touching the power of government over distribution , is surely very natural . The socialist view of what social arrangements ought to be is very much like that of the early Christians , and the clergyman*s imagination is naturally touched by finding it held by large bodies of his contemporaries . Moreover , was not the world once conquered by an ethical idea , and what is easier than for an ardent preacher to believe that it is not too late to do it over again ? It has been maintained in this city in a clerical convention within twenty years , in all seriousness , that the whole world might be , and probably would be , with proper effort , " converted , " in the technical sense of that term , within thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this conversion might be hastened by a rearrangement , under government superintendence* of the relations of labor and capital ? Moreover , the notion that the economists are to blame for the aberrations of " the benevolent clergymen , ecstatic ladies , " and other " prophets and disciples of an industrial millennium , ** would be more plausible if an industrial millennium were anything new , or if , from the days of Hesiod to our own , the evils of man 's condition had not been laid on the greed of the rich , on the pride of the wise and learned , and on the inhumanity of the great , by a long catena of poets , sages , and prophets . That the volume of social discontent is now greater than in former ages is due mainly to the multitude of new problems we have to face , to the immensely improved means of spreading ideas , to the wonderful economic changes effected by science and invention , and , though last not least , to the appearance on the scene of the new schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . But the labor problem remains very much what it has been ever since agriculture was substituted for hunting and fishing  --  a problem which , in the main , each man must solve for himself.
