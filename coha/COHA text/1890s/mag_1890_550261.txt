THE GREAT DORR WAR . By Charles H. Payize . ABOUT fifty years ago , the little state of Rhode Island was agitated by a controversy which so nearly brought its citizens into armed collision with each other as to receive the name of a " war. ** Though the circumstances were then familiar to the whole country , they have so far faded from memory and are in themselves so curious as to merit a fresh recital . Though Rhode Island began as an innovator and bo* sts of having been first to proclaim and practise the doctrine of " soul-liberty " or freedom of opinion from the control of the civil power , she soon became very conservative , and some of her people recall the facts that she was the last state to ratify the Federal Constitution and the last to adopt a written constitution of her own , with as much pride as if a wise act necessarily grew wiser by postponement . In 1663 , the colony of Rhode Island obtained from King Charles II . a charter , erecting a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be governed until 1842 , no constitution being adopted at the Revolution , but the charter being still regarded as the fundamental law . In the course of a hundred and eighty years , however , this form of government became , in the opinion of many Rhode Islanders , too old-fashioned for further service . The principal grounds of complaint were the restricted suffrage and the unequal representation in the legislature . The suffrage was coufined to owners of a freehold of the value of one hundred and thirty-four dollars , and the eldest sons of such freeholders . The assignment of representatives , made by the charter , had come to involve such absurdity as that Nexvport , with a population of about eight thousand , had six representatives , while Providence , with a population of twenty-three thousand , had but four , and the town of Jamestown , with a population of three hundred and sixty-five , had two . These defects led to agitation for a change , and for the adoption of a more liberal written constitution , as early as 1797 . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed again in i8r r and 1820 , and in 1824 a constitution ( making , however , no extension of the suffrage ) was proposed to the freeholders and rejected . In 1829 , upon a petition for extension of suffrage , Benjamin Hazard made a report , famous in the annals of the // state , which is an elaborate and powerful defence of a restricted suffrage , and contains the much-quoted description of immigrants to Rhode Island as " persons who have adventured among us from other states or countries to better their conditions . . . and upon whose departure there is no restraint . " In 1832 and 1834 other ineffectual efforts were made in the same direction . These repeated failures and the deprivation of what they regarded as their right produced deep discontent in the minds of the disfranchised portion of the citizens , who despaired of ever obtaining what they sought through the regular channels of authority . As early as 1832 a party movement was begun with the object of awakening the public feeling and concentrating the efforts of those who desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches were made . The landholding electors were generally substantial , well-to-do people , and their leaders , the men who became governors , senators , and members of the Assembly , belonged chiefly to old and wealthy families , lived in substantial , roomy , " colonial " houses , where they dispensed a liberal hospitality in the midst of the memorials of an ancestry of which they were as proud as any feudal nobles . The advocate* of extended suffrage , on the other hand , were mostly mechanics and tradesmen , some of foreign birth or parentage , and generally not so rich as the members of the other party . Naturally , therefore , the controversy took on to some extent the form of a contest between the " aristocracy " and the " people , " and the suffrage orators were liberal in the use of such terms as " aristocrats , " " ruffled-shirt gentry , " and the like . To emphasize the contrast they took pains to appear upon the rostrum arrayed in jackets of green baize and other styles of dress intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts . Little was accomplished by this movement , and it nearly died out ; but in the spring of 1840 it revived and presently increased to greater strength than before . In the meantime , some lawyers and some of the freeholders , some even of the higher class among them , had joined the movement . Chief of these was Thomas Wilson Dorr , who wa* to bear the most conspicu ous and trying part in the events which followed . Dorr belonged to an old , wealthy , and influential family , and was connected by blood and marriage with most of the leading " aristocrats " of the northern part of the state . He was born in 1805 , graduated , with honor , at Harvard College in 1823 , studied law in New York under Chancellor Kent , and in Rhode Island under some of the best laxvyers in the state . He was now practising law in Providence , taking , at the same time , a warm interest in politics , lie was a man of strict honor and integrity and high character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an indomitable will . Between the spring of 1840 and that of 1841 , the organization of the Rhode Island Suffrage Association , with branches in various parts of the state , was carried rapidly forward . Its declaration of principles was based upon the assertion that all men are created free and equal , and that the possession of property should create no political advantage . It maintained the right of the people to assemble by delegates and form a constitution , without regard to the absence of any authority for such proceedings from the existing government of the state . The right of the people to adopt a constitution in this way , and the legality of such a proceeding , were vehemently asserted by the supporters of the suffrage cause and as strongly denied by the friends of the charter government , who maintained that only through a convention legally called by the existing goveminent could the people speak with authority . The discussion caused a general ploughing up of fundamental principles and a vast deal of talk about the rights of man , principles of 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much enthusiasm was displayed , mingled with a small proportion of thought and learning . The theory of the suffrage party was succinctly expressed in the famous question of a suffrage orator , " If the soverinity do n't reside in the oplc , where the does it reside ? " At the January session of the General Assembly , 1841 , a convention was called , to meet in November , to frame a constitution . But this convention , like the previous ones , was to be elected by the " freemen , " or qualified freeholders , only , and was regarded by the suffragists as a mere expedient , a device to quiet the agitators , // without effecting any reform . Determined , accordingly , to take independent action , they called a mass meeting of the friends of extended suffrage to meet in Providence on April 17 , 1841 . The appointed day was ushered in by the ringing of all the church bells , and though a fine , drizzling rain fell during the whole of the proceedings , a great procession was formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the principal streets to an open space on the top of Federal Hill . The column was headed by butchers in white frocks , mounted , and hearing a banner with the figure of an ox and the inscription , " I die for liberty . " They were followed by a body of nearly three thousand citizens , each wearing a badge with the legend , " I am an American Citizen , " and carrying banners with appropriate inscriptions , among which were , " Worth makes the man , but sand and gravel make the voter " ; " Virtue , Patriotism , and Intelligence VS. $134 worth of Dirt . " A good many of the freeholding voters took part , whether induced by love of free suffrage or a desire to share in the patriotic feast which followed may perhaps be a question . According to a suffrage newspaper of the day , " a dead silence , broken only by the martial strains of three or four powerful and excellent bands , pervaded the immense column from right to left , and the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed the congregated host . " Arrived upon the ground , these st*rnly resolute patriots , after singing Olaf flundreaf as a sort of grace , unbent so far as to consume an ox , a calf , and a hog , which had been roasted whole for the occasion , together with a loaf of brown bread ten feet long and two feet wide , and " several barrels of beer . " The procession then re-formed , perhaps with somewhat smaller numbers , marched back to the " Town House , " which was to Providence what the Forum was to Rome , and listened to several speeches on the great subject of the day . Little attention was paid by the charter party to these proceedings and no alarm was excited ; but the suffragists were much encouraged by the success of the mass meeting and pushed forward their preparations for a direct appeal to the people . On the 5th of May another meeting was held in Newport , where , on the same day , the newly elected state government was being inaugurated . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , but was still pronounced by the suffrage organ " a glorious affair . " It adjourned to meet in Providence on the 5th of July , when Independence Day was to be celebrated , and the patriots on their way home were warned of " the danger of the People where the Iron Sceptre of Aris* tocracy and Despotism prevailed . " Before the date of the adjourned meeting an effort was made by Samuel Y. Atwell , one of the best men in the suffrage party , a leader of the bar and a man respected by all parties for his character and ability , to induce the General Assembly to modify the act calling a convention , previously passed , so as to give better representation to the popular feeling , but his proposals were voted down . The suffragists were afterwards blaited for going on with their plans for an independent people 's convention , while the convention called by the Assembly , afterwards called the " Landholders ' Convention , " had not yet shown what it would do ; but it was replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the General Assembly showed that it would do nothing on the main question unless forced into it . On the 5th of July , pursuant to a resolution of the May meeting , a mass convention was held in Providence . The city was unusually full of strangers , many of whom were drawn from the country towns by interest in the suffrage meeting . A long procession , in which were two of the independent military organizations of the state , escorted the orators to the ground , and a very large crowd was present at the meeting . Emphatic resolutions were adopted , the state committee was directed to call a convention to frame a constitution , and the unanimous vote of the meeting pledged its members to sustain and carry into effect such constitution , if adopted , " by all necessary means . " The ground upon which all these proceedings were taken and upon which the suffrage party acted was briefly this : that , under the American system of government , the absolute sovereignty resides in the people ; that , at the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed to them , and the charter derived from a British king ceased to // have any binding force ; that a fundamental principle of American public law is " the right of the people to make and alter their constitutions of government " ; that , though this right had not been exercised since the Revolution , it had not been and could not be abandoned or lost ; and that , in pursuance of it , the people , at any time , upon their own motion , without the aid or in spite of the opposition of any existing form of government , might assemble by delegates , form and submit a constitution which , upon adoption by a majority , would become the supreme law of the land . Though it is not difficult to find defects in this theory , it contains a large measure of sound truth , and , beyond all doubt , it was sincerely and conscientiously believed by the suffrage party . On July 24 , 1841 , the state committee issued a call for the election of delegates to a convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American citizen , twenty-one years old , who had resided one year in the state , was entitled to vote , and delegates were apportioned strictly on the basis of population . On the 28th of August , delegates were elected , under this call , from nearly every town in the state . Three days later , at the regular town-meetings , delegates were elected to the Landholders ' Convention ( called by the General Assembly ) , which was to meet in November . On October 4 , the " People 's Convention " met and proceeded to its work . Its sessions attracted little attention . As yet , the public failed to recognize the fact that the suffrage party was in earnest , and seemed to expect that its present undertaking would end in talk , if it was even intended to do more than influence the action of the authorities . The sessions of the convention lasted only from Monday to Saturday ; but in that time , under the leadership and guidance of Thomas W. Dorr , they framed a constitution not only embodying their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality of representation , - but limiting and changing the old system in many important points , so as to bring it into harmony with modern ideas of American constitutional law . A strong effort was made to include negroes among those entitled to suffrage , - and this was supported by Mr. Dorr , who followed his principles to their logical conclusions , - but it was unsuccessful . Early in November , the Landholders ' Convention assembled . By this time , the agitation and arguments of the suffragists had convinced many of the charter party that some extension of suffrage was advisable . But the majority in the convention was determined to cling fast to the old order , and drafted a constitution in which the only substantial change was an equalization of representation , the suffrage being still con fined to the freeholders . This done , they adjourned to February , to consult the people upon their work . The People 's Convention had adjourned to November , for the same purpose , and reassembled soon after the adjournment of the Landholders ' . Making some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to be submitted to popular vote on the 27th-a9th of l ) ecember , 1841 . On these days , accordingly , the vote was taken . Each person voting was required to state in writing on his ballot whether he was or was not a qualified voter under existing laws . On January 12 , 1842 , the convention met again , counted the votes , and announced that 13,944 votes had been given for the constitution , 49fi0 of them by " freemen . " This being a majority both of the adult male population and of the freemen , as their numbers were estimated , the constitution was declared adopted , and was proclaimed by the officers of the convention , and , with the votes upon it , communicated to the General Assembly . It was to go into effect May 3 , 1842 , and elections under it were to be held April i8 . In February , the Landholders ' Convention re-convened . Events , since their last meeting , had sharply reminded the conservative members that others were likely to take a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold back too long . The suffrage provisions in their constitution were now liberally extended , and made substantially like those of the People 's constitution . The General Assembly also had now directed the constitution to be submitted not only to the qualified freemen , but to all who would be entitled to vote under its provisions . A warm contest now began over this constitution . The charter party made every effort to secure its adoption , and many of the suffragists were disposed to adopt it , drop the People 's constitution , // and , by accepting the practical benefits of the Landholders ' , avoid any trouble . Such was , no doubt , the prudent course , and that which would probably have been chosen by a xvise statesman . But Mr. Dorr was not prudent : he was logical , and had the courage of his convictions , and he threw all his influence with his party against such a course , saying , " The People 's constitution has been adopted and is the law ; this device of our enemies to perplex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was defeated by a majority of 676 . Again Mr. Atwell in the General Assembly tried to obtain recognition for the People 's constitution , but , instead of this , resolutions were l ) assed declaring that the existing government would be sustained . The suffrage party , on the other hand , appeared equally determined . The convention had pledged the party to support and defend the constitution " by all necessary means " ; and this pledge was repeated by numerous meetings , and supported by much tall talk about the use of force and the interference of armed men from other states , as well as from Rhode Island . Armed bands were organized and drilled and almost nightly paraded the streets , and two or three chartered military companies embraced the suffrage cause . In consequence of this , the charter party , who were called " Algerines " by the suffragists , because of the alleged tyranny of their measures , assumed for themselves the name of " Law and Order " party , and claimed to represent the respect of the community for peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra session of the General Assembly , held as soon as the rejection of the Landholders ' constitution was known , the first active step toward a suppression of the plans of the suffrage party was taken by the passage of the " Algerine Act , " which made it a misdemeanor , punishable by fine and imprisonment , for any person to act as moderator or clerk at any election meeting under the People 's constitution , and treason for any one to accept office under it . At the same time , Governor King warned the militia to be in readiness for service at thirty minutes ' warning . The passage of this act produced a great outcry from the suffragists , to . whose cause , indeed , it was a serious blow . Many persons who had gone thus far with them , finding now that the Law and Order party was in earnest and that nothing could be done without a resort to force , which their wisest leaders bad never sanctioned , fell away , and ceased to countenance or assist the party ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timid persons , scared by the penalties of the act . The governor and his council , after watching the preparations and listening to the threats of the suffragists for some time , still hoping that the trouble would blow over without action on their part , at length decided to act , and , distrusting the efficiency of the militia , applied to President Tyler for military aid , on the ground that Rhode Island was " threatened with domestic violence . " The President declined to grant the request , before an actual insurrection existed , promising , however , in that case , to come to the aid of the established government . President Tyler , who pursued a conciliatory course in this matter , with the usual fate of peacemakers , was berated by each party for not espousing its cause more decidedly ; but he seems to have followed the only course legally open to him , and to have given good advice to the excited disputants . The President 's letter , which was immediately published by the governor in a proclamation , still further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large portion of the party stood firm , and vehemently declared their intention to establish their constitution , " peaceably if they could , forcibly if they must . " On April i8 election meetings were held , and a full set of officers elected , including T. XV . Dorr as governor . On the 3d of May , according to the constitution , the People 's government was organized in Providence . The streets were crowded , and friends and foes watched with anxious interest to see what the revolutionists would do . The governor and General Assembly were escorted to the place of meeting by a procession of nearly two thousand people , including two military companies in uniform , who marched on either side of the carriages containing the officers-elect , having their muskets loaded , it was said , with ball-cartridge , and prepared to resist any attempt to // arrest lJr . Dorr or his colleagues or to interfere with the organization of his government . No such attempt was made , however , and the martial spirit of the troops was not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who enjoyed that possession which is nine points of the law , had closed and barricaded the State House , so the People 's legislature was forced to meet elsewhere , and they selected an unfinished building , intended for a foundry . It was not a very imposing senate house , being somewhat imperfectly protected from the weather and only partially floored . It contained but one room , in a part of which the House of Representatives assembled , while the Senate sat on a platform at one end , on the edge of which also sat the Speaker , in front of the Senate and overlooking the House . The two houses were soon duly organized and the officers sworn in , and in the afternoon Governor Dorr delivered his message , a calm and temperate document rehearsing the career of the suffrage party and justifying its course . The houses at once proceeded to business and , after requesting Governor Dorr to proclaim the organization of the government and communicate the same to the President of the United States ( which he presently did ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held on the next day ; some officers were elected , some criminal laws directed at the suffrage party were repealed , and resolutions passed demanding the surrender to the officers under the People 's constitution of the state property . The Assembly then adjourned till July . If the suffrage cause ever had a chance of success , or the People 's constitution a chance of becoming the acknowledged law of the state , it was at this point . The bulk of the state property was in the city of Providence , which was favorable to the suffragists . The failure to enforce the Algerine law had created some doubt of the purpose of the Law and Order party . If Mr. Dorr and his officers , supported by the armed men then at their command , had taken possession of the State House , Arsenal , and other state property , and acted as if they had confidence in themselves and their cause , the result might have been different . This was the course desired and advocated by Mr. Dorr , but he was overruled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit themselves , disturb the peace of the state , and provoke the Law and Order government , but not far enough to give themselves a chance of success . While the People 's government was being organized in Providence , the regularly elected General Assembly met on the same day at Newport , inaugurated the officers as usual , and passed resolutions declaring that an insurrection existed in the state and calling on the President for aid , which was again declined with good advice as to amnesty and concession , which was not heeded . On the following day , a member of the People 's legislature was arrested under the Algerine law , and this arrest was followed by others , which in turn produced a plentiful crop of resignations from that body . The Law and Order Providence Journal published several of these ; but presently announced that , as they had ceased to be news and came in such large numbers , it must cease to insert them except as advertisements . The rats were beginning to desert the sinking ship . No attempt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of one of his supporters , his father being one of the most vehement of the Law and Order party and his home therefore not a comfortable place for the People 's governor . An armed guard of suffragists was maintained about the house , who promised to resist any attempts to arrest him . At the request of his legislature , Mr. Dorr now went to Washington and unsuccessfully tried to secure the aid and countenance of President Tyler . He returned by way of New York , where he was welcomed and ffited by sundry Democratic politicians who embraced his cause , probably because many of its leaders at home were Democrats . He was given a reception in Tammany Hall , and made a speech , professing entire willingness to become a martyr , - " a profession , " says the New York American , " which is likely very soon to be put to the test . " From this meeting he rode to the boat in an open carriage , escorted by a procession and a band of music . Two New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , but this he wisely declined . His friends , however , met him on the way with an armed guard , by which he was // escorted to his headquarters and there installed under the protection of four pieces of artillery . He immediately issued a proclamation , in which he announced that armed assistance had been promised from other states , declared that , as soon as a soldier of the United States shall be set in motion against the people of this state , " he should call for such aid and resist force with force , and directed the military to prevent any further execution of the Algerine law . During Mr. Dorr 's absence , both parties were pushing on military preparations . The charter authorities caused the militia companies to be filled up and drilled , placed a guard in the State Arsenal , a strong stone building containing several pieces of artillery and a quantity of smallarms and ammunition , and called upon the citizens to arm for the defence of the city , furnishing all who applied with arms for this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same direction ; but though they succeeded in collecting a considerable quantity of arms , chiefly from without the state , they had some difficulty in finding men to use them , for in proportion as the regular authorities showed more energy , and the prospect of aid from the general government grew stronger , the number of active supporters of the Dorr government diminished , though enough still remained to hold meetings and pass very valiant resolutions . In fact , no contest of the same duration was probably ever so prolific of resolves and counterresolves , proclamations , letters , and manifestoes . But blood flowed much less freely than ink . The excitement at this time was naturally great , though many were still inclined to ridicule the popular fears , and the wildest rumors filled the air . Governor Dorr was accused of trying to raise an army of mercenaries in other states to invade Rhode Island , and of having promised his supporters that the city of Providence should be given up to pillage , its sons to slaughter and its daughters to outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Law and Order party , the rallying cry of the suffragists was " Beauty and the Banks . " Mr. Dorr at once saw that , if his government were not to die of inanition , some decisive step must be taken to assert his authority , and he determined to attack the Arsenal and take possession of the property there . He was not aware of the strength of the guard , and his own constancy and belief in the sincerity and steadfastness of men prevented his seeing the defection of many of his followers and the hesitation of those who remained . A summons was issued to his military forces , ordering them to muster at his headquarters on Tuesday , May i * . A large crowd assembled at the appointed time , and a small number of troops , consisting partly of regular chartered companies which had embraced Dorr 's cause , and partly of the volunteers who had been enrolled and drilled during the past few months . They were not well equipped , and were in numbers , as in all other respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early in the day a body of the volunteers marched coolly into the centre of the city to the armory of an artillery company , halted in the street before it , loaded their muskets and quietly took possession of the two field-pieces deposited there , without resistance from any one , and to the great surprise of a crowd of spectators . This movement convinced the last doubter that the Dorrites , as they were now called , meant business . Forthwith the governor was summoned from his residence , the military companies were ordered under arms , troops were summoned from other parts of the state , and hand-bills were scattered through the town , calling on all good citizens to arm and repair to the Arsenal for its defence . To borrow the words of a contemporary historian , " From the hoary-headed sire of seventy winters to the stripling just advanced to the verge of manhood , all ages and all conditions looked defiance , uttered the war-cry , and clad themselves for the battle-field . " At one o'clock on the *Sth of May , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts of his followers , warning them that the battle was at hand , and notified the garrison of the Arsenal to prepare for the attack . The attacking forces had already begun to disperse , and when at last they got under way , at two o'clock , they numbered only two hundred and fifty men , with the two six-pounders captured in the afternoon . With this force , the undaunted Dorr , who had never seen a battle or any other military operation , marched to the attack of a strong // building standing in an open plain , well garrisoned and well armed . Arriving at the spot , Dorr sent a flag to demand surrender of the post , which was contemptuously refused , causing great disappointment to many of the besiegers , who had expected the garrison to yield without resistance . The night was very dark and foggy and gave O**O rtunity to many of the attacking force to steal away unperceived , and to emissaries from the garrison to mingle with the ranks of the besiegers and report their weakness . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and the match applied . Again , quoting the same historian , describing the terrors of the night , " The heart of the devoted wife and the fond mother sickened with anguish , as she thought on all that was dear to her on earth and listened , with agonizing suspense , for the cannon s dreadful roar that might tell the tale of death and leave her a childless widow ! But , instead of a " dreadful roar , " the unfortunate cannon produced only a flash in the pan , - in short , refused to go off ; though the governor 's own hand applied the match . Perhaps the powder was damp ; I ) erhaps some enemy , under cover of the fog , had spiked the guns . The poet who , after the " war " was over , celebrated it in the Dorriad suggests another cause and thus describes the scene  --  " Th ' impatient chief looked on with ire ; Blanched was his cheek , hut ten-fold fire Was flashing in his eye . He threw his martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to s/ride - Give me the torch , ' with fury cried , And d it , let me try He seized the match with eager hand , While hackward his brave soldiers stand ; Three times he waved it in the air The cursed Algerines to scare , And hid them all for death prepare ; Then down the glowing match-rope thrust As though he 'd have the cannon hurst . Had they not Jut the ball in first , It very likely would ! The scanty force was melting away , meanwhile , and , unable to discharge his guns or to hold his men together , the unfortunate Dorr was obliged to withdraw the remainder of his troops , now amounting to about thirty men , to his former quarters . By nine o'clock in the morning , the charter government , by the arrival of mili tia from out of town and the mustering of citizens in arms , had gathered a considerable force . The mayor issued a request to citizens to close their places of business , which was generally obeyed , guards were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with excited crowds , some in search of martial glory , others merely gaping at the unusual sight . The force which finally set out to take the dreaded Dorr from the hands of his few remaining defenders amounted to upwards of seven hundred men , with twelve pieces of artillery . Arriving at the spot , they cautiously proceeded to surround the house where Dorr was supposed to be , no resistance , beyond threats , being made by the guard , and then to search for the late People 's governor . But the search was vain : Dorr had fled . Convinced that the people were not ready to support him in arms and that any further attempt at hostilities or resistance to the authorities would be useless , and that efforts would at once be made to seize him , he had left the state early in the morning , and was now in Connecticut . After some parley with the guard remaining at Dorr 's headquarters , who refused to allow their captured guns to be taken from them , but agreed to return them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and dispersed , without having discharged a gun , unless by accident . A reward of one thousand dollars was offered for the apprehension of Dorr , and for several weeks every effort was made to find him , but he evaded his pursuers and remained concealed . I ) uring this time , great uncertainty prevailed in the state , though nearly all fear had vanished . Some supposed that the attempted revolution had entirely collapsed ; but others , knowing Dorr 's perseverance , expected a renewal of the enterprise . The Dorr party , at first large and respectable , had been reduced by the defection of those who thought the Landholders ' constitution a sufficient reform , of those who disapproved the use of force , and those who were terrified by the action of the government , until now the leader , who was undoubtedly actuated by pure motives , was supported chiefly by an irresponsible body of those who had either gone too far to retreat or were led on by desire of excitement and hostility to the constituted authorities . Such followers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeat at the Arsenal , began to make preparations for a renewal of hostilities . In sundry towns the volunteers reorganized and paraded under arms , and efforts were made to collect munitions of war , which were at least so far successful as to fill the ears of the Law and Order party with stories of thousands of stands of arms , parks of artillery , hosts of men from other states , and the like . The friends of Dorr within the state were encouraged by those without who , at the safe distance of New York and Philadelphia , published glowing articles and held enthusiastic meetings in his favor . A fresh military demonstration in Providence seemed hopeless , but the village of Chepachet , situated about sixteen miles from Providence , offered marked advantages in the favorable disposition of its inhabitants , and in being but six miles from the Connecticut line , thus leaving open a convenient line of retreat to foreign soil . About June 20 , men , armed and unarmed , began to gather at this point , and presently they formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hill , a gentle slope overlooking the turnpike which led from Providence , through the village , to Connecticut . Alarmed at these proceedings , the General Assembly authorized the governor to proclaim martial law , which he did on June 25 , summoning also the militia from all parts of the state , and calling out the volunteer companies of the city . Sentries were posted along the city line and guards patrolled the streets . The Dorrite newspapers were suppressed in no very gentle manner , and the friends of Law and Order undoubtedly took advantage of their position to rebuke and chastise some of the opposite party with less respect foi their feelings and even their skins than they considered to be their due . Another of the florid historians of the period thus described the state of things : " The jails were soon filled with men who had been arrested and bound and brought to prison by armed free-booters . . . . The Sabbath was profaned and the church desecrated ; priests and deacons readily surrendered the temple of the Most High to bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode in the holy tabernacle . The stillness of the sanctuary was broken with the loud clanks of armor and the rude trappings ot an infidel soldiery . The church was converted into an arsenal , weapons of death were piled in the chancel , and men thirsting for blood surrounded the altar . Instead of anthems of praise and orisons of peace , the sacred choir resounded with beastly orgies , and the house of prayer became a den of thieves . Gangs of armed men , as ruthless as ever sacked a conquered city , patrolled the state ; dismay went before them and shame followed after . " This must probably be taken with at least a grain of salt . On Saturday , June 25 , Governor Dorr arrived at the camp in Chepachet . The gathering there had been without his orders , and he doubted its wisdom or prudence , but thought it best , since the men were there , to make another appeal to the people to sustain what he always considered their chosen government . He at once issued a proclamation calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to meet on that day at Chepachet , Providence being no l9nger available for the purpose . But before the 4th of July the last vestige of the People 's government had evaporated . There was whose numbers , in a day or two , reached three thousand , while at Chepachet , lodged partly in tents within the entrenchments on the hill , partly in barns and farmhouses in the village , was a motley crew , armed and unarmed , amounting , according to the rumor in the city , to eight hundred men , but according to Governor Dorr 's own account , never rising above three hundred . Among them was " the Spartan Band , " from New York , led by one Mike Walsh , a sort of knight-errant of the Bowery . The presence of these " foreign mercenaries " was a source of much concern to the Law and Order people , but they seem to have done no harm . The troops professed to be regularly organized . but little discipline was maintained . Soldiers came and went at will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life or fear of consequences prevailed ; visitors , friends and foes , came from all directions , inspected the camp , brought and carried away the news unmolested . At intervals , however , greater strictness was used . One dark night two // Law and Order men set out on a scouting expedition in a sulky . Reaching Chepachet about two o'clock , they were stopped by some Dorrite sentinels and taken into custody . In company with two other equally unlucky scouts they were presently bound and marched off to Woonsocket , twelve miles away , under a guard of thirty men with a cannon . One of the party , too stout to keep up with the regulation step , was assisted from time to time by the prick of a Dorrite bayonet in the rear . Similar treatment was accorded by the Law and Order troops to sundry suspects within their lines , whose houses were searched and themselves committed to prison on rather flimsy grounds , giving rise to loud complaints of " outrages , " which were described in a great quantity of affidavits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides had completed their preparations , but with very different results . In Providence a body of three thousand militia and volunteers were assembled , on the whole well armed , equipped , and organized . Orders were issued dividing the force into three divisions , which were to march upon Dorr 's camp on the 28th , from as many different directions , one in the rear between the camp and the Connecticut line , to cut off his retreat . On the other hand , in spite of all his exertions , Governor Dorr had been able to collect and hold together only about two hundred and fifty men , ill-armed and undisciplined . At last he saw the hopelessness of his position , realized that the people were not with him in the attempt to appeal to arms , and made up his mind to submit to the inevitable . He writes : " In dismissing our brave men at Chepachet , I had to perform a hard duty ; but being a duty , as I believed , it was done . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's divisions . Defeat or victory would have been honorable to us in the judgment of the world . But the people were not with us . XVe deemed it our duty not to fight against our friends and our enemies . " Accordingly , after consultation with his officers , he dismissed his men and ordered them to disperse and abandon the camp . It was presently deserted , and an hour after the dispersion of his forces , Governor Dorr left the spot and again retreated into Connecticut . At the same time , he despatched a letter for publication in one of the friendly newspapers in Providence , announcing the dismissal of his forces . This letter fell into the hands of the governor and council and caused them much satisfaction . Not relying entirely , however , on the voluntary dispersion of the insurgents , the Law and Order forces were still pushed forward , and on the morning of June 28 were in full march for the seat of war at Chepachet . The abandonment of the camp was not known , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless much the appearance of a holiday procession . Bands were playing , colors flying , militia companies in various brilliant uniforms were mingled with citizens in no uniforms at all , armed with all sorts of weapons , from a pistol to a spear , and the column was accompanied by a numerous body of spectators out to see the fun , some on foot , some on horseback , some in carriages or carts . Among these was Thurlow Weed , who had come from New York to watch events , and entered so much into the spirit of the day , that he attached himself to a company and marched the whole sixteen miles in the hot sun , without fatigue . As they approached Chepachet , they fell in with numerous stragglers from Dorr 's force , who were hanging about to see what happened , and were at once taken into custody and put under guard . At length they reached the foot of Acote 's Hill , from the top of which frowned down five cannon which Dorr 's men had neglected to remove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Order troops , the Dorrite battalions were lying behind their entrenchments , ready to pour a deadly fire into the devoted ranks of the assailants . The commanding officer of the advanced guard rode boldly up the hill , " every one expecting , " writes Mr. Weed , " when he reached the summit , to see him fall . " But he found only a deserted breastwork , with a few cannon , a broken ammunition wagon , and some dilapidated tents - not a living being was on the hill . The main body of the troops now came up , took possession of the village , taking also some more prisoners , and assuring themselves that the Dorr " army " had really disappeared . There was a slight scrimmage at the tavern in the village , which was kept by a // well-known sympathizer with Dorr . The reason of it was not very clear , unless it was the excited spirit of one of the Law and Order officers who , on being warned not to fire into the tavern , lest he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " did n't care a , if he could kill somebody . " The following announcement of this bloodless victory was sent , express , to Providence - " ORDERS , No. 54 . HEADQUARTERS , &amp;c . " The village of Chepachet and fort of the insurgents were stormed at a quarter before eight o'clock this morning , and taken , with about one hundred prisoners , by Col. Win . W. Brown . None killed , none wounded . " The officers of the victorious troops then established headquarters in a grove near the village , where hampers of poultry and game and baskets of champagne were presently spread out for the refreshment of the exhausted warriors . XVith patriotic toasts and speeches and recital of incidents of the campaign , the feast was continued till about six suvl. when the general and his army , triumphant and hilarious , returned to Providence , the procession graced by a hundred or more prisoners , bound with bed-cord and marching at the point of the bayonet . The only blood shed during the " war was on the night preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , a body of Dorr 's sympathizers and a crowd of lookers-on gathered in the town of Pawtucket . Their shouts and threatening demonstrations on former occasions had alarmed the good people of the town , and on this evening a company of militia had been sent to preserve order . The hostile demonstrations were renewed and the soldiers fired upon the crowd , slightly wounding several persons and killing one Alexander Kilby , who , as is usual in such cases , turned out to be only an inoffensive spectator . The reward for Dorr 's arrest was now increased to five thousand dollars , and he was pursued by a party which included some of his own relatives ; but he again escaped and found a refuge in New Hampshire , where Governor Hubbard received him with honor and refused to surrender him . In Rhode Island , the triumphant Landholders were actively at work , stamping out the remaining embers of the blaze . The General Assembly appointed a commission to examine prisoners , of whom a large number were now brought in . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up here and there by wandering parties of Algerine militia , who , no doubt , disregarded pretty often the courtesies , not to say the laws , of ruilitary discipline , and against whose alleged " barbarities " a great cry was raised by the Dorrites . The unaccustomed power conferred on the citizen-soldiers to enter and search the houses of persons whose supposed Dorrite plots had for some time been the terror of the community , and to terrify them by a display of arms and chains was a temptation not to be resisted . In one instance , a party searching for a certain Liberty Howard , supposed to be a dangerous person , were opposed by his mother , who thus describes what followed : he came up to me , laid his hands on me , and shook me and said in a very loud voice , Do you know that you are under martial law ? ' He then took his bayonet and put the point of the bayonet against the pit of my stomach : he pressed the bayonet against me and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and spiteful . The point of the bayonet went through my clothes and fractured the skin , but did not break it , but caused the blood to settle the size of a ninepence or larger . With my hand I knocked the bayonet away and he stepped back and looked at me with a stern look , and then went out of the house . " In another instance a " hired man " of a pursued 1 ) orrite , less bold than Mrs. Howard , was captured while attempting to crawl under a bed which was so low as to admit him only half-way . Most of the prisoners , after being detained a short time and examined by the commissioners , were discharged ; others were bound over and subsequently tried and convicted . Little damage was done to private property , though , during the occupation of the village of Chepachet by the charter troops , some liberties of this kind were taken , floridly described by the Dorrites as the " sacking of Chepachet , " which caused the loss of sundry pewter spoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the property of a damsel rejoicing in the name of Ripsy Tift . In June , 1842 , while the excitement was // still at its height , the General Assembly had called still another convention , which met in September and , under the leadership of the chiefs of the Algerine party , framed the present constitution , i*aking an extension of the suffrage nearly equivalent to that demanded by the suffrage party previous to 1841 . In November this constitution was adopted , and in May , 1843 , went into effect with a set of officers chosen from the leaders of the Landholders ' party , the same men who had always ruled the state . The suffrage provisions of the constitution of 1843 continued unchanged until i888 . About i 88o a new agitation for their enlargement was begun , the main point then in view being the extension of the suffrage to foreign-born citizens , not owners of land . After eight years of effort , this was accomplished by an amendment adopted in April , i888 . Order and peace had been now entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials over , and though party feeling ran high and the embers of the conflagration glowed under its ashes , the danger of an outbreak was past . The Dorr party had been defeated and had failed in their immediate object , the establishment of their constitution and the independent power of the people ; but they claimed , and probably with justice , that , without their . efforts , the Landholders ' party would never have yielded an extension of suffrage , or a reasonably satisfactory constitution . Early in August , Governor Dorr , who had remained beyond the reach of the authorities , against his own will and in deference to the wishes of his friends who still hoped , issued an address explaining and justifying his course and announcing that he should soon return to Rhode Island . Accordingly , on October 31 , he returned to Providence , without concealment , and registered himself at the principal hotel . Soon afterwards , he was arrested and committed to jail , without bail , to await trial for treason under the " Algerine " act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to the fairness or magnanimity of the court or of the Law and Order party . Under an unusual provision of the act , although all Dorr 's acts had been done in Providence County , he was tried in Newport , the most unfriendly county in the state . The jury was selected . from a panel of io8 , of whom 107 belonged to the Algerine party ; Mr. Dorr was given scant time to investigate them , and the jury , as made up , consisted entirely of his political enemies . Mr. Dorr conducted his own defence . He made no attempt to disprove the state 's case , but claimed a justification and undertook to show that the people 's constitution was lawfully adopted . This the court ( no doubt correctly ) refused to permit . Every point was ruled against Mr. Dorr , and the charge to the jury , while sound in law , plainly showed the opinion and wishes of the court . It was promptly followed by a verdict of guilty , and on this verdict Mr. Dorr , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp at Chepachet , was sentenced to imprisonment for life . In response to the usual question , whether he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced upon him , Mr. Dorr addressed the court in a speech , the closing paragraphs of which were as follows - " All these proceedings will be reconsidered by that ultimate tribunal of public opinion , whose righteous decision will reverse all the wrongs which may be now committed , and place that estimate upon my actions to which they may be fairly entitled . " The process of this court does not reach the man within . The court can not shake the convictions of the mind nor the fixed purpose which is sustained by integrity of heart . " Claiming no exemption from the infirmities which beset us all , and which may attend us in the prosecution of the most important enterprises , and , at the same time , conscious of the rectitude of my intentions , and of having acted from good motives in an attempt to promote the equality and to establish the just freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equanimity this last infliction of the court ; nor would I , even at this extremity of the law , in view of the opinions which you entertain and of the sentiments by which you are animated , exchange the place of a prisoner at the bar for a seat by your side upon the bench . " The sentence which you will pronounce , to the extent of the power and influence which this court can exert , is a condemnation of the doctrines of 76 , and a reversal of the great principles which sustain and give vitality to our democratic repub // tic , and which are regarded by the great body of our fellow-citizens as a portion of the birthright of a free people . " From this sentence of the court I appeal to the people of our state and of our country . They shall decide between us . I commit myself , without distrust , to their final award . " Declining an offer of liberation if he would take the oath to support the new constitution . Mr. Dorr went to prison and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of amnesty was passed , and he was released . A great concourse greeted him with cheers at the prison gates , and escorted him with music and banners to his father 's house , which he had not entered since he began his contest for the establishment of the People 's constitution . The newspapers all over the country , which favored his cause , congratulated him and spoke of the event as an act of tardy justice to a martyr in the cause of freedom and popular rights . At Cambridgeport a salute of one hundred guns was fired ; he and his principles were toasted and cheered at public banquets in Philadelphia and elsewhere ; he was invited to attend demonstrations in his honor in New York and Albany . But Mr. 1 ) orr 's active life was over . He had left the prison broken in health andi visibly declining to his end . Tb e close confinement , dlampness , and bad air had shattered his constitution , and fixed upon him a dlisease from which he never recovered . He lived nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . During this time , though he took no part in public affairs , there is nothing to show that he ever changed his opinion of the correctness of his principles or the legality and patriotism of his acts . In 1854 , Mr. Dorr 's political friends came into power in the state , and at once passed an act reciting that his trial had been unfair and illegal and his conviction unjust , and directing the clerk of the Supreme Court to write across the face of the record , the words , " Reversed and Annulled by order of the General Assembly . " Whatever satisfaction this may have given to Mr. Dorr , he did not long enjoy . He died December 27 , 1854 , aged fortynine years . lie had adopted a theory of constitutional law and political action which time and experience have caused to be generally discarded . Having no personal ends to serve , but abandoning bright prospects of professional and political success under the old order , he attempted to obtain for his fellow-citizens the privileges which he believed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the interests of others , which he believed to be right and patriotic , his firmness and logical consistency forbade him to abandon it , as a demagogue or self-seeker would have done , at a point where he might have avoided the final ( lisaster . The theories advocated by Mr. I ) orr and his party would now find but few defenders and can be seen to be unsound , though they were then sincerely believed in by many . In our political system , which is the liberty of law , reforms are to be safely sought and securely maintained only under the authority of law but this conflict , so stormy while it lasted , and the fires of which have even now scarcely died out , may remind the possessors of power that it is dangerous to withhold too long that which men regard as their right and upon which they have a reasonable claim .
