txt Serious charges have been preferred before the Governing Committee or the Stock Exchange against John B. Manning . a broker and dealer in bonds and investment securities at 14 Wall Street . He is one or the oldest members of the Exchange , and One of the best-known men on the Street . The charges , which are of a rather peculiar nature . have been the subject of rumor on the Stock Exchange for several days , but there was much mystery about the case because of the reticence observed by all persons concerned . The particulars were not learned until yesterday . The charges , which are being considered by the Governing Committee of the Exchange , set forth , among other things , that about a month ago Mr. Manning sold five one-thousand-dollar Missouri Pacific Railroad coupon bonds to a member of the Exchange , whose name is withheld , and that he delivered them to the purchaser as clean " bonds . A " clean " bond , in Wall Street parlance , Is one which might be said to be directly issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Manning have been married over thirty-fire years , and have seven children living , ranging in age from 31 to 21 years . Mrs. Manning complained that during the Summer of 1692 , while the family was occupying a cottage at Arverne , her husband beat her and drove her . from the house and used coarse and profane language toward her in the presence of her children . All the children sided with the mother . Mr. Manning lives in the house 134 West Thirty-fourth Street during the Winter , but spends the Summer in a. cottage at Arverne. and resold a number of times , passing through the hands of a number of different persons . and bearing upon it various indorsements . " Clean " bonds have a market value of from 3 to 5 per cent . above bonds that bear a number of indorsements , because there is always a possibility that the transfer or indorsements may prove to be Illegal or irregular . It is non- charged against Manning that the bonds sold by him as " clean " bonds had been purchased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the purchase they had upon them several indorsements , and that between the time of the purchase and the sale to a member of the Stock Exchange these indorsements disappeared . It is further charged against Mooring that he removed these indorsements or caused them to be removed by the use of chemicals , so that the paper appeared to the purchaser as . " clean " bonds . In this condition the bonds brought a higher price than if the indorsements had been allowed to remain . and Manning , if the charges are true , realized perhaps 6150 more than he would have done had the changes not been made . None of the members of the Governing Committee would talk about the matter yesterday . Francis L. Eames , President of the Stock ? Exchange , admitted that the charges had been made , but he refused absolutely to give any information about them . Under the rules of the Exchange , an accused member has ten days in which to answer charges made against him . The hearing before the committee will not take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governing Committee has no alternative but to expel the member . The evidence submitted to the committee was secured through discoveries made at the auction sales , and by tracing the bonds through the records of the company to the original holders . It was not known yesterday whether the criminal authorities have been consulted in the matter , but it is not probable that any court action will be taken , if at . all , until after the Governing Cornreittee'has disposed of the case . Mr. Manning was served with a copy of the . charges yesterday . He was visited subsequently by a reporter , and asked to give his version of the case . He declined to go into particulars , but said : " The bonds were payable to bearer , and they were in innocent hands . I think I will have no , difficulty in proving that the charges made against me are not true . " Mr. Manning is about sixty-five years old , and has been in Wall Street for many years .

Nothing has ever been published against his honesty . Mr. Manning , hoWever , gained unenviable notoriety through his family troubles . In May , his wife sued him for large sums of money which she alleged were due her through stock transactions , and which Mrs. Manning asserted he had failed to account for , and she also charged that he had failed to account for $3,500 belonging to her which had been on deposit in a. savings bank .
