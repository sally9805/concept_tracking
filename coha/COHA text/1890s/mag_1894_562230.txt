txt ON Sunday , November 19th , 1893 , in the The Sunday Democrat , a " Weekly Family Journal devoted to the Propagation and Defence of Catholic Truth , Irish Home Rule , Literature , Politics , Etc. , " published in New York City , there appeared the following petition and text of a proposed law : LET JUSTICE BE DONE . It is proposed to circulate the following petition in the 901 parishes of the State of New York , and secure the signature of the majority of the voters of the State : " TO THE LEGISLATURE OF TIlE STATE OF NEW YORK . " PETITION OF THE TAXPAYERS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE - ASSEMBLY DISTRIcT . " The petition of the parents and friends of the children attending the parish schools attached to the church of - showeth that we , the under . signed , desire to bring before the Legislature parental claims and grievances in respect to the education of our children , for which we crave consideration and redress . " As the State has made education compulsory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of the parental right , given by the law of nature , to educate our children in schools which possess our entire confidence , without our being subjectedon that account to financial loss or embarrassment . Our conscientious repugnance to send our children to any but Catholic schools for their education is insuperable . " The continually growing difficultier placed in the way of the maintenance of our Catholic schools , by the increasing number of children who attend them , make it every day more difficult to maintain those schools which alone meet our legitimate requirements . " The compulsion to pay rates towards the exclusive support of schools which our religious convictions do not approve is an injustice which we pray your honorable body to redress . " Your petitioners , therefore , humbly pray that the school fund be distributed , in due proportion , to every school whose efficiency in secular in // struction shall satisfy the Education Department of the State-proper facilities being afforded for securing the right disbursement of the money paid over from the rates , while the Catholic management of our schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty bound , will ever pray . " The following bill will be proposed by a Republican Senator at an early session of the next Legislature : " AN ACT FOR THE PROMOTION OF EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF NEW YORK . " ( Drafted by DENIs A. SPELLISSY , of the New York Bar . ) " The People of the State of New York , represented in Senate and Assembly , do enact as follows : " SEC. 1 . That whenever any individual , or body or association of individuals , or any organization of persons , incorporated or unincorporated , shall have established a school for the free education of youth in the primary branches of education , to wit , reading , writing , and arithmetic , and such school shall have been in existence for the term of at least one year , with not less than fifty pupils in regular attendance , and shall have been s4lbmitted to a satisfactory inspection and examination thereof by the State or local hoard of school trustees , or such other persons as may from time to time be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association or organization conducting or managing such school , shall be entitled to receive from the State ( or city , or county , or district ) each year a share of all State and other moneys now directed to be apportioned and distributed among the common schools , the same to be apportioned and distributed among them as directed to be apportioned and distributed among the common schools by Chapter 555 of the Laws of 1864 . " SEc. 2 . Such sums shall be paid annually from time to time ; provided , that such school shall be always open at reasonable times for inspection , as aforesaid , and that the pupils shall have passed a satisfactory examination at such stated times as may be determined by the board of school trustees in accordance with usages and regulations in force for the public schools of the State . " SEc. 3 . The provisions of this act shall apply only to primary and grammar schools , or schools in which the course of study is substantially equal to that in use in the public schools of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for introduction into the New York Legislatnre , distributing the public moneys raised for common-school education among all sorts and conditions of schools , has not been submitted to the officials of the Roman Catholic diocese of New York , and that the petition prepared and to be sent to the nine hundred and one parishes ( li . C. ) in this State is irregular and no notice should be taken of it unless the bishops give their consent . So say the intel-viewers in the New York papers . So far , so good ; but with or without the consent of the bishops ( R. C. ) , notice has been taken of it , and will be , and ought to be . // The Roman Catholic Church , the world over , is singularly skillful and subtle in political arts ; and it is possible at least that Mr. Spellissy and the editor of the Catholic Herald have been used for an end . Little elephants are often sent in first to try the depth of a river which the herd intends to cross ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture safely . This particular stream of strong , united , American public feeling about the common-school system is deep enough , I think , to drown the biggest elephants there are in America . Whether the Spellissy bill is now discredited , and whether it will be withdrawn from consideration , remain to be seen ; but the thing that is really discredited is the attempt to sectarianize public education , and that can not be withdrawn from consideration . I desire to deal with this question purely from the point of view of an American citizen . If I were dealing with it on the platform of a church congress , or in a periodical in the interests of the portion of the Catholic Church to which I belong , there are a good many things that I should feel bound to say which are out of place in an article of this sort . I should feel bound to enlarge upon the assumptions arid assertions of the Roman Chnrch , as witnessed over and over again , by utterances of her chief Bishop in Rome and of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere in the politics of every country in which she is placed ; as to the supreme authority of the Bishop of Rome to claim their allegiance before any allegiance which they owe to the government under which they live ; as to her emphatic and entire condemnation of the whole theory of public-school education ; as to the groundlessness of her claim to be , to the exclusion of all other Christian people , the Catholic Church , which Protestants have foolishly allowed her to do by giving her the name of 6*atholic , instead , of the name Roman , which she herself chooses in the Tridentine creed of Rome ; and so on . But I am speaking now simply as a citizen , and not as an ecclesiastic , and addressing , not members of any one religious body , much less of that to which I belong , but the American people . The Roman Catholic Church in America has posed a good deal before the public in civic affairs . She seems to be keeping a sort of perpetual feast of Assumption ; and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own ends is too patent to be denied . The mtscalled " freedom of worship bill " passed two // years ago in New York with a part of its sting taken out , and the enormous disproportion of money secured by her in Washington for her Indian schools , are evidence enough ; and now she is looking after the educational funds of the State . What Roman Catholics really think about common school education is not easy to discover because of the contradictoriness of their utterances on the subject . Just now Cardinal Gibbons , a Paulist Father , a layman of the New York Bar , and the editor of " a weekly family journal devoted to the propagation and defence of Catholic truth , Irish home rule , literature , and politics , " speak with the most distinct determination and with the most positive assurance , as to the rightfulness and necessity and possibility of securing this State aid for the support of Roman Catholic schools . On the other hand , the distinguished Archbishop of New York , with the lay trustees of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill and all sympathy with the movement . And the Baltimore Sun , whose proprietors are pronounced Roman Catholics , deals with the case in a most able and temperate editorial as to what they call " the unwelcome signs of a disposition on the part of a number of zealous but impractical people to revive the public school question in the acute form . " I am glad to quote later on the closing words of this most admirable article , earnestly desiring that we all might come to agree with its principles ; and that any discussion of the subject may be conducted with the same temperate courtesy which marks the language of the editor of the Baltimore Sun . Behind this present difficulty of discovering the real opinions of Roman Catholics on this subject , are previous , and more official , inconsistent and contradictory statements . There are three apparent propositions recently brought before the minds of American citizens . First , the insistence that all Roman Catholic children shall be kept away from common schools and forced to attend their own parochial schools . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be the plain statement of the Council in Baltimore . Secondly , that the State should take charge of the parochial schools and support them , the buildings with their teachers and furniture being handed over bodily , with the understanding that religious teaching should be given to the pupils out of school hours . This is the so-called // Faribault plan , as plain people understand it . Between these two things the infallible Head of the Roman Church has recently decided in a manner worthy of the oracle of Delphi , cordially supporting both plans , in spite of their absolute antagonism . And now comes the third scheme  --  to take the money raised for the education of all the children in the State and distribute it , *pro rctta , among all sorts of schools , private , religious , irreligious , anything , so the school is a year old and has more than fifty pupils . Minnesota has spoken with no little emphasis against Archbishop Ireland 's plan . I am disposed to think that before long New York will be not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . " And it looks as if the Roman Catholics would have to do what the rest of us do , support their own denominational schools . But the question has been raised , and it can not be put down , either by supercilious misunderstanding of the English language on the one hand , or by the use of violent language on the other . The Roman Catholic Church throughout the world is really two or three absolutely distinct and different things . Whatever one may feel about the schism which it is , and the schisms it has caused ; or , however deeply one may deplore the novelties with which it has overlaid the old faith ( which , like all novelties , being on the top are the things most thought of and most dwelt on by her people ) , these are not matters for discussion here or now . In spite of these , she is to every intelligent mind an ancient and venerable portion of the Christian Church ; and in her discharge of her ecclesiastical and religious duties , is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion , consistency and courage , which we should do well to learn . Beside this , she is a factor in the lives of thousands of people , citizens of our country , who are kept from evil living by her ministrations and control ; and when we consider the fact that the enormous majority of the crowded poor belong to her communion , that perhaps the most turbulent element in our citIzenship owes at least a faint and nominal allegiance to her authority , that without the control of her priesthood , we should be powerless to deal , except by brute force , with great masses of the workingmen of America ; we must certainly be ready to secure to her every opportunity for doing the legitimate work of a great Christian Church . Over and above this  --  and I say it // with no unkindness-since an overwhelming proportion of the inmates of our institutions of reform consist of her people , it seems right to me , provided no money for the support of religious services comes from the State funds , that her clergymen should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations . The Roman Church is also a beneficent institution , with multiplied and manifold Orders and agehcies of mercy and charity , in the support of which , and in their methods of administration , she is not only to be protected , but greatly admired and imitated by others . But beside all this the Roman Church is a tremendous piece of human machinery cleverly and cunningly devised , and sticking together with a coherency which , in spite of innumerable divisions of belief , opinions , and parties , presents an apparent organic , cohesive unity , which gives it great power . It is beycnd a peradventure that it is a great political force and factor . It is able to mass its adherents on almost any question , and it does not hesitate to say so in advance . The boast is made that this proposed petition , not yet , we are told by authority , sent out , will receive 800,000 signatures from the 901 parishes ( R. C. ) of the State of New York . And one of the Paulist Fathers says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own system . Of course this is not an intelligent expression , either of 800,000 or of 10,000,000 of individuals . It is merely a great flock of sheep following , not so much , the shepherd as the bell-wether . It is like the calling together of thousands of men on a strike , because a self-chosen leader orders it , though the individuals prefer to go on as they are . With her theory of the essential importance of definite religious teaching , as part of any thorough education , I have the most entire sympathy ; and while she founds parochial schools and maintains them herself , I have the most absolute respect for her consistency . But she has rio reason to come , in forma panperi* , to ask the State to aid her in this . For while multitudes of the poorest people are in her communion , she has enormous wealth , both in personal membership , in wisely acquired property , and , if rumor speaks true , in very large assistance from the Roman Propaganda . At this moment millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , on her educational institutions , which she is abundantly able to support . // It seems inconsistent with a spirit of any real martyrdom to complain of the hardship of what she is doing , as a witness to her convictions of duty and truth . When she comes , informa ecciesUe , to demand or to ask for help to train her children in her own way , then we say not only she has no reason , but she has no right to come . We may dismiss the question of the effect of breaking up this educational fund into various appropriations ; though it must be patent that it would destroy the efficiency of our chosen system of public schools ; would foster sectarian rivalries , and deepen the lines of religious division . The editor of the Sun suggests what I think is plainly involved in this , that if the public money were to be divided between parochial and public schools , " an immediate demand would be heard from Protestants that Catholic ( R. C. ) teachers should retire from the public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This would be the practical destruction of our commonschool system . It would divide the nation 's children , its future citizens , into two opposing camps , and breed in time the same sharp and bitter antagonisms that have proved such fruitful sources of disturbance to the political and social peace of European countries . " We may also dismiss the apparent generalness of the bill , in providing that all or any other people may ask for and get the same thing . The title of the bill answers itself . The American way " to promote education " is to increase common schools , and not to multiply private enterprises ; and the fact remains that among the most fundamental principles of this general government is the absolute separation of Church and State . And the use of State money for Church uses is at once the lowest and the most dangerous place to begin to break it down . Make out of it what one will , it is impossible to escape the fact that every penny of public school money given to any religions body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , and the result of that taxation to further and support the religious tenets of that body . We can afford , it seems to me , to take and hold a firm and quiet stand upon this inherent principle . Next to this is the other question of " rights " We are very much given to talking about this word as implying a good many things to which it is not applicable . We ought to be far more concerned with duties than with rights . It is the duty of the State to protect itself and its people from the misery and sin of ignorance , but it is not the right of any child to demand this // from the State . It is the duty of every Church and of every Christian parent to protect itself and its children from the misery and sin of irreligion ; but this must be done by the Church or by the parent ; and it is neither the duty of the government to do it , nor the right of any individual or of any Church to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these two principles is an irresistible vantage - ground . I am forced to say a word about the distinction , which some of us are said to make between Roman Catholics and Americans . It is quite true in certain ways that they are American citizens , by naturalization or by birth ; by the right of protection from the flag under which many of them fought gallantly ; and in many instances , by their loyal love of their adopted country . Very many of their people , left to themselves , would forget their other allegiance . But their leaders keep it up . The bishop across the sea has no idea of letting go of it . Their public documents assert it positively ; and their strong religious associations , their virtual separation from all the rest of American citizens in their religious life , their undisguised contempt for all Protestant bodies , their religious exclusiveness , their clannishness , make them a sort of " empire within an empire . " And if the question ever came , which God forbid , between their yielding obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman authority , large numbers of them would be almost compelled to surrender political loyalty to what they thought the higher law . The alienism of Roman Catholicism does not depend upon the citizenship of its people , three-fourths or all of them , by birth or by adoption for two generations or for twenty . It depends upon the fact that their first allegiance is owed to a foreigner , stripped of all temporal power even in his own country , but convinced that it belongs to him by divine right , and claiming an absolute and infallible authority and control over everybody and everything everywhere . And it depends no less on the effect produced upon conscience and character , by its peculiar system of mental and moral training . No system of any kind ought to be judged by its results , where they have been wrought out under circumstances and conditions which limit or control them . Anarchy , for instance , is not as bitter or as blasphemous in America as it is in Russia , because it is modified by a certain atmosphere of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much set against the limited authority of our free institutions , as against autocracy itself . Unbelief is less blatant in a Christian country than it was in unmitigated heathendorn , because necessarily it is modified by its Christian surroundings , of which it partakes , and which it imbibes , and is influenced by , to a degree . And in the same way , extreme Romanism , partly from policy and partly from unavoidable influence , is less absolutely papal , in certain appearances , in America than it is iu Mexico or in Spain . It is held in abeyance . But , as it can , and where it may , the essential tendencies will betray themselves . I do not believe that the majority of the Roman Catholic people are at heart un-American , any more than I believe that the great majority of workingmen who go on a strike act intelligently or willingly . But the leaders in both cases are extremists . They have control , and they use it ; and the wise thing now to do is to go behind professions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , like the claim of the number of Roman Catholics in the northern army during the civil war ; and to see what are the inflexible assertions of her unchanging policy . Agnostics , indifferentists , may afford to be careless as to religious results . But the civil questions concern every citizen ; and Roman Catholic citizens ought to weigh this as well as all others . Two or three specimens of the root principles and claims of Rome must suffice . The episcopal oath of allegiance to the Bishop of Rome contains the promise " to persecute to the utmost heretics , schismatics , and rebels against the pope . " The Encyclical of Pius IX . anathematizes almost every proposition of what we know as civil or religious liberty , e. g. , liberty to profess the religion a man believes , the system of instructing youth apart from the Catholic faith , the separation of Church and State . This is the paper of which Mr. Gladstone said that it " required every man to forfeit his moral and mental freedom and to place his loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel , as strongly as any man can , the unfortunateness of introducing any question that touches upon religion into civil and political matters . But if Rome chooses to introduce it , she must take the consequences , and not vituperate those who oppose her schemes . Out of this contention and controversy , indiscriminate abuse and violent denunciation certainly ought to be // kept . But truth must be stated baldly and plainly ; and it is somewhat difficult to avoid strong and almost severe language , under the excessive provocation of Roman arrogance and assumption . I think that we outsiders are largely responsible for this . To begin with , she has been allowed without protest to take and use the name of " the Catholic Church , " when really her own self-chosen definition in the creed of the Council of Trent is " Roman . " In this very last year , we have rather applauded and certainly accepted her claim , which has put her into curiously public prominence* that we are indebted to her for the discovery of America ; without stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , either that Columbus discovered North America , or that it was in the interests of the Roman Church and so gives her a pre-emptive right of ecclesiastical possession and control . Some few people have protested against this , but their voices have been drowned in the popular clamor , which played chorus to the loud assertions of the Church . And in this same year , with a sort of feeling that really we have been complimented and honored by a great personage , our newspapers have been taken up , either with tie difficulties of Dr. McGlynn or IDr . Burtsell , or with the differences between Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Corrigan , or with the movements of Monsignor Satolli , who could not have been more notorious , if he had been Plenipotentiary Extraordinary from all the sovereigns of Europe to all the United States ; instead of being the powerless envoy of a single bishop , to settle or unsettle the ecclesiastical quarrels of his own Church . And while in all these ways , and in some other ways by no means so creditable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit by , delighted with the dream that somebody is Americanizing Roman Catholicism . Such things make it hard to use temperate language in denouncing the tireless and vigorous schemes of self-aggrandizement . But we are on the defensive in this matter behind good breastworks , with an overwhelming majority on the American side , when the issue is finally raised . The Roman Catholic Church is committed by a tradition of centuries , by the history of almost all countries in the world , to perpetual political interference . It has cost her the choicest jewels of her crown in England , on the continent of Europe , and in Japan . But she can not let it alone . And we can not afford not to read // the experiences of the past into the appearances of the present . Thank God , the day is passed when religion can resort to the secular arm to maintain its demands . And let ns pray God that the day is passed when such demands may be met by the violence of men . But it will not do to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period " were due to the violence of Protestant denunciations . They were due to what lay behind the denunciations , the intrusions and interferences of Rome in public and civil affairs . It is very easy for Ahab to say to Elijah , " Art thou he that troubleth Israel ? " ; but the truth is that Rome was the troubler then , and will be now , unless all temptation to this kind of thing is positively removed . Let me quote again the wise language of the Baltimore Sun : " We regard this whole agitation , therefore , as unwise . Catholics and Protestants have lived together in peace and mutual respect , and their children have met on the neutral ground of the free public school , with the inevitable result of knitting them in the bond of a common patriotism for forty years past . To array them now against each other will be a lamentable thing . We want no more fuel provided for a second know-nothing conflagration . Let the public schools alone . Leave private schools of every sort and name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have peace . ' Such words give one almost the hope that there is power in the appeal , to remind Rome to keep within the limits of her legitimate sphere . Even if that may not be , the appeal ought to be heeded , which the present opportunity makes to all intelligent , non-Roman citizens , to arrest the movement at the start , and to put up now a barrier which shall prevent the recurrence at any future time . Take away the possibility , and the attempt will not be made . Once let it be seen and known that the enormous majority of American citizcns , willing to respect the Roman Catholic Church and to protect her in her rights , will not tolerate any ecclcsiastical interference , forcign or domestic , with our established system of education , or with our national and political affairs , and the agitation will stop . And the only way to do this , is neither by interviews , nor violent controversy , nor by the defeat of the movement in a single year ; but by submitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an amendment to the Constitution ; and , this year , by submitting to the Constitutional Convention in this State , an amendment to our State Constitution , absolutely prohibiting the use of any State patronage or public money in the interests of any religious body at all.
