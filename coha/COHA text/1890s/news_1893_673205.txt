txt We showed a few days ago how the coffee trade had been affected by the imposition of retaliatory duties on certain products of Venezuela , Colombia , and Haiti . In the year 1891 about one-sixth of the quantity of coffee consumed . in this country was brought from these countries , the average monthly imports from them being 7,300 , - 000 pounds . But for the seven months ending with January last the average fell to 2,000,000 pounds , and . in that month the quantity procured from the three countries mentioned was less than 850,000 pounds . This change has been caused by the exaction of a duty of 3 cents a pound under the terms of Mr. IlAanisoN 's retaliatory proclamation . The effect of this discriminating duty has been to increase the cost of certain kinds of coffee brought from other countries , to decrease our exports to the three countries directly affected by the proclamation , and otherwise to disturb injuriously the natural movement of trade . It seems to us quite probable that these retaliatory duties that were imposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be considered apart from the reciprocity agreements , and they are clearly injurious to our own people . The exports of the three countries to the United States have been reduced , our own exports to the same countries have fallen off , and in addition the people of this country have been required to pay a new tax . If these be the results of retaliatory reciprocity , the loss we have of it the better for everybody .
