txt It is manifest that our excellent old . friend Prince Bismarck , ' being no longer in a position to control the destinies of nations , has determined to ' devote his de- , cjining years to promoting their gayety . He announced . some time ago that he should free his Mind in the Reichstag from time to time , but np to this date he has contented himself with posing as " Sage . " A Sage With the Mischievousness of a monkey seems to be a contradiction in terms , but there is a great deal of mischief in BISMARCK . Even when he was a Prime Minister he was not always able to repress his love of practical joking . Now that he is irresponsible , it is no wonder that he lets himself go and . reverts to the days of his wild and happy youth , when he vindicated the dignity of Prussia by lighting up a large porcelain pipe under the nostrils of the Austrian Ambassador . Nothing could be more calculated to infuriate his august ex-master than this line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ august master is as deficient ashislate Chan cellOr is abounding in the sense of humor . When BISMARCK imparts , in the slippered. and unbuttoned ease of mind and body which is his notion of a dignified . retirement , his views about things in general to the correspondent of a Paris newspaper , the young Emperor is sincerely persuaded that he blasphemeth , and it is natural that he should command the actual Chancellor to explain BISMARCK away . This the actual Chancellor has done by a diplomatic circular explaining to the powers that at present the utterances of Prince BISMARCK are merely those of a private gentleman . There is a supplementary explanation of this explanation to the effect that the explanation is merely an official notification of BISMARCK 'S retirement , but this is merely comic . Even as the slow course of diplomacy goes , the Foreign Offices must be siikrtled at the appearance of this piece of news at this date . The notification will rightly be taken , even in the Foreign Offices , as an expression of the imperial ignorance and solicitude . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor wonders " what he is going to do next , " and he takes superfluous pains to absolve himself from it in advance , whatever it may be . The official notification of BISMARCK 'S retirement is equivalent to one of those advertisements from deserted . husbands that occasionally appear . " Whereas , " the Emperor means to say , " my man OTTo VON BISMARCK has left my bed . and board , with no matter what cause or provocation , this is to give notice that I will be responsible for ' no debts of his contracting , not any opinions of his expressing . " The disclaimer is superfluous , but none the less , to resume our simian similitude , it will be " nuts " to Iksmanox . What the practical joker above all longs for is to " " produce a reaction " and . to elicit evidences of irritation on the part of his victim . This evidence is officially furnished in the notification , - which will have filled Bisivauck with delight , and must stimulate him to further frankness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as in Germany , try to account for his goings-on by the supposition that he has been incorrectly reported . This supposition is overthrown by the fact that he has not said . so himself , though he has never shown the least hesitation in saying so when he had been incorrectly reported , or , for the matter of that , when he had been correctly reported . If the Emperor had any appreciation of BISMARCK 'S character , he would have foreseen that to warn Europe that BISMARCK 'S remarks no longer commit the Government of Germany would be precisely the proof of success that would . complete BISMARCK 'S enjoyment of his own freedom of speech . Undoubtedly there is a serious side to this farce , as nobody knows better than the leading low comedian himself . Brsaranos is doubtless as patriotic a German as he ever was , but naturally patriotism does not seem to him now to consist in a blind devotion to the house of Hohenzollern so much as it did - when attachment to the house of Hohenzollern meant subserviency to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany as the author of German unity and . the creator of the German Empire . He simply does not mean that his great achievements shall make political capital for an administration by which he considers himself - to have been shabbily treated . He has already succeeded in detaching his fame from the patrimony of the young Emperor . The official disclaimer of his utterances was not only superfluous , but ' will be quite useless . With his medieval way of looking at things the Kaiser imagines that BISMARCK derived all his importance from his official place as a servant of the German Crown , and loses it with his retirement . This is a huge mistake . When BISMARCK chooses to speak seriously upon any public topic , he has the rare gift of being able to give the same weight to his words as if he never permitted himself to lapse into buffoonery . His ' words will no longer carry the same kind of weight as when he had . the power of enforcing them . Nevertheless his view of German interests will be taken , - within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far wider and wiser view than those a the young Kaiser and the unknown CAPRIVI , and no possible disclaimer of it as unofficial can alter that important fact .
