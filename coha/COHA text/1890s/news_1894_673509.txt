txt The action of the railroad Presidents and managers of the Trunk Line Association , inspired by the plain and vigorous speech of President Depew of the Central , seems to have had a bracing effect . At all events , it averted what threatened to be a disastrous rate war , and it must have left an enduring impress upon the minds of railroad managers beyond the domain of the association . The picture of the destructive consequences of a rate war In these times was not overdrawn by Mr. Depew , nor did he urge too strongly the importance to railroad managers of adhering to mutual obligations for the protection of common interests . Rate wars are not only disastrous to that part of the public who are investors in railroad property as holders of  --  the securities of the corporations , but they are injurious to all business interests and to the whole public . The proposal to abandon all agreements because . one member of the association had violated its obligation by a secret contract for a cut rate in a certain class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare in an effort to rid it of rats , President Depew 's substitute for this proposal , which was adopted by the Trunk Line Association , included a renewal of pledges to carry out contracts in good faith , an agreement to bear pro rata any damages that might be assessed in getting rid of the secret contract of the offending member , and a further agreement " under legal advice to a contract to pay a penalty of $10,000 whenever the Commissioners adjudge any one of us guilty of rate-cutting or paying commissions . " A renewal of pledges does not of itself mean very much . A con -- tract is not greatly strengthened by mere reiteration . Sharing the consequences of repudiating a contract which could never be enforced is a small matter . The gist of the new agreement is in the penalty clause , and like the rest of it , that is chiefly for added " moral effect , " notwithstanding the " legal advice , " for if the voluntary contracts of railroad Presidents and managers with each other can not be enforced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their violation can not be exacted with the aid of any legal machinery . That is the fundamental weakness of all these " gentlemen 's agreements " and " voluntary contracts " for the maintenance of rates or the division of traffic . They are not binding in law , and can not be enforced . In fact , they are inconsistent with the recognized principles of the common law , which favor free competition in all traffic . They may be bound about by repeated pledges and promises and consecrated by the sanctions of honor , but they will not hold , if parties to them refuse to be bound by considerations of that kind in the stress of competing efforts for business . It has to be admitted that in the railroad business , as it has developed in this country , unfettered competition may be the life of trade for a time , but it is death to the corporations in the long run . All discussion of this problem inevitably comes around to the necessity of ' giving a binding force in law to contracts under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution that appears practicable . That is what the railroad managers are asking for , and upon it the discussion of the railroad situation tends to concentrate .
