txt There is a closer likeness than might have been expected between " The Black Crook " of 1892 and its noble , historic predecessor , " The Black Crook " of 1809 . Barrios , Wheatley . Palmer , G. Burnett , Lizzie Wilmore , and a host of others concerned in the spectacular stage production at old Niblo 's that startled and charmed , amazed and instructed Now-York in the " flush " times just after the close of the civil war are all dead , and if any person is employed in the present revival who took part in the original performance of Durres 's infantile play she is only some comparatively obscure member of the corps do ballet whose name is not printed on the house bill . Yet our dim remethbrance of the scenic effects in the first " Black Crook " convinces us that Mr. Eugene Tompkins has not been less lavish in the use of money , paint , and tinsel than his predecessors . The ballet was certainly never larger in numbers and the costumes were never richer . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a century , and the electric light that was not invented in 1866 is employed with striking effect in the revival . Firo flashes from the lingers of the arohtiend while he is making his dread compact with old Herzog , and the incandescent globes that are made to give weird effects in this scene are used ingeniously and in great numbers to add light and color to the scenes of restivitY . Mr. Barras'e text is found to be as naively Inane as ever . Probably no work so utterly worthless as this ever gained so great distino'non . Rut the text is quite as well spoken as ever it was . The new Rudolph Is as plump and vociferous in his misery as George Bonifaeo used to be , and Mr. Springer , the new Herzog. is quite as malignant as the historic MortonNo one can hear what the fairy queen says to Rudolph , but probably no one wants to ; and it is not news that the Academy Is too large a theatre for a person who has not undergone severe vocal culture to attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance , In which eve encounter many romindets of other plays which had pleased Mr. Barras , was strangely fated to become the medium of an exhibition tending to shook the moral sense of a community unused to license in the theatre . It was the appearance of the four dancers in the pas de demote that caused the greatest excitement at the first performance . These smiling young ladies tip-toed to the front of the stage clad in trunks and tights without a single skirt to their names . New-York had never seen anything like that before . There was a gasp , a tremor of surprise , and then a burst of applause , and the pas de ( 15 ; nem began and continued for more than a hundred nights . New-York in 1tsi12 is not to be so easily startled . The costuming in this revival is as frank as possible . and there is a dance by four coarse and ugly Frenchwomen of mature years , who wear reasonably ample skirts , which is bolder and more reprehensible than the demons ' dance of 1866 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public . The wild applause that followed their antics last night was probably started by men who spend their mornings in bed and their afternoons at the race track , and it was almost drowned in hisses . The French " quadrille dancers " can well be spared . This Is a feature of Mr. Tompkins 's " Black Crook " that was not found in the original . There are others . The " variety show " was introduced in the third act of the spectacle some time in the seventies . Mr. Tompkins clings to this innovation with doubtful sagacity . We are likely to have too much of the " variety show " in New-York before this season is finished . Nothing among his " specialties " is particularly good except the balancing feats of Fielding . Eight girls imitate in pantomime Mr. Edward Harrigan 's types of the New-York - tough , " male and female , to the tune of " Maggie Murphy 's Home , " and the coming of Miss Lottie Collins is anticipated noisily and showily but with no great amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy tumblers , but the Greppo is a pantomimist and acrobat of excellent skilL Carline. who used to be a ballad-singing soubrette , is now a music-hall girl , with that peculiar singing voice and manner that is cultivated in the modern " variety show . " The scenery is showy and glittering . The combinations of color are often more daring than judicious , but Me general effect is not bad . The changing light effects in the incantation scene are cleverly managed , and this is perhaps the picture that bears the closest resemblance to art . The rest is spectacle . But everything is expensive and new . The ballot is led by four dancers new to our stage ? " tole Tornaghi .

The Academy was jammed to the doors last night . There were many old-stagers among the spectators anxious , if possible , to renew their youth ; but do Leon 's fabled Spring is not to be found in East ' Fourteenth Street . A distinguished General of the civil war was conspicuous in the parquet circle , and an eloquent and amiable pact had made the weary journey from a remote rural hamlet . The performance was remarkably smooth . and the transformation scene was exhibited at midnight . When Mr. Tompkins has sent his quadrille dancers back to France and dispensed with the services of a superfluous female gymnast whose trapeze " act " is merely tiresome , his ? ?
