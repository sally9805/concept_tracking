' * They had everything their own way for nearly three months , when it was discovered that several of ournumber hadbeen murdered by them . This knowledge stirred us up a good deal , and we soon sent out a petition to the authorities praying for some interference in our behalf . They granted our request at once , and sent in twenty or thirty of their best men , armed with revolvers , to assist us in hunting out the desperadoes . In the course of three hours some two hundred of these raiders were pointed out by the different prisoners , who could easily do so as soon as all fear of the consequences was removed . They were placed under a special guard , and marched outside that they might receive a fair trial . In fact , the captured raiders were taken outside at their own request , as the multitude of prisoners were so excited and enraged that they could expect but little mercy at our hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared not proceed against these men , either by court martial or by any civil law that could be had in that vicinity ; but that he would allow us to organize a court , judge , and jury , and try our prisoners , as he called them , by a court of our own ; and that he would render all the assistance in his power in guarding the prisoners for us , and in furnishing proper facilities for executing the sentences that the court might impose . This court was quickly organized . The judge to preside was selected by ballot , and the jury was drawn from a panel of a thousand . The prisoners had the privilege of pleading their own case , or of employing any one within the stockade to plead for them . Two attorneys were selected , from anumber of that profession among us , to proceed against the prisoners . The trial continued six or eight days . It was conducted as fairly and honorably as was possible under the circumstances ; and forty or fifty of the two hundred arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punishment by the " cat-o ' - ninetails , " to be " bucked and gagged , " to restore property where possible , or otherwise punished , as the nature of the case seemed to require . Six of the number were clearly found guilty of murder in the first degree , and sentenced to be hung within the stockade upon two days ' notice.1 Wirz furnished the material for a scaffold , and guarded the six unfortunate ones until the appointed day , then delivered them over to us for execution without further assistance on his part . 1 The murderers were given the privilege of rejecting jurors , and they exercised that privilege till they were tired of it , and allowed a jury to go on . THE HOMES OF ANDEESONvILLE . ( FROM A PHOTOGEAPH. ) // Of the two hundred men who were thus tried there were probably a few en tirely innocent of any crime , while nothing could be absolutely proved against one hundred and twenty of them ; yet as their trial ended , and they were set at liberty within the stockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - a thousand or more emaciated human beings stand ing ready to administer a bloxv , a kick , or at least a curse and muttered execration , to those who in a measure had added to our sufferings , even though * no act could be proved against them by * the court . * Two days later a scaffold was hastily H * erected near the south gateway , within the stockade .

These ex * ecutions effectually put a stop to plun * der and murdering . In order to induce twelve men to take the responsibility * of executing these six murderers they were promised by Wirz to be paroled * and sent within the Union lines . This * promise I think Wirz kept , because I * never saw them afterwards . * A league had been formed by the * better class of prisoners , several days be * fore the executions , for the purpose of pro * tecting our lives and scant property ; and it was by the aid of this league , headed by a character known as " Big Pete , ** that these raiders were brought to justice . This league , or " police , " as they were called , was ever after kept up , and constituted itself into a complete government for the stockade within the dead-line . " Big Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish all offenders against the public peace . After the executions above mentioned , he was judge , jury , chief of police , and often he executed his own sentences . He settled all // disputes between individuals , applied the *&gt; * " freely in punishment of petty thieving , bucked and gagged for graver offenses , appointed the night and day patrol within the prison limits from men of his own selection , and was generally a terror to the evil-doer but respected and a blessing to the great mass of prisoners . " Big Pete " had a kind heart , and there was many a poor fellow who could speak of the acts of kindness received at his hands . During the last part of our stay nearly all of the rations issued consisted of " cow peas stewed to a mush ; often large masses of them were half cooked , and other masses burnt black ; generally they were issued without salt . These rations were brought in large dry-goods boxes drawn into the pen by four-mule teams . Each team was driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each wagon received a guard of four to six men as it entered the stockade . The guard evidently sought the oJ ) portunity thus to enter the stockade for the sake of a chance to trade , in a small way , with the prisoners , generally for the brass buttons off our coats , needles , jack-knives , knickknacks , and very slyly for greenbacks . When the guard were thus occupied by anything but their business , some of the more enterprising of our number would crawl under the dry-goods boxes , as they were emptied and loaded back upon the wagon , and ride safely out of the stockade . The fact that the guard left the teams at the stockade , and that the teams had to go nearly half a mile to reach the cook-house , away from the immediate neighborhood of all the guards , gave those who rode out an excellent chance to come from under the boxes at their leisure . uL . XL. - Si . There were also about two hundred of our men paroled out of the prison-pen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , so that the enterprising prisoner , as he emerged from his hiding-place , could stroll around during the day and with a little shrewdness not be distinguished from the paroled men . This trick was played very freely for several days , until too many men began to be missed at roll-call , and several were finally caught in the act . Many escapes were also made through the tunnels , and by straggling from the squads sent out after wood . Over one hundred men went out one night through a single tunnel , but within ten days they were all brought back , killed or badly torn by the hounds - a pack of eight or ten bloodhounds being kept by one or two experienced negrohunters in the vicinity of the prison . No doubt a very few did finally make their escape good to the Union lines , but I have never been able to learn of one well-authenticated case from Andersonville . There was one tunnel which was the innocent cause of much fear and alarm to our guard . I knew nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not only to ourselves , but also to the guard . Sometime in August one of those sudden and terrible thunder-storms so common in hot countries occurred , and it so sx**e1led the small brook running through the stockade that its outlet , hewn between a few of the timbers set in the bed of the brook , would not allow the immense volume of water to pass ; consequently the stockade acted as a dam , so that the water rose within an hour nearly to the top of the timbers , completely flooding the four acres of swamp . Some fifty yards along this part of the stockade , each side of the brook , the soil was more sandy than the common red clay of the remainder of the prison , and the tunnel in question was in this vicinity . The water soon found it , and undermined the stockade , so that in a few moments a large breach was made , and with a rush the flood immediately passed through . This frightenedthe guards so that they jumped from their posts and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes several shots from the cannon were fired over the prison , and warning shouted to us that if there were any signs of a crowd collecting anywhere within the prison they would pour into that crowd grape and canister . It was at first supposed by both prisoners and guards that the stockade had been purposely undermined . At the time of the flood which caused the break in the stockade the lightning , which was almost incessant , seemed to strike in several places within the stockade , at one spot GRAVES OF THE SIX RAIDERS HUNG JULY II , 1864 . ( FRoM A PHOTOGRAPH. ) // killing several of our number . It struck , or seemed to strike , at one place about fifty yards from my own shelter and just within the deadline . I noticed that several were prostrated by the stroke , and I immediately walked over to the spot , with many others , to see what damage was done . I found an ugly-looking rent in the ground , out of which was flowing a clear , copious stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet within the dead-line , on the east side of the inclosure and fifty or sixty yards above the spot where the brook entered . The general belief among all the prisoners in that vicinity was that the spring was opened by the lightning , and the fact that it was so opened was not questioned till years afterwards . It looked as though the electric fluid had found vent at this place from the overcharged earth . Be that as it may , this spring gave us pure , sweet water , and in sufficient quantity , from this time out so long as the place was occupied as a prison ; and I have been told that it was still a living spring twenty years afterwards . The prison authorities fixed a wooden trough to conduct the water over the dead-line within our reach - about the only act I ever knew them to perform spontaneously that had the slightest leaning towards mitigating our wretched condition . We knew that a league was just being formed , termed the " Union League , " composed of the ablest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not become sufficiently organized for work , or even to take advantage of the breach after it occurred . But the incident opened our eyes to the possibilities with such a league in working order and properly officered , so we exerted ourselves to perfect it ; but it was not long before the authorities seemed to have become aware that such a league was forming or had already formed , and strict orders were circulated within the prison forbidding the prisoners to collect in any crowd , under penalty of being fired into from the batteries , except under the orders of the prison authorities for the purpose of roll-call . Further to check this league formation they sent in spies , disguised as prisoners , with the new batches that were brought in . These spies were so shrewd as to become members of the league , and , with 1 In his memoirs , " Advance and Retreat , " General John B. Hood says , with reference to the fall of Atlanta , " The presence of thirty-four thousand Federal prisoners at Andersonville rendered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in order to prevent the Federal commander from turning loose this large body , ready to wreak its illwill upon our people . " On July 27 , before the fall of Atlanta , General John II . Winder issued the following order to the officers at the information they gave , completely broke it up . The question has often been asked of Andersonville prisoners , " Did the commander of the prison , Captain Henry Wirz , ever really murder a prisoner ? " Yes , and under my own personal observation . On one occasion he rode into the stockade accompanied by two or three attendants also on horseback ; the object of his visit was to demand that the chief of the Union League be delivered up to him . Of the crowd that collected about him not one in fifty knew that such a league existed , and of the actual members of the league but few knew who the chief was . Wirz was very soon informed to that effect , which seemed to rouse the demon within him , so that he swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon turned to retire from the prison , and while nearly within the gateway drew his heavy revolver and shot the whole six barrels into the crowd of emaciated , starving wretches who had collected about him . Without stopping to discover the effects of his shooting , he put spurs to his horse , sprang out through the gate , and galloped away from the stockade . Two men were killed outright by his shots , and several others were wounded . Soon after the 1st of September we learned , from some of the prisoners brought in , that Sherman had captured Atlanta ; 1 and it was evident from the actions of our guard that they were growing uneasy . Reports were circulated with increasing vigor that we were soon to be exchanged by way of Savannah . Many believed it ; others did not . Sometime after the middle of September , one day everything was bustle and confusion , as one detachment after another was marched outside the stockade , and again loaded into box-cars ,  --  as always , sixty in a car ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all we should get for three days . The rations were of the old style , simply coarse corn-bread , and I could easily have disposed of my own in one day without satisfying my hunger or injuring my digestion . My detachment was one of the first , if not the first , to leave the stockade , and occupied , with several others , the first train that left for Savannah . The anxiety to be the first to leave Andersonville : " The officers on duty and in charge of the battery of Florida Artillery at the time will , upon receiving notice that the enemy have approached within seven miles of this post , open fire upon the stockade with grape-shot , without reference to the situation beyond these lines of defense . It is better that the last Federal be exterminated than be permitted to hum and pillage the property of loyal citizens , as they will do if allowed to make their escape from prison . " // was displayed in many ways , as it was the general impression that those who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this anxiety , perhaps because I chanced to belong to one of the first detachments taken out , but I think more because I did not believe we were going to be exchanged . It was quite apparent to Dick Williams and myse1f* , as we discussed the question in all its bearings , that Sherman was getting too near our sylvan retreat to make it at all pleasant for the authorities that held us , and that they , fearing for their ability to hold us there any longer , determined to remove us to safer quarters . We left the stockade , however , very willingly , knowing that no worse place could be in store for us . Many were foolish enough to leave behind what few possessions they had , such as tattered blankets , shelter poles , cooking tins , etc. ; but the good sense of the levelheaded ones among us prevented this suicidal business to any great extent , and with the majority my mess of three took with us all we possessed . I crept out of that filthy sore spot on God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with but little ambition to speculate upon where next , but with the determination to make a desperate attempt to escape from my guard whenever the slightest opportunity offered . I left behind me the greater number of all my immediate acquaintances , more than half of them among the thirteen thousand dead in the cemetery I never saw . Thirteen thousand dead in a period of a little over four months ! About every third man who entered Andersonville was dead in four months . As many more were rendered physical wrecks forever after . There were a few over forty thpusand different men who entered Andersonville . Not quite one-third of that number were alive twenty years after . Our train moved towards Macon , and after leaving there kept the road towards Savannah . Only one of the slide doors to each box-car was allowed to remain open to give us air , and within that were posted two sentinels . It was but natural that every prisoner within the car should desire to obtain a place near the open door . Of course the most persistent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or five at most . Sometime , while about midway between Macon and Savannah , I succeeded in grasping the long - sought and persistently worked-for place at the open door ; and the sentinels had so relaxed their discipline as to allow about four of us at a time to sit upon the edge or floor of the car with our feet dangling out . This was the situation I had been striving for during the last hundred miles of our travel , and so completely had my attention been occupied with that idea that I had noticed but little of the country through which we were traveling . About nine o'clock in the evening we came to a stop at a place where the train passed within the station , which was dimly lighted . On another track stood a regular passenger train , well filled with passengers , and among them better-dressed people than I had seen for four months . I wondered if I should ever be one of a civilized community again , traveling as I pleased and where I pleased ? The thought quickened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comrade by me that I should jump from the train as soon as it had left the depot and before it had got fully under way ; that leaving the lighted depot and moving out into the dark night would blind the sentinels for a time , so that we could not be seen . I urged him to jump with me , but he could not be induced to take the risk . When the train reached a distance of two or three hundred yards from the station I simply slid down from the car and out into the black night-so black and dark that not the shape of an object could be seen . I landed in some bushes which only scratched me and tore my clothes , adding a trifle to their already tattered condition ; while the sentinel standing in the car door fired his musket out into the blackness , and a number of the guard upon the top of the train followed his example . The moment I struck I crawled up alongside the track , which brought me under the projecting sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay like a log till the train was half a mile away . I first tried to recall my school-boy knowledge of the geography of the State of Georgia , and that part of it that might appertain to a spot on the Macon and Savannah Railroad about sixty miles from Savannah . Meantime I kept walking mechanically in the direction my train had gone , and soon found myself upon trestle-work in a swamp . The night was dark , though starlight , and there seemed no alternative but to keep along upon the trestle . I walked through the long night till I could barely drag one leg after the other , frequently stopping to rest in the damp air of the swamp . The only sounds I heard were the occasional hooting of an owl and the frequent splashing of alligators . I was getting very lonesome , and even tired of my freedom . It seemed a swamp without end , with only alligators and owls for companionship . Dor6 must have seen some such place , else he could never have drawn his illustrations of Dante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning I reached higher land where the railroad left the trestle. // Leaving the track , I started off through a scattering growth of bushes , seeking an opportunity for a bath and for water to drink . While in the act of bathing , only a few minutes before the sun rose , two men came suddenly upon me , each armed with a double-barreled gun , and informed me that they were out quailhunting . It is possible they were on the watch for me , as I learned later that my train made a stop about half a mile from where I left the swamp , which gave the guard an opportunity to inform the natives that there were stragglers about . They questioned me pretty sharply , and I must have made some very uncertain replies , for our consultation ended in their taking me in charge . They conducted me to a building , in the midst of a little settlement , that seemed to be used as a carpenter 's shop . They gave me all I wanted to eat ,  --  fried egg-plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shavings which was royal . I did not feel very bad over my recapture , so after eating my fill I fell asleep , and was only awakened by my captors about three o'clock in the afternoon in order to place me aboard the next train-load of prisoners , which they flagged for my special benefit . They very kindly gave me a parting ration of pork and hominy . I found several of my Andersonville acquaintances in the car upon which I was placed , and shared with them my generous allowance of pork and hominy . My full stomach and night 's experience had roused my spirits wonderfully . I reached Savannah only one day behind my proper train . Sometime in the night we were marched a short distance into an inclosure of high brick walls , which I soon learned was the jail yard of Savannah . Here I found the car-load of prisoners from which I had escaped , and regained my privileges and share of our mess of three . At daylight the next morning the jail yard was eagerly explored , and among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Irish potatoes , evidently gathered several days before ; but in carefully scratching over the loose sandy soil with sticks , in common with hundreds of other prisoners , I obtained six or seven small potatoes as large as walnuts , which were eagerly devoured raw . They relished better than anything I had eaten for four months , probably because I had begun to feel the creeping on of scurvy . XVe remained in the Savannah jail yard four days . Personally I had enough to eat while there . The fifth day we again took box-cars for another jaunt at the expense of the Confederacy . The old story of " exchange " was told by our guard ; and this time we moved towards the north , which made the story so plausible that none of us made any attempt to escape , though several good opportunities offered . We reached Charleston sometime during the afternoon , and were unloaded from the train within that part of the city which had been shattered and partly burnt by the shells from the Union batteries upon Morris Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelties practiced upon the pet city of the South by these batteries , and more particularly by the single Union gun called the " Swamp Angel . " We were also told that the whole city was so incensed by the ruin and suffering imposed upon them by the blockade , as well as by the shattering of their beautiful city , that we were in danger of being mobbed unless strongly guarded and protected . We were thus made suspicious and timid about our reception , and our astonishment was great when we found the treatment exactly the opposite of what we had been led to expect . Instead of being obliged to protect their prisoners from a mob , our guards were obliged to use all their faculties to prevent the inhabitants from giving us an ovation . They VIEW FROM WIRZ 'S HEADQUARTERS OF THE STOCKADE AT ANDERSONVILLE . ( FEOM A SEETCH MADE AT THE TIME BY H. K. SNEDEN. ) // qwq suggestion , I boiled my sweet potatoes in one of the vats . I learned that my plan of floating with the tide out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was tried every dark night when the tide was favorable by some of the black men , many of whom were successful in reaching the Union lines , but many were shot or recaptured by the pickets constantly patrolling the whole harbor . My enthusiasm was a little dampened , but I concluded to take the risk the next night provided I could secrete myself during the day just dawning . A large pile of lumber upon one of the wharves appeared to be the best hidingplace , and I easily crawled well into the pile . Sleep must have overtaken me almost immediately , but my dreams were brought to a sudden termination by a large gang of negroes , under the direction of two white overseers , who were overhauling the pile of lumber and loading it upon drays . I was taken out and questioned by the overseers as to the nature of my business in that vicinity . Hailing one of the mounted patrol , they delivered me to his care , and he marched me to the provost marshal at the city jail ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two o'clock in the afternoon . The officers of the guard questioned me sharply as to the means of my escape , and more particularly as to the identical beat that I crossed . On my refusing to tell they threatened to place me in the stocks , and even to use the lash upon my back . But underneath all their bluster I could detect a lurking respect for my boldness , and for my sense of honor in not implicating any who might have aided me . The next two days were spent , with the assistance of Frank Bonney , Dennis Short , and George Ray , in mapping out a plan for reaching the Union lines after leaving the prison camp , which we fully decided to do on ttie first favorable night . My easy run past the guard had so emboldened my comrades that I was confident one or more of them would accompany me next time . We finally settled upon the plan of traveling nights across the State of South Carolina , making our objective point the mountains of East Tennessee . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same manner as before , only without attracting the slightest attention from the sentinel , and I have no doubt he was quite asleep , though standing upon his feet and leaning on his musket . George Ray followed within five minutes , also without attracting any attention , and in a few minutes more Dennis Short followed , but without the same success . A few days before the camp had been contracted a little , so that many of the holes dug for wells were left outside the dead-line , and even outside the sentinel 's path . When just passing the sentinel 's beat Dennis stepped into one of these holes , which caused him to measure his full length upon the ground , making a noise like the falling of a heavy log . Instantly he sprang to his feet and kept on , though a little wild with fright from his mishap . The noise aroused the sentinel whose beat we had crossed , and also several of his nearest comrades , and they quickly fired their muskets , though at what I never could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at us . This aroused the relief guard , who came running to the scene of action . It required several minutes of persistent effort to attract Dennis 's attention to us . He was a good deal excited , and I finally crept out towards him and drew him farther away from the light . When the camp had quieted down we took a road leading , as we supposed , across the narrow peninsula that joins Charleston to the mainland . After following this road for over a mile we brought up on the bank of the Ashley River . Well knowing the hounds would be after us as soon as our absence was discovered , we waded and swam down the river a mile to the camp left at the race-course , and emerged from the river two or three hundred yards below it , and then went *traight for the only road leading out of Charleston over the peninsula . We were all barefooted . The picket-post , by the side of an earthwork thrown across the peninsula from river to river , was safely passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively free . We pushed rapidly on for about four miles , the greater part of the distance being through a swamp which obliged us to keep to the road till day began to lighten ; then , leaving the road , we struck away from it through the woods , in spots through a tangled undergrowth of palmetto and kindred shrubs , to the rear of a large plantation a mile away . Here we slept soundly till the sun was - nearly down . I awoke very hungry , and sore and stiff in every joint . Keeping well screened from observation behind the brush , and in the full-grown corn which reached to the edge of the wood , r succeeded in getting near enough to the quarters to attract the attention of an old white-headed black man who seemed very busy about nothing in particular . He did not seem to take that interest in us which I supposed he would when told who we were , but I learned later that he was much more interested than his manner showed . He promised to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir from our hiding-place till he , or some one whom he would // send , could find an opportunity to come out to it . Our waiting was very patient during the first hour , but very impatient fhe second . We began seriously to doubt his ever coming . Not having any means of knowing the time , we were quite sure it was near midnight when a slight cough indicated the presence of some one , and without further signal the old black man stepped noiselessly in among us , followed in a moment or two by another somewhat younger man . He produced a boiled chicken , *atld his comrade several large corn- orjes . As we were eating , the old man " al owed , " " You ns war hungry , sure ! " We learned that it was not quite ten o'clock ; that we were only about seven miles from Charleston ; that the whole county was constantly patrolled by men too old to do service in the army , and that with our limited knowledge of the county the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always keeping a sharp ear for the patrol , and not allowing ourselves to be seen by a white man . He said we need not be afraid to make our wants known to the old men among the blacks , and they would help us to the extent of their ability . With a hearty " God bless you ! " westarted on , rested and enthusiastic . Our tramp was not molested during the whole night . Towards morning a deer crossed the road , so near as to be distinctly visible , which was the only live thing seen . As it began to grow light we again took to the woods , away from the traveled road , selecting a restingplace half a mile from three negro cabins seen in the edge of the woods , which seemed to be inhabited , as smoke was issuing from the chimneys . We had tramped without resting for five hours . Sleep overtook us speedily , but about noon I was awakened either by the hot sun shining fill upon me or by the sound of chopping near by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to in* vestigate ; so , creeping cautiously through the brush , I soon came in sight of a middle-aged colored man , stripped to the waist , and splitting rails . After assuring myself that he was alone , I hailed him . He answered immediately , in a low tone , informing me that he had known of our presence all the morning ; that his only object in being in that particular place splitting rails was to watch for us and give warning in case of danger ; that I must go right back to the other two and keep quiet till he came f@r us after dark . He did all this talking without once looking up from his work , as though talking to himself . After dark the black led us into one of the three log-built cabins . They were short of corn-meal with which to make the universal corn-pone . To supply the deficiency the ne gro 's child , a girl about fifteen years old , took a peck of corn in a bag upon her head and traveled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other girls she ground the corn in a hand-mill . She returned alone with the meal within two hours , and said she was glad to do it for " Uncle Lincum 's men . " It was soon baked for us , and , with plenty of boiled eggs , made us happy again . During the three hours ' conversation with our host and a neighbor that he had invited in we got and gave much information . As we were about starting again upon our tramp our host said that the colored folks wanted to get just a sight of " Uncle Lincum 's soldiers , " and , sure enough , they were all waiting for us outside the cabin , to the number of twelve or fifteen . We shook hands with them all , men women , and children , resuming our tramp about eleven o'clock . We still kept the main traveled road , which led in the direction of Columbia . Not much worth noting occurred during this and the two following nights and days . The country seemed to be sparsely settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towards morning of the sixth night of our tramp we dodged back into the woods as usual , half a mile or so from the road , found a comfortable camping-place , and immediately dropped asleep . We were awakened , however , very soon , by the sound of chopping so near our hiding-place as to discover the chopper to us as soon as our eyes could be fairly rubbed open . He was a mulatto , not over twenty years of age , stripped to the waist , and cutting wood for the Charleston market , as it proved . In less than an hour we reckoned him one of us . He had quickly decided to go with us and seek his freedom at the North by acting as our pilot . Our misfortunes began with his acquaintance , although through no particular fault of his . About noon I killed two large snakes called the " pilot-snake , " from the fact that they are generally found in the vicinity of rattlesnakes . The mulatto said that my killing them was a bad omen ; it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night approached we decided to cross the Congaree River on a small flatboat that the mulatto knew where to find ; keep well round and away from the . city of Columbia ; then take a general northwest direction , which had been our direction thus far , and we calculated that seven more nights of travel would take us to the Tennessee line . The mulatto returned to us about an hour after dark with a large bag well filled with ham , meal , and sweet potatoes , which he proposed to take across the river and on a mile or two to a secluded place where there were // friends of his who would cook the food for us . Just before dark we were made uncomfortable by a cold rain , which decided us to start about nine o'clock . At the cross-roads near which we found ourselves was a settlement of perhaps eight or ten houses , only one of which was lighted . From that the light streamed through an open door directly across the road which we must pass . As we moved across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious that we could be plainly seen if by chance any one was looking that way , and this uncomfortable feeling could not be shaken off . The sequel proved that this ray of light was the trap set for us or for any straggling darkies or Confederate soldiers . It was in one sense a picketpost well guarded , as we learned afterwards was the case at every important cross-roads in the Confederacy . Before we had gone a mile we were conscious of the barking of dogs in the road behind . The mulatto said our game was up , and that he would be killed if caught with us . I assured him that we would stand by him and not see l*m punished because he happened to be caught with us . I advised him , if caught , to plead that he was going to see his sweetheart with the rations in his bag ,  --  which was , in fact , the place we were making for to get our cooking done ,  --  and had just happened to fall in with us a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for in that time the dogs , seven or eight of them , all leashed together , and accompanied by eight horsemen , were upon us . We quickly dodged into the thick brush by the side of the road , while four of the horsemen stopped , and the remaining four rode on fifty yards beyond and halted . Immediately the one who seemed to have charge of the horsemen and dogs called to us to come out into the road and give an accot*pt of ourselves . The mulatto was afraid of his life , and we advised him to improve the opportunity to run , thereby obtaining a good chance to get clear of the whole business while we engaged the attention of the dogs . Our parley lasted for a half-hour or more , after which we encountered the dogs and beat them off with our walking-sticks . From swearing and cursing the men changed to entreaty , and begged us to let the dogs alone and come out and we should be treated like gentlemen . We knew that we must , sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we were satisfied the mulatto had got a fair start , we three dilapidated-looking specimens of humanity stepped out into the road . The leader inquired for the fourth man , and I immediately knew we had been seen and counted while passing the lighted doorway at the cross-roads . I replied that he was a negro we had fallen in with a half-hour before , but that we did not know where he was going or where he came from . This answer seemed to satisfy them partly ; nevertheless a man was sent into the brush , with two of the dogs , to pick up his track and find him . The mulatto instead of making the shortest track for his master 's place very foolishly ran in the opposite direction and was caught upon the bank of the river , and within an hour was brought to join the rest of our party . Our captors gave us comfortable quarters , and we were soon on very good terms with them . The mulatto was brought in shortly before midnight , and , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securely lashed to the trunk of a tree , with his arms about the tree and so elevated as barely to allow his toes to touch the ground . Then his master was sent for and the mulatto sharply questioned . His master had not missed him , which was in his favor , and he told substantially the same story agreed upon before our capture , and stuck well to it . They did not make out much of a case against him , but concluded to whip him on general principles ; yet on my intercession he was let off and sent home . One fact , perhaps , had as much to do in saving the mulatto 's skin as my defense : he had not quite got beyond the two-mile limit from his master 's place within which he had the liberty , in common with all the negroes , to roam . The next morning a mule-team drew us to the nearest railroad station , seven or eight miles distant , where we were placed on board one of the regular passenger trains . Our captors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a final and safe return to our homes , and expressed the honest wish that our next attempt to reach the Union lines might be more successftil . We were placed in charge of a guard that I was told traveled with all the trains within the Confederacy . The Confederacy was truly under martial law throughout its length and breadth . Our journey to Charleston was unimportant . We reached the city about dark , and soon learned that the whole prison camp had been broken up and our comrades taken to Florence , in the same State . We were taken to the city jail for safe-keeping . The provostmarshal , in whose charge we were placed , made some effort to see if we could not be exchanged and sent to the Union lines at Morris Island , but without success ; so we were placed in a large room on the third floor , already occupied by fourteen Confederates " absent without leave . " I devoted the first hour to making a critical survey of the premises , and discovered that there // barred ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of which was the building in which the " Charleston Courier " was printed ; that the presses were going all night ( the windows to the press-room being thrown wide open ) ; that the jail yard was wholly unguarded , so far as appearances went ; that an iron trellis was built up to the top of the second-floor window for a grapevine and under the window to our room ; that the only sentinel or watch discoverable was the one in the hallway at the head of the stairs outside our room . I communicated the result of my inspection to my comrades and the disconsolate rebels , urging upon them the feasibility of escape that night . Dennis was ready to assist in the execution of any plan offered . George complained of being sick and too tired to keep his eyes open . A number of the Confederates " allowed " they would follow if we succeeded in what they considered a desperate undertaking . I was anxious to get one or two of the Confederates to join , because they lived in the northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life . Borrowin*g a jack-knife from one of the rebels , I cut away the sash of our window overlooking the trellis and the jail yard ,  --  the racket from the presses drowning all the noise I could make , - and succeeded in a few minutes in removing four lights . Dennis assisted me , but George slept soundly through it all , and not one of the Confederates would bear a hand . Without losing any time in reflections or further urging my room-mates , I crawled through the window , feet foremost ; hanging from the window-sill with my hands I easily reached the top bars of the trellis with my feet . With my hands on the top bars of the trellis I dropped down through to the ground . Being in the shadow of the jail I could not see the ground , and it seemed like a fall of twenty feet , though it was probably not more than six . I crouched upon the ground for a moment or two to assure myself that the slight noise made had not attracted attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the corner of the " Courier " building , in the shadow of which I was comparatively safe from observation . From there I could see the form of Dennis crawling through . He scrambled down more like a frightened cat than with the welltrained nerves of an athlete . We patiently waited half an hour for the others to follow , but they never came . We ended-up an old plank , taken from a pile by the side of the " Courier " building , against the twelve-foot brick wall , and in less time than it takes to tell it were once more free upon one of the back streets of Charleston . VOL . XL. - 82. 617 It was somewhat after midnight , and we sought the road that had led us out before ; but this time we were not so fortunate . As we attempted to pass through the opening left in the earthworks for the road we were seen by a sentinel , and in answer to the ominous click of the lock to his musket we surrendered . During the morning one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office at the jail , which we reached about ten o'clock . After the provost-marshal had done his regular routine of swearing we were handcuffed and bound together with ball and chain . I told the provost-marshal that some day w* should be able to tell our children of our confinement in the Charleston jail ; of our being shackled together because we had removed four lights of glass from one of the jail windows . I told him how we had escaped from the " Washington race-course , " and of our run through the country . Finally , at his own instance , he removed the irons on our word of honor not to attempt another escape so long as we were in his charge . We were well fed , had the liberty of the office , corridors , and jail yard , but our first parole was of short duration , for in three hours we were placed on a regular passenger train to follow our cbmrades to Florence . Our arrival there was sometime during the night . We were turned loose into the stockade like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the ist of November . My health was good , but the weather was growing quite cold , and my clothing , for many weeks very scanty , was now in tatters . It was made up of the dilapidated crown of the army regulation hat , without brim , a thin fatigue blouse , which also did duty as a shirt , without buttons , but tied together with strings , and an apology for trousers , so frayed at the bottoms as to reach only half way from the knees to the ankles ; I had no shoes or stockings . And as our rations were not sufficient by half , and included no meat , the winter prospect was rather discouraging . My own physical condition on entering the stockade at Florence was superior to that of nine-tenths of my comrades , which was in a great measure due to my frequent escapes . LIFE IN THE FLORENCE PEN . THE stockade at Florence was so similar to the one at Andersonville that it needs but little description . It inclosed about eight acres , upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of water of six times the volume of the one at Andersonville . This stream was bordered upon both sides by a swamp comprising about two acres , which in wet weather was almost impassable . At such times it was necessary to wade above the knees in the black A YANKEE IN ANDERSONVILLE. // swamp muck in order to reach the stream to procure water . Much of the time during the winter the frost was an inch deep and ice formed over thc- stream , but never , I think , - sufficiently thick to bear one 's weight . The ice rendered the wading very disagreeable ; besides , few possessed dishes or cups that would hold over a pint or quart . During the winter hundreds of starved , half-naked , emaciated prisoners stood at the edge of the swamp , with their trousers tucked up to their hips , or , in many instances , without any at all , soliciting the job of filling the cups of those in want of water , for a quid of tobacco , a mouthful of food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival within the stockade I clubbed my all together with James B. Snow and Frank K. Bonney , who had preceded me but a few days . Aside from what we had upon our backs - and Snow and Bonney were no better clothed than I - we mustered a dilapidated army blanket ; a regulation overcoat worn very thin and rotten ; three haversacks ; one canteen ; two tins used for plates , made by splitting a canteen ; one tin cup that held a quart ; one pail , holding about two quarts , roughly Thade from old tin that had once done service upon the roof of a baggage car ; one case knife ; one iron spoon ; an apology for a jack-knife ; and one tobacco pipe . The nights were growing very cold , and we had already experienced a cold storm of several days ' duration without any shelter . Many had burrowed into the ground from the hillside , covering their burrow with a blanket ; but we decided that our shelter must be on the top of the ground if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the shelter , which , except the roof , was built of mud from the swamp . This swamp muck had considerable clay mixed through it , and when baked dry in the sun it would retain its form very well , and even withstand much wetting b*fore it would break down . We brought this mud from the swamp in our hands , about one hundred yards , to the site selected for our building , mixing it to the proper consistency at the swamp , so that it was ready to add to the walls as soon as brought . It was necessary to build slowly , that one layer of mud might dry to a certain extent before another was added . The molding was all done with the hands , and the mud pressed as compactly as possible . We built the walls about ten inches thick and three feet high to the eaves , while the gable ends brought the ridge five feet from the ground . Its size had to be such that the woolen blanket would cover it as a roof This gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide inside . One end , facing the south , was about half taken up with a mud chimney built about seven feet high , leaving the remainder for an entrance . The chimney furnished us with a fireplace about twenty inches square . Snow , Bonney , and myself occupied this mud hut for two months . It sheltered us from the cold , but eternal vigilance was necessary to keep it even comparatively dry during stormy weather . About the time it was finished I managed to get out one day on the regular detail sent for wood , and I brought back the overcoat stuffed full of pine needles , which were spread upon the ground for bedding . When the weather was very cold , the overcoat was used to close the opening left by the side of the chimney . It was a snug , comfortable nest in dry weather , even without a fire ; though much of the time we managed to obtain wood so that a fire of splinters could be kept going during the long , cold evenings . The rations throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks about one-half our number obtained from one to two ounces of fresh beef on every alternate day , the other half taking it the other day ; but this was soon stopped , and during all the winter months no meat was issued . The rations for three-fourths of the time were about eight ounces of cornmeal for each man per day . Occasionally about half the quantity of flour , " cow peas , " or rice would be substituted . The ration of " cow peas " was always very acceptable in exchange for the meal , being a fair substitute for it in sustaining qualities , but the flour and the rice were not so satisfactory , a ration of either containing much less nutriment than the corn-meal or the " cow peas. ** There were days when our scant rations failed to appear at all , through some flimsy excuse , and once none were delivered for three days . The occasion of this failure was Lieutenant Barrett 's difficulty in counting us . This Lieutenant Barrett was an ignorant man , supposed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro driver " before the war . I was told by Adjutant Cheatham that these Yankees , who usually came South to make money , were very apt to become negro traders . Every Sunday a thorough count was made of our numbers by driving every man who could hobble to one side of the creek , then counting them as they returned over a foot-bridge so narrow that but one man could cross at a time . We were obliged to take all our movable possessions along with us ; for if left behind , some of our needy ones would return before the owners and transfer them . Some poor scamp of a prisoner did appropriate a good share of our pine-needle bedding before we returned from one of our weekly pilgrimages . One Sunday // Barrett could not make his count agree with the reported number of prisoners . He declared the count must tally , or the missing ones be accounted for , before we would receive any more rations , and he kept us moving backward and forward across the creek for three days before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue the regular rations . When the ration did come it was for only one day . No back rations were ever made up to us.1 This period of three days without rations caused the most acute sufferings , broke down more men mentally and physically , and in all my prison life of ten months was the climax of cruelty to which we were subjected . I had been three days without food after the battle of Chancellorsville , but the deprivation followed immediately upon plenty . In Florence the three days ' loss of food followed immediately upon a starvation diet of months . Several hundred deaths were the immediate result . Our numbers within the stockade at Florence varied from five to nine thousand . Whatever record may have been kept by the prison authorities never came to light . One-third of this numb*r , or about three thousand , died during the four months that this place was used as a prison . Details were made from the ablest of the prisoners , about one hundred and fifty in all , to cut and bring wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stockade . I belonged to this detail for about two weeks . It was divided into about fifty choppers and one hundred carriers . We were marched out every morning , except when it was very stormy , about nine o'clock , and paroled each day . This parole amounted to taking an oath to keep within half a mile of the stockade and not to commit any act , by word or deed , against the Confederacy , and was considered binding for twenty-four hours , but we were usually re-p turngd to the prison each day about four o'clock . Each squad of eight men was required to bring out of the swamp one cord of wood during the day . Other squads took it within the stockade , while still others were required to cut a definite amount each day . Being one of a squad to carry the wood out of the swamp after it was cut , I remember that part of the work very well . Some of the squads were sharp enough to have their full complement made up of able men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional committee , Thomas A. Pillsbury of the i6th Connecticut stated that the rations were withheld for three days because Lieutenant Barrett was not able to find out who of the prisoners were digging a certain tunnel . " The man who dug the tunnel , " he said , " wentout and told him , and then we received our rations . " - EnrroR. that their task of bringing out a cord would very frequently be accomplished in two hours , while for others it made a serious day 's work . We received for our labor an extra ration , which was usually a more generous one than those issued within the stockade ; besides , I always carried in an extra stick of wood , begged a little tobacco of some Confederate , gathered some scattering " cow peas " left in an adjoining field , with an occasional stray ear of corn , and also plenty of pine-needles for bedding , thus keeping my messmates in better condition than the average . After about two weeks of wood carrying I contracted a severe cold , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have my comrade Snow take my place , so that during the gloomiest , dreariest month of all , December , my mess managed to obtain about two-thirds of a proper supply of food and wood to cook it with . During the month of November , while confined within the stockade at Florence , the presidential election occurred at the North ; and although it was spoken of and lightly discussed by some of my prison comrades , yet no great amount of interest was taken in it till xve discovered that it was the absorbing topic of the authorities outside , and for days was the only thing that seemed to interest our guard . To a man , their anxiety seemed to center in a desire for the election of George B. McClellan . I believe that underneath their hatred of the Yankee there was love for the Union and that they thought the election of McClellan would open a way for their honorable return to the Union without an " unconditional surrender " ; also that Lincoln 's election meant a prosecution of the war to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lovers of McClellan , but they also felt that it would be unwise to change leaders . Perhaps we had unconsciously adopted the sentiment , as given by one of our dying comrades in the last words he uttered , that " to love those things the rebels hated , and hate what they loved , would assure any man a safe entrance to heaven . " When election morning dawned great preparations were made by the prison authorities to take a test vote of the prison . Knowing we represented all parts of the great North , they thought our vote would be a fair index of that cast at the North , and in fact it was . A bag was procured , and presided over by some of our own number , and also supervised by some of the prison authorities . Beans were used for ballots , and we were instructed that a black bean would count for Lincoln and a white bean for McClellan . The intense desire for the election of McClellan was displayed by the prison authorities in their offer of an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42211SS ) -* *x --  --  2** ' THE PRISON PEN AT PLORENCE , SOUTH CAROLINA . ( FROM A SKETCH MADE DECEMBER 8 , 1864 , BY B. K. SNEDEN. ) of white beans were found in the bag , so that every incentive was held out to vote for McClellan ; besides , we knew that our vote would have no influence upon the real election . The result was a great disappointment to our captors . About five thousand five hundred men voted , being marched to the polls in squads of a hundred . Four thousand votes were cast for Lincoln , and one thousand five hundred for McClellan . There was some flanking and repeating , but the above was a fair indication of the prisoners ' choice . The general conditions within the stockade were much the same as those at Andersonville . We retained the same " chief of police , " as he was termed , that did such efficient service at Andersonville in suppressing the " raiders . " " Big Pete " was the only name we knew him by , a big-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make our lot any worse th*n necessary by petty thieving or abuse of any kind . All disputes were referred to him ; and the fact that he was thoroughly respected , and even loved by the great mass of prisoners , was sufficient proof of the fairness and justice of his decisions . He was a godsend to us . Tunneling was indulged in but very little ; personally I did not know of an instance . A deep , wide ditch was dug outside the stockade , and the soil from it , thrown against the stockade , was heaped high enough to form a walk for the sentinels and to allow their heads* and shoulders to reach above the timbers . This ditch effectually checked tunneling , and the few escapes that were made from Florence were accomplished by members of the working squads while outside on parole . Under the rules of civilized warfare enlisted men , or all that part of the army below the rank of the lowest commissioned officer , which is a second lieutenant , are not considered competent to give a parole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the risk of the captor . But an officer who breaks his parole and is recaptured may be put to death . But those prisoners who did break their parole and were recaptured were usually punished in some manner during the first months of our prison life , by " bucking and gagging , " stocks , ball and chain , or were tied up by the thumbs , till the authorities at Washington began to take notice of this treatment and retaliated or threatened to retaliate , which put a stop to it . My comrade George Ray , who was left behind in the jail at Charleston when Dennis Short and I crawled through the window , escaped by breaking his parole , and succeeded this time in reaching the Union lines , but he had a rough experience , as he has since related to me . It was sometime in January that General J. H. Winder dropped dead upon the platform of the Florence depot . This Winder had full charge and control of all prisoners of war . The lack of provisions , shelter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of orders from him . There is no evidence that he acted under the orders or advice , or even sought the advice , of any authority higher than his own , nor was he ever made to answer for his treatment of prisoners of war till he was suddenly called to judgment . The hundreds of complaints of Winder 's inhumanity that were made on all sides to the Confederate authorities at Richmond // were simply referred to Winder without comment or advice fromthem . Wirz and Barrettwere his willing tools , and even added to Winder 's cruel orders a little cruelty of their own invention ; but the fact remains that to Winder belongs the disgrace of Belle Isle , Andersonville , Florence , and Salisbury , with all their horrors . I have several times spoken of Frank K. Bonney . We were schoolmates for a time before the war , and comrades of the same company when taken prisoners , and his home was about two miles from my own in Massachusetts . He had an uncle , an elder brother of his father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man , and there married a Lee , a near relative of General R. E. Lee . Some two years before the war Frank 's elder sister visited her uncle at Camden , and remained there . Frank 's health was precarious during the whole of our prison life . Much of the time his hands were so crippled with sores as to make him helpless , so that while at Andersonville I wrote one letter for him to his sister , and still another while at Charleston , but he received no reply . We doubted whether the authorities allowed the letters to reach their destination . At FlQreice Frank became almost helpless from scurvy , and at his request I again wrote to his sister , informing her of his condition , in hopes that she might succeed in reaching and helping him before it should be too late . To make sure , if possible , that the message should reach her , I resolved to place the letter in the hands of Cheatham , the adjutant of the post at Florence , who did all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even going so far as to receive a reprimand from Winder ; so that he was something of a favorite with the prisoners . When I asked him to forward the letter the astonished look he gave me made me hesitate . " Do you know Miss Bonney ? " he inquired in his sharp , quick way . " Yes , " I answered ; " her family and mine are near neighbors in Massachusetts . " " Go get your traps , and come right out of here ! " he said . " But , " said I , " her brother is my chum , and I wrote the letter for him because he is so crippled that he can not write . " " Miss Bonney 's brother in here ? Go bring him out ; I want to see him ! " was the imperative order . I went back to Frank , who cleared up the mystery by saying that Adjutant Cheatham was from Camden , and probably knew his sister . Prospects began to brighten just before total darkness was about to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seventy-five yards away , without assistance , and I had reached my lowest condition , weighing only ninety-six pounds as tested by the commissary scales a day or two later , but we were not long in finding the adjutant at the gate , waiting for us . He immediately took us to his own quarters , and questioned us closely in order to prove our identity . It soon transpired that Adjutant Cheatham was intimately acquainted with Frank 's sister ; that she had received the two letters previously sent , the one from Andersonville and the other from Charleston ; that she had charged him to look for us as soon as she had heard of the arrival of prisoners at Florence ; that she had made repeated efforts for our release from Andersonville , and was about to succeed when we were moved away ; that she had visited Charleston in search of us , only to arrive a few days after the camp had been broken up , and was now anxiously waiting to discover our whereabouts . We were immediately given good quarters , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was against all orders to have any of the prisoners paroled outside except for the purpose of performing definite work ,  --  with plenty to eat and some few articles of clothing , which we learned was a part of the supply sent from the North for the prisoners ' use ; and the adjutant informed us that Miss Bonney would visit us as soon as we were presentable . No doubt we were hideous-looking objects . Frank 's weight was about the same as my own , and he was covered with sores from head to foot . Both were black from the grime and smoke of the camp , with hair uncut for a whole year ; but baked sweet potatoes and bacon very soon began to make a change for the better , and a small piece of soap that I obtained one day by chance made a change in our complexion . My own health and strength came back very rapidly , but Frank 's never fully returned . Miss Bonney visited us a few days after our exit from the stockade , bringing Frank a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself some underclothing and a pair of shoes . For the shoes she paid $8o , and in like proportion for the other clothing . She made every effort to take Frank to Camden with her , but Adjutant Cheatham could not obtain official consent ; so he was made comfortable at Florence , while I , in a few days , was able to do my share of duty with the men who buried the Union dead . Nine men , all paroled prisoners , composed this " burial squad . " It was our duty to receive the dead as they were delivered from the stockade each day , bury them , mark the graves , and keep a register of each name , company , and regiment , with a number , corresponding to the number against the name in the register , placed at the head of each . The only articles furnished by the prison authorities to assist in giving this last sad rite to the long- // suffering dead were a two-mule team with a negro driver , shovels , and an ax . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were between twenty and thirty to be placed away each day , and only nine men , not one of whom was able to do more than half an able-bodied man 's work , to perform this duty . The headboards , upon which were cut the numbers that corresponded with the register , we split from pine logs . This work was performed conscientiously , so that at any future day a body could be reclaimed with the certainty that it was what the headboard with its number represented it to be . All this time it was evident that the Confederacy was fast falling to pieces , and our deliverance not far distant . The tone of the prison authorities began to change , particularly to those of us who were enjoying the outside parole . The guard began to fraternize with us , showing a disposition to be neighborly . One of them made the burial squad a present of a very fine ham , such a ham as they at the South only know how to cure , and a bushel of sweet potatoes . They began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the evening , and play cribbage , chess , and checkers . XVe were invited into their camp . The last two or three weeks of our stay at Florence we could go and come pretty much as we pleased after our day 's duties were done . At last we were told that they could hold us no longer , and that we would be placed on board the cars as fast as they could be obtained and run into the Union lines at Wilmington . Adjutant Cheatham requested all the paroled men to remain to help off the last train-load , which would consist of the sick and totally disabled . I watched for my comrades as the prisoners filed out of the stockade . I took Snow , McCullom , and Short by the hand as they emerged from this gate to Hades , and assured them that they were really bound for God 's country this time . The last load left the fourth day after . We worked till near midnight in loading the box-cars with their half-living , half-dead human freight , the remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the train , and more than twenty while en route between Florence and Wilmington . We placed aboard the train nearly a hundred cases of small-pox , and two hundred cases in the last stages of scurvy-whose condition I dare not describe . The excitement and efforts to revive the almost dying kept my nerves and muscles strung till the last man was on board ; then I felt faint and deathly sick , and could not ride inside the cars with the loathsome sick and dying . I climbed to the top of the train , and rode for the first fifty miles in a cold northeast rain storm , until so thoroughly wet and chilled that I shook from head to foot like a man with ague . Then I crawled along to the engine and over the tender into the cab , where I found four of my comrades , who had preceded me to get warm , and we rode here the remaining distance to Wilmington . We supplied the tender and fire with wood , and , in short , pretty much ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March i , 1865 , I saw the first free Union soldier in ten long months , in the form of a foraging cavalryman . Our whole train-load cheered him with all the noise we could make , and waved some kind of a rag . I never saw a more astonished soldier . Evidently he did not comprehend the situation . About noon we reached the Union lines , upon the opposite side of the river from XVilmington , where we were met by ambulances , surgeons , and everything possible to make us comfortable , and there we saw the glorious God-given flag , the Stars and Stripes of a free people ! I could not eat during the three days we spent at XVilmington , but did drink a little coffee , that we had longed for so much . XVe were taken from Wilmington on a small steamer over the bar , and transferred to the ocean steamer Livings/o ; i , that was waiting in the offing . I fell asleep from sheer exhaustion , and when I woke again it was to find myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of lost time to be accounted for . The surgeon told me that I had been delirious during that time ; that I was now on the fair road to recovery , and must remain quiet several days longer . In response to my importunate appeals , I was promised a furlough as soon as I should be able to walk to the office . This I attempted every day till the fourth day I succeeded , but it took me to the end of my rope . The surgeon tried to persuade me to remain a few days longer ; but I was bent on going home ; I claimed his promise , and the furlough was written . A hackman took me in his arms to his vehicle , and from that aboard the train in the Baltimore depot . The journey to Boston I do not remember . Somehow I got there , and another hackman carried me to my uncle 's house and placed me upon the lounge in his sittingroom . The next morning I was carried to the cars and rode out home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house .
