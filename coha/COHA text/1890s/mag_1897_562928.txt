txt THE citizens of the United States have , as a rule , only vague ideas of the methods adopted by the House of Representatives to do its part of the legislative business of the country . A clear comprehension of the facts would dissipate many objections and do much to reconcile even members themselves to the limitations of each individual 's power , for they would find that the limitations arise out of the nature of things and are well-nigh inevitable . Every member of the House represents a large constituency in its relation to national affairs . Each one , therefore , feels that his rights should be commensurate with his duties . In fact and practice , however , there are 356 other gentlemen who represent constituencies just as extensive , and with just as many rights . The problem is how to recognize each one 's rights , having also due regard to the rights of all the rest . Obviously , no one has rights to the exclusion of the rights of others . This problem the House has had to meet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use have been , the creation of no one man and of no set of men , but have been the slow growth of a hundred years , changing with the changed circumstances and meeting new conditions as they arose . Why they are what they are can best be understood by considering the duties and obligations and the Cepyright , 159T , by THE NORTH AMERICAN LEVIEW PUBLISHING COMPANY . All rights reserved . // physical possibilities of an assembly of 360 men , for such is the number of men who compose the House of Representatives when you include the three Territorial delegates , who have the right of speech though not of vote . It is to be noted at the outset that there are few analogies between the House of Representatives of the United States and the corresponding bodies of the different States . The differences between the two are fundamental and very wide reaching . When the Constitution was prepared and submitted to the people of the separate States the authors of the Federalist recognized one difference , which has not only lasted to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook to defend the entrusting of two years ' power to the House they encountered much opposition . The popular sentiment of that time was well expressed in the popular proverb that where annual elections left off tyranny began . All the thirteen colonies then believed that two years ' power was a dangerous gift , too dangerous even to be entrusted to the representatives of the people themselves . Whether much of the trouble we are having in the States does not arise from the abandonment of that opinion of our forefathers is well worth the consideration of the judicious . However that may be , biennial elections were fiercely assailed , and the defence brought out a fundamental fact as true , or , perhaps , more true , to-day than ev*er before , the fact that we all of us know little of what is thought and believed outside our own locality . Although we are a great nation , united and compact , it is still true that the first government we live under is the government of the State . That first attracts our attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the government of which we have much knowledge . Of Congress the people get little information ; of their own legislatures the people get a great deal . Inasmuch as the newspapers so limit their accounts of Congressional action that an absent Congressman can hardly keep track of the proceedings of his own assembly , the individual in private life can hardly expect to have much of an idea of what is going on even in that part of the proceedings which affects him . As for the action of States other than his own the citizen in general has no notion whatever unless some extraordinary action is taken . Our State affairs we take in by absorption . // In Congress every member finds himself at one great disadvantage , which length of service may diminish but can never entirely take away , and that disadvantage arises from the lack of local knowledge as to far-off States . We may be a homogeneous nation , but we are certainly not lacking in diversities . The broad extent of the country , in more ways therefore than one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its methods of action . In some of the smaller States all the business which is presented to the Legislature is disposed off in some way or other . The committees report all bills and resolutions which are sent to them , and both Assemblies say " yes** or " no " directly or indirectly to them all . Lu Congress neither House attempts to do anything of the kind . The pigeon holes of all of the committees which are fortunate enough to have any business at all are found , at the end of the session and of Congress , full of bills undisposed of . Thousands also of the bills reported are left on the calendars without even the poor formality of being discussed , or even of being called up . In a word , Congress , when it gets ready , adjourns , leaving the dead bills by the wayside . In assemblies where all the business is transacted , where the dockets and calendars are cleared , it is only a question of the time when a proposition shall be heard , and never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to state the situation in the House of Representatives in more concrete form , and therefore to bring it nearer to general comprehension , the facts relating to the business of the House and Senate of the 64th Congress now last past will be very useful . Both sessions of this Congress were short . The number of bills introduced into the House and Senate was 14,114 . The number of resolutions was 470 , making a total of 14,584 bills and resolutions . When we adjourned there had been passed of these , 948 acts and resolves . On the calendars of the House were more than 2,000 bills and resolutions not acted upon , and the rest were in the pigeon holes of the committees undisturbed , or at least unreported . It will therefore be seen that the House did only six and a half per cent . of the business laid before it . Out of 14,684 a selection of 948 was made . The question which naturally arises is how was this selection made , how did it // happen that these particular bills were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may help to make this clear . Among the bills passed were those which raised , or attempted to raise , revenue , bond bills , all the bills carrying the great appropriations for the support of the government , bridge bills , railroad right of way bills , private bills , and public bills of all descriptions . Among those bills which were not passed were many which without the sanction of law or precedent proposed to pay large sums . Added to these were private claims , pension claims , individual schemes , and propositions to increase the salaries of our civil servants while we were borrowing money for the necessities of life . To have passed the bills which were passed and all those which were presented would have been a task which could not have been accomplished even if the House had worked day and night for the whole period of two years . Obviously , there are some things which have to be done . There are bills which must be passed . Unless revenue is furnished , even the ordinary function of government would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not properly appropriated ac* cording to law , the government could not go on , for its continuance costs money . Hence , under the rules of the House , the Committee of Ways and Means having charge of bills raising revenue , and the Committees on Appropriations obliged to pro . vide for the expenditure of revenue , have a right of way which is thorough and complete . Whenever the Jouse desires to take up such bills there is neither let nor hindrance . The country , therefore , can be sure that its necessities are provided for . Besides these pressing necessities which can not be denied , there are others which ought not to be denied . So far as the bills of this character carry money and require its expenditure , the rules do not offer very great facilities , and indeed could not . But if there be a pressing emergency calling for expenditures , the Committee on Rules has the right to submit to the House a proposition to consider the measure calculated to meet the emergency . If the House so desires the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last Congress the Bill to Regulate Immigration , the Bankruptcy Bill , the Labor Commis // sion Bill , the Postal Bill relating to second-class mail , the Pacific Railroad Bill , and various others . There are a great many measures which it would be impossible to treat in that special way , and for these the morning hour is provided , and now that the House has got used to this period the rule has worked well and every measure not involving any appropriation and which was of a public character was passed upon in the last House . Some of the bills on the House calendar to which this morning hour applies were not acted upon , but that was simply because the committee reporting did not care to urge them . This morning hour was the invention of the Fifty-first Congress . The old morning hour was sixty minutes only , and no committee was allowed more than two days , and the very smallest kind of a filibuster would kill a bill which the great majority of the whole House might be desirous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes only , or , if the House chooses , may continue all day , and when a bill is once brought up it can not be killed by mere indirection . During this period of time all , or about all , the work of the Judiciary Committee , which has charge of the changes of federal law , a portion of the work of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee , which has charge of the transportation interests of the country , and of various other committees to alesser degree , can and do receive consideration , and are disposed of . All the bridge bills and right of way bills are passed at this time . After the Fifty-first Congress this rule , which has thus shown its value , was , owing to the high state of party feeling , changed back to the old death trap which existed prior to 1890 . It was then deemed necessary to obliterate every possible trace of the Fifty-first Congress . Time and experience , however , have shown the value of the changes which were made in those troublous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many gentlemen who had been opposed in the Fifty-first Congress were not hostile in the Fiftyfourth Congress to the most efficient measures to give the majority control of the House . Among other things , we adopted , with hardly a word of dispute , the rule proposed sixteen years ago by Mr. Randolph Tucker , which will probably be found effective to secure a quorum at all times . // Besides these bills the nature of which has been indicated , there are private bills which deal in the main with the personal claims of individual citizens . They are divided into money claims and pension claims , including removal of charges of desertion . The pension claims have Friday evening of each week set apart for their special consideration and other days by special order from the Committee on Rules . Friday itself is set apart for other claims . Besides the business which pertains to the States and the Congressional Districts , the Congress has another class of business of great importance to the Territory interested . Besides being the legislative body for the whole Union , Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and City of Washington . Local self-government does not exist there , and whatever is done for the District is done by Congress . Much legislation gets into the District of Columbia Appropriation Bills . Nevertheless there is much to be done for the City of Washington , as much perhaps as for any similar city . This necessity is met under the Rules of the House by setting apart two Mondays in each month , the second and fourth , or so much as is found necessary . The Committee on the District on these days calls up such bills as it deems proper for consideration , and the bills are considered by the House or by the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union as determined by the nature of the bill . In this way all the matured and needful legislation is passed which the District requires . It will be evident from the summary thus given that all the necessities of the government are promptly and thoroughly attended to and that whatever happens to the wishes of individuals the welfare of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own chosen representatives . The rest of the business indicated by the bills introduced comprises those bills o* ' a private nature which are lost for lack of time and other bills which can not be brought up because they are not in order from being too far down the list . The greater number by far are private bills or those which , like Public Building bills , are for the benefit of particular localities . So few , however , of these private bills can be disposed of even at the expense of one-sixth of the time of Congress that out of that and out of other private and public exigencies , // the custom has grown up at certain times to ask unanimous consent to take up one and another of these bills and also other bills to expend money . Under this system any one member can object and stop any action by the House . Each member has complete control and may object and defeat the bill or may help pass it . Without experience one would suppose that such a system was amply safeguarded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to it , there could be no danger in letting it be presented for passage . But , alas ! the weakness of poor human nature , though of course not often prevalent , does certainly lurk in even celestial and Congressional minds . If a member objects he may be the subject of reprisals and his own bill may go to the tomb of the Capulets . Moreover , he hopes some one else will bear the burden and while he hesitates he is lost and the bill is gained . The liberum veto might do in Poland , but it is bad in Congress . However , the custom has been so established that it must be yielded to . Now as to the method . If the presiding officer were simply to put down the names in the order of application all sorts of things would be presented without even one man knowing anything about them , and as soon as the list reached fair proportions all interest in it would cease , for it would only be superseding one list by another , and when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would not be possible , therefore , to adopt this plan , for it would wreck itself . Various expedients have been tried at various times with results not at all satisfactory . One House , that of the Fortyseventh Congress , I think , adopted a rule devoting an hour of sixty minutes of each day to such s , one for each committee in order . Under this arrangement bills were called up with a provision for five minutes for explanation , and if five members objected the bill was not considered . If five members did not object , then five minutes on a side were allowed for discussion and the proposition was then voted upon . Under this method , however , very few bills were passed . Objections were many and the hour was soon consumed . On two days during the second session of the Forty-seventh five bills only ran the gauntlet . The system in the general opinion was far from being successful , and was not long continued . The Speaker then under the present system has to make the selection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much labor and exciting not a little feeling . However , it is only just to the members to say that the trouble arises not so much from them , for they are in position to understand the Speaker 's difficulties , as from the constituents who can not understand them . The Speaker is also a member of the House . When he refuses to submit for unanimous consent , he is only exercising his right to object , a right which belongs to him in common with all the other members of the Assembly . He has to make more frequent objection because he has to know what the bills proposed or to be proposed are about and what their pro-visions mean . He has opportunities to examine them , and indeed must examine them to do his duty . Another method of breaking the regular order , and one which unlike unanimous consent is sanctioned by the Rules of the House , is the method under " Suspension of the Rules . " Some years ago the right to move to suspend the rules and pass a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of questions and abstract propositions which were presented to entrap members and put them in the wrong were presented on Monday . Some of them were so ingeniously drawn that the enemy were caught whichever way they voted . As no amendment was permitted and but little debate , only fifteen minutes on either side , there was often much trepidation among those who were liable to be impaled on at least one horn of the dilemma . The ordeal through which we had to pass got to be so annoying that when the rules were modified and classified in the Forty-sixth Congress , the power to entertain motions to suspend the rules was confined to two Mondays in the month , the first Monday and the third ; committees had the right of way on the third and individual members on the first . here , however , selections have to be made by the Speaker , and he has some of the same troubles to afflict him which present themselves on the propositions for unanimous consent . On the last six days also of a session rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first session seldom determine until very late the day of final adjournment the last six days of the first session are not so dreadful as those of the last session , where the House on the verge of dissolution has its last chance to enact the measure so dear to the member . At that time the struggle has driven many a Speaker to the verge of distraction . He can satisfy not five per cent . of // his applicants , and , therefore , welcomes the final adjournment as the saint ought to welcome death and paradise . In the proceedings of the English House of Commons there seems to be an entire absence of a large class of bills which clog our calendars and make miserable the lives of members . There are no private pension bills , because there each claimant is left to the administration of the general law , nor do there seem to be any claim bills at all . Parliament is not called upon to adjudicate questions of damages resulting from the dealings of the government with its citizens . Almost all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , belong to the State and other local authorities , our work in that direction being mostly confined to bridges over navigable waters over which the nation has control . Notwithstanding , however , this immunity from that which worries us most of all and notwithstanding Parliament sits longer than we do , Sir Albert Rollit declared in 1894 that " business in the House of Commons had become more and more congested , " and that in the case of non-official members 309 bills had been introduced , of which only 23 were passed and the ministers had hardly better fortune , for as he said of them , " The list of promises was long , of performances extremely short . " It is curious to notice how tremendous has been the increase in the presentation of bills by members of the House . In 1863-64 in the Thirty-eighth Congress the number was only 813 . Such a number could be dealt with and all of them passed upon and decided . But who could dare to attempt to struggle with 10,378 ? Perhaps a knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of constituents as to the business which they entrust to their members and enable them to judge more justly of the difficulties in the way of their wishes . All human instrumentalities are imperfect and while they can be improved they can never meet the wishes of all . Indeed if they meet the wishes of the majority they will be fortunate . Nothing has been said of the loss of time which might be utilized by action which owes its origin to the desire to address not the House , but the constituency ; fc*r that seems to be inevitable It is the same in all countries , and has been the same in all ages . Undoubtedly it serves other purposes than display , and is part of // the education of a free people . Still there are times when business propositions being nnmerous and the days few , one wishes that eloquence and speaking bore a closer resemblance to reasoning and deliberation . It might as well be admitted at once that the faults of legislative bodies are not the faults of legislators alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as we rate oratory too high and wisdom too low and gauge onr representatives by the number of times they get into newspapers and not by what we ourselves know of their characters and abilities , so long we shall continue the desire for opportunities for display and fail to create the desire for opportunities to do service.
