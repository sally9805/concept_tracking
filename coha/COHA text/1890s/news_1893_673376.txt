txt All of the indications point to a victory for honest government in Brooklyn . It is the unanimous opinion of the most careful and the best-informed ob4ervers that the only serious obstacle in the way is the illegal voting . This is , in our judgment , more disgraceful than dangerous . Undoubtedly the ring will do a:1 that it can do in that . direction , and quite enough of it , if justice could be had , to land a good many of its tools and some of its leaders in the penitentiary . But all that eau be done in illegal voting is not , in our view , sufficient to overcome the tremendous revolt of honest Democrats against the men who are making of the name of Democrat in Brooklyn a byword and a reproach . Unless all signs fail , this revolt is to be overwhelming , like that against the Tweed ring in 1870 , or that against the Federal machine in this State in 1882 . Meanwhile , the course of the ring is such as to hasten its downfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State campaign , it was deemed necessary to provide as heavy a fraudulent vote as possible in Gravesend , where the prizefighting authorities had complete control , and where it was thought that fraud could safely and secretly be arranged . But Boss has very much overdone the lob committed to him . In the first place , he ought to have known that he could . not count on the blindness of the press , and before his registration was half completed THE TIMES was on his track and exposed the nature and probable extent of the iniqui'ty he was engaged in . In the next place , to provide for a vote exceeding by 50 per cent , the entire male population of the town , from the boy babe in arms to the old man on his death bed , was to give to all the people of Kings County too glaring a proof of what the ring would try to do whenever it had the chance , and thus very much to restrict the chance . It was an insolent challenge to every decent voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring , and the decent voters are responding in tens of thousands . Again , the ring is much too violent . It has lost its head . It has put no speakers of any ability before the people . It has let Mr. RIDGWAY loose to parade his vulgarity and mendacity to the disgust and indignation of respectable men everywhere . It has set its lowest followers to bulldozing small tradesmen who dare to put Mr. SCDIRREN 'S portrait in their windows , and it has prevented the police ? most of whom are decent men and sick of the tyranny of the ring -- from protecting peaceable citizens in the exercise of their rights . It is our belief tlaat all this is without the approval of Mr. MCLAUGULIN , who knows how much mischief it does , but apparently Mr. MCLAUGHLIN 'S gang has got out of his control , as was sure to happen , since he has nothing but their greed to appeal to , and has stimulated that beyond his ability to gratify it . Another fact of significance is the great interest shown in this struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professional agitators , but the men who pay taxes on their little homes and who do not like to see those taxes taken to pay Aldermen 's rum bills and carriage hire and like indulgences . On the whole , there is every reason to think that a strong and united effort on Tuesday next will smash the machine beyond hope of recovery .
