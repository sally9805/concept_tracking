BY JULIAN RALPH . CHICAGO will be the main exhibit at the Columbian Exposition of 1893 . No matter what the aggregation of wonders there , no matter what the EjifelTower-like chief exhibit may be , the cit.y itself will make the most surprising presentation . Those who go to study the w6rld 's progress will find no other result of human force so wonderful , extravagant , or peculiar . Those who carry with them the prejudices begotten out of political rivalry or commercial envy will discover that , however well founded some of the criticism has been-especially as to the spirit of the Chicagoans  --  the development of the place has not followed the logical deductions . Those who go clearminded , expecting to see a great city , will find one different from that which any precedent has led them to look for . While investigating the management and prospects of the Columbian Exposition , I was a resident of Chicago for more than a fortnight . A born New-Yorker , the energy , roar , and bustle of the place were yet sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to examine the city , and to cross-examine some of its leading men . I came away compelled to acknowledge its possession of certain forceful qualities which I never saw exhibited in the same degree anywhere else . I got a satisfactory explanation of its growth and achievements , as well as proof that it must continue to expand in population and commercial influence . Moreover , without losing a particle of pride or faith in New Yorkwithuut perceiving that New York was affected by the consideration-I acquired a respect for Chicago such as it is most likely that any American who makes a similar investigation must share with me . The city has been thought intolerant of criticism . The amount of truth there is in this is found in its supervoluminous civicism . The bravado and bunkum of the Chicago newspapers reflect this quality , but do it clumsily , because it proceeds from a sense of business policy with the editors , who laugh at it themselves . But underlying the behavior of the most able and enterprising men in the city is this motto , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LXXXIV. - No. 501-42 same words , " We are for Chicago first , last , and all the time . " To define that sentence is , in a great measure , to account for Chicago . It explains the possession of a million inhabitants by a city that practically dates its beginning after the war of the rebellion . Its adoption by half a million men as their watchword means the forcing of trade and manufactures and wealth ; the getting of the World 's Fair , if you please . In order to comprehend Chicago , it is best never to lose sight of the motto of its citizens . I have spoken of the roar and bustle and energy of Chicago . This is most noticeable in the business part of the town , where the greater number of the men are crowded together . It seems there as if the men would run over the horses if the drivers were not careful . Everybody is in such a hurry and going at such a pace that if a stranger asks his way , he is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information , for the average Chicagoan can not stop to talk . The whole business of life is carried on at high pressure , and the pithy part of Chicago is like three hundred acres of New York Stock Exchange when trading is active . European visitors have written that there are no such crowds anywhere as gather on Broadwa*y , and this is true most of the time ; but there is one hour on every week-day when certain streets in Chicago are so packed with people as to make Broadway look desolate and solitudinous by comparison . That is the hour between half past five and half past six o'clock , when the famous tall buildings of the city vomit their inhabitants upon the pavements . Photographs of the principal corners and crossings , taken at the height of the human torrent , suggest the thought that the camera must have been turned on some little-known painting by Dord . Nobody but Dor6 ever conceived such pictures . To those who are in the crowds , even Chicago seems small and cramped ; even her street cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even her streets that connect horizon with horizon seem each night to roar at the city officials for further annexation in the morning . We shall see these crowds simply and // satisfactorily accounted for presently ; but they exhibit only one phase of the highpressure existence ; they form on y one feature among the many that distinguish the town . In the tall buildings are the most modern and rapid elevators , machines that fly up through the towers like glass balls from a trap at a shootiug contest . The slow-going stranger , who is conscious of having been " kneaded " along the streets , like a lump of dough among a million bakers , feels himself loaded into one of those frail-looking baskets of steel netting , and the next instant the elevator-boy touches the trigger , and up goes the whole load as a feather is caught up by a gale . The descent is more simple . Something lets go , and you fall from ten to twenty stories as it happens . There is sometimes a jolt , which makes the passenger seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a rule , the mechanism and management both work marvellously toward ease and gentleness . These elevators are too slow for Chicago , and the managers of certain tall buildings now arrange them so that some run * to the seventh story without stopping , while what may be called accommodation cars halt at the lower floors , pursuing a course that may be likened to the emptying of the chambers of a revolver in the hands of a person who is " quick on the trigger . " It is the same everywhere in the business district . Along Clark Street are some gorgeous underground restaurants , all*marble and plated metal . Whoever is eating at one of the tables in them will see the ushers standing about like statues until a customer enters the door , when they dart forward as if the building were falling . It is only done in order to seat the visitor promptly . Being of a sympathetic and impressionable nature , I bolted along the streets all the time I was there as if some one on the next block had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate with the clerk by electricity , and may flash word of their thirst to the bar-tender as lightning dances from the top to the bottom of a steeple . A sort of annunciator is used , and by turning an arrow and pressing a button , a man may in half a minute order a cocktail , towels , ice-water , stationery , dinner , a bootblack , and the evening newspapers . Our horse-cars in New York move at the rate of about six miles an hour . The cable-cars of Chicago make more than nine miles an hour in town , and more than thirteen miles an hour where the population is less dense . They go in trains of two cars each , and with such a racket of gong-ringing and such a grinding and whir of grip-wheels as to make a modern vestibuled train seem a waste of the opportunities for noise . But these street cars distribute the people grandly , and while they occasionally run over a stray citizen , they far more frequently clear their way by lifting wagons and trucks bodily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid and a business-like city . The speed with which cattle are killed and pigs are turned into slabs of salt pork has amazed the world , but it is only the ignorant portion thereof that does not know that the celerity at the stock-yards is merely an effort of the butchers to keep up with the rest of the town . The only slow things in Chicago are the steam railway trains . Farther on we will discover why they are so . I do not know how many very tall buildings Chicago contains , but they must nurnber nearly two dozen . Some of them are artistically designed , and hide their height in well-balanced proportions . A few are mere boxes punctured with window-holes , and stand above their neighbors like great hitching-posts . The best of them are very elegantly and completely appointed , and the communities of men inside them might almost live their lives within their walls , so multifarious are the occupations and services of the tenants . The best New York office buildings are not injured by comparison with these towering structures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , but there is not in New York any office structure that can be compared with Chicago 's so-called Chamber of Commerce office building , so far as are concerned the advantages of light and air and openness and roominess which its tenants enjoy . In these respects there is only one finer building in America , and that is in Minneapolis . It is a great mistake to think that we in New York possess all the elegant , rich , and ornamental outgrowths of taste , or that we know better than the West what are the luxuries and comCorts of the age . With their floors of deftly laid mosaicwork , their walls of marble and onyx , their balustrades of copper worked into // arabesquerie , their artistic lanterns , elegant electric fixtures , their costly and luxurious public rooms , these Chicago office buildings force an exclamation of praise , however unwillingly it comes . They have adopted what they call " the Chicago method " in putting up these steepliug hives . This plan is to construct the actual edifice of steel framework , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone masonry , and the necessary partitions of fire-brick , and plaster laid on iron lathing . The buildings are therefore like enclosed bird - cages , and it is said that , like bird - cages , they can not shake or tumble down . The exterior walls are mere envelopes . They are so treated that the buildings look like heaps of masonry , but that is homage paid to custom more than it is a material element of strength . These walls are to a building what an envelope is to a letter , or a postage-stamp is to that part of an envelope which it covers . The Chicago method is expeditious , economical , and in many ways advantageous . The manner in which the great weight of houses so tall as to include between sixteen and twentyfour stories is distributed upon the ground beneath them is ingenious . Wherever one of the principal upright pillars is to be set up , the builders lay a pad of steel and cement of such extent that the pads for all the pillars cover all the site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by laying alternate courses of steel beams crosswise , one upon another . Each pair of courses of steel is filled in and solidified with cement , and then the next two courses are added and similarly treated . At last each pad is eighteen inches thick , and perhaps eighteen feet square ; but the size is governed by the desire to distribute the weight of the building at about the average of a ton to the square foot . This peculiar process is necessitated by the character of the land underneath Chicago . Speaking widely , the rule is to find from seven to fourteen feet of sand superimposed upon a layer of clay between ten and forty feet in depth . It has not paid to puncture this clay with piling . The piles sink into a soft and yielding substance , and the clay is not tenacious enough to hold them . Thus the Chicago Post-office was built , and it not only settles continuously , but it settles unevenly . On the other hand , the famous Rookery Building , set up on these steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the architect 's calculation was that , by squeezing the water out of the clay underneath , it would settle seven inches . Very queer and differing results have followed the construction of Chicago 's biggest buildings , and without going too deep into details , it has been noticed that while some have pulled neighboring houses down a few inches , others have lifted adjoining houses , and still others have raised buildings that were at a distance from themselves . The bed of clay mxderneath Chicago acts when under pressure like a pan of dough , or like a blanket tautened at the edges and held clear of underneath support . Chicago 's great office buildings have basements , but no cellars . I have referred to the number of these stupendous structures . Let it be known next that they are all in a very small district , that narrow area which composes Chicago 's office region , which lies between Lake Michigan and all the principal railroad districts , and at the edges of which one-twenty-fifth of all the railroad mileage of the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half a mile square or 300 acres in extent . One of these buildings  --  and not the largest - has a population of 4000 persons . It was visited and its elevators were used on three days , when a count was kept , by 19,000 , 18,000 , and 20,000 persons . Last October there were 7000 offices in the tall buildings of Chicago , and 7000 more were under way in buildings then undergoing construction . The reader now understands why in the heart of Chicago every work-day evening the crowds convey the idea that our Broadway is a deserted thoroughfare as compared with , say , the corner of Clark and Jackson streets . These tall buildings are mainly built on land obtained on 99 year leasehold . Long leases rather than outright purchases of land have long been a favorite preliminary to building in Chicago , where , for one thing , the men who owned the land have not been those with the money for building . Where very great and costly buildings are concerned , the long leases often go to corporations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many strangers who visit Chicago that it is reasonable to prophesy a speedy end to the feverish impulse to swell the number of // these giant piles , either through legislative ordinance or by the fever running its course . Many prophesy that it must soon end . This idea is bred of several reasons . In the first place , the tall buildings darken the streets , and transform the lower stories of opposite houses into so many cellars or damp and dark basements . In the next place , the great number of tall and splendid office houses is depreciating the value of the humbler property in their neighborhoods . Fourstory and five-story houses that once were attractive are no longer so , because their owners can not afford the conveniences which distinguish the greater edifices , wherein light and heat are often provided free , fire-proof safes are at the service of every tenant , janitors officer a host of servants , and there are barber shops , restaurants , cigar and news stands , elevators , and a half - dozen other conveniences not found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since not all the people of Chicago spend their time in offices , there must soon come an end of the demand for these chambers . So it seems , but not to a thoroughbred Chicagoan . One of the foremost business men in the city ass&amp;rts that he can perceive no reason why the entire business heart of the townthat square half-mile of which I have spoken-should not soon be all builded up of cloud-capped towers . There will be a need for them , lie says , and the money to defray the cost of them will accompany the demand . The only trouble lie foresees will be in the solution of the problem what to do with the people who will then crowd the streets as never streets were clogged before . This prophecy relates to a little block in the city , but the city itself contains 181k square miles . It has been said of the many annexations by which her present size was attained that Chicago reached out and took to herself farms , prairie land , and villages , and that of such material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . In suburban trips , such as those I took to Fort Sheridan and Fernwood , for instance , I passed great cabbage farms , groves , houseless but plotted tracts , and long reaches of the former prairie . Even yet Hyde Park is a separated settlement , and a dozen or more villages stand out as distinctly by themselves as ever they did . If it were true , as her rivals insist , that Chicago added all this tract merely to get a high rank in the census reports of population , the folly of the action would be either ludicrous or pitiful , according to the stand-point from which it was viewed . But the true reason for her enormous extension of municipal jurisdiction is quite as peculiar . The enlargement was urged and accomplished in order to anticipate the growth and needs of the city . It was a consequence of extraordinary foresight , which recognized the necessity for a uniform system of boulevards , parks , drainage , and water provision when the city should reach limits that it was even then seen must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories , and dwellings . To us of the East this is surprising . It might seem incredible were there not many other evidences of the same spirit and sagacity not only in Chicago , but in the other cities of the West , especially of the Northwest . What Minneapolis , St. Paul , and Duluth are doing toward a future park system reveals the same enterprise and habit of looking far ahead . And Chicago , in her park system , makes evident her intentions . In all these cities and in a hundred ways the observant traveller notes the same forehandedness , and prepares himself to understand the temper in which the greatest of the Western capitals leaned forth and absorbed the prairie . Chicago expects to become the largest city in America  --  a city which , in fifty years , shall be larger than the consolidated cities that may form New York at that time . Now on what substance does Chicago feed that she should foresee herself so great ? What manner of men are those of Chicago ? What are the whys and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , as it is now , a city of young men . One Chicagoan accounts for its low death rate on the ground that not even its leading men are yet old enough to die . The young men who drifted there from the Eastern States after the close of the war all agree that the thing which most astonished them was the youthfulness of the most active business men . Marshall Field , Potter Palmer , and the rest , heading very large mercantile establishments , were young fellows . Those who came to Chicago from England fancied , as it is said that Englishmen do , that a man may not be trusted with affairs until he , has lost half // his hair and all his teeth . Our own Eastern men were apt to place wealth and success at the middle of the scale of life . But in Chicago men under thirty were leading in commerce and industry . The sight was a spur to all the young men who came , and they also pitched in to swell the size and successes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the loaning of it and by handling city realty-sources which never failed with shrewd men-not only whetted the general appetite for big and quick moneymaking , but they provided the means for the establishment and extension of trade in other ways and with the West at large . It is one of the peculiarities of Chicago that one finds not only the capitalists but the storekeepers discussing the whole country with a familiarity as strange to a man from the Atlantic coast as Nebraska is strange to most Philadelphians or NewYorkers . But the well - informed and " hustling " Chicagoan is familiar with the differing districts of the entire West , North , and South , with their crops , industries , wants , financial status , and means of intercommunication . As in London we find men whose business field is the world , so in Chicago we find the business men talking not of one section or of Europe , as is largely the case in New York , but discussing the affairs of the entire country . The figures which garnish their conversation are bewildering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will reveal to the listener how vast and how wealthy a region acknowledges Chicago as its market and its financial and trading centre . Without either avowing or contesting any part of the process by which Chicago men account for their city 's importance or calculate its future , let me repeat a digest of what several influential men of that city said upon the subject . Chicago , then , is the centre of a circle of 1000 miles diameter . If you draw a line northward 500 miles , you find everywhere arable land and timber . The same is true with respect to a line drawn 500 miles in a northwesterly course . For 650 miles westward there is no change in the rich and alluring prospect , and so all around the circle , except where Lake Michigan interrupts it , the same conditions are found . Moreover , the lake itself is a valuable element in commerce . The rays or spokes in all these directions become materialized in the form of the tracks of 35 railways which enter the city . Twenty-two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-radials made by other railroads raise the number to 50 roads . As said above , in Chicago one-twenty-fifth of the railway mileage of the world terminates , and serves 30 millions of persons , who find Chicago the largest city easily accessible to them . Thus is found a vast population connected easily and directly with a common centre , to which everything they produce can be brought , and from which all that contributes to the material progress and comfort of man may be economically distributed . A financier who is equally well known and respected in New York and Chicago put the case somewhat differently as to what he called Chicago 's territory . He considered it as being 1000 miles square , and spoke of it as " the land west of the Alleghanies and south of Mason and Dixon 's line . " This region , the richest agricultural territory in the world , does its financiering in Chicago . The rapid increase in wealth of both the city and the tributary region is due to the fact that every year both produce more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago the rule was that a stream of goods ran eastward over the Alleghanies , and another stream of supplies came back , so that the West had little gain to show . But during the past five years this back-setting current has been a stream of money returned for the products the West has distributed . The West is now selling to the East and to Europe and getting money in return , because it is manufacturing for itself , as well as tilling the soil and mining for the rest of the world . It therefore earns money and acquires a profit instead of continuing its former process of toiling merely to obtain from the East the necessaries of life . The condition in which Nebraska and Kansas find themselves is the condition in which a great part of the West was placed not long ago  --  a condition of debt , of being mortgaged , and of having to send its earnings to Eastern capitalists . That is no longer the case of the West in general . The debtor States now are Kansas , Nebraska , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Illinois , Ohio , Indiana , Missouri , Wisconsin , and // Michigan ( the States most closely tributary to Chicago ) have paid off their mortgages , and are absorbing money and investing it in local improvements . What they earn is now their own , and it comes back to them in the form of money . This money used to be shipped to the East , to which these States were in debt , but now it is invested where it is earned , and the consequence has been that in the last five or six years the West has rarely shipped any currency East , but has been constantly drawing it from there . In this change of condition is seen an explanation of much that has made Chicago peculiar . She has been what she would call " hustling . " For years , in company with the entire Western country , she has been making money only to pay debts with . That , they say , is why men in Chicago have talked only " business " ; that is why Chicago has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking investment . The former conditions having changed , now that she is producing more and buying less , the rest will change also . When we understand what are the agricultural resources of the region for which Chicago is the trading - post , we perceive how certain it was that its debt would be paid , and that great wealth would follow . The corn lands of Illinois return a profit of $15 to the acre , raising 50 to 60 bushels at 42*- cents a bushel last year , and at a cost for cultivation of only $7 an acre . Wheat produces $22 50 an acre , costs a little less than corn , and returns a profit of from $12 to $15 . Oats run 55 bushels to the acre , at 27 cents a bushel , and cost the average farmer only , say , $6 an acre , returning $8 or $9 an acre in profit . These figures will vary as to production , cost , and profit , but it is believed that they represent a fair average . This midland country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand million bushels of corn , seven hundred million bushels of oats , fifty million hogs , twenty-eight million horses , thirty million sheep , and so on , to cease before the reader is wearied ; but in no single instance is the region producing within 50 per cent . of what it will be made to yield before the expiration of the next twenty years . Farming there has been haphazard , rude , and wasteful ; but as it begins to pay well , the methods begin to improve . Drainage will add new lands , and better methods will swell the crops , so that , for instance , where 60 bushels of corn to the acre are now grown , at least 100 bushels will be harvested . All the corn lands are now settled , but they are not improved . They will yet double in value . It is different with wheat ; with that the maximum production will soon be attained . Such is the wealth that Chicago counts up as tributary to her . By the railroads that dissect this opulent region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the western country between the Rockies and the Alleghanies . She is closely allied to the South , because she is manufacturing and distributing much that the South needs , and can get most economically from her . Chicago has become the third manufacturing city in the Union , and she is drawing manufactures away from the East faster than most persons in the East imagine . To-day it is a great Troy stove - making establishment that has moved to Chicago ; the week before it was a Massachusetts shoe factory that went there . Many great establishments have gone there , but more must follow , because Chicago is not only the centre of the midland region in respect of the distribution of made-up wares , but also for the concentration of raw materials . Chicago must lead in the manufacture of all goods of which wood , leather , and iron are the bases . The revolution that took place in the meat trade when Chicago took the lead in that industry affected the whole leather and hide industry . Cattle are dropping 90,000 skins a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , St. Louis , Kansas City , Omaha , and St. Paul . It is idle to suppose that those skins will be sent across the Alleghanies to be turned into goods and sent back again . Wisconsin has become the great tanning State , and all over the district close around Chicago are factories and factory towns where hides are turned into leather goods . The West still gets its finer goods in the East , but it is making the coarser grades , and to such an extent as to give a touch of New England color to the towns and villages around Chicago . This is not an unnatural rivalry that has grown up . The former condition of Western dependence was unnatural . The science of profitable business lies in // the practice of economy . Chicago has in abundance all the fuels except hard coal . T She has coal , oil , stone , brick-everything that is needed for building and for living . Manufactures gravitate to such a place for economical reasons . The population of the north Atlantic division , including Pennsylvania and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 17,401,000 . The population of the northern central division , trading with Chicago , is 22,362,279 . Every one has seen each succeeding census shift the centre of population farther and farther West , but not every one is habituated to putting two and two together . " Chicago is yet so young and busy , " said he who is perhaps the leading banker there , " she has no time for anything beyond each citizen 's private affairs . It is hard to get men to serve on a committee . The only thing that saves us from being boors is our civic pride . We are fond , proud , enthusiastic in that respect . But we know that Chicago is not rich , like New York . She has no bulk of capital lying ready for investment and reinvestment ; yet she is no longer poor . She has just got over her poverty , and the next stage , bringing accumulated wealth , will quickly follow . Her growth in this respect is more than paralleled by her development into an industrial centre . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . The explanation forms not merely the history of an American town , and a town of young men , it points an old moral . It demonstrates anew the active truth that energy is a greater force than money . It commands money . The young founders of Chicago were backed in the East by capitalists who discounted the energy they saw them display . And now Chicago capitalists own the best street railway in St. Louis , the surface railway system of Toledo , a thousand enterprises in hundreds of Western towns . Chicago has been as crude and rough as any other self-creating entity engaged in a hard struggle for a living . And latterly confidence in and exultation over the inevitable success of the battle have made her boastful , conceited , and noisy . But already one citizen has taken to building houses for rental and not for sale . He has arranged an imitation Astor estate as far ahead as the law will permit , which is to say to one generation unborn . Already , so they boast in Chi cago , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whist-players with gray locks and semispherical waistcoats in the afternoons during business *hours I - a most surprising thing , and only possible at the Chicago Club , which is the old club of the " old rich . " These partially globular old whist-players are still in business , of course , as everybody is , but they let go with one hand , as it were , in the afternoons , and only stroll around to their offices at four or five o'clock to make certain that the young members of the other clubs have not stolen their trade while they were playing cards . The other clubs of Cliicago merely look like clubs , as we understand the word in New York . They are patronized as our dining-clubs are , with a rush at luncheon-time , although at both ends of the town , in the residence districts , there are clubs to which men drift on Sundays . And here one is brought to reflect that Chicago is distinctly American . I know that the Chicagoans boast that theirs is the most mixed population in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Americans . The streets of the city are full of strange faces of a type to which we are not used in the East - a dish - faced , soft - eyed , lighthaired people . They are Scandinavians ; but they are as malleable as lead , and quickly and easily follow and adopt every Americanism . In return , they ask only to be permitted to attend a host of Lutheran churches in flocks , to work hard , live temperately , save thriftily , and to pronounce every j as if it were a y . But the dominating class is of that pure and broad American type which is not controlled by New England or any other tenets , but is somewhat loosely made up of the overflow of the New England , the Middle , and the Southern States . It is as mixed and comprehensive as the West Point school of cadets . It calls its city " She-caw-ger . " It inclines to soft hats , and only once in a great while does a visitor see a Chicagoan who has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are eloquent of its habits , especially of its habit of freedom . " Take G- 's candy to the loved ones at home , " stares from hundreds of walls . " Gentlemen all chew Praxy because it sweetens the breath after drinking , " one manufacturer declares ; then he adds , " Ladies who play // tennis chew it because it lubricates the tliroat . " A bottler of spring water advertises it as " God 's own liver remedy . " On the bill-boards of a theatre is the threat that " If you miss seeing Peter Peterson , half your life will be gone . " In a principal street is a characteristic sign product , " My fifteen-cent meals are world-beaters " ; yet there are worse terrors for Chicago diners-out , as is shown by the sign , " Business lunch - quick and cheap . " But the visitor 's heart warms to the town when he sees its parks and its homes .

They are not cliff dwellings like our flats and tenements ; there are no brown-stone cafions like our uptown streets ; there are only occasional hesitating hints there of those Philadelphian and Baltimorean mills that grind out dwellings all alike , as nature makes pease and man makes pins . There are more miles of detached villas in Chicago than a stranger can easily account for . As they are not only found on Prairie Avenue and the boulevards , but in the populous wards and semi-suburbs , where the middle folk are congregated , it is evident that the prosperous moiety of the population enjoys living better ( or better living ) than the same fraction in the Atlantic cities . Land in New York has been too costly to permit of these villa - like dwellings , but that does not alter the fact that existence in a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crippled living . There never has been any valid excuse for the building of these compressed houses by New York millionaires . It sounds like a Celtic bull , but , in my opinion , the poorer millionaires of Prairie Avenue are better off . A peculiarity of the buildings of Chicago is in the great variety of building - stones that are employed in their construction . Where we would build two blocks of brown-stone , I have counted thirteen varieties of beautiful and differing building material . Moreover , the contrasts in architectural design evidence among Chicago house-owners a complete sway of individual taste . It is in these beautiful homes that the people , who do not know what to do with their club-houses , hold their card parties ; it is to them that they bring their visitors and friends ; in short , it is at home that the Chicagoan recreates and loafs . It is said , and I have no reason to doubt it , that the clerks and small tradesmen who live in thousands of these pretty little boxes are the owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display evidence of a tasteful and costly garnering of the globe for articles of luxury and virtu . A sneering critic , who wounded Chicago deeply , intimated that theirs must be a primitive society where the rich sit on their door-steps of an evening . That really is a habit there , and in the finer districts of all the Western cities . To enjoy themselves the more completely , the people bring out rugs and carpets , always of gay colors , and fling them on the steps  --  or stoops , as we Dutch legatees should say-that the ladies ' dresses may not be soiled . As these step clothings are as bright as the maidens ' eyes and as gay as their cheeks , the effect may be imagined . For my part , I think it argues well for any society that indulges in the trick , and proves existence in such a city to be more human and hearty and far less artificial than where there is too much false pride to permit of it .

If the dead do not rise until the Judgment-day , but lie less active than their dust , then old Wouter Van Twiller , Pctrus Stuyvesant , and the rest of our original Knickerbockers will be sadly disappointed angels when they come to , and find that we have abandoned these practices in New York , after the good example that our first families all set us . It is in Chicago that we find a great number of what are called boulevarded streets , at the intersections of which are signs bearing such admonitions as these : " For pleasure driving . No traffic wagons allowed ; " or , " Traffic teams are not al // lowed on this boulevard . " Any street in the residence parts of the city n*y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park commissioners of the district , provided that it does not lie next to any other such street , and provided that a certain proportion of the property-holders along it are minded to follow a simple formula to procure the improvement . Improved road-beds are given to such streets , and they not only become neat and pretty , but enhance the value of all neighboring land . One boulevard in Chicago penetrates to the very heart of its bustling business district . By means of it men and women may drive from the southern suburbs or parks to the centre of trade , perhaps to their office doors , under the most pleasant conditions . By means of the lesser beautified avenues among the dwellings men and women may sleep of nights , and hide from the worst of the city 's tumult among green lawns and flower beds . Chicago 's park system is so truly her crown , or its diadem , that its fame may lead to the thought that enough has been said about it . That is not the case , however , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds some of them outgrowing his knowledge , unless he goes to them as he ought to go to his prayers . It is not in extent that the city 's parks are extraordinary , for , all told , they comprise less than two thousand acres . It is the energy that has given rise to them , and the taste and enthusiasm which have been expended upon them , that cause our wonder . Sand and swamp were at the bottom of them , and if their surfaces now roll in gentle undulations , it is because the earth that was dug out for the making of ponds has been subsequently applied to the forming of hills and knolls . The people go to some of them upon the boulevards of which I have spoken , beneath trees and beside lawns and gorgeous flower beds , having their senses sharpened in anticipation of the pleasure-grounds beyond , as the heralds in some old plays prepare us for the action that is to follow . Once the parks are reached , they are found to be literally for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy that a people who are so largely American would not suffer them to be otherwise . There are no signs warning the public off the grass , or announcing that they " may look , but voL . LXXXIY. - Ko. 501-43 must n't touch " whatever there is to see . The people swarm all over the grass , and yet it continues beautiful day after day and year after year . The floral displays seem unharmed ; at any rate , we have none to compare with them in any Atlantic coast parks . The people even picnic on the sward , and those who can appreciate such license find , ready at hand , baskets in which to hide the litter which follows . And , 0 ye who manage other parks we wot of , know that these Chicago play-grounds seem as free from harm and eyesore as any in the land . The best parks face the great lake , and get wondrous charms of dignity and beauty from it . At the North Side the Lincoln Park commissioners , at great expense , are building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sea-wall , esplanade , and drive to enclose a long , broad body of the lake water . Although the great blue lake is at the city 's edge , there is little or no sailing or pleasureboating upon it . It is too rude and treacherous . Therefore these commissioners of the Lincoln Park are enclosing , behind their new - made land , a watercourse for sailing and rowing , for racing , and for more indolent aquatic sport . The Lake Shore Drive , when completed , will be three miles in length , and will connect with yet another notable road to Fort Sheridan twenty - five miles in length . All these beauties form part of the main exhibit at the Columbian Exposition . Realizing this , the municipality has not only voted five millions of dollars to the Exposition , but has set apart $3,500,000 for beautifying and improving the city in readiness for the Exposition and its visitors , even as a bride bedecketh herself for her husband . That is well ; but it is not her beauty that will most interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this is very American ; but what is to be said of the Chicago Sunday , with its drinking shops all wide open , and its multitudes swarming out on pleasure bent ? And what of the theatres opening to the best night 's business of the week at the hour of Sunday evening service in the churches ? I suspect that this also is American -- that sort of American that develops under Southern and Western influences not dominated by the New England spirit . And yet the Puritan traditions are not without honor and respect in Chicago , // witness the fact that the city spent seventeen and a quarter millions of dollars during the past five years upon her public schools . Another thing that I suspect is American , though I am sorry to say it , is the impudence of the people who wait on the public . It is quite certain that the more intelligent a man is , the better waiter he will make ; but your free-born American acknowledges a quality which more than offsets his intelligence . In pursuit of knowledge I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good , and the American who waited on me lightened his service with song in this singular manner : " Comrades , com-you said coffee , did n't yer ? - ever since we were boys ; sharing each other 's soi ' - I do n't think we 've got no Roquefort -- sharing each other 's joys . Brie , then-keerect ! " ( I recall this against my country , not against Chicago restaurants . A city which possesses Harvey 's , Kinsley 's , or the Wellington need not be tender on that point . ) But it is as much as a man 's self-respect is worth to hazard a necessary question of a ticket-seller in a theatre or railroad depot . Those bona fide Americans , the colored men , are apt to try their skill at repartee with the persons they serve ; and while I can not recall an instance.when a hotel clerk was impudent , I several times heard members of that fraternity yield to a sense of humor that would bankrupt a Broadway hotel in three weeks . In only one respect are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they boast the same motto- " Liberty , equality , fraternity . " There is another notable thing in Chicago which , I am certain , is a national rather than a merely local peculiarity . I refer to dirty streets . In our worst periods in New York we resort to a Latin trick of tidying up our most conspicuous thoroughfares , and leaving the others to the care of-I think it must be the Federal Weather Bureau to whose care we leave them . However , nearly all American cities are disgracefully alike in this respect , and until some dying patriot bequeathes the money to send every Alderman ( back ) to Europe to see how streets should and can be kept , it is , perhaps , idle to discuss the subject . But these are all comparative trifles . Certainly they will seem such to whoever shall look into the situation of Chicago closely enough to discover the great problems that lie before the people as a corporation . She will take up these questions in their turn and as soon as possible , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise and energy of Chicago will doubt for a moment that she will master them shrewdly . These problems are of national interest , and one is a subject of study throughout Christendom . They deal with the discipliningof the railroads , which run through the city at a level with the streets , and with the establishment of an efficient system of drainage or sewage . A start has been made for the handling of the sewage question . The little Chicago River flows naturally into the great lake ; but years ago an attempt to alter its course was made by the operation of pumping-works at Bridgeport , within the city limits , whereby 40,000 gallons of water per minute are pumped out of the river , and into a canal that connects with the Illinois River , and thence with the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico . At most times this causes a sluggish flow of the river southward away from the lake . Water from the lake is also pumped into the river to dilute its waters , but it remains a noisome stream , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are driven into Lake Michigan to pollute the city 's water supply . " Measures have been taken to construct a large gravity channel as an outlet for the sewage into the Illinois River . The Chicago Sanitary District has been formed by act of Legislature ; nine trustees have been elected to supervise the construction of the channel , engineers have been set at work upon surveys , " and perhaps the channel which will result will serve the double purpose of disposing of the sewage and establishing a navigable waterway connecting Chicago and her commerce with the Mississippi River . It is said that this will cost Chicago twenty millions of dollars . Honestly done , it will certainly be worth whatever it costs . Chicago 's water supply has been linked with this sewage problem . It does not join with it . Once the sewage matter were settled , the old two - mile crib in Lake Michigan would bring to town water than which there is none more pure on earth . The five-mile tunnel and crib now in course of construction ( that is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lake ) certainly will T // leave nothing to be desired , even as the sewage is now ordered . The railroad question is more bothersome . Chicago is criss-crossed by a gridiron of railway tracks . Practically all of them enter the city and dissect the streets at grade ; that is to say , at the level of the city 's arteries . Speaking not too loosely , the locomotives and cars mangle or kill two persons on every weekday in the year , or six hundred persons annually . The railroad officials argue that they invented and developed Chicago , and that her people are ungrateful to protest against a little thing like a slaughter which would depopulate the average village in a year . In so far as it is true that they created the city , they will but repeat the experience of that fabled inventor whose monstrous mechanical offspring claimed him for its victim , for , in a wholesome public-spirited sense , that is what must become their fate . Chicago is ten miles deep and twenty-four miles wide , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all terminate within 4000 feet of the Rookery Building . I rely on the accuracy of a noted Chicagoan for that measurement . The Rookery is situated very much as the Bank of England is in London and as the City Hall is in New York , so that it will be seen that Chicago is at the mercy of agencies that should be her servants , and not her masters . Some railroad men , looking from their stand-point , assert that it will cost Chicago one hundred millions of dollars to overcome this injury to her comfort and her safety . This assertion is often echoed in Chicago by men not in the railroad business . On the other hand , I shall be surprised if the railroads do not have to bear a large share of the cost , whatever it may prove to be , because I take it that Chicago will not fail to profit by the experiences of other cities where this problem has already been dealt with , and where it has not been so lightly taken for granted that when railroads are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not the railroads , who must pay to move them out of the way . The sum of present human judgment seems to be that the cost is divisible , and that the railroads should look after their tracks , and the people after their streets . The entire nation will observe with keen interest the manner in which Chicago deals with this problem , not with any anticipation of an unjust solution that will trespass on the popular rights , but to note the determination of the lesser question , whether the railroads shall be compelled to sink their tracks in trenches or to raise them on trusses , or whether , as has also been suggested , all the roads shall combine to build and terminate at a common elevated structure curving around the outside of the thick of the city , and capable of transferring passengers from road to road , as well as of distributing them among points easily accessible from every district . One would think it would be to the advantage of the principal railway corporations to try at once to effect an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because , as I have said , the railroads are now the slowest of Chicago 's institutions . The reduced speed at which the municipality obliges them to run their trains must be still further modified , and even the present headway is hindered by the frequent delays at the numerous crossings of the tracks . This is a nuisance . Every occasional traveller feels it , and what must it be to the local commuters who live at a distance from their business ? They move by slow stages a quarter of an hour or more before the cars in which they ride are able to get under the scheduled headway . But it is more than a local question . It is one of the peculiarities of Chicago that she arrests a great proportion of the travelling public that seeks destinations beyond her limits in either direction . They may not want to go to Chicago at all , but it is the rule of most roads that they must do so . They must stop , transfer baggage , and change railroads . Often a stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to continue , the public might at least have the performance expedited . Both the local and the general nuisance will , in all likelihood , be remedied together . It is the aim of all progressive railroad managers to shorten time and prevent transfers wherever possible ; and delays against which the entire travelling public protests can not long avoid remedy . In interviews with Chicago men the newspapers have obtained many estimates of the number of visitors who will attend the Columbian Exposition . One calculation , which is called conservative , is that ten million persons will see the display , // and will leave three hundred millions of dollars in the city . It is not easy to judge of such estimates , but we know that there is a wider interest in this Exposition than in any that was ever held . We know also that in the foremost countries of Europe workmen 's clubs and popular lotteries have been established or projected for the purpose of sending their most fortunate participants to Chicagoa few of many signs of an uncommon desire to witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago , they will find it not only an impressive but a substantial city . It will speak to every understanding of the speed with which it is hastening to a place among the world 's capitals . Those strangers who travel farther in our West may find other towns that have builded too much upon the false prospects of districts where the crops have proved uncertain . They may see still other showy cities , where the main activity is in the direction of " swapping " real estate . It is a peculiar industry , accompanied by much bustle and lying . But they will not find in Chicago anything that will disturb its tendency to impress them with a solidity and a degree of enterprise and prosperity that are only excelled by the almost idolatrous faith of the people in their community . The city 's broad and regular thoro ' *ghfares will astonish many of us who have imbibed the theory that streets are first mapped out by cows ; its alley system between streets will win the admiration of those who live where alleys are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility and self-respect of a great body of its citizens . The discovery that the city 's harbor is made up of forty-one miles of the banks of an internal river will lead to the satisfactory knowledge that it has preserved its beautiful front upon Lake Michigan as an ornament . This has been bordered by parks and parkways in pursuance of a plan that is interrupted to an important extent only where a pioneer railway caine without the foreknowledge that it would eventually develop into a nuisance and an eyesore . Its splendid hotels , theatres , schools , churches , galleries , and public works and ornaments will commend the city to many who will not study its commercial side . In short , it will be found that those who visit the exposition will not afterward reflect upon its assembled proofs of the triumphs of man and of civilization without recalling Chicago 's contribution to the sum .
