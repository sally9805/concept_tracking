txt IN his admirable article under the above title , which appeared in the March number of the REVIEW , the Hon. Hilary A. Herbert has said , with his usual force and clearness , all that can be said in favor of the efficiency of the legislative machinery employed by the House of Representatives as contrasted with that employed by the House of Commons . There can be no question of the soundness of Mr. Herbert 's main conclusion that , despite the hostile criticism often directed by the press against the personnel of the House of Representatives , it is nevertheless true that the body as a whole may challenge comparison for integrity , fidelity , industry , and ability with any similar body in the world ; that " taken altogether there can be no better guaranty of the capacity of the people of the United States for self-government than the character of the men they send to Washington to make their laws . " But after that admission has been made the fact remains that , notwithstanding the high average of personal excellence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-standing conviction that the House , in its corporate capacity . does not efficiently and promptly dispose of the great and complicated mass of legislative work yearly cast upon it ,  --  a conviction which accounts for Mr. Herbert 's opening statement that " the one factor in the American government that is subjected to more adverse criticism than all others combined is the House of Representatives . " Since the close of the civil war there has been *i growing conviction upon the part of the American people that twre is something radically wrong with the oee4ur* Q* Q1* // popular chamber , and that some sweeping reform or readjustment mast be made in order to increase its efficiency . One class of critics have contented themselves with simply depreciating the character and ability of the members themselves , while another and more thoughtful class have fancied that the desired end can only be attained through the substitution of the English cabinet system in the place of our American committee system . After many years of patient investigation into the origin , growth , and practical workings of English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude that the growing inability of the House of Representatives to do all that is required of itcannot be traced to personal deficiencies upon the part of its members , neither is the remedy for such evils as do exist to be found in the sweeping change which certain theorists have advocated . The most remarkable trait which our federal constitution has so far developed is its elasticity-its wonderful capacity to grow and to expand with the growth of the nation , and to adapt itself to new conditions , without organic change in the instrument itself . This good result is the product of a foresight which was wise enough to intrust to Congress a range of legislative action sufficiently wide for the task of adaptation and readjustment imposed by a national development so vast and rapid as to have no parallel in history . The constitutional power given to Congress to regulate its own procedure is broad enough to enable it to so reorganize and readjust its relations with the Executive as to secure all the practical advantages of the English cabinet system without more than a modification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our political life . When we remember that the House of Representatives is really the workshop of the constitution , it is surprising to see how well it handles the vast amount of business which of late years has been cast upon it by means of the old and now inadequate machinery with which the fathers equipped it . When the first Congress met , the population of the United States was about three millions and a half , and the total number of bills offered in that Congress was less than three hundred . Our population now exceeds sixty-three millions , and the total number of bills offered in the House of Representatives alone during each congress usually exceeds ten thousand . As the volume of business in that House has thus increased , and as new subjects of legislation have come into existence , // the old committee system has simply been expanded by a multiplication of the standing committees which now number fifty-six , and by a distribution of the vast jurisdiction originally vested in the Committee of Ways and Means among many others . The practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subdivision is a lack of leadership or directing power through which the attention of the House can be promptly concentrated upon the few vitally important subjects of national legislation which should be lifted up out of the mass , debated and disposed of in advance of all other business . The ability to accomplish that necessary and practical result is the distinguishing feature of the system of cabinet government which prevails in every parliament in the world except our own . Back of this lack of concentrating and directing power , inherent in the headless committee system , stand the unorganized relations of the Executive with Congress , which intensify the difficulty . The primary purpose of oar system of parties is to secure the periodical presentation to the country of* two or more comprehensive political programmes which each party promises , in the event of success at the polls , to put into practical operation through acts of C5ngress . The party platforms in which these programmes are embodied always have been and always will be , for an obvious reason , vague and shadowy on the vital issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than concrete propositions . Not until after the victorious party has entered into possession of the executive power , with or without majorities in the federal legislature , does the vital and practical question arise as to the character and scope of the two or three leading acts to be offered in Congress as concrete expressions of the party platform . Under the English cabinet system no difficulty can arise as to who is authorized to transform party pledges into proposed schemes of legislation , for the simple reason that the cabinet itself is a political committee armed with the power to draft legislation , and to offer the same in the House of Commons as the official expression of the party which it represents . Under our parliamentary system a very different conditiou of things exists . The President and his cabinet , as representatives of the dominant party , have no special right to interpret the party platform which they are expected to carry out , neither do they possess the power // to draft , to offer or to debate the proposed acts through whose influence alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being allowed to speak or to act directly . As the right to initiate legislation is practically vested in the committees , the President and his cabinet are forced to rely upon their political friends thereon to draft such acts as the dominant party is supposed to approve , and to conduct them through the chambers . During the debates which ensue , the President and his cabinet can only be heard through the mouths of " friends of the administration , " who speak without any official authority . The difficulties arising out of this system of organized confusion reveal two weak spots in our system of federal government . The first difficulty consists in the want of power in the President and his cabinet ( a power universally conceded elsewhere ) to sit as a political supreme court , and to interpret the party platform by reducing its general statements to the concrete forms of proposed acts of Congress . The second difficulty consists of the want of power in the cabinet to offer such proposed acts in the houses as the official expressions of the party which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early consideration , and to take part in the debates upon them . Under every parliamentary system in the world except our own these two fundamental rights are secured to the executive as practical expedients absolutely necessary for the prompt and orderly consideration of great national measures which have a natural precedence over all other business . All existing cabinet systems except our own are modeled after the English , and that , we should not fail to remember , has been developed since the ma/cing of our federal constitution , in order to enable the reorganized English democracy to transact the vast business of an empire upon business principles and in accordance with the will of the majority . As Mr. Bryce has well expressed the fact : " In 1787 , when the Constitutional Convention met at Philadelphia , the cabinet system of government was in England still unmature . It was so immature that its true nature had not been perceived. *** The fathers had therefore no opportunity to see the workings of the English constitution in its modern form , they had no knowledge of the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be assumed that they re p. , 4mriocrn CYQm ? nornQ0Z*1. , Y9l. 1 , p. *78 , // jected it as unsuitable to our condition . For the want of something better they equipped the two houses with the legislative machinery known as the committee system ; and in the early days , when the volume of legislative work was very small , that system was adequate . But the original conditions have wholly changed ; the growth of population has been great , and as Mr. Herbert has said , " the interests embraced in the legislation of Congress have multiplied even more rapidly than population . " Out of the casting of this vast increase of legislative work upon the primitive committee system grow the causes which account for the statement already quoted that " the one factor in the American government that is subjected to more adverse criticism than all others combined is the House of Representatives. ** The purpose of this article is to combat Mr. Herbert 's statement that " evevy serious objection urged against its ( the House 's ) methods by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contend that , through a brief act of Congress supple . mented by a corresponding change in the rules , the relations of the two houses with the Executive may be so readjusted as to secure all the practical business advantages of the cabinet system , without any organic change in the constitution , and without more than a modification of the existing committee system . Such an act should vest in the American cabinet the three powers now vested in the council by the Swiss Federal Constitution , which are the right to appear in both houses , to propose measures of legislation , and to debate them , without the power to vote . Thus could be secured to the cabinet the all-important right to draft and initiate legislation upon those questions of vital national interest to which the Executive stands pledged . No illusion was ever more complete than that embodied in the idea that the present condition of things can be improved by simply giving to the cabinet ministers permission to sit in the houses with the right to debate , without the right to draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debate . Parliamentary government is simply another name for government by party , and in all such governments party is the steam-power which drives the constitutional machinery . Under the English system the cabinet is the conduit through which the steam-power is applied to the machinery . The first step in the process is the drafting and offering in the Commons of the schemes of legisla // tion which the dominant party has promised the people to enact ; the second is the driving of such measures to a legal conclusion . Unless we are prepared to arm the cabinet with the power to take the first step , all efforts to secure any of the benefits of the cabinet system will be useless . There is no lack of constitutional power in Congress to pass such an act as has been indicated . Under the proposed arrangement no cabinet minister would become in any souse " a member of either house . " The members of the cabinet would simply appear at the bar of the houses by their invitation , submit measures for their consideration and debate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication would certainly not conflict with the maxim which declares that the three departments of government-legislative. executive , and judicial-shall forever remain separate and distinct . As all students of our constitution know , that maxim was incorporated into our system in the same limited and restricted sense in which it was understood in the original from which it was taken . As Mr. Madison has expressed it in the Federalist : " On the slightest view of the British constitution we mu*it perceive that the legislative , executive , and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each other . " And then speaking of the constitutions of the States he said : " If we look into the constitutions of the several States , we find that , notwithstanding the emphatical , and , in some instances , the unqualified terms in which the axiom has been laid down , there is not a single instance in which the several departments of power have been kept absolutely sep . arate and distinct . " In the making of our federal constitution , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , had been divided between the three departments in the limited and qualified sense in which such division was understood in the State constitutions , each department was organized in accordance with English ideas in so far as they could be applied to a " composite state " at once federal and republican . It can hardly be contended that the new and qualified relation which the cabinet ( without the power to vote ) would assume to Congress under the proposed act could offend in any way against a maxim which has always been applied here in the same limited sense in which it has been understood in England . If Congress possesses the power to pass the act , it certainly possesses the power to so modify its rules as to give to the // cabinet that precedence for the consideration and dispatch of great national measures which is guaranteed to all other cabinets unt.r the European constitutions . Under the committee system as now organized " the several great committees control in turn " ; under the modified system proposed the cabinet would simply have its turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet to the few great subjects of a purely national charact.r which should be formulated before Congress meets , and which should be promptly presented for legislative action as soon as the session begins . In that way a natural division of labor would be brought about under which the drafting and advocating of only a few vitally important acts would pass to the cabinet , while the Houses themselves would still reserve for their committees the initiative as to the great mass of business to be disposed of . Thus the committee system would only be modified to a limited extent by the transfer to the cabinet of the duty of formulating and advocating the few great national measures to which the dominant party stands pledged . At the meeting of Congress such measures would always be ready for presentation and debate as the official expressions of the party intrusted with their enactment , without the long and awkward pause which takes place under the existing system . Under the authority to press such measures to a conclusion in advance of all other legislation , the cabinet would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays which will often occur to play havoc with its business interests . Every individual and every corporation possesses the inherent right to consider grave and urgent matters and to dispose of them in advance of everything else . The mission of the cabinet system is to arm parliamentary governments with that simple and indispensable power now so conspicuously absent in our own . What has so far been said has proceeded upon the assumption that the party in possession of the executive office , and armed with a limited initiative in legislation , will always possess a majority in both houses upon which it may rely for the enactment of its proposals into laws . Bnt suppose a contrary condition of things should exist-that the party in possession of the Presidency should be in the minority in one or both houses . What would then happen after its measures had been rejected by an adverse vote ? It is certain that the ordinary result which // follows under the English cabinet system  --  a resignation of the ministry or a dissolution and an immediate appeal to the people - could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution which no wise man would advocate . But the hopeful feature of the case is that no organic change is necessary in a constitution which expressly provides for direct appeals to the people every two years . When periods of ten or twenty years are taken into account , it will be found that under our system of biennial Congressional elections appeals are more often made upon parliamentary questions to the Americau than to the English electors . It is only necessary that we should utilize such elections more perfectly than ever before as the means of ascertaining the will of the people upon precise and definite questions already reduced to the forms of acts of Congress . The inevitable result of the proposed change would be to draw from the party in possession of the Presidency more explicit and authoritative declarations in the form of well-digested schemes of legislation which the opposition would be forced to meet by counter-schemes upon the same subject . With the great issues thus formulated and crystallized , our Congressional elections would soon become , in a sense which they have never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electors would have the opportunity to give not simply a general vote of confidence in a man , but a pointed expression of approval or disapproval of well-understood schemes of legislation . The fact that under the proposed plan the ministers would always remain in office until the end of their terms , after an adverse vote upon the measures offered by them , would be no drawback whatever . Such is the rule under the Constitution of the Swiss Confederation , which , from its federal character , is strikingly like our own . As Mr. Freeman has expressed it : " The Swiss Federal Constitution has sever.al points of likeness with that of America , and the constitution of the two houses of the Federal legisla. ture is clearly borrowed from the American model . " 5 Under the Swiss system the executive power is vested , not in a president , but in a council or cabinet of seven which holds office for three years . The Council apportions the departments of state among its own members , and " the members of the Council have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal legislature , but not to vote . " * When the measures pro5Essay Upon Presidential Government . // posed by the Swiss ministers are defeated in the legislature , they simply return to their desks and go on with the business of their departments , a form of procedure which has stood the test of experience . We have therefore a most satisfactory precedent upon the one vital point at which we must depart from the English model . The Swiss constitution , like our own , is federal ; and its federal legislature consists of two chambers . The Swiss executive Council or cabinet holds for three years instead of four ; the Swiss ministers possess the right to sit in either house , to initiate legislation and to debate , without the right to vote ; and when the vote upon measures proposed by them is adverse , they remain in office until the end of their terms . It is therefore perfectly practicable for us , by means of a brief act of Congress coupled with a corresponding modification of the rules , to engraft upon our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English cabinet system ; and then at the point of departure from that system we can save ourselves from any organic change by appealing to the people in the old way at the congressional elections . That such a modified cabinet system - under which the ministers may sit in the chambers with the right to initiate legislation and to debate , without the right to vote , and without losing office upon an adverse vote-works well in practice is fully established by the experience of a federal system strikingly like our own . A careful review of the whole matter must lead to the conclusion that the House of Representatives has been for a long time subjected , as Mr. Herbert says , to more adverse criticism than all other departments of the government combined , simply because there are in fact radical defects in its now inadequate machinery which inflict serious inconveniences upon the legislative business of the country . The nation continues to complain simply because there is something to be amended . The trouble so far has been in mistaking the real cause of the difficulty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiencies upon the part of men . Any hopeful effort at improvement must begin with a correct diagnosis which will indicate with unerring precision the points at which the friction occurs . In readjusting the machinery of a system like our own , which is to a great extent an adaptation of another to new conditions , it is certainly wise to look to the subsequent developments of that other for light and // guidance . And yet in adapting English institutions to our wants we must remember as the fathers did that they can only be applied so far as our special circumstances warrant in the light of that principle , inherent in the race , which commends judicious amendments suggested by experience rather than novel experiments based upon s-priori principles . The suggested readjustment of our legislative machinery in its relations with the Executive through congressional action only , fortified as it is at every step by precedent and example , complies with every condition which the most conservative reformer may impose . The good results which would surely flow as collateral consequences from the proposed change could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national platforms , which would naturally become more precise and definite in view of the fact that the cabinet of the victorious party , as its official organ , would be at once called upon to transform its pledges into acts of Congress . The right of such a body to speak officially for the dominant party , and to construe its generalities , could not fail to improve a political system which now scatters at the very point at which it should concentrate . And then the character of the work to be performed by the cabinet ministers in drafting and debating the great national measures of legislation would certainly draw into those offices the very wisest and most experienced statesmen the country could furnish . Every President would be forced to snrround himself with a trained fighting force in which untried men could find no place . The debates would inevitably bring into collision the great minds of the opposing parties in a much more pointed manner than at present , and the people would witness the proceedings with a keener interest and a far more perfect understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses , everybody would understand where the credit of authorship belonged . In the event of defeat the hostile majority would be forced to offer counter-measures , for which it would become directly responsible . In that way definite and well-understood issues would be made up for the judgment of the electors at the next congressional election . And thus the whole system would become more quickly and more surely responsive than ever before to the touph of public opinion.
