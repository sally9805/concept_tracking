txt It appears by a dispatch to The New-York Times from Washington that the reason for the . detachment . of Capt . Henry Glass from the cruiser Cincinnati and his appointment to the command of the battleship Texas was that he had kept the Cincinnati in such a high condition of efficiency ; ' from the time he took command of that fine ship as to indicate to Secretary Herbert his peculiar fitness for a superior command . The keeping of a modern steel ship , with its mass of complicated mechanism , in constant working order , is a much more difficult task than that of maintaining one of the old wooden ships . There are electrical'and air-pressure machines , complicated steam apparatus and connections , . double bottoms , bulkheads , and Collision doors to be looked after ; ammunition hoists and steam or electrical steering gear  --  to be kept always in. ' prime working order , and they are only to be found always . in order for inspection under a strict ' commander , who appreciates the responsibility devolved upon him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One has only to recall the recent scandalous history of ' . the Atlanta to be Convinced that even commanders reputed to be disciplinarians and efficient officers may allow a ship . to run down until it may cost to . repair - her perilously near the amount beyond - which it is not lawful to go in restoring a vessel of the navy . The ' Atlanta had been so neglect . ed that ' her collision doors were rusted until they could not be closed , and dirt that should have been removed from the double bottoms and ' other parts of the ship had been painted over to save the labor and trouble or its removal . Under the regulations . made after the discovery of the Atlanta 's condition it is now next to . ' Impossible for . another vessel to be rendered uselessfor months through such criminal neglect , but the best and most Severe of regulations not all ' oilidek- ' arid men alike . Capt. - Glass , seems to have been one of the officers for whom no additional regulations were neeeSsary'to prove his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears , is Capt . R.D. Evans , to whom Secretary Herbert gave the command of the New-York to be assured that the efficiency of that magnificint vessel should be maintained at the best for three years . The condition of the New-York is , like that of the Cincinnati , quite beyond - censure for anything that can be done by the commander of the ship . ? It may be true that Secretary Herbert has considered the advisability of transferring Capt . Evans to the battleship Indiana. , when that vessel is ready for commission . If the report shall turn out to be true , his transfer of Capt . Evans , before he has completed a tour of service on the New-York , will be like the transfer of Capt . Glass to the Texas , and for the same reason  --  to give the new battleships the . advantage on their first cruises of the cotscientious , intelligent , faithful care of Captains who should be accepted as examples by the whole naval service .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
