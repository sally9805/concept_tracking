txt An impression seems to prevail among the officers of the New-York , New-Haven and Hartford Railroad Company that a stove ceases to be a stove when the coal Sre in it is used to heat water that is carried in pipes through a passenger car . It then becomes a " heater . " The cars of that company are warmed by such stoves , and because the stove doors are closed and locked the fire can not get out , these gentlemen say , evern when the car is torn to pieces by the terrible force of a collision . The purpose of those who made the law of this State concerning the use of stoves on railway trains was to exclude coal fires or wood fires from passenger cars . They had in mind the exclusion of Just such stoves as are used on the New-Haven Road , as well as other stoves . " We have not been deterred from the introduction of steam-heating apparatus because of the expense , " say the officers of the NewHaven Company , " but have been waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is curious that a system of heating by steam from the locomotive which has been used for two or three years by the New-York Central and Hudson River Compithy , and for almost as long a time by many other companies , should be regarded as worthless by the officers of the New-Haven Company . The plea by which President CLARK sought two years ago to defend his company 's inaction was that " any accident or defect in the pipe or fitting allowing the escape of steam in the car will instantly destroy every life in it . " Experiments made not long afterward showed that the escape of steam under such conditious would harm no one . The plea now is that the systems of steam heating in use are imperfect .                     @x txt Investigation indicates that the story told by Jacob F. Goss , a Lynn shoemaker , about " the extreme hardship and rough usage " the men and girls who lately went from Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoe factory there have been subjected to , may be a veritable cook-and-bull yarn .

Mr. Fuller says that his firm fitted out the new factory of Paul &; Co. at Caracas with everything in the way of machinery excepting the engines and stitching machines , which were bought in New-York . " I know Mr. Holman , " he says , " who Goss alleges , abused him , and can say that I know him to be a man of excellent reputation and above doing anything like that which is charged against him . Mr. Brigham of our house was the person who selected Holman for the position of general manager of the affairs of the Caracas firm , and he will substantiate what I have said . In refutation of the shoemaker 's statement " that no shoe factory had been erected , that the girls were placed in ill-ventilated rooms , and that the contracts were invalid , Mr. Brigham , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , written by Holman about a month ago , in which he describes the factory just then oompleted , and tells how well pleased all are with the place and their work . It was suggested to Mr. Brigham that there must be a good-sized colony of Massachusetts men down there . " Yes , " he replied , " seven men ( one being Goss ) and six women went from Lynn in December , and Saturday eight men , whom I engaged for Mr. Holman since the receipt of his letter , sailed from New-York . They were George E. riper of Haverhill , engineer ; John F. Spellman of Marlborough , edgesetter , whose pay will be from $18 to $20 a week ; George H. Crowley of Marl-borough , pay $18 a week ; James McCabe , Patrick Galvin , Miehael E. Mullin , E. W.

Fuller &; Co. of Boston . and had sent information to no one but his wife about the state of affairs at Caracas . He says that by technicalities Paul &; Co. have avoided coming into conflict with the American Consul at Caracas , but still continue to perpetrate wrongs and in-justices upon their employee . and are using the Americans only to instruct the Spaniards In the art of McKay and fair stitching . after which the Americans will be left to shift for themselves .
