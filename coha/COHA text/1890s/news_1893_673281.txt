txt The question as to the probability of the Archdiocese of New-York soon being partitioned and a new diocese created to take in all that part of the present diocese outside of the city limits is exciting the keenest interest among the Catholic clergy of t city and was freely discussed by th yesterday . Although the pastors of loading churches , are naturally averse to expressing their views publicly , a reporter for THE New York TIMES was favored with interviews by some of the most distinguished and bestinformed priests in the diocese . Their statements throw more light on the subject than anything that has been published . The Rev. Dr. Henry A. Braun , pastor of St. Agnes 's Church , in East Forty-third Street , who , it is well known , possesses Archbishop Corrigan 's confidence , was very outspoken yesterday . He said : " Although I have no positive information on the subject . I am decidedly of the opinion that all this talk about splitting up the archdiocese is more moonshine , and has no foundation in fact whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last November in reference to the amount of work he was called upon to perform . out of which , I presume , the rumors circulated in reference to the subject originated . But I did not understand him to say that the diocese was too large , or that he had any desire to have a new Bishopric created . " He is'quite a young man , in the prime of life , full of energy and activity , and likely to live for thirty years to come . With two zealous and indefatigable Vicar Generals to assist him who are clothed with full authority to discharge all tho episcopal functions vested in Bishops , with the exception of administering confirmation , an active and energetic secretary , and three rural deans in the outlying districts to assist in the work of making visitations , I see no reason fox-creating a new diocese . " I do not think there is any sentiment in favor of such a project among the priests of the diocese . The Archbishop is fully equipped for the efficient discharge of all the duties devolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying there is not the least ground for the rumors that have been circulated in respect to the desirability of dividing the diocese . " One of themoatdistinguished theologians and efficient-clergymen in the city who was called upon took an entirely different view of the subject . He said : " Dr. Burtsell is my authority for stating that-Archbishop Corrigan said . at the last Synod that in consequence of the amount of work that devolved upon him , he would be obliged to do one of three things  --  to have a coadjutor appointed , to divide the diocese , or to ask the rural deans to assist in the work of visitation . " " What is the usual method of procedure when a diocese is to be divided and a new bishopric created 7 " he was asked . " It is generally done on the motion of the Bishops of the province , or of the Bishop of the diocese . " was the reply . " When a former Archbishop of New-York asked for the appointment of a coadjutor and his request was refused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed for Long Island . " " Does Rome ever take action without any such request being made by the Provincials " " The authorities at Rome sometimes take action in such a case without any request from the Bishops , especially when the population of the diocese becomes so large as that of New-York at present . The estimate of population given in the Catholic directories is far below the actual Catholic population , which probably exceeds 1,000,000 for the City of New-York alone . . ? The population of the rural districts it is dIfficult to determine , but it can not fall far short of 200,000 . " " You think the authorities at Rome would favor the creation of a new diocese under existing circumstances I " " I think so undoubtedly . It is the desire of the authorities that a diocese shall not be too large : The City of New-York alone should be sufficient to tax the energies of the ablest and most efficient ecclesiastic in the Church . It is a work of no ordinary magnitude to look after the spiritual welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Archbishop Corrigan himself would be glad to have the diocese divided . " " Is this the first time the proposal has been made to create a new bishopric ? " " By no means . It is only a few years since the proposition was made to Rome and maps of the diocese forwarded showing how the division suggested should be made . All the rural districts were to be consolidated into the new diocese , and Newburg was suggested as the place for the Bishop 's residence . " More than this , I am in a position to state that the recommendation was made by the Bishops of the Province with the concurrence of Archbishop Corrigan , and that the names of three prominent clergymen were submitted for the choice of Rome for the selection of the new Bishop . This was about four years ago . " " You think , therefore , that there is good ground for believing a new bishopric will be created ? " " I certainly do . For some reason the matter has been postponed . but I feel satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no distant day . " " Would there not be some difficulty in respect to making arrangements for the support of the charitable institutions ? " " Certainly not . They are all supported at present by the churches of this city . The rural parishes contribute nothing toward their support , and as they- are all within the city i limits no difficulty whatever can arise n this respect . Westchester and Staten Island would , of course , be included in the Diocese of New-York . " " Do you think the clergy in the rural districts would favor the project ? " " Most undoubtedly . It would . be greatly to their advantage to have the new bishopric created . At present they have no asylums or benevolent institutions for the care of the orphans of their parishes , nor can they have them admitted into the institutions of this city . A fresh impulse would be given to religion in the outlying parishes by having a Bishop of their own to devote all his time and attention to their wants and interests . The country priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " lu the event of a new diocese being created who do you think would be selected for the mitre ? " " Three names would be selected by the seventeen irremovable rectors and submitted to the Bishops of the Province . They should either accept them or state their reasons for rejecting them , and forward the papers to Rome with their own selections as well . I am of the opinion that the rectors would name Vicar General Farrelly , Vicar General Mooney , and Dr. Burtsell . " The statistics of the Archdiocese of New York as given in the Catholic directories are as follows : Churches , 206 ; chapels , 68 ; stations , 48 ; priests , 504 ; brothers , 405 ; nuns , 2,372 . There are 2 seminaries , 16 academies for boys , 32 academies for girls , 8 orphanage schools , 9 industrial and reform schools , 170 parochial schools , with an attendance of 40,000 ; 8 orphan asylums. 17 homes for destitute children , 8 hospitals , 1 insane asylum , and 1 foundling asylum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The archdiocese includes the counties of New-York , Westchester , Putnam , Dutchess , Ulster , Sullivan , Orange , Rockland , Richmond , and the Bahama Islands .
