txt Mayor Schieren 's pretense of surprise at The Times 's reports of the open sale of liquor in Brooklyn on Sunday will fool nobody  --  not even himself . Mr. Schieren knows perfectly well that the saloons of Brooklyn have carried on a side-door traffic since the first Sunday after he became Mayor , and he knows that the police have made no effective effort to interfere with the traffic . He made a mistake , a terrible mistake , in conniving at violations of the law he had sworn to enforce . He blunders again in his sickening - attempt to make the world believe that he ordered Commissioner Welles to put a stop to Sunday selling and that he supposed he had stopped it . If Mayor Schieren has permitted Sunday selling as a policy thought out and determined on , he is not fit to be Mayor of Brooklyn and ought to be removed from office . If he really ordered Commissioner Welles to close the saloons on Sunday and has all this time actually supposed that they were so closed , he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mayor Schieren is n't a fool , and he is n't blind . He knows the saloons have done business as usual on Sunday , and he knows that he never gave Commissioner Welles *such an order as Commissioner Roosevelt has given the Police Captains in this city . It this statement of the case forces the implication that Mayor Schieren played the hypocrite a bit yesterday , why , that is not The Times 's fault . It is not quite so bad to be a hypocrite as it is to be a fool , and not nearly so bad as being a conscious and persistent violator of an oath of office and of the law of the State .
