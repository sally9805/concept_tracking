WASHINGTON REMINISCENCES . I. seen Congresses and administrations come and go , the Union temporarily FOR more qwq been familiar figures to me . Asked to contribute my own impressions of men and events during this stirring and momentous period , I have not felt at liberty to decline . Preserving the rule of reticence as to living persons , I will endeavor to convey as frank and impartial an estimate of the characteristics of some public men of the past , whether in legislative , executive , or judicial life , as my experience and judgment permit . No other merit is claimed for these sketches than that they are the fruit of a candid observation and an experience somewhat prolonged . WILLIAM PITT FESSENDEN . Few of our public men have had a more marked and engaging personality than Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine . A great lawyer , an incorruptible patriot , a man of almost haughty independence , he left behind , at immeasurable distance , the rank and file of politicians . His small , fine , classically cut head and face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet look , as of incessant pain overmastered by main force of will , united to mark a man cast in no common mould . His ripe judgment and wisdom brought to him in his later years the title of " the Father of the Senate . " Even his faults , his somewhat irascible temper , his cool scorn of the weaklings and the fanatics of his party , the extreme literalness and almost narrowness of his unpoetic mind , and his habitual conservatism , which led him to cling to things established , even sometimes to established abuses , are rather remembered as salient traits of character than cited to his disparagement . He despised demagogues , and had a lifelong contempt for time - servers , sycophants , and bores . When Fessenden first came to Washington , at the age of thirty-five , in the days of the great Whig victory of 1840 , he was a young and ardent Whig , yet full of that even judgment and grasp of practical affairs which always rendered him an invaluable aid in the business of Congress . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army ; and it is significant that he began by opposing his party , whose watchword of retrenchment and reform " was to be carried out by cutting down the military force to a point which he deemed niggardly and insufficient . The new member was heard with wonder and some impatience , but his intellectual force was such as to give to his array of facts a weight which few new members ever command . Then he " wore the rose of youth upon him , " and his straight , lithe figure , jet-black hair , piercing eye , and finely cut face , out of which intellect looked , made him one of the most admired men in the House . The Portland district , always until then Democratic , wished to send him back to Congress , but he obstinately declined ; for he had no patrimony , and felt obliged to cultivate his profession to enable him to educate his family , an end which was incompatible with serving in Congress . He toiled at the bar during the next ten years with rare zeal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hebore a conspicuous part in the whole anti-slavery struggle , which began with the " compromise measures of 1850 , followed by the Kansas-Nebraska bill of Douglas , and ended with the extinction of slavery and the elevation of the negro to citizenship . He has often been criticised , and even fiercely denounced , as unduly conservative in the anti-slavery struggle . The charge is not sustained by a perusal of his speeches and his record . No more signal proof of his fidelity to freedom need be adduced than the fact that , after President Andrew Johnson Imad broken wholly with the party which brought him into power , Fessenden was chosen by his colleagues chairman of the important joint committee of both Houses on Reconstruction . As such , he wrote that able Report which , for clearness , terseness , // and vigorous treatment of the great questions then still at issue , stands unsurpassed in the political literature of the time . Fessenden 's manner and delivery as a speaker were almost unique in the Senate , where set speeches read from inanilscript have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what he was to say , stood with easy grace in the aisle next to his seat , and talked in a quiet , almost conversational tone , but with clear , distinct utterance , and a precision of statenent which marked his intellectual acuteness . He spoke often , but never at much length . Charles Sumner said of him that " nobody could match him in immediate and incisive reply . " His first speech in the Senate , March 3 , 1854 , on that revolutionary measure the Kansas-Nebraska bill , at once raised him to a front rank among the senatorial opponents of slavery extension . The little band of Senators who confronted the aggressive forces of the South , joined to the well-nigh compact democracy of the North , included Seward , Sumner , Chase , Wade , Everett , Hamlin , Fish , and Foot . Fessenden , as yet but little known on the stage of national affairs , made his maiden speech just before midnight , when the debate was about to be closed by Senator Douglas in behalf of the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that the territories ought to be opened to slavery , notwithstanding their dedication to freedom by time compromise of 1820 , and showed how the South had since secured the admission of four new slave states , while only the same number of free states had been admitted . Then he took up the compromise measures of 1850 ( which he had vigorously opposed when the Whig National Convention of 1852 had indorsed them ) , and proceeded : - " It has been claimed for these compromise measures of 1850 that they satisfied all parties , and restored peace to a distracted country . All differences had been settled . We were a happy people . Suddenly , in the midst of this concord , comes a proposition to take from the free states just that which I ad been given for all these advantages which had accrued to the South , - to take the little that was allowed to the free states by the compromise of 1820 this is designed as a measure of peace , let me tell you that anything but peace you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , it is not yet in the Union , and it never will come into the Union except with exclusion of slavery . " This speech was heard by many Southerners , one of whom said to another as it proceeded , " What sort of a new Senator is this ? All his guns are doubleshotted . " As chairman of the Senate committee on finance , which at that day had entire charge of all appropriations as well as of revenue measures , Mr. Fessenden stood virtually as the leader of the Senate , at the head of its most important committee . In this responsible position his sagacity and ability were so fully demonstrated that when Mr. Chase resigned the office of Secretary of the Treasury , in June , 1864 , President Lincoln chose Mr. Fessenden as his successor . Scruples against accepting so onerous an office in his rather precarious state of health led him to decline , for he greatly preferred the Senate . But his reluctance was overborne by Mr. Lincoln 's good-humored pertinacity , and by the urgent expressions which came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one fit man for the place . Congress was about to adjourn , after a long and anxious and laborious session , in which he had borne the conspicuous and responsible part of leader in the Senate , where he had been charged with all revenue measures and the financial policy of the government . He was weary with daily and nightly labor , and had looked forward longingly to the accustomed rest of the summer vacation . He went to the White House one morning ( it was // five days before the adjournment ) to confer with Mr. Lincoln as to the rneasures of legislation then in their final stages , and to consult as to a proper candidate to be proposed for the Treasury Department . It was all essential to secure some one who would command public confidence at such a critical juncture . Mr. Lincoln put his hand upon Fessenden 's shoulder and declared that he himself was that man . Surprised and almost confounded , the Senator told the President that he could not accept ; that he was nearly worn out with the responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to assume the onerous duties of the Treasury in the burning heat of Washington , at such a moment , would be dangerous , if not suicidal . He could not , would not accept the office , for , aside from his frail health , he did not feel himself qualified for it . Mr. Lincoln replied with feeling and energy in a strong appeal to Fessenden 's patriotic impulses , with assurances that he had the confidence of the financial interests of the country , and that he should have the way smoothed by the aid of able lieutenants ; and closed by telling him that the nomination had already been sent to the Senate . In fact , Fessenden 's appointment had that day been unanimously confirmed . He at once resolved to sink personal considerations , and to enter upon the office , with the proviso that he should be at liberty to withdraw whenever a fit successor should be found to relieve him . He himself said of it , " I took the office reluctantly and as a matter of duty , and vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase , after the great victories which had attended the arms of the Union in preceding years , and aided by the eager and overwhelming patriotism of the country , had made a signal reputation by the marked success of the large popular loans negotiated during his administration . The price of gold - that infallible barometer of public confidence - had fallen , while the national revenues had steadily improved . But there came a time when the tide chan ned . In May and June , 1864 , the slow progress of Grant 's army toward Richmond , the ineffective battles of the Wilderness , and the losses at Cold Harbor , with the delay of Sherman 's army in the movement upon Atlanta , had chilled the entliusiasm of the people , and had shaken their confidence in the early termination of the war . The result was seen in the financial situation quite as conspicuously as in the military . The government bonds , issued in ever increasing volume , went heavily . The willingness to invest slowly gave place to a feeling of distrust . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no response . Gold , which had hovered between 150 and 180 , went up to 250 in June , 1864 , an ( l then to 285 , the highest point reached during the entire period of the war . It was at this gloomy crisis , with the legaltender money of the government worth barely thirty-five cents on the dollar , with a new loan of fifty millions unsalable , with an eminent Secretary of the Treasury just resigning his office , with revenues totally inadequate to daily expenditures , with a gre at army in the field no longer scoring victories , and with doubt and distrust on every side , that Fessenden was called to take charge of the Treasury Department . In this new and untried position Fessenden exhibited the same qualities of energy , foresight , and grasp of affairs which had marked his career in the Senate . As a notable evidence of the appreciation in which his distinguished character and services were held in the public mind , the price of gold , which had stood at 280 , fell to 225 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was announced . The press of the country joined its voice to that of capitalists and bankers in declaring that a great crisis had been averted . // But the situation was very far from reassuring . the expenditures were steadily in excess of the estimates which had been made for the year . Requisitions upon the Treasury , suspended because there was a lack of funds to meet them , had reached almost a hundred million dollars . The enormous scale upon which the armies of the Union were pushing the war in the South , under the lead of Grant and Sherman , had been unexampled in the history of modern warfare . The daily expenditure exceeded two million dollars , and sometimes reached two and a half millions . The depreciated greenback was a perpetual object-lesson and menace to the credit of the government . Secretary Fessenden confronted this difficult situation with a courage which only an uncommonly strong man could have shown . He announced that no more paper money would be issued ; but , with characteristic prudence , lie did not put forth any declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assuring the public creditors that temporary obligations would be met as soon as possible , that no new forms of indebtedness would be created , and that the discretionary power vested in him by law would be exerted to reduce the interest on the public debt . He asked the exhausted banks of New York for a loan of fifty millions ; but they were unable to respond at that time , as they had strained their resources to take up former issues of bonds . Then he offered all the six per cent gold bonds yet unsold , proposing to take compoundinterest notes in exchange at par ; and , though opposed by the banks , this policy was vindicated by almost doubling the subscriptions . The demands for army needs still increasing , an authorized loan at seven and three tenths per cent interest was offered , but met with only moderate success . Then , by Secretary Fessenden 's direction , the Treasury issued small denominations of the 7-30 bonds to the army paymasters , to be tendered to such officers and soldiers as chose to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with much favor , and multitudes of brave and patriotic soldiers thus loaned their pay to the government , while fighting to preserve its integrity . Still there was a constantly yawning deficit between receipts and expenditures . Criticism of the Treasury policy was rife , and dictatorial leaders in the press and menacing letters from banking interests poured in on the new Secretary . He calmly went on his course , disregarding the claim for " more money ; " well knowing that it was not more , but better money that was needed . Yet the subscriptions to the 7-30 loan had stopped ; the demand certificates of indebtedness had mounted to over two hundred and forty millions ; ninetytwo cents was their current value in the market . Mr. Fessenden strove to arrest this rapid depreciation , and suspended further issues of these certificates . He also withdrew the six per cent bonds , and appealed once more to the banks for a 7-30 loan . But when he found that their resources were exhausted , he resolved to appeal to the people , and to popularize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankers who in 1863 had succeeded in placing five hundred millions of six per cents at par . This plan met with great success ; in the judgment of many , it saved the Treasury from bankruptcy . Nearly two hundred million dollars were secured . At the same time military victories revived drooping hopes , and fresh streams of money began to flow in through the operation of the amended tax-laws . Mr. Fessenden had a leading share in framing these , and their successful operation gratified him exceedingly . He had still much labor to perform , however , before he could leave time Treasury . The war was yet in progress , and revenues for the ensuing year must be provided upon a scale at least as extensive as for the current one . He drew up // a financial measure , which became a law March 3 , 1865 , providing for deficiencies by new authority for loans , and also empowering the Secretary to fund all forms of non-interest-bearing debt into a new form of bond : first into a five per cent issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government ; and then into four and four and a half per cents , after ten years from date of the first issue . For this far-sighted and comprehensive policy of reducing debt , and thus at once cutting down expenses and strengthening incalculably the credit of the government , the country is largely indebted to Mr. Fessenden 's sagacity . Having now arrived at a point where lie could safely and honorably lay down the burdens of his exacting administrative office , and having been rc*lected by the legislature of Maine to a third full term in the Senate from the 4th of March , 1865 , lie again took his seat in that body . He resumed , by unanimous eboice of his Republican colleagues , his post as chairman of the committee on finance . Here the great and difficult problems involved in the reconstruction of civil government in the Southern states were added to the questions of financial policy which had formed so large a share of his senatorial and administrative responsibility . He was made chairman not only of the finance committee , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress on Reconstruction . The task of that committee of fifteen was one of almost unprecedented difficulty . It had to make thorough inquiry into the condition of all the lately seceded states ; to determine their actual status under the Constitution and public law ; to define the powers of Congress over them as against their own autonomy ; and to frame such legislation as would insure peace , safety , and the permanent preservation of the Union . The situation was entirely anomalous , and taxed to the utmost the knowledge , the political skill , and the patriotism of those who confronted it . Mr. Fessenden 's Report , with accompanying bills , met with the acceptance of both Houses of Congress , and the measures of reconstruction proposed , which were the result of concessions of many conflicting opinions , became laws , including the recommendatiori to the states of a fourteenth constitutional amendment , fixing the basis of representation in Congress ' , and reducing it in the states in proportion to the exclusion by them from the elective franchise of any portion of their population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the active participants in the rebellion , until relieved from disability by act of Congress ; declared the sacredness of the public debt , and prohibited the recognition of any debts or claims incurred in aid of the insurrection or for the eniancipation of slaves . This far-reaching amendment was ratified by thirty-three states , and became a part of the Constitution . Mr. Fessenden had a strong man 's indifference , which often amounted to contempt , for that public opinion which is manufactured by newspapers . The world 's notion of a particular course of conduct , the party 's notion of political necessity or expediency , had little importance in his eyes , when his own mind led him to a different conclusion . As early as 1854 , when catechised in the Senate upon the doctrine of instructions , he declared that a legislature had no right to instruct a Senator how he should vote . To him the post of Senator of the United States was a great trust , to be guarded jealously against all dictation or interference . When he came to pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was curious to see how like a disinterested critic or spectator he spoke . He appeared completely to have dismissed all political feeling , and to have judged the case solely with regard to the law and the evidence . The almost unexampled political cxcitement // of that time can be but imperfectly apprehended by those who were neither participants nor witnesses of its scenes . With an overwhelming majority in both H'ouses opposed to the President , with the public in the North against him in immense and almost vindictive preponderance , with his own obstinate , imprudent , and exasperating utterances against Congress itself , it required an independence of party spirit very rare in the members of representative bodies , to rise above the clamor of the time , and to pronounce a calm , judicial judgment . This , Fessenden , a Republican of the Republicans , did ; and in it he was joined by only seven out of forty-three of his colleagues belonging to that party . After a clear and searching review of the evidence , which he found insufficient to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - " To the suggestion that popular opinion demands the conviction of the President on these charges , I reply that he is not now on trial before the people , but before the Senate . They have not taken an oath to do impartial justice , according to the Constitution and the laws . ' I have taken that oath . I can not render judgment upon their convictions . The consequences which may fob low either from conviction or acquittal are not for me to consider . . . . And I should consider myself undeserving the coiifidence of that just and intelligent people who imposed upon me this great responsibility , and unworthy a place among honorable men , if , for any fear of public reprobation , I should disregard the conviction of my judgment and my conscience . " The acquittal of President Johnson , by failure of only one vote to make a two-thirds majority , was the signal for opening upon Mr. Fessenden the batteries of denunciation and abuse . He was threatened with political destruction , with being read out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability , and ultimately gained more respect than opprobrium by the act . In the National Republican Convention which met two months later and nominated General Grant for the presidency , hot-headed resolutions denouncing Republican Senators who had voted against impeachment were laid upon the table . And the sober second thought of the public , as in the similar case of the condemnation of Charles Sumner by the Massachusetts legislature for his resolutions against perpetuating the names of victories over fellow citizens in the civil war , may be said to have reversed the judgment first hastily rendered under stress of popular excitement . Mr. Fessenden was always a comprehensive reader . In the severely laborious later years of his life novels and whist were his favorite recreations of aa evening . The stores of biography and of history in the Congressional Library were frequently drawn upon by him . The works of Swift , Dryden , Pope , and De Quincey were among his familiar readings , and he keenly appreciated the masterly History of Gibbon . Thackeray and Balzac , Dumas and Edgar Poe , he read with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American books he had a special admiration for the historical works of Motley . Senator Fessenden was for nearly ten years a member of the Committee on the Library of Congress , and while it occupied the long , narrow room on the west front of the Capitol it was his delight to browse at will among its stores . When the question of purchasing for the library of the United States the great historical collection of books , pamphlets , periodicals , and manuscripts of Peter Force came up , in 1866 , he was an earnest advocate of its acquisition , and his influence in the library committee and in Congress was a potential factor in its favor . For some years during his senatorial term he was a regent of the Smithsonian // Institution , an honor highly appreciated , and in his case well deserved . Mr. Fessenden was one of the victims of the * National Hotel disease , " which in 1857 , by its fatal results to some prominent men in Washington , caused such a horror throughout the country , and the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and embittered his final hours . This once inexplicable mystery is now supposed to be clearly traced to arsenic . About eighty dead rats were found in a water*tank in a certain part of the hotel , most of which had been poisoned . Mr. Fessenden 's life , like those of some other public men who had their place of sojourn in that hostelry , was doubtless shortened by that most unfortunate calamity . He died at Portland , September 8 , 1869 , at the age of sixty-three . PETER FORCE . The life of such a man as Peter Force , who died in Washington in 1868 , at the ripe old age of seventy-seven years , was worth more to American letters and to human history than the lives of a score of the military generals and other notables whose names are so generally blazoned abroad . He lived for more than half a century in Washington , having gone thither in 1815 from New York . He found the capital a straggling village of wood , and saw it become a stately city of brick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was for nine years editor and proprietor of a daily journal which enjoyed the confidence of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams ; but it is not as mayor of Washington nor as an editor that he will be best remembered . His characteristic merit , which distinguishes him from the Ritchies , the Duff Greens , and the F. P. Blairs , who also bore an active part in political journalism at the national capital , is that he was more than a journalist , - he was an historian . Born near Passaic Falls , N. J. , on November 26 , 1790 ( his father , William Force , being a veteran of the iRevolationary War ) , Peter Force was by lineage , as well as by native tastes and talent , a worthy exponent of that branch of American history to which he dedicated so many years . Very early in life he evinced a zealous interest in historical investigations , and four years after coming to Washington he originated and published an annual of history , with statistical and official information of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , as he called it , antedated by ten years the publication of the old American Almanac , and was continuously published from 1820 to 1836 , except the years 1825 , 1826 , and 1827 . In 1823 he established a newspaper , the National Journal , which was continued until 1831 . This drew to its columns some noted contributors , among them John Quincy Adams . The high-minded conduct of this paper in doing justice to the opponents of the administration once led to a committee of the ruling party waiting upon Mr. Force , and asking him to permit them to edit or to revise the political columns , with a view to more thorough partisan effect . He drew himself up to his full height ( he was six feet tall ) , and , with that dignity of bearing which sat so naturally upon him , said , " I did not suppose that any gentleman would make such a proposition to me . " Among Mr. Force 's publications of very great value to the students of American history were his series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were careful reprints of the rarest early pamphlets concerning America , long out of print , some of which could not be purchased , and others of which he could not afford to own ; but he borrowed them from libraries for the purpose of reproducing them . " Whenever , " said he , " I found a little more money in my purse than I absolutely needed , I printed a volume of Tracts . " Many of the raris // simi of early American history or exploration thus owe to Peter Force their sole chance of preservation . The series of American Archives , the great monumental work of his life , was published at intervals from 1837 to 1853 . It embraces the period of American colonial history from March , 1774 , to December , 1776 , in nine stately folio volumes , printed in double columns , and most thoroughly indexed . These archives constitute a thesaurus of original information about the first two momentous years of the Revolutionary struggle , and especially concerning the Declaration of Independence and the early revolutionary action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inestimable value . To this work , the bold conception of his own mind , to contain nothing less than the original fountains of American history , reproduced in systematic chronological order , he dedicated his long and useful life . For it he assemubled , with keen , discriminating judgment and unwearied toil , that great collection of historical material , which now forms an invaluable part of the Congressional Library . Nor was his literary and historical zeal by any means confined to the early history of America . He dignified and adorned his profession of printer by original authorship in many fields . He was profoundly interested in the annals of the art of printing , and the controversies over its true inventor . He gathered , by persistent search , a small library of incitnabula , or books printed in the infancy of the art , representing every year from 1467 ( his earliest blackletter imprint ) up to 1500 and beyond . He studied the subject of arctic exploration , collecting all books published in that field , and himself writing upon it . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Intelligencer , the true history of the Meeklenburg Declaration of Independence of May , 1775 ; proving by contemporane ous newspapers he had acquired that the true Resolutions were of date May 31 , and that the so-called Mecklenburg Declaration of May 20 , 1775 , was spurious . The American Archives imposed upon Mr. Force a devoted , patient , assiduous life-labor , in one spot , surrounded by the continually growing collection of books , pamphlets , newspapers , manuscripts , maps , and engravings , which contributed to throw light upon some period of his inquiry . To say that his library alone filled his commodious house almost to overflowing ; that it embraced , besides the largest assemblage of books accumulated up to that time by a private citizen in this country , thirty thousand pamphlets and eight hundred volumnes of newspapers ; that it was rich in Revolutionary autographs , military papers , maps , portraits , and engravings ; and that it embraced between forty and fifty thousand titles , - all this is to convey but a mechanical idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite subject . He began to collect American books long before the birth of the extensive and mostly undiscriminating mania of bookcollecting which of late years has become the rage , and he continued the unceasing pursuit until the very week before he was laid in his grave . He carried off prizes at book - auctions which no competitor had the nerve or the knowledge to dispute with him . He ransacked the bookshops of the United States , from Boston to Charleston , for rare volumes . He had agents to pick up " unconsidered trifles " out of the garrets of New England housewives , and he read eagerly all the multifarious catalogues which swarmed in upon him , of books on sale iii London and on the Continent . On one occasion he was a bidder against the United States for a large and valuable collection of bound pamphlets , the property of an early collector , which were brought to the hammer in Philadelphia . // The Library of Congress had sent on a bid - a limited one - for the coveted volumes ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " Buy nie those pamphlets in an unbroken lot . " They were bought . His purchases were often made at prices which would now seem fabulously cheap , yet he never boggled at a high price when once he was satisfied that he had an opportunity to procure a rare or unique volume . Thus , he used to tell how lie had endeavored to buy two thin foolscap volumes containing Major-General Greene 's manuscript letters and dispatches during the Southern Revolutionary campaign of 1781-82 . The price demanded was two hundred dollars . Mr. Force offered one hundred and fifty dollars , which was refused . He then offered fifty dollars for the privilege of making a copy ; this was also declined . Seeing that he could not otherwise possess himself of them , he wisely paid the two hundred dollars , and marched off with the precious volumes under his arm . He carried away from an antiquarian bookseller in Boston the only file of Massachusetts Revolutionary newspapers which had been offered for sale in a quarter of a century , and when goodnaturedly reproached by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusively replied , " Why did n't you buy them yourselves , then ? " To the last he was untiring in his efforts to secure complete and unbroken files of all the Washington newspapers . These were carefully laid in piles day by day , after such perusal as he chose to give them , and the mass of journals thus accumulated , for thirty years or upwards , occupied nearly all the large basement of his house . His file of the printed Army Orders issued by the War Department was a marvel of completeness , and it was secured only by the same untiring vigilance which he applied to all matters connected with the increase of his library . With the weight of seventyfive winters on his shoulders , he would drag himself up to the War Department regularly , to claim from some officer who knew him and his passion the current additions to the printed series promulgated in all branches of the nillitary service during the civil war . He thus obtained for his private collection - now become the historic heirloom of the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official channels of communication alone , have sought in vain to gather . It was my good fortune , in the closing years of his life , to see him daily , and in his company to go through all the more precious stores of his vast collection . At eight o'clock each morning I found him already immersed in work . No luxurious library furnishings , no glazed bookcases of walnut or mahogany , no easy-chairs inviting to soft repose or slumber , were there , but only plain rough pine shelves and pine tables , heaped and piled with books , pamphlets , and journals . Among them moved familiarly two or more cats and a favorite dog ; for the lonely scholar was fond of pets , as he was of children . He had near by bits of bread or broken meat or a saucer of milk , to feed his favorites in the intervals of his work . As we went together through the various treasures of the collection , to enable me to make the needful notes for my report to Congress , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up many a rare volume or tract on neglected and dust-laden shelves or from street hookstalls , how he had competed at auction for a coveted volume and borne it away in triumph , how he had by mere accident completed an imperfect copy of Stitli 's History of Yirginia by finding in a heap of printed rubbish a missing signature , and how precious old pamphlets and early newspapers had been fished by him out of chests and barrels in the garrets of Virginia or Niaryland . In the rear of his workroom was a // little garden , - now all built over by the brick edifice erected for the Washington Post , - in which he had planted trees , then grown to stately size , interspersed with grass and rose-bushes and box and tangled shrubbery . This green retreat , or thicket , he called his " wilderness " ( and it bad actually the wildness of nature , though begirt with busy streets ) , and here he walked when resting from his sedentary work . His domestic life was singularly fortunate . He brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of whom inherited the paternal zeal for historical investigation , and produced writings of recognized value . The one supreme object which overshadowed all* other objects with Peter Force was to amass the materials out of which a complete documentary history of the United States could be compiled . His work as an historiographer is known to comparatively few , since the great bulk and cost of the published volumes of his American Archives confine them chiefly to the large libraries of the country . The plan of the work comprised , in the language of its prospectus , " a collection of authentic records , state papers , debates , and letters , and other notices of public affairs ; the whole forming a documentary history of the origin and progress of the North American colonies , of the causes and accomplishment of the American Revolution , and of the Constitution and government of the United States to the final ratification thereof . " His contract with the Department of State ( executed in pursuance of an act of Congress ) was to embrace about twenty folio volumes* He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , in six volumes , was completed and published in the seven years from 1837 to 1844 . Three more volumes , forming the commencement of the fifth series , and bringing the history down to the close of 1776 , were also printed , when Secretary of State Marcy arbitrarily stopped the work by withholding his approval of the contents of the volumes submitted to him for the continuation* This was in the year 1853 ; and this sudden and unlooked-for interruption of his cherished plans , and demolition of the fair and perfect historical edifice which was to be his lifelong labor and his monument , was a blow from which lie never fully recovered* It was not alone that lie had entered upon a scale of expenditure for materials commensurate with the projected extent of the work ; that he had procured , at great cost , thousands of pages of manuscript , copied from the original archives of the various colonies and those of the State Department ; that he had amassed an enormous library of books and newspapers , which encroached so heavily upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet his bills ; but it was the rude interruption of an important national work by those incompetent to judge of its true merits ; it was the vexatious and unjust rescinding , by an officer of the government , of a contract to which Mr. Force had reason to believe that the faith of the government was pledged . He was already past sixty years of age when this event happened . He never renewed his labor upon the Archives : the masses of manuscript remained untouched in the very spot where his work on them had been broken off ; and he could never allude to the subject without some pardonable bitterness of feeling . Friemids urged him to appeal to Congress , to try to prevail with new secretaries of state to renew the work , to sue for damages , to petition for relief . Not one of these things would he do . He had a sensitive pride of clmaracter joined to a true stoic loftiness of mind . He could suffer , but he could not beg . He never approached a member of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might justly have claimed a righL He bore his heavy burdens // manfully , cheered by no hope of recompense , struggling with debt , yet still laboring , day by day , amidst his books , and hospitably receiving and answering all persons who called upon him for information and historical aid . For this unrecompensed service , which became a constantly increasing tax upon his time , he got only thanks . He never made any overtures to sell his library to the government , nor did he , until two or three years before his death , entertain any idea of parting with it in his lifetime . Many proposals had been made to him to buy his collection , either as a whole or by porticus . Finally , in 1866 , the matter was taken up in earnest by the Librarian of Congress , who shared in the strongest manner the conviction of those who knew its value , that it would be a national misfortune and disgrace if this great historical library should be dispersed ; and Mr. Force consented to part with the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by persons who sought to buy it for New York , namely , one hundred thousand dollars . The press of the country warmly sec onded the effort , and the appropriation went through Congress without a word of objection in either House , - a rare example of wise and liberal legislation effected on its own merits . Rutherford B. Hayes , at that time chairman of the library eommittee on the part of the House , took a zealous interest , as did the entire committee , in the object of securing this invaluable and unique collection . Many of its volumes are enriched with the notes of Mr. Force , correcting errors of date , citing pages of Panzer or other catalogues of incunabula , or referring to books or newspapers in which other sources of information are to be found . The transfer of the library to the Capitol took place in the spring of 1867 . It was watched with careful interest by its venerable owner , who was left to his desolated shelves , and often lamented that lie never again felt at home without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Library of Congress , and invited to take a desk there and continue his studies ; but though he often came , he could not bring himself to sit down and work there . He died January 23 , 1868 . His children erected a marble monument over his grave , on which is carved , above the name of Force , as a beautiful and appropriate device , a shelf of books bearing nine volumes inscribed " American Archives , " with a civic crown of laurel . But his library , and his historical works , though unfinished , are his fitting monument , and these will preserve his name to the future ages of the great republic as that of a pure and unselfish patriot and student .
