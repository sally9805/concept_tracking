txt The result of two years ' detective Work lies in an arrest made at Coney Island yesterday by a Brooklyn Deputy Marshal and a Post Office Inspector from Colorado . The arrest was made after the most desperate resistance and an attempted rescue by a Coney Island gang , but the Colorado Inspector believes that the chief of a gang which has operr.ted throughout the United States for more than three years , and has robbed the Government of 3153.000 , has been captured , and that the gang is doomed . Several mince members of the gang are now in jail in Colorado . Post Offices in all parts of the country have been entered by burglars , and in each case stamps have been the object of the robbers . The postal detectives concluded that a regular gang was at work , with a chief , who directed the operations , designated the points of attack , and received and disposed of the booty . After months of work it was learned that this chief was at Coney Island . George H. Waterbury , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver Division , who had been detailed on the case , finally located W. S. Hostetter of Denver as a member of the gang . Hostet ter fled and Waterbury tracked him to Canada . With a warrant Waterbury chased Hostetter through Canada and finally caught him in the upper mining regions and took him back to Denver . Afterward George H. Burton , Frederick Robinson . and William . Worth were caught . Hostetter finally confessed that he had been concerned in the robberies at Manito , Cripple Creek , Victor , and Florence . The total amount taken in these robberies amounted to 4 ' 910 . ? Stamps Traced to Coney . These stamps were traced through the express companies to Coney Island , and then Hostetter weakened so far as to give up a receipt which he had got from Charles E. Morson , a saloon keeper at Coney Island . The Postal authorities concluded that they had now got on the track of the chief , and it was found that Robert Burkhardt of Coney island had acted as intermediary . The conclusion reached was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Grand Jury of Denver indicted both Morson and Burkhardt on Nov . S and a bench warrant was issued by District Judge Moses Hallett of Colorado . Two or three days ago Waterbury arrived in Brooklyn and began to work up the case with Inspectors Duryea , King . and Coleman . under the orders of Inspector Ashe of the New York Division . Morson was finally located . His saloon is what is known in Coney Island parlance as a " black and tan . " It opens on West Third Street and also has entrances on all sides . The Western Inspector went there shortly after noon yesterday accompanied by Deputy Marshal Charles Koch . Morson , who was tending bar , looked entirely unsuspicious of his new customers . As a matter of fact , he had received a letter from one Oscar Dickens . a member of the gang , warning him to beware of strangers . Apparently the place was deserted , except for Morson and his twenty-one-year-old son . After Waterbury had satisfied himself of Mar-son 's identity , he walked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " " I ca n't help that , " drawled Morson , looking the old dete6tive in the eye . " I 've got to take you back to Denver . " " I ca n't help that . " Fight for the Checkbook . Saying this , Morson tossed his checkbook to Waterbury , saying , " Look at that . " Waterbury turned over the leaves rapidly , and came to the name " W. S. Hostetter , " which he read aloud . Instantly a change came over the face of Morson , who had apparently forgotten the entry , and , snatching the checkbook from the Westerner 's hands , tossed it to the son , shouting , " Take that and ' run ! " The boy started for the door . At the same instant one of the numerous side doors opened , and a crowd of typical Coney Island toughs rushed in , shouting out oaths and threats . Waterbury made a dash for the young man and tripped him up . The two went rolling on the floor together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , grabbed 1Vforson , who is a lame one . The saloon keeper started to break away , but Koch hung to him , and , after a hot struggle , hurled him to the floor . Waterbury , having conquered the young man , faced the crowd of toughs . " Keep back ! " he yelled , and his hand . shot for his hip pocket . There was a glimpse of a revolver butt . The Westerner did not draw , but it was enough for the crowd . Fairly falling over one another in their haste to escape , they floundered pell-mell out of the numerous doors in the queer little dive , and Waterbury , assuring himself that he was the last of them , , turned to look at Koch . The saloon keeper had got to his feet again and was fighting to free his hands . Koch was clinging to his big opponent for dear life , and in the struggle the handcuffs tore the prisoner 's wrists . Waterbury sprang forward , but he was not needed . Hoch had flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on . There was no further resistance . Morson was arraigned before United States Commissioner Oakey in the United States Court in Brooklyn and held in $3,540 bail , which was furnished by P. J. Montague , a Brooklyn saloon keeper . There will be a hearing next Wednesday .
