txt The reorganized McCann Opera Company made its Wit appearance in this city last evening at Hanimersteinai Harlem Opera House . The operetta chosen for the occasion was MilNicker 's " Seven Suabians , " adapted in English by Harry B. Snaltb . The pretty theatre was crowded from floor to ceiling ; every member of the company was received with derdonstratiaras of great friendliness , and there was abundant laughter and applause throughout the evening . The English version of " The Seven Suabians " will undoubtedly undergo no small amount of alteration before the present week comes to a close . It seems to be inevitable nowadays that a comic operetta at its first performance must be too long by about one hour , and the latest applicant for public favor was no exception to the rule . This being too long means that there are parts of the performance which move with leaden feet , and to which the training down process must be applied with rigorous severity . " The Seven Suabians " is by no means a great work , but when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great deal more satisfactory than it was last night . Indeed , proper alteration will make of it an exceedingly brisk and merry entertainment , for the groundwork is all there . The English adaptation abounds in bright and telling lines , and the lyrics are full of taking allusions to prominent topics of the day . The performance last evening was , on the whole , smooth and agreeable . evening any disappointment was felt it must have been in regard to the work of R. F. Cotton , who , as Paraceisus , had the leading comedy role of the piece . It must be confessed that Mr. Cotton is not funny . He means well , but he does not understand the art of making the public laugh . He is young , however , and there is hope for him . Chauncey Olcott gave an excellent performance of the Count Otmar , acting earnestly and singing very agreeably . Lilly Post was satisfactory as Katherine , and Annie Meyers displayed the usual amount of pertness and black hosiery as Hannele . Mme. ' Cottrelly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came off second best . William Blaisdell worked hard as Spatzle , the magician 's office boy . The seven Suabians every well acted , and their topical song , " Wait a Little Bit , " was one of the hits of the evening . The operetta was very well put on the stage . The costumes and scenery were suitable , the chorus was large and industrious , and the orchestra efficient , John S. Hiller conducted excellently . Altogether the MoCaull Opera Company 's season may be said to have opened auspiciously , and a career of prosperity probably awaits the newly formed organization . MR . SULLIVAN . Mr. John L. Sullivan of Boston made his first appearance in New-York as an actor last night at Niblo 's . Ho was received with deafening cheers . No other recent novice in the dramatis ) art has been more cordially welcomed or more warmly encouraged . Mr. Sullivan is a fine figure of a man , and that is an advantage that theatrical aspirants do not often possess . Most young men who want to ' go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is curious , but it generally happens so , and the appearance of a really flue-looking young actor like Mr. Sullivan , with good broad shoulders and well-developed limbs , is a grateful surprise to habitual theatregoers . Mr. Sullivan 's first attempt was entirely MCeessful . Of course he is , at present , little more than an amateur , and it would be unfair to submit his work to very close critical scrutiny . He has much to learn , but for that matter , so has Signor Salvini . In fact , the work of an artist is never finished . He must devote his whole life to it , and learn something new every day . We have no doubt that Mr. Sullivan will learn something new to-day . There are other points of resemblance between Mr. Sullivan and Signor Salvini . Their names are similar , tobegin with ; indeed , it is the opinion of eminent Cattle scholars that they are Identical . No other English-speaking actor resembles the great Italian physically so closely as Mr. Sullivan does , and the fact that he speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan 's favor with the multitude to whom Signor Salvini 's performances are caviare . Again Mr. Sullivan plays an Irish blacksmith with an honest heart and willing hands ; who is very fond of his mother and does not notice that she paints her face very badly and talks altogether too much copy-book sentiment to be a deserving person ; who is always on the side of right and " knocks out " another man in three rounds Just before the ( sustain falls . It is a long while since Signor Salvini played a part like that . Mr. Sullivan understands the value of repose , one of the great secrets of good acting . When he stands at rest on the stage , with his hands at his sides , waiting for his cue to speak , he is a very impressive figure . His speech , perhaps , is not all that might be expected from a Boston artist . He is too apt to miss his punctuation marks , and to neglect to put the emphasis in the proper place . Thus when he says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choke you 1 " the niceties of light and shade that a more experienced artist would observe are missed . Mr. Sullivan pronounces his words very well . He says eye-ther and nye-ther . But he gives too little attention to the matter of voice production . He should open his mouth wider when he speaks . But we must boar in mind that Mr. Sullivan is constantly in the company of Mr. Duncan B. Harrison , and that ho must suffer as much as the audience does when that perverse gentleman snorts and whines and wails and gurgles and coughs . His praiseworthy desire to avoid Mr. Harrison 's eccentricities , even if he has to give up the champion 's belt , seems to have led Mr. Sullivan to adopt a manner of talking that is faulty in the other extreme . That he can speak fluently and well , and right from the shoulder , when he wants to , was shown when he was compelled to address the audience last night just after he had accused the villain of the play of the crime of parricide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yon kindly for the very great applause with which yon have greeted my first attempt in this line of business . Thanking you again for your kind applause , I remain your obedient servant , John L. Sullivan . Mr. Sullivan wore a loose white shirt , with ruffles , black knee-smalls , black silk stoongs , and pumps . In the last act of the play he also wore boxing gloves , and the applause then was overwhelming . He was the all in all of the performance . All the honors were his . The play went for nothing , which is just ' What it ' Would bring if put up at auction . NOTES 01 ' THE STAGE . Huber 's Palace Museum , in East Fourteenth Street , has a host of new curiosities in its exhibition galleries this week and a good company of " specialty artists " In its cozy little theatre , Yesterday 's holiday brought a great crowd of visitors there , and the lecturer had to talk upon his marvels so many times that even he must have been tired when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wants , " the two-mouthed ox , a human pin cushion , and a one-man band , while the theatre programme holds the names of Walter Hyde , a recently-imported English music-hall violinist , who does some clever imitations upon the strings , Carmanelli , who draws music from a knife-grinding machine , and the Kimballs , wise give a funny shadow pantomime . The Park Theatre was opened last evening . Some alterations have been made in the house . New tiling had been placed in the lobby , and the proscenium arch and boxes have been decorated in white and gold . The attraction last night was that string of absurdities known as " Later On . " All the old nonsense remains in the skit , and much that is new has been added . Messrs . Hellen and Hart , the nimble gentlemen who star in " Later On , " are as amusing to their numerous admirers as ever , and are well supported by Annie Lewis , Mollie Faller , Mark Murphy , and John E. MoWade . A Mr. " Bobby " Gaylor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Opera House last evening as Ofi-an-agan , the Irish Vizier of the Sultan of Myra , in a condensed version of Lester Wallaok 's old military play , " The Veteran , " which has been renamed " An Irish Arab . " Mr. Gaylor 's performance is very different from the late John Brougham 's . He uses the spectacular brogue of the variety halls , which is unlike anything ever heard in Ireland , while his slang and his songs are oddly contrasted with the florid , pompous text of the old play . W. S. Cleveland 's minstrels appeared yesterday at the Fourteenth Street Theatre before a large audience . " Kohinors of Minstrelsy " is the title the programme gives the comDougherty , which includes Messrs . " Hughey " Dougherty , Luke Schooloraft , " Hilly " Emerson , and " Barney " Fagan . The ens tertainment includes an excellent and novel acrobatic exhibition by the Craggs . The songs and dances were well done and the entire performance was well received . " HARPER " FOB SEPTEMBER . Mr. Theodore Child turns up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andes . Not so very long ago he was writing on French topics , then on Russian , and then his theme was the cooking art . We shall probably next find his name attached to a paper on Thibet or one on the mountains of the moon . The present paper is well up to Mr. Child 's own high standard . It deserves the place of honor the editor has accorded it . James Lane Allen , another writer who gives joy to readers every time his name appearsln a magazine , writes on the mountainous passes of the Cumberland , and makes the melancholy announcement that this Is the last of his articles on Kentucky . Lieut . Kelley 's description of the social side of yacht-ing is one of the chief attractions of the number . Other noteworthy papers are Russell Sturgis 's account of recent discoveries of painted Greek sculpture and Charles Eliot Norton ' s on Harvard as it now is .
