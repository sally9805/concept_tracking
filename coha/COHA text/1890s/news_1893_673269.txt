txt The Parkville tunnel at which the slaughter on the Bay Ridge line occurred seems to be a deliberately contrived death trap . and it is a marvel that it has escaped the condemnation of the Railroad Commission so long . Doubtless it was not deliberately contrived to destroy life , but to save expense to the railroad corporation , but in that contrivance there was , according to the statement of Coroner KENE , one feature the very purpose of which was to ditch a train to prevent a head-on collision in the tunnel . This " dead switch " is a monstrous evidence that the company took the chance deliberately of slaughtering passengers rather than go to the expense of constructing the tunnel for a double track , which was the only proper and effective means of avoiding all danger of collision . This tunnel is approached from the east on a curve which prevents the man in the signal tower from seeing the train at any distance , and yet the two tracks of the railroad are brought together in passing through it so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the schedule of trains could wholly avert that danger , for there is always liability of delay , and everybody knows that delays are common on these Coney Island trains on crowded days . This coalescence of the east and west tracks in going through the tunnel . with switches and signals on either side operated by one man , who can see neither train until it gets close to the trap , is a diabolical contrivance which should not have been permitted for a single day , and with any proper supervision of the construction and operation of railroads it would not have been permitted . But the cold-blooded provision against head-on collisions in the tunnel is , it is to be hoped , something unique in railroad construction . It is simply a switch intended to derail one train or the other and . hurl it into the ditch before it can enter the tunnel to meet the other . The switchman in his tower , with his various levers to manipulate , was expected , if he heard two trains coming in opposite directions and liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of way and deliberately throw the other off the track . There was a " rale " that the first at the switch be allowed to go through , even though it might be empty and . the other overloaded , and the homicidal switchman could hardly be left to determine instantly which train he should ditch . This contrivance only illustrates the reckless risks which railroad corporations - will take to avoid expense . The company took the chance of escaping the disaster for which it made provision , and in taking that chance it committed a crime . The disaster which has occurred is not exactly the one for which it provided , but it was the direct result of inadequate provision for the passing of trains through the Parkville tunnel . No time should be lost in requiring the reconstruction of the tunnel so as to accommodate two tracks and do away with the dangerous switches , and the company should be held strictly to account for the harm already done .                  @ @ @
