BY JULIAN RALPH . JUST as the Atlantic cities were surprised when Chicago distanced all but two of them in population , and challen*ed all of them by her enterprise , so will they be astonished again and from an other quarter , if they refuse to study the forces that are operating to build up new capitals in the West . In another ten years there will be another claim of a million population , and the counting of heads will not make nonsense of it . The new ai* d wonderful assumption of metropolitan importance will be that of the twin cities of the wheat region-Minneapolis and St. Paul . They may not be joined under one name and government-opinions differ about that  --  but all agree that they will jointly possess a million of population . The last census credited Minneapolis with 164,700 population , and St. Paul with 133,000 , or , jointly , 297,000 . At the time of the preceding census ( 1880 ) the two cities included about 88,000 souls . At that rate of increase they will boast in 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer of 1891 that they possessed more than 350,000 joint population , and that the million mark will be reached before the next census is taken . Why should men make such a prophecy ; or rather , why have these two towns already gathered 350,000 inhabitants within their limits ? We must repeat the study that we made at Chicago . That city we found to be the metropolis of the entire interior between the Rockies and the Alleghanies , but an analysis of its sources of supply and field of distribution showed it to be more particularly the capital of the corn lands . We saw how rich were the returns from agriculture in a country by no means fully developed , and of such vast extent as to be roughly spoken of as a territory one thousand miles square . Chicago is its trading centre , and , from a beginning upon borrowed capital , that city has ceased to borrow , and has begun to amass wealth , to lend money , and to supply its tributary country with manufactured goods in such quantities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the great amount of rich laud that is yet to be redeemed , and in the wide leeway that exists for improved and economical farming , we are able to clearly see a noble , a splendid future for Chicago . But in St. Paul and Minneapolis we reach the pulse of another region- - the wheat lands of America . I understand that in a sense these cities are tributary to Chicago , and that in the same sense their tributary region has in some measure been included in that of Chicago , but the line that is being drawn between the two centres is growing heavier and broader every year . In the possession of home manufactures lies the ability to trade economically and to save a profit , and just as we have seen Chicago emancipate herself from the bondage of Eastern capital through manufactures , so we shall find that the twin cities of Minnesota are setting up for themselves as independent traders . The country they aim to monopolize in trade is far smaller than the corn region , but it is extraordinarily more fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies the famous Red River Valley , which is by some students of such comparative values declared to be the third agricultural region , in point of fertility , in the world , there being one Asiatic and one African valley in the foreground beyond it . This Red River Valley takes in many counties of Minnesota and the most easterly counties of the two Dakotas . It is prairie land of black soil that once formed the bed or deposit of an ancient sea . It reaches up into Caiiada , beyond Winnipeg , and is a great deal richer at its southern end in the United States than in Canada . This region pours its wealth of grain ( or a great part of it ) into Minnesota 's twin cities , there to exchange it for merchandise . Other cereals and cattle are produced beyond this valley in the new States , and the valley itself returns the same commodities along with its wonderful output of wheat . In the extra fruitful year just closed-wonderful for its crops and for the world-wide demand for breadstuffs from this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of the crops seeiued fabulous . For instance , it was boasted that the farmers of the Northwest would make sufficient // profits to pay off all their mortgages this year . This boast was not disputed by any of the leaders in trade and transportation with whom I talked , but I gathered from what they said that though the farmers are as well off as this statement implies , the majority will not remove the inortgages , but will be more likely to expend their profits in betterments , in extending their farms , and in redeemiiig unxvorkable tracts in their present holdings . This roseate view ends at the valley , so far as the Dakotas are concerned . The Dakotan farmers have suffered some bad seasons , and are not so near the end of their debts . It is in the Red River Valley that one may hear of a farmer whose profits last season were close to $30,000 ; it is there that men bought farms of great extent , expecting to pay for them in an indefinite number of years , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . the wonderful yield of last year . Such is the region at the very doors of the twin cities of the Northwest . If Ceres left the Old World when the worship of her went out of fashion , it must have been to the valley of the Red River that she came . But if mythology is suggested at all by a study of this marvellous re*ion , it is in the recollection of the fabled river Factolus , wherein King Midas washed off his power to turn into gold all that lie touched . That may well have been the stream that once swelled from side to side of this valley , for , truly , its sediment retains little less than Midas 's power . We realize the majesty of agriculture as we never did before when we learn that in Minnesota and the two Dakotas the wheat crop alone was worth one hundred and twenty millions of dollars last year . Figure for yourself the estimated yield of one hundred and fifty millions of bushels selling at from 75 cents to 82 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of a literal field of gold to equal that ? There are 8,832,000 acres in the valley , and less than a quarter of it was in crop last year . If every acre were put into wheat , there would be no market for the wheat ; it would become a drug . As it is , of the portion that is under cultivation , only about three-quarters were in wheat , and the yield of last year was estimated at from 30,000,000 to 37,000,000 bushels , grown at the average proportion of 20 bushels to the acre . The wheat crop of the valley , therefore , fetched about $27,000,000 . At 80 cents a bushel , each acre returned $16 , at a cost of from $6 to $8 . Good land has produced 31 bushels to the acre , and good land farmed scientifically has yielded as high as 47 bushels to the acre , but 20 bushels is the average product , and the farmer is entitled to a profit of $10 an acre , with prices as they were last year . Matured farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acre . The Dakotas , which are also tributary to the txvin cities of Minnesota , do not offer opportunities for theatrical or bonanza farming . Three-quarters of their territory is not wheat land . More wheat can be raised upon the six counties in the Red River Valley than in all the rest of both Dakotas . The Dakotas will produce grain , cattle , horses , sheep , and , in ten or fifteen counties , corn . These States offer a good reward for honest toil , and that would be very high praise of them were it not that the opulent valley on their eastern edge forces a comparison between itself and them . The end of one great source of revenue to the region is in sight . That is the lumber production . The trees are all counted ; the number of feet in each forest is entered in the lumbermen 's books . In Michi*an , all that is of value in the forests will have disappeared in five years , it is said ; in XVisconsin , 15 years will end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 years  --  a pin point in the dial of time . Already capitalists are turning their mercenary gaze toward the majestic and virgin forests of the new State of Washington . Montana is believed to be another and a greater Pennsylvania , rich in coals , in oil , amd in varied metalhiferous ores . These resources and the timber and farm products of the Washington of a later day are all waited for to swell the importance of the twin cities , for it is not now seen that there is a likelihood that any other very great cities will be developed in the Northwest except upon the Pacific coast . There will be populous district centres , of course , and already three such places are robust , lively towns , but the men who now seem possessed of the most shrewdness and foresight in the North west do not believe that the shifting horizon of time is hiding // any competitor for the position now occupied by the Minnesotan capitals of trade . Having noted the resources of the Northwest , possible as well as present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see that the great railway lines of tbat upper corner of our country present the appearance of a rude diagram of a human hand with the fingers outspread . St. Paul and Minneapolis are at the wrist , and control the fingers that reach out and grasp the trade of the entire Northwest . This double metropolis and this trade have their own ports at Duluth and Snperior , while at the twin cities of Minnesota the navigation of the Mississippi begins or ends . Minnesota 's twin capitals in the wheat region are not yet one corporate body , and there are many shrewd citizens of one and the other who assert that they will not unite while the present generation of leading men remains dominant . There has been too keen a rivalry , and each town is too jealous of the other , for union to be possible , they say , until the boys of to-day become the successors of their fathers . Therefore , if for no other reason than that , the cities must be studied separately in this article . They are ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very misleading , because they lie side by side like two globules of quicksilver , with a few little drops of the liquid between them . Whoever journeys from one to the other fails to perceive why they may not at any moment shake together into one great glittering mass , with no other division than is created by their separate charters , and no joint border line except that which will require a surveyor 's kit to determine . To begin with Minneapolis , the larger of the two cities , let me introduce the town as that one which seems to me the pleasantest and most nearly perfect place for residence of all the cities I have seen in my country . St. Paul is in the main so nearly like Minneapolis that a slight sense of injustice comes with the writing of those words ; yet St. Paul lacks some of the qualities which Minneapolis possesses and the words must stand . Both cities have arisen amid park-like surroundings , both rejoice in the possession of the lovely Mississippi ( for it is a most beautiful river up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling districts which fascinate the very soul of a man from the solid , pent-up cities of the East . But in one minor respect Minneapolis triumphs in being thoroughly consistent with her ruling trait , and at that particular point St. Paul fails . That is to say , Minneapolis is ample and broad and roomy in her business district , while St. Paul is in that quarter narrow , compact , huddled , and old-fashioned . I can not force Minneapolis to challenge the world to produce her equal , but it seems to me that it will be difficult to find another influential trading and manufacturing city that is so peculiarly a city of homes . It was after riding over mile after mile of her streets and boulevards , and noting the thousands of separated cottages , each in its little garden , that I came to a locality wherein there were a few  --  a very few-apartment-houses . They were not what we in New York call " tenement-houses , " for the poor seemed superior to the evil , and lived in their own tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indolent by nature . These were so very few that the array of dwellings took on an extraordinary importance . Try , then , to fancy the pleasure and surprise with which I read in the city directory , afterward , a statement that the city 's 164,738 inhabitants occupy 32,026 dwellings . If there were 921 more dwellings there would be one to every five persons , which is to say one to each family . As these houses are in the main owned by their tenants , the city presents a spectacle of communal dignity , self-respect , and comfort that distinguishes it even in a greater degree than Philadelphia is distinguished among our Atlantic seaboard cities . It was pleasing to hear in the neighboring city of St. Paul , where nearly the same conditions prevail , that when the citizens go to the City Hall to ask for places in the public service , or to demand their rights , they often draw themselves up to their full height and say , " I am a tax-payer , " by way of preface to a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his breast , and who goes home to a house whose every side offers windows to the light and air , should be as nearly a complete and perfect individual as it is possible for the more or less artificial conditions of life in a city to produce . Of such individuals is the great bulk of the population of Minneapolis composed . // It is interesting to know that the motive power of the city has always been pure Yankee . The settlers were in a large degree from Maine , and it is wittily said that they followed the pine westward , until at this point its final appearance east of the Rockies was no.ted . Here the Maine men rested and set up their saw-mills , using St. Anthony 's Falls to move their saws . It was a lumber town during most of its history . The great wheat-handling industry is a new thing by comparison . In 1871 only two car loads of wheat were received here ; in 1887 the Great Western Railroad brought thirty-three million bushels to the flouring-mills . It is thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached in the twelve months which include the period of receipt of the enormous crop of last year . But if newness is to be considered , what shall be thought of the city itself ? Its first settler marched in a procession through the streets last summer . He marked out his claim , in what is now the thick of the city , on June 10 , 1849 . A bird 's - eye view of the city is like such a view of one of those parks in the East which rich men dot with villas . It is a plain of luxuriant foliage , broken here and there by house roofs . Trees border the streets and avenues , and deck even the most ordinary building plots . The houses are simply little frame cottages , with here and there a street of pretentious and large residences , also of wood , and with a few noble mansions built of masonry for the leading capitalists of the place . But the same admirable features distinguish all classes of homes : nearly all stand apart one from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual and independent taste ; and all are found in districts sacred to domesticity and peace , where a taboo has been put against liquor-selling , and where traders of every sort seem loath to jar the homelike tone by intruding their storehouses . It is such a town as the average American housewife would plan , and nowhere do the women , both matrons and maids , seem better placed or more thoroughly the mistresses of their position in modern city life than as one sees them upon those bowery streets , passing the rows of pretty cottage homes , beneath trees , amid flowers , and beside the rosy children who play fearlessly in the well-ordered streets . We shall see in another article that Minneapolis enjoys a peculiar and admirable liquor license law . Suffice it here to say that the dram shops are confined to what may be called the business districts , where the stores and factories are clustered together  --  a fit arrangement for a woman 's capital , an earthly paradise of homes , a settlement of landlords and landladies . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes upen those who compare it with other towns , but they are aware of one effect , while ignorant of the cause ; that is , they know theirs is what is called an eminently " healthy " town . The death rate is lower and the sum of the general health is greater ( or was in 1890 ) than in any one of the twenty - six largest cities in the United States . We have seen in the past , and shall see again and again , that the Western people have not only an extraordinary fondness for public parks , but a positive genius in arranging them . Minneapolis found half a dozen pellucid lakes within her borders , and these she has converted , or is converting , into exceedingly pretty little parks . They are not . grand , like the pleasuregrounds which border the majestic lake at Chicago , but they are dainty and bewitching . To go by way of Hennepin Boulevard , for instance , where the electric cars run upon a central strip of grass between parallel driveways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes have been put to , is to enjoy a treat that will not be easily obliterated from the memory by any crowding of lovelier scenes . First , along the short route is Loring Park , so called in honor of the designer of the city 's park system . It is a reproduction in miniature of the most lovely features of New York 's Central Park . Then is seen a parkway of woodland beside a great sheet of crystal called Lake Calhoun . In another five minutes Lake Harriet is reached , and there bursts into view a great bowl of mirror-like water , embowered in trees and surrounded by the grove which nature planted there . At one point on the edge of the lake is a graceful casino building , and anchored out in the lake is a floating band - stand , hooded by a sounding-board , under which , on summer afternoons , a band is stationed to play for the people . Light , graceful row-boats are plentiful , and for hire at a low price ; the strand is fallowed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant less than half an hour 's journey from the heart of the city , at a passage rate of five cents , and there is no warning or rule against trespass anywhere in the beautiful grounds , which the people maintain , own , and are wisely permitted to en oj . The parks I have mentioned form bul 80 many links in a glorious chain N which compasses two sides of the city , Piat includes five parks and ten parkways , and that ends " Wbere the Falls of Minnehaha Laugh and leap into the valley , " at what is called Minnehaha Park . The winding verdant route from park to park is a continuous , well-ordered , and beautiful series of parkways , eighteen miles in length . Many Western cities and towns are interested spectators of the work of removing the railroad grade crossings in Minneapolis , for , although the city has grown to its present size with the railroads entering and crossing it on a level with its streets , the people have not hesitated to force a solution of the problem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cities out West . It was five years ago that the City Council of Minneapolis ordered the City Engineer to prepare plans for the execution of the work . This done , the City Attorney began proceedings in court to determine why the railroads should not lower their tracks . It was fortunate for Minneapolis that the head of one great railroad system was Mr. James J. Hill , whose consideration for the public and eminent shrewdness led him to fall in with the city 's project ; indeed , he did more-he aided the effort with suggestions that were calculated to lighten and improve the work . Another corporation , using tracks parallel with those of Mr. Hill 's Great Northern and Manitoba railroads , fought the authorities ; but in time its receiver , who was an officer of the courts , was ordered to accept a compromise between its own and the city 's demands , and the great and notable work that is called " The Fourth Avenue Improvement " was agreed upon and begun . The New York reader will understand the situation clearly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were running upon our own Fourth Avenue across all the numbered streets and on a level with them . The danger , slaughter , and discomfort of the citizens of Minneapolis may be imagined ; the obstacles against the free and fast handling of the trains need not be described . It is safe to say that if our own New York Central Railroad could return to the old streetlevel service , and could have back the cost of its sunken track with interest , it would not make the change . It could not if it would ; it would not be able to transact its present volume of business under the old conditions . Yet everywhere the railroads fight the efforts toward self-protection that are made by our municipal governments , and out West no subject is now being studied with deeper interest and earnestness than that of the methods by which the railroads can be forced to raise or lower their tracks within the boundaries of cities . Minneapolis 's mode of handling the problem is an especially valuable study , because , unlike her twin sister St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of self - defence and self-preservation was postponed u n til the city had grown great , and the task had become formidable . Along this Fourth Avenue in Minneapolis run not merely the trains of two trunk lines , but on that narrow avenue in the heart of the city is handled the enormous traffic between the twin cities and their chief summer resort , Lake Minnetonka . The arrangement that Minneapolis made was a simple one-for the city . It decided that the railroads were to build the entire viaduct , approaches , bridges , masonry walls , excavations , and all , and that the city was to stand between the railroads and those property-holders who might claim damages for injuries growing out of the improvement . It happens that most of the buildings whose owners claim damages were old rattletraps , and the highest claim for injury is one for $12,000 . In most cases abutting property was benefited . The city therefore comes out of the affair at very slight cost , while the railroads have been put to an enormous outlay . The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear space of twenty feet above the tracks . The railroads must keep the bridges and approaches in perpetual repair . One notable concession by the city is the surrender of a street crossing . At Sixth Street , where the work of lowering the tracks begins , and where there are // many rails and switches , the crossing is closed , and the city gives up its rights in the street at that point . Beyond this street , as the city continues to grow , the people will pay for and build the bridges that may be needed . The passenger tracks are sunk ten feet at the lowest point ; the freight tracks four or five feet . There are six bridges . They vary in length between 100 feet and 500 feet , as the tracks spread out beyond the starting-point . One bridge is 100 feet in width , but the others permit of only a thirty - six - foot roadway and a twentyeight-foot sidewalk . The bridges are approached by a gradual raising of the street levels , and the effort has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within four feet in the hundred , but in one case the grade is a foot greater . The railroads have done excellent work , and the viaduct , with its stone walls and fine freight-houses and passenger station , presents an appearance that is almost ornamental . It will be of interest to those officials of other cities who are meditating work of this kind to know that the railroads which use the new viaduct are greatly pleased with the reform , and would not go back to the old conditions . Moreover , a railroad whose tracks run upon the street level on the other side of the river , in Minneapolis , has made an informal proposition to sink its tracks , if the city will bear a moderate share of the cost . When I was in Minneapolis , in September , the City Engineer had been sent for to testify in behalf of Columbus , Ohio , in a suit growing out of a similar progressive movement in that city ; and it is certain that when the whoe country knows what Minneapolis has done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will attract . To give an idea of the extent of the principal industries of the Flour City , let me say , roughly , that her saw-mills cut 343,000,000 feet of lumber , 162,000,000 shingles , and half as many laths in 1890 ; that in the upper Mississippi region four billion feet of forest trees were cut down , and that the city received 45,000,000 bushels of wheat , and shipped 12,000,000 bushels away . The city has an assessed valuation of $138,000,000 , and nine millions of dollars of banking capital . It boasts a public-school system that is everywhere held to be unexcelled , and a function of the government is the maintenance of a library of 47,000 volumes , housed in a noble building , and having two circulating branches connected with it . In the extent of its circulation of books this library is the seventh in the country . The city is 53 square miles in extent , possesses many miles of granite and cedar block paving , 1500 acres of parks , 49 public schools , and a sufficient number of churches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonded debt of seven millions of dollars . Its hotels and theatres are very good , and among its notable office buildings one is the best that I have seen anywhere in the country ; that is the Northwestern Guaranty Loan Company 's building , an office building that towers above the town , and is peculiar in the fact that its owners surrender more valuable space for the admission of light and air than is given up in any other building of the sort that I have ever seen . At least half the interior is open and roofed with glass , while the offices , which have store fronts of plate-glass , are reached by glass-paved galleries . The building cost a million and a half of dollars , and contains , besides the offices , a Turkish bath , roof promenade and concert garden , a restaurant in the top story , private dining rooms , ladies ' rooms , a billiard-room , a barber 's shop , a law library-free to the tenants-locked boxes in fire-proof vaults for all the tenants , cigar and news stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the building is 1500 souls . But the growth of the manufacturing interests is the most important feature of the development of this city . It is rapidly fitting itself to become the main source of supplies for the most opulent farming region in America , and among recent additions to the list of her industries may be noted a knitting-mill ; a piano factory ; a linen mill ; tub and pail , carriage , and macaroni factories ; a manufactory for wood-carving machinery , in connection with a street-car construction company ; a smelter for reducing Montana silver ore ; a stove-works ; and additions to the facilities for making boots and shoes , woollens , lumber , and flour . The difference in freight rates enables the manufacturers of the twin cities to hold their own against Chicago in the trade with the Northwest , and they have their drum mers in all the cities and villages of the region . // The street-car service in Minneapolis is as nearly perfect as that of any city . Within a year , when the extensions now planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect . The electrical system which depends on overhead trolleys is in use there . The cars are elegant and spacious , and run upon 70 miles of tracks . They are propelled at a speed of 8 miles an hour in the city , and at 12 to 14 miles outside . They have run to Lake Harriet in 20 minutes , which is at the rate of 15 miles an hour , and they have made the journey to St. Paul ( 10*- miles ) , including ordinary stops , in 32 minutes . At the end of this year the system will embrace 130 miles of tracks . To the mind that is accustomed to judge of Eastern towns , St. Paul is more citylike than Minneapolis . Its business portion , originally laid out by French Canadians with narrow ideas , is such a compact mass of solid blocks and little streets that it might almost have been a ward of Boston transplanted in the West . One sees the same conditions in Portland . Oregon , but they are rare in the West , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we were to imagine the twin cities personified , we would liken Minneapolis to a vigorous rustic beauty in short skirts ; while St. Paul we would describe as a fashionable marriageable urban miss , a trifle stunted and lacking color and plumpness , but with more style and worldly grace than her sister . As to which should have the preference , there will be views as differing as the two towns . There are those who prefer hard-paved , bustling streets , faced by ranks of city stores , pressed shoulder against shoulder , with here and there huge , massive office towers breathing crowds in and out to choke the narrow sidewalks ; and there are others who like better the big , roomy avenues of Minneapolis , even though they hang like too loose clothes against uneven , shrinking lines of fashionless houses . They said to me in Minneapolis that they realized the fact that their city was only growing . If I would call around in a few years , they said , I would find all the walls up and plastered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Paul it is just the other way ; it looks finished . Its motto is , " While we journey through life , let us live by the way " ; but the Minneapolis spirit is that of the man who , to celebrate his marriage , built a four-story house , and lived in the front and back basement , saying to his wife , " We will lath and plaster the rest , one room at a time , as the family increases . " For my part , I find it so hard to decide between them that I am not going to try . Every man to his taste , say I. Minneapolis has done wondrous work for the future ; St. Paul has done more for present improvement than any other city in the West that I have seen . The twins are very like or very unlike in other respects , according as you look at them . Minneapolis is very American and St. Paul is very mixed in population . She has sixty-five per cent . of foreigners in her make-up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danes , and Germans . There are Irish and Poles , French Canadians and Bohemians , there also , and the Irish and Irish Americans are conspicuous in the government . St. Paul is usually Democratic ; Minneapolis is generally Republican . In eight years St. Paul has made tremendous strides away from the habits and methods of civic childhood . Its officials say that more has been done to establish its character as a finished city than will ever need to be done in the future . Its expenditures of energy and money have been remarkable . It has levelled its hills , filled its marshes , and modernized all its conveniences . The water-works , which were the property of individuals , now belong to the people , and serve two hundred miles of mains with pure wholesome water brought from a group of lakes ten miles north of the city . A noted firm of water-works builders has declared that it would willingly assume the city debt in return for the profits of this branch of the public service . No city in the country is better drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mile and a half of improved streets and three stone sidewalks eight years ago , and to-day it possesses forty-five miles of finished streets and fifty miles of stone sidewalks . Two costly bridges have been put across the Mississippi , and an important bridge has been rebuilt . In no city in the West is the railroad grade-crossing bugaboo more nearly exorcised . Only one notable crossing of that sort endangers the people 's lives and limbs . The public buildings of the city are admirable , and // were built at moderate cost , and without sixpence worth of scandal . The restricted saloon system is enforced there , and the residence districts are kept sacred to home influences and surroundings . The streets are thoroughly policed , and the fire department is practically new , and appointed with the most modern appliances . The street-car service consists of nearly one hundred miles of electric railway , and fifteen miles of cable road . There are no horse-cars in use in the city ; they would be too slow for such a town . St. Paul is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen such , any and all of which would ornament any city in the country . The population in 1890 was 133,000 , to which sum 12,000 should , in fairness , have been added . By actual count the city contains 26,942 houses . For its districts of dwellings it deserves the same praise that has been bestowed upon Minneapolis , and only in that slightly modified degree that comes from its having a stronger admixture of foreigners among its citizens and a larger number of houses squeezed close together in its older business district . Once away from that region , trees , grass , and flowers greet the visitor 's eyes wherever he rides and walks . On both sides of the river the phalanxes of pretty little homes rise among the trees . There are villas for the well-to-do and tiny frame dwellings for the poor , but the latter are not mere boxes ; they are distinguished by prettiness of designing and individuality of taste , and they stand apart from one another so that the people who live in them may get the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to plants and trees . The well-to-do cottagers have gathered in two or three very pretty clusters that were once suburban villages . A notable peculiarity of their houses is their possession of extra large double plate windows . Sometimes a house will have only one such extra large sheet of glass ; others will have several . Whether these are backed by drapings of snow-white lace or are filled with plants and flowers , the effect is very beautiful . I was told that in Minneapolis any man may buy himself a home for from $1800 to $2000 , selecting a site within easy walking distance of the City Hall . I am sure the same rule applies to St. Paul , which maintains fortytwo building and loan societies , with an invested capital of $3,064,310 . The stock in these societies used to mature in eight or eight and a half years , but the term has lengthened to nine and a half or ten years , owing to the competition in the loaning of money . The annual growth of the city by the addition of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For two years-1888 and 1889 - St . Paul was fourth in the list of American cities in this respect . Last year ( 1890 ) the permits issued were for 3174 buildings , planned to cost nine and a half millions of dollars . But the wonder ceases after the relation of the twin cities to the rich Northwest is understood . St. Paul is the meeting-point of twenty-eight railroads that crisscross that region . That city will contribute its full share to the million population nine years hence . With uncalled-for modesty St. Paul 's leading men apologize for the absence of a royal series of great parks , and assert that they have now designed and begun work upon such a system . They admit that they possess thirty-two little squares for children and adult pleasure - seekers , and say that the city and its environs are so park-like that the need of great public lungs has not been pressing . The apology should be graciously accepted . It reconciles us with what we know of ordinary humanity in our comparatively torpid Eastern cities to find them weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all elegance and ornament of the highest and most modern order . In one boulevard , called Summit AvenUe , it possesses one of the noblest thoroughfares , and the nucleus of one of the most impressive collections of great mansions in the country . Euclid Avenue , Cieveland , has long ceased to lead the rich residence streets of the nation , for Chicago has more than one finer street of the same character , and so has Buffalo , and so has New York since Riverside Avenue has begun to build up . None of these has the beauty which the Hudson River and its Palisades lend to Riverside Avenue , but a good second to it is Summit Avenue , St. Paul . From its mansions , rising upon a tall bluff , the panorama of a great and beautiful country-side is commanded . It may be necessary to say to the untravelled Eastern reader that the appointments-and the tenants-of these mansions reflect the best modern attainments of civilization as it has been studied in the capitals of the world . One , at least , // among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as its size , its beauty , and the character of its surroundings are concerned . In its appointments it will be found that the elegances and art triumphs of far more than Christendom have been levied upon to testify to a taste that at no point oversteps the limits cultivation has established . On the walls a number of the masterpieces of the Barbizon school hang side by side with the best efforts of Munkacsy , Diaz , Tadema , Detaille , Meissonier , and many other masters . Barye bronzes have their places in various rooms , and the literature of two continents , freshened by the constant arrival of the best periodicals , is ready at hand and well marked by use . I betray no secret of the Northwestern country in saying that such is the home of Mr. James J. Hill , the president of the Great Northern Railroad , and , despite its ornaments , it is maintained quite as a home , and solely for comfort . It is but one of several mansions in these two far Western cities . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidencing nothing of taste that is not shared and reflected in the other homes of those communities . Once again we come to the heart of any such study of a city 's capacity for growth in importance and wealth . St. Paul in 1881 manufactured $15,466,000 worth of goods with which to trade with the Northwest ; in 1890 the sum had grown to $61,270,000 , an increase of three hundred per cent . in nine years . The city is the dairy centre of the Northwest . It has made great investments in the manufacture of clothing , boots and shoes , fine furniture , wagons , carriages , farm implements , lager-beer , cigars , fur garments , portable houses for settlers , dressed stone , boilers , bridges , and the products of large stock-yards . To a less yet considerable extent it manufactures crackers , candy , flour , bedding , foundry-work , sashes and blinds , harness , brass goods , barrels , brooms , and brushes . Its banks have a capital of $10,000,000 ; its jobbing trade amounted to $122,000,000 in 1890 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of a million head in the same year . It has fine hotels and opera-houses , a typically elaborate Western school system , and is in all respects a healthy , vigorous , wellgoverned city . These are the trading centres of the Northwest . But there is another pair of twins , which are the lake ports and shipping-points for that region . They are the baby twins - Duluth in Minnesota , and Superior in Wisconsin . Though they are in different States , they are closer to one another than the cities from which we have just taken our leave . Though babies , these cities feel the impulses of giants . Their growth in so short a time and to such proportions as they possess calls attention to the radical changes that are taking place in the outlets for the produce of the Northwestern States . Not many years ago the grain trade centred at Chicago and Milwaukee , but the demands for economy that led to the development of the present railway systems in Minnesota and the Dakotas have altered the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twin ports at the head of Lake Superior . These two ports now receive a large proportion of this business , and have already distanced Chicago in the competition . It is easy to understand why this should be the case . Duluth and Superior are nearer to a large section of the Northwest than either Chicago or Milwaukee , and yet they are not any farther from the Eastern lake ports at the other end of the water route for freight . A glance at the map will reveal the fact that the distance to Buffalo is no greater from the head of Lake Superior than from the head of Lake Michigan , where Chicago is situated . This advantage in position is evident to any one but the men of Duluth and Superior claim a greater advantage . By drawing circles ten miles apart , with themselves as a centre , they demonstrate the possession of a larger tributary territory than can be shown for Chicago by the same means . It is humorously said to be as much as one 's life is worth to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports . This was the case not long ago with regard to St. Paul and Minneapolis , but last autumn one of those cities joined in an effort to secure the holding of a convention in the rival town . It will be long before any such amiable and generous self-sacrifice will be shown at the head of Lake Superior . The situation there is intensified by the fact that Duluth was for a long while practically alone in the glorious possession of the advantages that a seat at the head of the // great lake brings with it . Suddenly , within five years , a little village a stone'sthrow off , on the other side of the St. Louis River , which separates Wisconsin and Minnesota , sprung from the stagnation of a chrysalis condition into a stirring town that began to establish town limits calculated to leave Duluth a very small second fiddle to make music with if the plans were carried out . And when the census-taker came along in 1890 , Duluth 's 35,000 inhabitants read that , in round numbers , the impudent baby next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worse yet , the ambition of Superior is seen to expand with ten times the ratio of its increasing growth , and if the student of the situation reads the official literature of the younger lake port , he will discover that the records of its achievements are arranged to show how it is gaining upon Chicago-upon Chicago , mark you , as if it considered its nearest neighbor , twice its size , too unimportant for consideration ! From the point of view of Duluth , fancy such a situation ! There are those who hold that geographical and topographical advantages account for the sudden rise of Superior alongside of Duluth . There are others who account for it on the ground that Duluth was too confident of her position , and adopted a short-sighted policy , which , while it was maintained , gave an opportuuiity for the development of the rival port . It is not worth while here to discuss these moot points . In considering the relation of the head of internal water navigation to the country beyond it , both cities have a common value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vast and opulent territory behind them , or whether one becomes ten times greater than its neighbor , the point of interest will still be the head of the lake  --  the point of contact of lake and rail transportation . Both must gain all that will belong to either solely from their location , which , it seems clear , must become the seat of a great population and of extraordinary activity . Since this will not be gainsaid , it will be the simplest course to state the arguments and claims of both these rival ports at once . Their leaders assert that whatever of wealth and importance has come to Buffalo , Cleveland , Detroit , and Chicago is due to their advantages as distribu ting and receiving points for the tonnage of the lake commerce . This it is which has drawn the rail ways to these cities , and the result of the reciprocal influence of the railway and harbor transactions has been a degree of importance dependent upon the extent and productiveness of the territory tributary to each of these lake ports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study and upon so brief a trial of results as the history of the head cities of Lake Superior permits , to accept the utmost that has been urged for the future of these cities . Yet the argument is interesting . " If , " says the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of one of these twin lake ports- " if a straight line be drawn uniting Chicago with these ports , and this line be bisected by another beginning near the eastern end of Lake Superior and extending southwestwardly to the Gulf of California , near the 27th parallel , this latter line will represent with geometrical exactness all points that are equidistant from Chicago and the Superioi* ports . " All places north of the line will be in the legitimately tributary territory of the newer ports ; and all the railroads in this vast region , which is more than half of the United States , are now pointing toward the newer ports as their ultimate objective , it is said , because they aim to secure the shortest route to deepwater navigation . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is stated that Denver , Colorado , is 125 miles nearer the head of Lake Superior than Chicago . A connection between the new ports and the Union Pacific Railroad at that point is an early probability . The Great Northern system is almost completed to the Pacific coast ; and the Canadian Pacific Railroad , which has leased a railway from Duluth to the other end of Lake Superior , is about to dip down from a point in Manitoba to join its new property at Duluth . These cities have already been sought by eight railways , operating 17,514 miles of roadways . They connect with St. Paul and Minneapolis and their feeders ; they bring in the produce of the Dakotas , Montana , Idaho , and Washington ; they connect the twin ports with the lumber and mineral regions of Minnesota and along both the north and south shores of Lake Superior . Either projected or in course of construction are other railway lines // which will lead into Iowa and the cOrn belt , and up into the wheat fields of Manitoba and the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of that cheap water transportation which is reached through them . For instance , the coal they use comes to them at the same rate that Chicago gets its coal , and twentyfive cents a ton cheaper than it can be supplied to Minneapolis and St. Paul . And seven months in the year the jobbers in the twin lake ports get Eastern goods at the same cost for transportation that is paid by the Chicago jobbers . Thus they have another advantage over Minneapolis and St. Paul . The flourmilling industry is one that is rapidly growing in the twin lake ports . Duluth has one mill that turns out 2500 barrels a day , and will double its capacity next summer . It has another and smaller mill in operation , and three others are projected . Duluth may yet become a very considerable milling point . The reason is that to ship the flour east from Minneapolis vid the twin ports ( 250 miles nearer than Chicago ) costs the millers of the Flour City ten cents a barrel  --  the price of the barrel . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eking out their insufficient water - power with steam , and in the cost of fuel the lake port mills again have the advantage . At the extreme western end of Lake Superior , where it terminates in a bay called St. Louis , the ancient terrace that marks a prehistoric coast line of the lake rises 500 feet in air beside the narrow beach of the modern level . A river breaks this terrace , and flows into the bay , and across that river and bay is a flat reach of once swampy lowland . The bluff is on the north side of the sharp end of the lake , and the houses of Duluth are perched upon this highland as if they might be a flock of goats grazing upon the face of a steep hill . Thus the land meets the water , and men have built upon it at Quebec , at Bar Harbor , and at minor places in Cornwall and Devonshire , England ; but the habit in nature and in man is rare . Naturally Duluth has grown most in length along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparsely built end to the other broken and scattering termination is about six miles . A large fraction of this length is compactly built along streets that climb the hill-side . To prevent a division of the town by a rocky tongue that once ran out into the lake , the formidable barrier has been cut away as if it were so much dirt , and the main street runs by the spot as if the rocks never had been . To get teams and people up the steepest part of the hill-side  --  and perhaps to demonstrate anew the inability of nature to daunt the Duluth man-an inclined plane , like a massive slanting elevated railroad , is now building , and will soon be ready for the hauling of every sort of load , whether of wagons , cars , men , or beasts , up to the top of the hill . Out there , among those indomitable people , it is impossible to resist the feeling that if the moon were to take a fixed position permanently just over the city , they would annex it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In this little place , that is only ten years beyond its village condition , if you ascend the hill you will find that a sort of terrace , an ancient beach on top of it , has been laid out as a grand parkway or boulevard twelve miles long , 200 feet wide , and half encircling the city . Unfortunately the larger trees , of the one-time forest up there had been all cut down when this was laid out , but there is plenty of slen-. der timber there for future adornment , and , better yet , there are several madcap streams that break upon the edge of the bluff , and would splatter down upon the town had they not been controlled and covered . However , up on the beautiful Terrace Drive they are novel and beautiful ornaments , and ingenious taste and skill have made the most of them . From that terrace one can comprehend and can not help but admire the city . In the thickly built heart of it are many costly modern buildings of great size , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyceum Theatre , the Masonic Temple , the Chamber of Commerce , a great school - house , and a railway depot are among these . Beyond them and the town lies the harbor made by nature in a way man could hardly improve upon , except as he has cut channels to it . A. great barrier juts out from Minnesota opposite another from Wisconsin , so that both form a great and perfect breakwater . There are two harbors behind this bar , first Superior and then St. Louis bays . Each city has cut a shipway through the barrier , and each has built upon its side // of both harbors an impressive array of wharves , elevators , and coal , grain , and ore bins and dumps . The smoke of the enterprise of both places comes together in one cloud over both , typifying either the united purpose to achieve success in both towns , or the sure result of all efforts to bring about any sort of union there , according as you are poetic or practical . Across the narrow end of the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see Superior , Wisconsin , the rival of Diiluth , made up of old Superior , West Superior , and South Superior . It is remarkable only for its enterprise . It is not almost unique in the character of its site , as is Duluth , nor is it pretty or picturesque . It has elbow-room on a great level plateau , and it may spread and wax great without the let or hinderance of rocks or bluffs . Its plans , as its chief historian remarks , " are on a magnificent scale . Many miles of streets and broad avenues have been paved for present needs , and a grand boulevard and park system anticipate the growth of population by some years . " Then the historian goes on to speak highly of its sewage system , its electric street motors , the fact that it is one of the best-lighted cities in the land ; all of which the facts justify . A liberal policy has led to the establishment of a number of important manufacturing establishments in the younger city , and with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risen higher and higher . From the Evening Telegram 's hand-book upon the subject I gather the following notes of the possessions and achievements of the city : It has an area of 37 square miles , an assessed valuation of $23,000,000 , a bonded indebtedness of about $900,000 , and a tax list of half a million dollars . It has ten banks , with a million of capital for all , aud surpluses arid undivided profits amounting to $216,286 . Its coal receipts by boat in 1890 were 1,045,000 tons ; its oil receipts , 115,000 barrels . Its wheat shipments the same year amounted to 9,318,336 bushels ; and in round figures it shipped 1,100,000 bushels of corn , 1,300,000 bushels of barley , and the same number of barrels of flour . It has a coal-dock capacity of 1,500,000 tons , a grain - elevator capacity of eight and a half million bushels , five hotels , twenty churches , seven railways , a street railway , the American Steel Barge Works ( where the famous " whaleback " lake steamers are made ) , the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of saw-mills , a furniture factory , and many other smaller works of various kinds . The population of what there was of Superior in 1884 was 2000 ; in 1889 it was 10,000 ; in 1890 it was 11 ,  - -  983 . Now it is variously estimated at from .15,000 to 20,000 . Duluth is said to owe its foundation to the grasping demands of those who held the land on the Wisconsin side of the bay when Jay Cooke sought a terminal point there for the Northern Pacific Railroad . Now Superior has arisen simultane*usly with the nearing completion of the Great Northern Railroad , which transfers its grain and other east - bound freight from its cars to its great steamers at Superior . Duluth had 3500 population in 1880 , and 33,115 in 1890 , according ta the census . This is now called 40,000 . Duluth receives less coal than Superior , but ships more grain . Her grain shipments in 1890 , and from January 1 , 1891 , to December 15 , 1891 , were as follows : 1890. 1891 . Flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,453,089 302,503 Oats 1,616,635 365,872 narley " 130,931 156,497 Flaxseed ... " 51,440 308,363 Rye .... 20,472 Duluth has extensive iron-works , iron and steel and steel and tin works , a woodturning mill , lumber mills , a furniture factory , and a woollen mill . The city 's grain-elevators have a combined capacity of 21,250,000 bushels . The lumber interest in Duluth is enormous , but the city itself is one of the great consumers of the supply , and receives far more than it ships away . The place is well paved , drained , and lighted , and has a good water supply system . As it would say of itself , it is " a hustler "  --  but so , also , is Superior . The key-note and countersign of life in these cities is the word " hustle . " We have caught it in the East , but we use it humorously , just as we once used the Southern word " skedaddle , " but out West the word hustle is not only a serious term , it is the most serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lobby of one of the great hotels in the older pair of twin cities , I heard two old friends greeting one another with ardent expres // sions of friendship and delight . They had not met for a long while , and each asked about the other 's Lizzie and Fannie and their respective little ones . All of a sudden I heard one say : " Well , see you to-night , I suppose . I have got to go . " " Where have you got to go to ? " the other inquired , plainly disappointed that the pleasant interview was not to be prolonged . " Where ? " the other echoed . " Why , to hustle , of course . I have lost ten minutes standing here talking to you . I 'm going out to hustle . " The word always jars upon the ear of an Eastern man when it is seriously spoken , but it is preferable to that otter expression once dominant in the West , but now all but abandoned . That was the word " rustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verb " to rustle " meant precisely what is conveyed by the newer terms a hustler and to hustle . At the first blush , as they say out West , rustle seems the better word . There is a hint of poetry in the suggestion of the sound of moving leaves upon the ground or of the silken dress of a lady moving rapid ly . Moreover , that was what the word was intended to convey , the idea being that of a man who moves so rapidly that the dead leaves upon the earth rustled as he swept along . But in its origin it is a word of evil intent , for the cowboys invented it , and applied it to cattle-thieves , rustlers being the swift raiders who stole upon grazing cattle on the plains , and rustled off with as many head , or beasts , as they could get away with . Therefore rustle is the worse word of the two . But to one who lives where neither word is in familiar use there is little choice , since the actual meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both imply a serious and even brutal lack of consideration for other persons , who are elbowed and pushed out of the way by the hustler as rowdies are hustled along by the police . Both Duluth and Superior are mainly dependent upon the lake system of navigation , and both complain that its limitations greatly retard their growth , and resist the growing demands of the shippers of the Northwest . In another article , upon Lake Superior , the situation in which these cities find themselves , and the need of prompt action by the government , will receive attention .
