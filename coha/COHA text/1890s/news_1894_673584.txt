The only votes in the committee against the bill , he said , came from the two NewEngland States of Massachusetts and NewHampshire ; there had been no protest from the farmers of any section of the country . Mr. Harter ( Dem. , Ohio. ) came in for a lively excoriation by Mr. Hatch near the close of his speech .

" He spoke of Mr. Harter 's invitation to him to come and sleep in his political bed , and announced his refusal of the invitation , saying he would rather sleep with a rail fence . " I would trudge in the heat all the way to Georgia , " said Mr. Hatch , " and crawl under the covers with Tom Watson , rather than to stretch one limb in the same political bed with the gentleman from Ohio .
