txt IT was toward the end of February , 1865 , that I first visited Washington , and it was there that I made Mr. Sumner 's acquaintance . The last session of the 38th Congress was then at its close ; a few days later Mr. Lincoin was to enter upon his second presidential term . The affairs of the Union presented at that moment a most interesting spectacle . The Federal armies were on their way , preparing the last military evolutions which were to bring about the downfall of the Confederacy . Under General Grant , the army of the Potomac was commencing its attack upon Richmond , while Sherman , after having crossed through Georgia , and threatened Savannah , had taken a northerly direction through the Carolinas . On the other hand , political events on the verge of fulfilment had also reached a climax of equal importance . Congress , with the required constitutional majorities , had just voted the amendments intended to wipe out slavery forever from American institutions . And thus , while abolitionist measures following one another in rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , the legislative power had placed in the President 's hands the necessary resources , in men and finances , to enable him to conduct the war to a successful termination . It was then , and in the midst of like events , that I saw Mr. Sumner for the first time . If he had good reason for being satisfied with the results derived from past events , still he was far from finding them sufficient , and he truly thought that the most arduous task imposed by the abolition of slavery was as yet hardly begun , much less achieved . To his mind , it was not enough to crush * down armed resistance in the secessionist States ; it was , above all , necessary to endow these commonwealths with an entirely new form and existence . But this opinion , as Mr. Sumner then frequently expressed it , was shared neither by the majority in Congress , nor by the President of the United States . Mr. Lincoln , in fact , did desire to end hostilities , to force the recognition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sole condition , restore them to their former rights . Although disturbed by this opposition to his views , and somewhat anxious regarding what the future held in store , Mr. Sumner , linked as he was to the Republican party by all possible ties , hoped by slow process to win over to his strong personal convictions that great political organization . He was then already preparing himself to fight for his favorite doctrines ; and at the same time he had such implicit faith in the rectitude of his political ideas , that he did not even doubt but that he would win Mr. Lincoln himself over to them , and compel him to side with him But this plan demanded time , sustained efforts , skill in persuasion , and it was only in the most remote corner of the horizon that Mr. Sumner foresaw the end at which he aimed . Thus , although much was being said in the opposition press about the consequences which might result from difference of opinion , which no doubt then existed between Mr. Sumner and the President , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , were following each other so quickly that they fairly seemed to rush . I had ilot been in Washington over six days , when in rapid succession came the news of the decisive victories of the army of the Potomac , the fall of Richmond , and Sherman 's entry into North Carolina . Mr. Lincoln was then at City Point , on the James , where General Grant had for many months had his headquarters . Mrs. Lincoln , who was on the eve of starting off to join her husband , asked Mr. Sumner and a few friends to accompany her on her journey . It was probably at Mr. Sumner 's request that // Mrs. Lincoln was kind enough to indude me among her guests . On April 4th we left Washington , and were able to visit Richmond the following day . What scenes , what surprises , do events prepare for men ! After such long and laborious struggles against slavery , Mr. Sumner , for the first time in his life , found himself in that same Richmond , which the Confederacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four years it had held its own against the Union 's strongest armies ! And in what condition did he find that city ? Everywhere crumbling walls , houses still smoking , all the traces of destruction and fire ! I followed Mr. Sumner through these many streets , often so filled with ruins that our carriage could hardly pass . The shutters were closed on every house . Only one white inhabitant did we encounter during our drive , and that a child of about fifteen who ran away when she saw us . On the contrary , however , hordes of negroes , who , ignorant of what liberty meant , surrounded us on all sides and gazed at us with astonishment . Everywhere the strangest contrasts met our eyes . But especially in the Capitol , where the assemblies of the Confederacy had met , were the most striking ones to be found . A few negroes were roaming through the abandoned halls , while others were playing bowls in the corridors , with Federal officers calmly looking on . Everything presented a most confused and desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , in a room the access to which was forbidden , were accumulated the glorious memories of Virginia 's history . The imprint left upon the final events of the last century and those of the early years of the present , by Washington , Patrick Henry , Jefferson , and so many others , were still to be seen in this room , filled as it was with the archives of that epoch ; and Mr. Sumner , reared , as he had been , in the pure traditions of these great men , acquainted with the most minute details of their history , was contrasting in his mind that past and the present , which revealed itself to him in so poignant a manner . But whatever were his sentiments or his forebodings in regard to what might one day spring from out these ruins , or blossom perhaps under the spur of a new generation , the advent of which he had beforehand hailed and prepared , I was none the less struck by the moderation he exhibited , nay , by the affectionate interest he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him one bitter feeling , or a single revengeful thought . During his talk with Federal officers , I heard him inquire after several ex-United States Senators , whom events had placed on the adverse side . One of them , in particular , excited in him a strong interest . He was an eminent Virginian who had ranked among the leaders of the Federal Senate , holding there a prominent position , when in 1851 , Mr. Sumner , almost unknown , had come to take his seat in that assembly , where he had been the first to raise the standard of Abolitionism . It can be readily understood what bitter feelings were aroused in the mind of this leader of the party then in power , by the efforts of this young man , who so audaciously expounded , in presence of himself and his colleagues , a doctrine so odious and repulsive to him and to them . But how radically all things had changed ! This man , so highly considered at one time , nay , but yesterday standing in the first ranks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumner , who had become in turn one of the most influential men of the United States , was now inquiring , with friendly interest , after this once powerful and now fallen personage . The day passed in conversation upon the recent events ; but in the midst of the anxiety they awoke in his mind , Mr. Sumner could not forget his love for letters and history . I heard him several times ask after the archives of the Confederacy ; and when he expressed the earnest wish that they be carefully collected and kept , it was less from a wish to satisfy his own curiosity for retrospective revelations , than for the purpose of giving to history documents which properly belonged to it . Toward evening we returned to the boat on board of which we were to re // main until the morrow . Mr. Sumner and a few of the guests seated themselves at the bow , on the side facing Richmond . Slowly night came on , and as it grew darker , they could see the fire still burning in the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , plunged in utter darkness . For a long while they listened ; not a sound was audible in the distance . Nothing of the vague noise that ordinarily reveals the neighborhood of large agglomerations of houses and men could be heard . Richmond presented the aspect of a death-ridden town . What thoughts arose in Mr. Sumner 's mind at the sight of so weird a scene ? Filled with confidence in the future , convinced of the sanctity of the cause of which he was one of the most illustrious champions , he doubted not that from this night of apparent death would date the dawn of a new life . On the day following we had left Richmond , and joined Mr. Lincoln at the headquarters . I was then at leisure to observe closely the existing relations between these two men , so different in origin and education , who represented opinions and convictions so distinctly apart , and who notwithstanding had found themselves bound to one another by the ties of a similar political faith , and united by a sentiment of mutual esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true patriotism which guided both , seemed a sort of platform upon which they naturally met ; they were therefore made to appreciate one another . But , on the other hand , it must be admitted that their two minds were scarcely intended to agree . Mr. Sumner took pleasure in mentioning that he had studied the Summa of St. Thomas . I do not know if it was from that source that he had derived his reasoning methods ; it is true , however , that in many respects his mind had been accustomed to the argumentative process of the Scholastics . Mr. Sumner reasoned as reasons a professor of theology . From the days of his youth he had felt that he had a calling in life ; that he would devote his existence to opposing injustice everywhere . Hence slavery being an absolute wrong , it must be his mission to obliterate it from the institutions of his country . In the beginning , no doubt , he intended opposing the enemy solely with persuasive arms , and he perhaps flattered himself that he might bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when by degrees obstacles arose on the reformer 's path , when the fight became hotter , and , especially after the breaking out of the war , new horizons had opened to Abolitionism , Mr. Sumner had accustomed himself , in spite of his utter repugnance to such means , to consider fire and steel as indispensable . There might possibly be discovered in the history of the religious middle ages , examples which would explain by what process of reasoning this theoretic enemy of war had , in spite of such principles , reached such conclusions . But even at the moment when it could be said that he contributed so largely to the direction of the struggle , and when , better than anyone , he had been able to define its true character , there still remained in him no hatred of the enemy . To his mind the question was less the striking down of an opponent , than the bringing back of a sinner to the right path . Whence the sentiment which animated him . Slavery must not only be abolished , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights for the emancipated slaves . These results of the Northern victories , which the South then considered with a feeling of horror , Mr. Sumner deemed inevitable . But , in his judgment , it sufficed that the culprit should accept them for his crimes to be expiated and forgiven . In this mauner is explained the strange contrast which stood for so many years before the eyes of the American people . Mr. Sumner 's personality has long figured as a living embodiment of the most extreme political measures , and , notwithstanding , no one has ever been able to quote or recall a single word uttered by him in a spirit of vengeance ; furthermore , those who lived in close intimacy with him can attest that no one among them ever heard him utter a bitter word agaiEst the Southern men , or even allude to // the personal violences of which he had been the victim . In contrast to this character so marked , this nature so vigorous , to this scholar so formed by the most profound studies , stood Mr. Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moulded for State affairs by the practice of affairs themselves , having risen little by little through fatigue and toil , knowing from experience all the difficulties of life , whose disposition was sweet and sad more than persistent and audacious . He too had devoted himself to the triumph of his ideas of justice and emancipation , but he was accustomed to measure obstacles and to appreciate them . Gifted , furthermore , with an uncommon resisting power , he felt himself sufficiently strong to oppose by the sole force of his obstinacy all efforts made with a view to alter his opinions . How could two such men agree ? Had it not been owing to the mutual esteem that united them , incessant conflicts would have arisen between them . It must also be said that Mr. Lincoln had a manner of attending to affairs that rendered things singularly easy . His patience was such that he could always listen to his interlocutor , without interruption , or without allowing his own sentiments to be even suspected . Once the statement concluded , if the President did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , or again , he might finish up with a joke , thus putting an end to the discussion . In like manner , when Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Sumner met after we had left Richmond , and when the latter seized upon the first favorable opportunity to discuss the general state of affairs , the conversation took the following course : Mr. Sumner insisted upon the necessity of bringing about an unconditional surrender of all the rebel armies . This result , he argued , once obtained , the President of the United States , by means of an official act , might make known his intention to establish civil and political equality between the two races . In the meantime , in order to furnish the disorganized communities with sufficient means for reconstruction , he would maintain martial law , and entrust its administration to military governors . But this plan Mr. Lincoln rejected with all his force . At the very moment , and while Mr. Sumner was expounding it to him , he was striving to further the execution of another , entirely different plan from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful or strained discussion , the President confined himself to silence . It must , however , be said , that after the sad experiences of the past eight years , * a number of Southern men have come to think that the adoption of Mr. Sumner 's plans , extreme as they undoubtedly seemed in 1865 , might have spared the once secessionist States many of the mishaps that have fallen upon them since . But home politics did not furnish the only questions which then engrossed the attention of the American Government . While Mr. Lincoln , seated at the headquarters , close by the telegraph operators , was sending off his personal orders to General Grant , and dictating to him the terms of Lee 's surrender , the news of which was now expected at any time , he was in addition forced to consider the presence of the French flag on Mexican soil , and all the while to meditate the steps to be taken with respect to the British Government , guilty in the eyes of the United States of having well-nigh publicly aided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and Mr. Sumner 's minds seemed in perfect accord . Both equally deprecated war . Mr. Sumner on that subject was animated with a strong belief , to which he was ever faithful ; indeed , one of his constant preoccupations consisted in endeavoring to find a final substitute for the decisions of battle - fields in in. ternational arbitration . On the other hand , Mr. Lincoln also had an instinctive horror of war . The Quakers , from whom he descended , had transmitted to him with their blood their doctrines of peace . Regarding the policy to be followed toward France and Great Britain , the sentiments of the President of the United States and those of Senator Sumner were in complete harmony . Both believed that the mere fact of the * Written in 1874. // Union 's reconstruction would amply sufflee to overthrow Maximilian 's throne and bring about the evacuation of Mexico by the French troops . They also thought that the victory of the United States over themselves , and the abolition of slavery , would exercise sufficient moral pressure to induce England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment , amid the first joy of triumph , the popular cry seemed to demand the intervention of the United States in Mexico . Masses of armed men showed themselves ready for a new campaign , which would doubtless have united under one flag the adversaries of the civil war . It needed all the moral fortitude of statesmen like Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Sumner to restrain such elements , ready to break loose . And this is possibly why it was then rumored , and perhaps not without some reason , that Mr. Lincoln , though personally opposed to Mr. Sumner 's home policy , intended intrusting him with the conduct of foreign affairs , and that he thought of appointing him Secretary of State in place of Mr. Seward . But how futile are the designs of men ! On April 9th , toward evening , the President and Mr. Sumner re-entered Washington City together ; and five days later , Mr. Sumner was among the small group of friends called in haste , on that terrible night , around the bed where Mr. Lincoln lay dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attitude at first taken by radical republicans as regards the Executive was not to remain long unchanged . Convinced as was Mr. Sumner that the problem of . reorganization of the South depended on the President , and that his power amply sufficed to solve its intricacies , he strove at first to make Mr. Johnson share his views . It is even probable that the latter went so far as to make promises , or at least allowed it to be understood that he would follow what was then termed the radical policy . At all events , when Mr. Sumncr left for the summer vacation , he , who rarely suspected double dealing in others , felt certain of the President 's co-operation . But , supposing even that Mr. Johnson had spoken to him in good faith , Mr. Sumner undoubtedly labored under an illusion , and attached too much importance to a few vague sentences . He thereupon carried with him to Boston hopes which did not remain long undeceived . In fact , the situation soon changed for Mr. Sumner . The chief help on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared war against his principles . It became incumbent upon him to alter his plan-to fight the President and induce Congress , by means of popular pressure , to adopt and maintain doctrines which until then had been regarded unfavorably in both assemblies . If ever like enterprise was coupled with great difficulties , the then impending events and state of public opinion greatly aggravated those difficulties . The Federal armies , disbanded with all possible promptitude , were at that moment returning home , supplying the Northern States with the working hands they so sorely needed ; commerce and industries were everywhere beginning anew ; everyone desired rest , and the immense majority among the people , happy to enjoy again the benefits of peace , seemed well disposed toward the policy to which Mr. Johnson appeared more and more to commit himself . It was under such circumstances that Mr. Sumner , feebly backed by a small majority , prepared to fight a new battle . I remember , one day , Mr. Sumner 's communicating to me a letter which he strongly recommended me to read with attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheld in the House of Representatives very nearly the same principles of which Mr. Sumner had become the champion in the Senate ; and both of them had found themselves in a powerless minority whenever they had attempted opposing Mr. Lincoln 's policy . But Thaddeus Stevens now understood that the situation had changed . Gifted with an instinct which seldom misguided him ; armed with political courage which nothing could daunt ; able in turn to lead the House of Representatives , and remain firm when abandoned by it ; strengthened by his own domineering sentiments ; and filled with // confidence regarding his own ability , Mr. Stevens understood that the time had come when he could at last exercise that political sway which he had always deemed to be his calling . He was therefore urging upon Mr. Sumner not to allow himself to be hindered by any obstacles , and in the name of the Union 's preservation , and in the interest of the freedmen , to declare war against President Johnson . But *while they were preparing for this new struggle , how different was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act the principal parts in it ! Mr. Sumner , fatigued by the many political battles which he had fought for years past , was already struggling against the disease which was slowly undermining his powerful constitution . He felt a sort of general lassitude which was beginning to alter his features , and besides , controversies and debates were things painful to him ; while accepting , or even while cafling them forth at times , he only fulfilled what he deemed a duty . Mr. Stevens , on the contrary , although then over seventy-two years of age , was still filled with all the ardor of youth . In the midst of strife he seemed in his element . The hotter the fight , the more uncertain its issue , the greater became his daring , the more numerous the expedients which would suggest themselves to his mind . Of what immense value , therefore , was Mr. Stevens 's co-operation to Mr. Sumner ! It was during the month of September , 1865 , that Mr. Sumner delivered , before the Republican Convention of Massachusetts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted his hostility to President Johnson , and expounded his personal views regarding the home policy to be followed in the future . The United States , he claimed , must exact guarantees for the future . They owed it to themselves not to abandon the race recently freed , or neglect anything in order to place it on an equal footing , political and social , with the white race . To stop at the point reached would be equivalent to an abandonment of the cause which had recently triumphed . At the same time , with a foresight which late events have proved to be wisdom , Mr. Sumner then went on to state that the United States Government must keep up to all its pecuniary obligations and pay off all its debts , of whatever nature they might be . Thus began the conflict which was destined to last well - nigh four years . During that long period Mr. Sumner remained ever foremost in the strife . The force of his character , his irresistible will , his indefatigable perseverance , at last convinced the Republican party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who acted almost always alone , and who took counsel only with himself , finally vanquished the most obstinate resistance . However , it must be said that Mr. Sumner was in turn obliged to make some concessions to the majority of the Republican party . This accounts for his being forced to consent to the immediate readmission of the Southern States into the Union , which however did not take place without very violent discussions in Republican meetings and conventions . Mr. Sumner always thought that it was not necessary to hasten in this matter , but he gave in at last . Indeed , for this very reason perhaps , when impartial history shall describe the events of that period , and it shall be asked who was responsible for the sad consequences that followed the policy termed " the policy of reconstruction , " it should long hesitate before throwing upon Mr. Sumner the whole responsibility . It was during that part of his life , from 1865 to 1868 , that Mr. Sumner strove to define what is a " republican form of government . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to examine what were , in the opinion of this statesman , the true conditions of life in a democratic and free people . Nurtured in the pure traditions of New England , having breathed in a measure the same atmosphere in which , a century before , had lived and toiled the founders of American liberty , Mr. Sumner had educated himself up to a respect approaching to worship of the patriots of that illustrious epoch . Constant meditation on the writings of that time had imparted to him this veneration for the fathers of liberty . The re // public they had established seemed to him the most illustrious of American traditions . And thus this patrician , enamoured of the democratic institutions of his country ; this faithful exponent of all that New England had noblest and best ; this man of letters whose mind was cultivated by the widest knowledge ; this statesman brought up , so to speak , in close intercourse with Otis and the Adamses , firmly believed that he was called upon to continue and perfect their work . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all to prove that the origin of his ideal republic could be traced to the works of its founders ; thence a constant effort to establish , beyond all possible doubt , that the authors of American independence had contemplated uniting in perfect equality all human beings residing upon the American continent . Furthermore , to Mr. Sumner*s mind the declaration of independence and the bill of rights did not wholly rest upon a philosophical effort of thought . They had been evolved , he held , both of them , out of the very traditions of the country . Each article , in both these documents , had directly emanated from the controversies which arose , during the second half of the past century , between the colonies and the mother-country . It only remained , therefore , to define , in a more satisfactory manner , the sentiments which then prevailed . From this standpoint , if the rights of man and of the citizen , and political as well as civil equality of all races be claimed , it was only because long before the Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others had claimed the same rights . Thus the ideal republic , the advent of which Mr. Sumner was striving to prepare , could not in his mind be considered as a new thing . He was convinced that he had found it described in the past , and he , who had so often been treated as a dangerous radical , firmly believed himself to be the representa-4 tive of the purest American tradition . It seems , therefore , as though one were forced to admit that , notwithstanding the fact that this idealist often failed to consider sufficiently the conditions of weakness which democracy imposes of itself upon oar political societies , the plan he had conceived , the doctrines he professed , and the principles to the success of which he had devoted his life , were surely not wanting in greatness or in justice . If they could not wholly prevail here , on earth , if man 's infirmity too often comes and convinces the noblest thinker that there is but little room for the realization of his schemes , it remains none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stands upon a plane to which the crowd does not attain . What Mr. Sumner wished was to make of the United States a model republic , which little by little should inspire all nations with the desire to imitate it . He was not one of those who pretend to convert other nations by force , and bring them , by means of a revolutionary propaganda or conspiracies , to the overthrow of their governments ; he would have considered it unworthy of himself to join in such intrigues . It may be said even that this great American republican judged rather severely the men who in several countries of Europe parade under the name of republicans , and whose conduct prostitutes it , and harms the very cause which they pretend to serve . But having long reflected upon that influence which the declaration of American independence had exercised over the great French movement of 1789 at its inception , he felt assured that the restoration of the republic in America would serve as an example which the new continent would point out for Europe to follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganization in the United States according to the plan he had conceived , events in Europe were for a moment of such a nature as to strengthen his hopes . Forced to abandon Mexico , and to retire as it were before the moral power of the United States ; stricken , though indirectly , at Sadowa ; threatened at home by the newly rising spirit of free discussion ; the French Empire , which Mr. Sumner had ever considered to be the " incarnation of C*esarism and modem tyranny , " was tottering and visibly // weakening . At a distance , one could readily believe that a new sentiment was manifesting itself in France , and over the entire older continent . Mr. Sumner 's optical illusion in this respect can easily be understood . Deceived by apparent demonstrations , he thought that the moment was coming when republican institutions would triumph over the world . How many times , and during how many hours , did we discuss together these questions ! And although in my mind objections arose which did not shake the great believer 's faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the firm believer always exercises over the man who doubts . At last , the thunder peal of 1870 broke forth ; the war declared by Emperor Napoleon against Germany filled Mr. Sumner with indignation . He expressed himself in a speech upon the subject . The Emperor , according to him , had committed the greatest of crimes . At this first instant , therefore , his sympathies were with Germany , which seemed to him assailed . He moreover deemed the Emperor responsible for the destruction of the European equilibrium , which had seemed to him favorable to the development of free and republican ideas ; but soon after his sentiments changed . I remember , in the autumn of that same year , after the catastrophe of Sedan , Mr. Sumner one day handed me a letter he had just received from his faithful friend Mr. Louis Agassiz . This time the illustrious geologist , whose loss Switzerland and the United States still mourn , wrote to him in French . He seemed to desire to speak again on that occasion the tongue he had spoken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thought of the political and military events then on the verge of fulfilment in France . I have seldom read a letter more truly sensible , more simply eloquent . In it Louis Agassiz appealed to Mr. Sumner , asking him to speak out publicly and withdraw from Germany the moral support he had at one moment lent her . It was no longer a war of conquest , said he ; the spirit of usurpation was again blowing over Europe , was even no longer taking pains to conceal itself under those democratic and revolutionary formula which the first Napoleon had so cleverly lent it . Old feudal Germany , as though made young again by recent scientific discoveries , was now embodied in the conquerors . After thus describing the true character of the invasion , Louis Agassiz pictured the sad consequences which would follow the triumph of such forces over Europe . And he concluded by saying that they would destroy , or at least impede , the ideas of liberty and progress . Mr. Sumner was on the point of following this advice of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American people what he thought ; but even at that time work bad become so difficult and painful to him , public speaking fatigued him so much , that he was forced to spare the little strength left him for the discussions in the Senate . But if he enjoyed an hour of satisfaction during that period , it surely was when he learned that in the midst of the bloody ruins of France , M. Thiers , now chief of the executive , was striving to establish a republican form of government . How often have I heard him express his ideas upon this subject ! While he admired the art of the great politician in the reconstruction of the power of his country amid such great and perplexing difficulties , he was above all interested in the progress which the statesman made in republican ways . It must be said that the hopes he then entertained regarding M. Thiers 's policy bordered at times on illusion . Mr. Sumner did not fully realize the terrible blow which German invasion had strnck at the spirit of liberty . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the old feudal institutions revived and victorious . But where is the Frenchman who would consider erroneous the judgment of those who kept up their implicit faith in the future of liberal institutions in France ? Mr. Sumner did not confine his thoughts on foreign politics to the development of republican institutions throughout Europe . Faithful follower of American tradition as he was , he never departed one moment from the principles // of neutrality and non-interference which President Washington had caused to prevail , and which his successors have scrupulously applied . Nothing could have induced him to consent by his vote to contract an alliance with any great foreign power . Grateful to Russia for her favorable attitude toward the North - an attitude from which the Czar 's policy never departed from 1861 to 1865-he neglected no opportunity to mention what he termed " the friendship between the two nations . " His good faith and candor caused him to think too well perhaps of the Russian sentiment as regards his own country ; but whatever were his illusions upon this subject , he would never have consented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any diplomatic act . In truth , Mr. Sumner , like most Americans of his time , had received too deep an impression from the civil war to be at all able to overcome it . Thence originated a sentimental foreign policy in which each European nation ranked according to the degree of sympathy exhibited by it at the time of the war for the Union 's preservation . How often , when I heard him deplore the uncertain and vacillating attitude of France toward the United States at the time of the crisis , have I regretted the fatal influences that weighed upon the decisions of the Imperial Government , giving to its policy an air of half-concealed hostility . How much better it would have been to conform with that time-honored tradition , born in the last years of our old monarchy , which was so ably continued by the first Consul , and which perished together with so many other excellent things at the close of Napoleon the Third 's reign ! But especially toward Great Britain , Mr. Sumner felt his strongest , possibly his most bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with re spectful admiration for her great men , learned in all the details of her consti tutional existence , sincere follower of the * liberal school from which her greater W glories spring , and , so to speak , enam oured of those abolitionists who , long before his day , had trodden the path upon which he had walked unflinching ly , Mr. Sumner , it may be said , felt , as regards that nation which had wellnigh openly declared its hostility to the Union 's cause , a sentiment of love betrayed . How was it possible that Lord Russell , the impregnable bulwark of the abolitionist cause in England , had become in 1862 an opponent of American abolitionists ? It was always with bitter sadness , though never angrily , that Mr. Sumner expressed himself regarding the existing relations between the United States and Great Britain . To his mind that nation was guilty of a great moral wrong , and owed those who had suffered therefrom a manifest atonement . Such was the feeling which inspired his speeches , at times eloquently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Saxon nations . On reading them one can readily understand what explosions such fiery words would provoke on the other side of the Atlantic . A challenge of war was thought to be concealed under them . The orator was even accused of exciting the worst of feelings and of appealing to the darkest hatreds . But in all this English public opinion was mistaken . Mr. Sumner only considered that Lord Palmerston , Lord Russell , and their colleagues had wronged the United States , and it was by appealing to higher sentiments that he demanded justice of their successors . Never did the idea of armed retaliation suggest itself to Mr. Sumner 's mind . This , indeed , might be called a new sort of diplomacy . The men of the old school might smile at it and regard the author of such passionate tirades as one who was lacking in practical good sense ; and yet it was Mr. Sumner who this time was in the right , and saw more clearly than they . The moral force which he in a measure embodied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , as events have shown ; it was in truth more potent than would have been the Union 's fleets and armies . Senator Sumner lived long enough to see sitting at Washington commissioners from Great Britain , chosen among the two great political parties of England , come to an agreement as regards the general clauses which were to put an end to the pending difficulties between // the two nations . And he helped to obtain the ratification by the United States Senate of the treaty of Washington , the first article of which contained the sincere expression of regret which England made in atonement for her conduct during the American civil war . Strange negotiation indeed , if thus it can be termed , and strange results also ! Public opinion may discuss them , enthusiasts may exaggerate their importance ; professional diplomatists may wilfully belittle them ; but let at least everyone observe , by comparing dates , that the mixed commission was being assembled at the State Department of the United States , at the very moment when triumphant Germany was rending from her vanquished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington was concluded by a few days before that of Frankfort . Mr. Sumner had conceived , in regard to the foreign affairs of his country , a general theory ; as I have very often heard him state it , I shall here trace its principal outline . Disinterested regarding what might occur in Europe , the American Union has already witnessed the downfall of well - nigh all the old colonial system ; a few years more , and the last European standard will have disappeared from the American Continent . England 's wise policy only prepares the advent of Canadian independence , and if until now a prudent hand has still maintained her domination over the Antilles , yet it is a question how long this status quo will last . But whatever may be the future of the British isles , at a small distance off lies that large Spanish dependency , Cuba , * where for years past blood has been flowing incessantly , rand where at any moment an outbreak may occur that shall determine the overthrow of Spanish dominion . Thus with patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada and in the Antilles . But he did not neglect the daily study of American growth of power on the Pacific coast . It would be interesting to read over his speech delivered in 1867 , on the purchase of Russian * This was written at the time of the Cuban insurrection . America . It was necessary , said he in it , to increase national sway over that immense coast . The day would probably come when emigration with the flow of its tide from east to west , would establish on that yet hardly inhabited slope the centre of an immense empire . In Mr. Sumner 's mind , it was in that direction that the United States would one day develop its power . But all the while , he did not cease warning his countrymen to proceed slowly , and to fear above all territorial annexations . His warnings in this respect amounted to personal resistance whenever the annexation of any of the Antilles or of the Mexican territories was spoken of . And it was precisely this political conviction which was to lead Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which he had so long toiled , and which owed him so much . The very day President Grant signed a treaty with a view to the annexation of the Dominican Republic to the United States , Mr. Sumner found himself placed in a most painful position . Was he to sacrifice to his party , and to the Administration , one of his most profound convictions ? Or , on the contrary , by opposing the ratification of this diplomatic agreement , was he to obey what he considered to be a most imperious duty , at the risk of breaking political ties which seemed indissoluble , and of renouncing personal friendships which time had cemented ? I was witness of the struggle . that preceded his determination . " Why can I not , " would he say at this moment of doubt and perplexity , " why can I not retire from political life ? Why have I yet so many sacred duties to perform , so many promises to keep regarding my poor darkies ? You see it , I can not forsake my wards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live , and there devote myself to a peaceful life and the culture of the arts . " However , Mr. Sumner , placed in presence of what he deemed to be his duty , resolved to perform it . He did so regardless of the peril he was incurring , and knowing well in advance that he was heaping up against himself implacable vengeance and wrath . But as soon as the old wrestler had resolved once // more to enter the arena , he was again able to display all his power . The speeches he delivered on the San Domingo question may be classed among his best . Although he was forced to strain himself in order to give his voice its former fulness and vigor , yet seldom did he produce greater effect upon the large audience which then filled the Senate chamber . He attacked directly the President 's policy regarding the Antilles , opposed with all his might the San Domingo annexation , and with profound emotion , although unflinchingly , he accused the official representatives of the United States of violating the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph . He struck a death-blow to the annexation plan ; the President himself was forced to retreat and abandon his cherished scheme . But how dear was this victory to cost him who had forced the executive power to give way ! This is not the place to relate the well-known events which ensued . Watching day by day their development , and following with anxious interest the painful incidents as they arose , I often thought whether the most despotic courts , whether the monarchies which have been the most declaimed against , have ever known anything more pitiful than the deeply hidden plots of which the greatest citizens of free republics may be the victims . While many supporters of the President , now interested opponents of Mr. Sumner , were pursuing him with their wrath , and were using against him all the weapons within their reach , the old leader , who had never known the force of intrigue , and who , owing to the idealistic turn of his mind , was totally unfit for an appreciation of base sentiments , still believed himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrown . What a wakening was his when the truth finally dawned upon him ! It was in the spring of 1872 ; he had protested in the most solemn manner against General Grant 's second nomiation for the presidency ; he had expressed himself with unrelenting sincerity regarding the President 's policy , and the Republican party , so long docile to his voice , chose General Grant for a second term , thereby disowning its old chieftain . Mr. Sumner remained alone . At that moment , as if joining in to aggravate his situation , his old illness , the same which had once before imperilled his life , attacked him again , and caused him most horrible sufferings . He had hoped , he wrote from Boston , to be able to assemble his fellow-citizens in Fancuil Hall , that venerable forum , in order to speak once more . to them of the great questions that relate to the country 's welfare ; but painful symptoms warned him not to attempt this effort . The speech he wished to deliver was given to the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with Mr. Sumner 's powerful oratorical efforts , deserve notwithstanding to be quoted ; the sentiments therein expressed will remain as the crowning work of his life , and will live also as an historical document . Casting his glance once more on the long-trodden path , the orator deemed , not without good reason , that his duty toward the enfranchised race was well-nigh fulfilled ; and he made one last appeal for reconciliation to the parties that had so long fought against each other . Protesting against any imputation of bitter feelings , he thus summed up his public life : " Such is the simple and harmonious record , showing how from the beginning I was devoted to peace , how constantly I longed for reconciliation , how with every measure of Equal Rights this longing found utterance-how it became an essential part of my life-how I discarded all idea of vengeance or punishment-how Reconstruction was to my mind a transition period , and how earnestly I looked forward to the day when , after the recognition of Equal Rights , the Republic should again be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ever maintained a policy of hate , I was never so minded ; and now , in protesting against any such policy , I only act in obedience to the irresistible promptings of my soul . " At the same time Mr. Sumner , whom his personal friends were anxious to tear away from the troubles of his pol // itical situation , and from the fatigue which endangered his life , consented to leave for Europe . In December following he returned to Washington . But by what sad circumstances his return was attended ! The Republican party publicly disowned him ; the commonwealth of Massachusetts , that had ever remained faithful to him , in turn also abandoned him . Furthermore the legislature , assembled in Boston , grasping a miserable pretence , publicly censured him . On the other hand , his physical sufferings were so intense that they had altered the strong expression of his features , and nearly deformed his stately bearing . A sad state and time this was , of which but very few of his friends were witnesses . At certain moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old athlete ; and yet his faith in the justice of his cause was so implicit , that even while stretched on his bed of suffering , where he was forced to pass most of his time , he would exclaim now and then : " I have but one enemy to contend with , and that is disease . Let it spare me a while , and I feel sure that soon it will become manifest that I was right . " But how could he defend himself now that his physical strength was so much exhausted that , during this whole sad winter , it was impossible for him to apply his mind to any constant work ? He even seemed uninterested in politics . Hardly did he even allude to them when speaking . In this state , but one consolation was left him and but one pastime : French literature that of our great epochs . " The Memoirs of St. Simon " awoke in him unceasing interest . The same with Voltaire , whose complete works he carefully reread He even went so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to our history of the last two centuries , the minute details of which he desired to study once more . In the early spring , however , his illness seemed to abate ; and while a work of re pair was going on in his physical organism , which seemed still so vigorous , public opinion was already recovering from its hasty judgments . Mr. Sumner 's vacant place had not been filled . The Senate missed in its discussions the presence of his great moral courage . The people of Massachusetts also began to regret its rash decisions ; a visible change was taking place , and in spite of vile efforts the general sentiment of the honest masses was coming back to Mr. Sumner . He lived long enough to see the Massachusetts legislature rescind the resolutions that the former legislature had adopted against him . The illustrious senator , who was now unable to add further to his fame , had a right , if we may say so , to witness this act of reparation . Providence justly ordained that it should be so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the United States Senate received official notification of the annulling of the resolutions of censure . Mr. Sumner enjoyed the satisfaction of being present at this ceremony . Hardly was it over , when he left the Senate chamber-far from thinking that it was for the last time . Two days later America learned that Charles Sumner was no more . On hearing the news , the whole country , which associated Mr. Sumner 's name with those of his most renowned contemporaries and friends , felt a thrill of pain . How could the nation fail to recall at that moment , Mr. Lincoln , Mr. Seward , and Mr. Chase ? How could it fail to understand that a great era was now closed ? And now * that Mr. Sumner 's seat is vacant in the liJuited States Senate , and that this last one of the great athletes of that epoch , after mourning for his former associates , has in turn followed them to the tomb , where the commonwealth of Massachusetts has just laid him , it remains to be seen whether the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Written in 1874.
