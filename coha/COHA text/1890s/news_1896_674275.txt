txt For some years , and up to a comparativelyrecent date , Mr. WILLIAM J. BRYAN vigorously opposed in and out of Congress the protectionist tariff policy , mainly upon the ground that it increased the prices of the necessaries of life and other commodities . Those prices , he contended , ought not thus to be increased . The farmers , he said , should enjoy the advantage to be derived from lower prices . His demand in those days for the repeal of legislation which increased the cost of the necessaries of life is curiously at variance with his arguments now for a very great addition to prices and his demand for legislation that shall bring about such an increase . He was accustomed to assert then that the farmer could be helped only by a re-. duction of the tariff tax upon the things which he must purchase , or by a bounty . In the House of Representatives he said , only two years and a half ago : " You can not help a farmer except by a bcunty , and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer can be aided only by a reduction of the taxes on what he buys . " I will not attempt to justify a bounty on anything . I believe it to be utterly indefensible in principle and vicious in practice . " Speech of Mr. BRYAN , Jan. 13 , 1894 . Congressional Record Appendix , Page 227 . The farmer could be helped , not by free coinage of silver that should double the price of his products and reduce his mortgage by one-half , but only by a redtiction of the prices of things bought by him , or by a bounty , which Mr. SATAN then regarded as " utterly indfensible In principle and vicious in practice , " although he urged in his speech at 1 Madison Square that no one ought to complain about the bounty which the ? free coinage of silver would bestow upon the . owners of silver mines . No one should " be deterred , " he remarked then , " because an incidental benefit will come to the mine owner " as the result of his promised immediate increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounce , measured by gold . " Mr. BRYAN 'S opinions two years and a half ago concerning the influences and conditions which determine the prices of American grain were also at variance with those he holds now . In the House , on Jan. 13 , 1894 , he said : " The export price of wheat in 1891 was 93 cents a bushel ; in , 1892 , $1.03 , and in 1893 , SO cents . The export price of cornmeal and wheat flour rose in 1892 and fell in 1893 . The high price of certain agricultural products , as every one knows , was due to the short crops abroad . * * * These figures show that the price received for the great staples of agriculture in the United States depends upon the price in foreign markets . " " They the Republicans tried to blind the eyes of the farmers by raising the tariff on the great articles of export , whose price , fixed in foreign markets , can not be raised or lowered by a tariff imposed upon them here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional Record Appendix , pp. 224 and 226 . He was not then pointing to an alleged uniformity in the decline of the prices of wheat and silver , and the fact that the price of American wheat is fixed in foreign markets was clearly perceived by him . No reference to an " appreciation of gold " as the cause of a decline or to debasement of the currency as a remedy . Mr. BRYAN also expressed in Congress his opinion as to the cause of the fall of prices . We have heretofore quoted a part of the following paragraph , which is published in The Congressional Record under the headline , " What Reduces Prices , " written by the orator himself : " You must attribute it the reduction of the price of certain products of manufacture to the inventive genius that has multiplied a thousand times , in many instances , the strength of a single arm , and enabled us to do to-day with one man what fifty men could not do fifty years ago . That is what has brought the price down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective tariff helping it , it has stood as a bar and prevented us. step by step , from taking advantage of the inventive genius of other countries . It has compelled us , each time and all the time , when it has benefited a protected industry , to pay more for those same things than the people elsewhere . " Speech of Mr. BRYAN , March 16. 1892 , Congressional Record , Vol. 23 , p. 2,363 , daily edition . Mr. BRYAN was not willing then that protective duties or any other artificial restraint should interfere with that progressive lowering of the cost of the necessaries of life which has been caused chiefly by the application of inventive genius to manufacturing and agricultural processes and to transportation problems . But now " inventive genius " has been displaced in his mind by " appreciation of gold " and " robber syndicates . " Now he would make " the common people " happy by doubling the cost of those products by which life is sustained and taking away half of the value of their invested savings .
