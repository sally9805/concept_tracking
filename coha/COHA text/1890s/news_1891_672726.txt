txt Several members of the Executive Committee of the Republican National Committee , which is to meet to-morrow , were in New-York last night , and their presence created a good deal of talk as to the business which will come before that body . A. L Conger of Ohio , who had just come from an interview with Mr. Blaine at Bar Harbor , was at the Fifth Avenue Hotel , as was J. Bloat Fassett , the Secretary of the committee . W. W. Dudley , the Treasurer of the National Republican Committee , was in the city for a few hours , though he registered atno hotel and made an effort to keep out of sight . The meeting of the committee promises to be full of interesting business . One of the leading topics of discussion , after the question of resignations has been disposed of , will be the linen cial condition of the national organization . The question of reimbursing those members of the committee who made up the shortage at the oloseaf the last campaign , it is said , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? solution of the problem of how to do this may be annoying . The shortage has been variously estimated at from $40,000 to $100,000 . Fifty thousand is said to be very near the precise amount . This amount was made up by Quell ' , Con ger , Clarkson , Dudley , and one or two others . Under the system of assessments , which has been attributed to the genius of Postmaster General Wanamaker ; a portion of this was raised and Mr. Quay has been paid health 's part of the contribution . Mr. Dudley has also been thoughtful enough to reimburse himself in part . The others want their share now , and the committee will try to devise some means of raising enough to square accounts with them . There has been some question as to where this meeting will be held . Some of the die . patches have said Philadelphia and the Continental Hotel and others have said Washington and the Arlington . Clarkson said Philadelphia last week . When Mr. Fassett ' was asked which was right he said ' that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as he regarded the matter as a confidential one at present he should have to refuse to give any information as to the place . He would simply say that the meeting would be held to-morrow . Asked as to what topics would be discus s ed by the Executive Committee . he said : " I suppose that naturally the topic that will . come in for the main attention will be the calling together of the General Committee to fix a. date and place for the next Republican National Convention . As to the rumors about resignations from the committee I have no informan tion , and I do not think there is anything in that talk . " Speaking of the forthcoming campaign in this State , he said that the Republican who could win would be a man who could get the honest Support of all Republicans . If the Republican vote can be got out the Republican candidate for Governor could be elected without the aid of any converts from the Democracy . Mr. Fassett still adheres to his opinion that no one but David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Dudley was in conversation with officials of the Republican League of Clubs for part of his stay . He said that he would not be interviewed on the business of the committee . When asked if he proposed to resign his position as Treasurer , he said that he did not inland to do so . That was all be had to say on the subject . Mr. Conger was emphatic in his Statements as to the good health of Secretary Blaine . It is only four or five days since Mr. Conger was in New-York , and gave utterance to some strong Blaine sentiments . He was of the opinion that Secretary Blaine could have the nomination . if he wanted it . His visit to Bar Harbor just oir the hour almost of the meeting of the Executive Committee is regarded as significant . There will be a great deal of Blaine sentiment at the meeting wherever it be held . Mr. Clarkson has been lately accused of being strongly tinctured with It . Mr. Conger has practically declared himself for Blaine . Henry C. Payne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Blaine could have the nomination , probably , if he wanted it . M. H. D. Young of California , another of the committee , is counted on to express the sentiment of his State . J. M. Haines of Maine , also a member of the committee , is not likely to forgot what State he hails from . ? Other members of the committee are G. A. Hobart of New-Jersey , Samuel Fessenden of Connecticut , John O. New of Indiana , who can not be presentafaourse ; J. Bloat Fassett , W. P. Campbell of Illinois , Mr. Cuney of Texas , and Mr. Quay . With so many admirers of Mr. Blaine and a recent report from CoL Conger , the informal talk in the committee room will be interesting to those who are considering the probabilities for next year . A TIMES reporter last night asked CoL Conger how he had found the Secretary . I found the old man in splendid shape , " he said . Where will the meeting of the committee be held I " I have not seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a note from Senator Quay , in which the place was given as Philadelphia . I had not understood that any change was contemplated . Mr. Fassett and Mr. Quay have authority to name the place , and of course it would be possible to change it on short notice if it were desirable . My mail has been ordered to Philadelphia , so that it a change had been made and notice had been sent me . I should not have recalved it at this time . "
