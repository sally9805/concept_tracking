txt The extraordinary vitality displayed by Walter Duryea , who has been for the last five months in Roosevelt Hospital , is causing renewed astonishment to the many physicians and surgeons who are watching his case . Mr. Duryea , who is a son of a well-known manufacturer , broke his neck last Summer at Glen Cove while diving into shallow water . On being taken to Roosevelt Hospital he underwent an operation which was widely discussed by medical men . Some weeks ago Mr. Duryea developed symptoms of pneumonia . He passed through this crisis , and a fortnight ago the physicians determined that another operation was necessary . It was realized that there was only one chance in twenty that the operation would be successful and that it was more than probable that it would be fatal . Mr. Duryea and his father both , however , consented to it . and it was performed . Whether the operation will prove to be successful , so far as bringing the young man back to health is concerned , can not yet be told . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock and has been pronounced out of immediate danger . He is stilt completely paralyzed , and as helpless as an infant , but his brain has not been greatly affected . He is subject to occasional illusions , which are somewhat similar to those suffered by persons afflicted with delirium tremens . The physicians at the hospital said Yesterday that it was impossible to tell what the outcome of the treatment adopted in this case may be . There is a remote chance that Mr. Duryea may recover , but it is more likely that he will remain in his present condition until his death . That , it was said , may occur in thirty days or thirty years . Inquiry late last night at the hospital elicited the information that the condition of Mr. Duryea was unchanged .
