txt ORSES are like babies - chiefly interesting to their owners . Occasionally they emerge from the enclosure of home life , an d become interesting to other people . One in a billion may find his way into print . But most rare are the horses whose characters are worthy of record . The one of which I write comes a step nearer to humanity in this , that a shadow of mystery falls upon his life and end . He belonged to the Fremont Hussars ; but how he came into the regiment , no man could tell . It was in September , 1861 , and the regiment , not yet completed , was in camp near St. Louis . Newly built sheds for horses and newly pitched tents for men lay in parallel lines , and around the encampment ran the high fence of the " Abbey Race Track . " In this , the first flush of war , recruits poured in , a daily stream ; and another stream , the troopers ' horses , came flowing from the Government corrals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenly together ; sometimes the men were in excess , sometimes the horses . But whenever there was a surplus of the latter , although the mass , *% . The story here printed is not fiction , although , as the reader will perceive , it is as improbable a story of a horse as was ever written . All of the facts actually occurred ; the most improbable event in the narrative was duly substantiated by legal evidence at the time , and this evidence has been submitted to the editor . The author is one of the seniors of our Federal judges ; the commanding officer of the regiment first referred to was colonel George E. waring , the well-known sanitary engineer ; and another witness of the incidents narrated was colonel James F. Dwight , recently one of the assignees in bankruptcy and a well-known member of the New York bar . would remain the same , there would be a strange disintegration of the particles .

For the Fremont Hussars consisted largely of German veterans who knew a thing or two of soldiering and horses , and who held thjit the best of troopers would be useless to the cause of freedom unless he were well mounted . Wherefore , as the " reserved mounts " grew nightly worse , the six mounted companies appeared daily better . Such fine horses they rode ; all so healthy and sound . " Yhy are our horses so goot ? Yhy , pecause ye take so goot care of tem . " One could not help liking these kind-hearted Dutchmen . But when the seventh company came to be mounted out of the " reserve mounts , " then there was awful swearing to be heard in the land-storms of harsh consonants-cataracts of Dutch oaths . And then the men already mounted , like disinterested patriots seeking to throw oil on the troubled waters , would address the to-be-mounted in calm and soothing words which pointed toward future arrivals of horses for future recruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made " all richt . " Whereupon , the exasperated , with glances thrown toward the distant Government corral , and an ominous Germanic jerk of the head expressive of much inward resolve , would say to all concerned , " Never mindt , never mindt . " In this state of equine affairs , a newly mustered captain of the regiment awaiting // the arrival of his own private horses , and needing a temporary mount , looked despondingly through the reserve , and found no horse which it would become " an officer and gentleman " to ride . As he stood negotiating the purchase of a cheap animal from a brother officer , a sergeant came up , and said that there was a well-appearing horse in the ninth shed , a horse that no one seemed to own . The party walked around to the shed , and at one end of it , with three or four of the rejected " rats " of the regiment , found a large chestnut sorrel , in appearance much above the average of troopers ' horses . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of in some of the six companies ' stables , was the first question . The sergeant had observed him standing there for three days past ; one man believed he had been rejected by a Prussian veteran as too rough a trotter ; another that he had thrown his rider ; but no one really knew anything about him . The inspecting officers of the regiment chanced to be lounging near , and they averred that they had never inspected the horse . But he bore the regimental brand and stood in the regimental stables . As the party approached the horse , the captain was struck with his breadth of forehead and dark , sinister eye . The sergeant also noticed the latter , for he immediately said , " That 's a wicked eye he has . " The horse quickly turned his head toward the sergeant and looked at him steadily with a mild , contemplative expression ; the remainder of the party said they saw nothing wicked about him . As they waited for a saddle to be brought , the horse yawned , stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been half cut off , i.e. , about mid-way in the tongue were the remains of a deep gash which had nearly severed it in two , and now left the lower half of a peninsula connected only by a narrow isthmus with the main continent . The saddle came and an Austrian officer mounted . He was a noble of the " blue blood , " on leave of absence , and a captain of the Hussars . He rode with the stiff , straight leg of a Continental cavalry officer , erect and commanding above the saddle ; awkward and unbe-i coming below-an unyielding seat , exacting and wearisome to man and beast . But like eli of the Prussian and Austrian officers , he understood his business thoroughly , and when a trooper could not manage his horse on drill , it was his way to order the man to dismount and ride the refractory animal for him . Under his easy hand , the horse he was now trying appeared much better than when in the stable , moving off in a free , bold trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which English painters love to sketch trotting to the " meet , " the red coat bending forward and rising in the stirrups with every stride . His trot was , indeed , a trifle too high and rough for a McClellan saddle and a " hard - riding " seat ; but nothing to reject a good horse for ; and there was a superior gallop with long and steady stride and hoof-beats falling regular as clock-work . There was no shying , starting , or stumbling ; he was neither restive nor lazy ; he moved quietly and freely ; he was just the horse that an officer would choose for the daily drill ; and the only objection that appeared was that he was not an easy horse " to ride hard . " " To ride hard " doubtless means to many an American , to ride furiously . In fact , it is the distinguishing term between the rising and falling , easy seat of the English gentleman , and the fixed , immovable seat of the English officer . When the Duke of Wellington was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a general ? " he answered : " As long as he is able to see to everything himself and ride hard . " In this topsy-turvy world of ours , there is a wonderful compliance of things to their conditions . All men have " builded better than they knew , " if they have but built at all . It may be laid down as a general law of transportation , that whenever good carriage-ways are built the horseman dismounts . He mounts again for parade or pleasure , for exercise or excitement ; but his transportation business he evermore will do on wheels . The English are an exception to the rule . They travel in the saddle , they ride to market , to Parliament , to their counting-houses , to their hunting meets . They ride twenty miles to lunch , and twenty back to dinner ; and they // ride upon hard highways and smooth macadam roads . Generations of experience have taught them that the steady trot and shifting seat are the movements of the united horse and man , which yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ease with the least degree of strain . The trooper with his sabre , and the cow-boy with his lasso , can not surrender the free activity of body and arm . They must always be in the saddle . In the deep prairie grass the trotter loses his feet , and the cowboy rides upon an easy lope . The trooper must ride at all gaits , and hence he must " ride hard . " The Austrian dismounted and spoke well of the horse . So did the small crowd of horse-critics , officers and men , that gathered round him . For your horse is a leveller in society ; and in the stable gentlemen and jockey grow familiar , without contempt , in a common enthusiasm ; and in the cavalry camp , officers and men mingle around the leveller , whose best judge , for the time , is the best man  --  the authority of highest rank . So this horse , which had been dozing for days amid six hundred sharp-eyed horsemen-each in want of a better horse than he had-seemed suddenly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horse had not been bitted ; he was not " bridle-wise , " and knew but one meaning in his rider 's spur . And there was no time to train him , for the " Department of the West " was a beehive then , without drones . The untaught officers from civil life 's quiet ignorance had not time to train themselves . There was drilling of men , inspecting of horses , beseeching ordnance officers for arms , imploring quartermasters for clothing . Matchless was the zeal and the industry that reigned in every camp during " Fremont 's hundred days . " Yet in the turmoil of the time , this horse seemed to learn by looking on , and , at the end of a week , to know everything . The slightest touch of the rein upon his neck , the mere motion of the rider 's hand , the gentlest pressure of the leg , would wheel him without the use of bit or bridle . So imperceptible were the means employed , that some who watched him thought that he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " left turn " at the mere word . It was observed that this horse seemed to delight in drilling-in drilling , not being drilled . It was as the captain 's horse , out of the ranks and viewing the unhappy condition of his kind , that he was happy . For , as the " coach* ' of a boat 's crew is properly on the outside of the boat , so the instructor of cavalry is always on the outside of his squad . He moves but little , and the men in their evolutions revolve around him . Occasionally he changes his position , but then halts to command , and explain , and criticise . When the captain thus halted , and the reins were dropped , and the new horses in the ranks were crowding and kicking , and fretting , and sweating , then would this one 's sinister eye glow with Satanic joy . When the squadron passed before him on the gallop , and dull horses were being pricked up by spurs , and fiery colts wrenched back by curbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and plant his fore-feet well in front and stretch his legs , and body , and long neck , and deep jaws , with such exquisite enjoyment as the sight of misery might give the animal with the cloven hoof and tail , from the stable below . If it were regimental drill , and he was denied the sweets of contemplation , then would he take his place in front of the line or beside the column , and move with the regularity of a machine , indifferent to the existence of all other horses . He never became excited ; he never showed the ineradicable desire of his kind to race ; he led down deep descents with no increase of speed , and up sharp acclivities without " losing distance ; " he did not swerve a hair 's breadth for a huge heap of broken stones , but mounted and traversed it at his measured trot . But when the hours of drill were over , and sounding bugles , and shouting drill-officers , and charging squadrons were gone , and the prairie was deserted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable and seek to follow his mates , then a wild excitement would sometimes fall upon this one , and he would rear , and plunge , and kick , and gallop around and around like an escaping colt . // The horse was not long in acquiring a name . At first , he was known as " The Drill Sergeant , " but there was soon a new development of character in which , as has been the case with many notable characters , he succeeded in making a name for himself . The afternoon drill was over , the October sun was sinking through the golden haze , and the captain , with his friend D. , was sauntertag from the drill ground to their quarters . It chanced that they came upon a young officer trying to force his newly bought horse up to some bloody hides that hung upon a fence beside the road . They volunteered a precept or two as they passed ; but precepts are mere blank cartridges , worth nothing without the projectile of example . The young officer understood the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish that the " Drill Sergeant " might be ridden up to the fence , and he and his colt be shown , not told , how to do it . D. had dismounted then and sent his horse to the stable , but he applauded the lieutenant 's sentiment , and said that it was perfectly fair ; nothing , he thought , could be more reasonable , and he really hoped it would not be passed by unnoticed . The captain touched the " Drill Sergeant 's " neck slightly with the rein , who with veteran-like gravity , turned and advanced toward the fence . The captain was sitting loungingly in the saddie , with an air of easy listlessness , one foot playing with the stirrup , the reins hanging loose upon the pommel . He was thinking that the " Drill Sergeant " would march on until his breast touched the fence , and he was intending to say that if young officers would train their colts first , and acquire a moral control over them , they might ride them up to bloody hides also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give utterance to the precept , when there was a bolt which seemed to him a small earthquake-a bolt rearward , roundward , upward , downward , and he found himself some thirty feet distant , and the " Drill Sergeant " standing placidly again in the middle of the road . The rider was not unhorsed , as he confessed he deserved to have been . Without knowing how , he had kept himself on the " Drill Sergeant 's " back , who was now , as has been said , standing placidly in the road . The young officer promptly seized his opportunity and said , sarcastically , that he had expected to be shown how to do it-he added seriously that the captain had better not try it again , for that horse was a wicked one , and the " rock road " with its loose , broken stone , a bad place for a fall . D. blandly interposed , and thought differently . He thought the captain had better try it again-when surprised , he had not been thrown , and now that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D. added that there was nothing more delightful than to witness a contest between the intelligence of man and the power of a brute . It did him good , he said . Besides , we cavalry officers should not mind a fall ; we must get used to them . The captain righted himself in the saddle and gathered up the reins . He had been preaching that with horses things should be done slowly and persistently : but as mutiny in officers is worse than mutiny in privates , even so , bolting by a trained and sedate horse is worse than bolting by an impulsive colt , and must be dealt with summarily . The captain turned the " Drill Sergeant " again toward the fence ; again he advanced freely , and again , before the rider could find time or excuse for driving the spurs into him , there was the same rearward , roundward bolt , and they were standing in the middle of the road . D. applauded highly and said that , if desired , he would " certify on honor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world . He added that he honestly thought that the captain had better try it again ; it was so very entertaining . The captain and the horse , externally , were calm ; but their two wills had crossed . As the horse turned for the third time toward the fence , a philosopher looking on would have asked whether in that brute body there was not some predeterminate resolve whether the mouth with the bit in it was not more tigiitly shut , and the mane-covered forehead was not contracted and knit ; whether the angry light that began to break from the eyes was not radiant from some angry soul w // within . But here the cunning of the human intellect appeared and took its part in the game-that cunning which , when applied to the movements of contending armies , we call strategy-that covert ally which the brute did not possess . As the horse moved forward to the fence , but ere the bolting point was reached , the rider 's spurs came biting fiercely upon his flanks , driving him forward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fence whither he would not go . Then the horse became a fury , and his dark , sinister eyes turned bloody red . The rider 's knees gripped the saddle more closely , and his arms grew stronger to bend the strong neck of the animal and to rein around his defiant head ; but as the fight grew hot , his cunning ally fled the field and the contest became more equal-strategy no longer took a part in the struggle ; it was skill and strength against strength and skillthe sharp sting of the spurs , the iron hoofs beating on rocks and stones-each creature intuitively knowing and resisting every act of the other , neither of them gaining or losing an inch  --  the one no nearer his goal , the other unable to fling off his warring burden . But it was a battle without result ; the bugle sounded the " retreat ; ** the king of the tournament dropped his warder ; the heralds proclaimed a truce . D. said it was delightful , charming , but that we must go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the morning . That evening , at the mess dinnertable , the battle was discussed . ID . was glowing in his description and declared that the " Drill Sergeant " should be named " Tarquinius Superbus . " The majority thought differently and named him " Animus Furiosus , " and after that they called him " Animus " for short . The following morning promised to be fateful , but the battle was not renewed . It is the unexpected that happens in war . On the one hand , the hides were gone ; on the other , Animus walked serenely up to the fence , rested his neck upon it , looked blandly over with ears inquiringly erect and eyes , for the moment , as innocent as a dove 's . Innocent he continued to appear , obliging , sensible , and grave , but in his heart of hearts was brewing a storm of resentment and revenge . A week or two passed in peace , and then came a day whereon the company to which Animus belonged was to be mustered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column to the mustering officer 's official abode , he ( and the mustering officer ) alone unruffled , unexcited . His rider proud and exultant whenever he glanced back at the ninety splendid young fellows who rode behind . A splendid company it was , splendidly mounted , and as the tramping hoofs resounded through the streets of St. Louis , the two sets of hearts beat faster , and troopers and steeds seemed equally elate . There is an earthly satisfaction in the human breast that none but the trooper knows ; when the cavalry cap works itself jauntily over , inclining toward the right ear with a saucy pitch forward toward the right eye , requiring the head to be held a little back , and the chin to be drawn a little in , and the chest to be thrown a little out ; when the clattering scabbard , the jingling spurs , the champed bit , unite forces with the prancing , sympathetic vanity of the horse ; when the eyes that wo n't stay " front , " but " right " and " left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares , but in gay , half-audacious , half-deferential glances ! Oh , reader , when you see the troopers in Washington swaggering about the Army headquarters , envy them , for you know not ( unless you have been a trooper ) " how good " that swagger makes them feeL Through the streets of St. Louis , Animus led , profoundly indifferent to the citizens around him ; coolly disdainful of the ninety fretting , fuming steeds behind . The " fours " formed platoons , and the platoons wheeled into line , with a precision that must have made the calloused mustering officer think himself back at West Point . And then there came two girls , pretty and young , with smiling , sympathetic loyal faces , in whom the trooper 's saucy airs took the form of pretty timidity ; and they stopped and hesitated , and almost came forward , and partly turned back , and seemed to say that their important business did really // require them to go immediately straight onward down the street , but that they positively could never dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses ; and then the captain of the company-as became the captain of such a company - sought to move himself a trifle farther from the sidewalk and throw a chivalrous yard or two of safety to the timorous damsels ; and then Animus flared up . He had a crooked , Roman nose , had Animus , and a forehead that receded and rounded toward the ears ; he was goodlooking in a horseman 's , and not in a lady 's , sense of the term ; and when his eyes turned red and his lips opened and showed white frothy teeth , I have no doubt but that this head of his looked much like a wild eagle 's head on a horse 's body . The two girls screamed and beat a retreat without any more pretty hesitation , and the rider 's blood boiled up at the excuseless conduct , and he rowelled the horse with his burnished spurs and beat him with the flat of his polished sabre . The horse seemed frantic ; he dashed against the brick walls of the houses ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trice ; he banged against front-steps and lamp-posts , and sent an aged cobbler fleeing through the back door of his poor , little shop ; and he plunged and beat his hoofs upon the cellar door as if he meant immediately to go by that route to the place below . Then he stopped-suddenly - instantaneously-not quenched or quaiing , but as if the fight then and there were but ammunition wasted , and he had better save the captain for a better opportunity . And after the affair was over , there came a strong conviction in the rider 's mind that the horse might have done more , but would not ; and friends began to advise that he should not keep that beast for service ; for , they said , if one of his wild moods should come in action , it would be certain death to the man who rode him . Again Animus lapsed into quiet working ways , biding his time to throw contempt at men and things . An opportunity came one fine Sunday , when there was a grand review at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers had seen a field of thousands , and to them the pageant seemed magnificent . If now , when artillery was thundering , and infantry presenting arms , and a dozen regimental bands were playing their loudest , this horse should rear and pitch as half the horses in the line were doing , it would not be unreasonable , and indeed would be attributed to commendable high spirit . The captain was thinking more of his company than of his horse , and indeed gave him no thought , till the general and his staff came down the line . Then , as the important moment approached when each individual volunteer knew that he must look his best , and all eyes were " to the front , " and every man sitting erect , then he glanced down to see how Animus would take it , and in his astonishment whispered to D. ( who was next on the officers ' line ) , and nodded at the horse . D. looked out of the corners of his eyes ( his nose being straight to the front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and then he turned red as though he were choking , and shook with laughter as if he might fall off his horse ; for then , as the gorgeous staff swept by , and the regimental bands blew their loudest blasts , and everybody was all excitement and otherhorses were well-nigh crazed-then Animus had composedly crossed his fore-legs like the legs of a saw-buck , and had dropped his ears back upon his neck like the ears of a rabbit , and had calmly shut his eyes and serenely sunk into counterfeit slumber . But malice still reigned in the heart of Animus , and while he did his work with a gravity above horses , he never let slip an opportunity to do damage . One gloomy morning after the company had been moved from the Abbey Track into Benton Barracks , when rain had been falling and freezing all night and none but a sharp-shod horse could keep his feet , Animus was brought up to the quarters . The orderly had not dared to bring both horses together over the slippery ground , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the piazza . Animus did not mind being hitched ; he had been hitched to that post a hundred times , where he would shut his eyes and doze by the hour . Around the corner of another range of // barracks stood an infantry regiment in line , and the sergeants could be heard calling their rolls . Nothing disturbed the horse , for nobody was stirring that morning , but the instant the orderly was out of sight , he began to pull violently at the halter . The red eyes were upon him , and the piazza post to which he was hitched was a contending foe . It gave way at the roof and broke off at the floor . It was a stout 4 by 5 inch joist , twelve feet long , and as an anchor would have brought an ordinary horse round " head to the wind ; " and an ordinary horse breaking loose on a cold rainy day , if he had made off with it in tow , would have headed for his stable . Animus turned in an opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose near to the ground , scoured off as fast as he could go , the joist skimming like a sled over the icy glare . He headed for the barracks , behind which was the infantry regiment , and all who saw him prayed devoutly that when he should turn the corner he would lose his footing , and fall and break his infernal neck . He did not , and as the heavy joist swung from centrifugal force almost up to an alignment with the horse , everyone thought that the infernal machine , like a Roman chariot with scythes on the axles , must mow down at least twenty men . But the infantry , when the tornado of horse and timber came rushing around the corner , broke ranks faster than the " double quick , " and the joist merely grazed a number of heroic shins . Then Animus , seeing that he had failed in his diabolical , or rebel design , halted , was caught and brought back , looking both innocent and unconcerned . But we must omit some of the incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the dreariness of winter and of barrack-life among strangers and sick and home-sick men , the greatest of blessings was a day 's escape from the camp . It came occasionally in the guise of some duty to be done in the city , and one lucky morning , a coveted " pass " reached the captain 's quarters . The orderly brought up the horses , and his happening to be lame , he rode Animus . A merry , active , light-hearted German boy was the orderly ; familiar , yet never presumptuous ; scrupulous and rigid in the punctilious respect he always paid to his captain . None but a German could unite so much familiar ease with so much ceremonious deference . Unbidden , he held bit and stirrup as the officer mounted ; untaught he " took distance " behind him and never varied from his respectful place . If the captain 's horse trotted , his trotted ; if the captain 's galloped , his galloped ; and never had the captain given the orderly command or hint . He had been quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should ceremoniously pay his officer , and was proud to pay it . But suddenly there came from the orderly a blast of Dutch execration ; he was almost out of the saddle , and Animus about to finish the job . The captain sung out sharply to the horse , who stopped instantly , and the orderly climbed back and recovered his seat . For more than three months had the orderly taken care of Animus , and more than three hundred times had he ridden him bare - back to water . He could not account for this freak now . " Tee horse go quiet-I no do anything , and then he throw me off most ; " and there came mingling terms of indignation and reproach addressed privately to Animus in smothered German . The city , after the camp , seemed civilization , cleanliness , decency , comfort a warm bath and an arm-chair luxuries too great for times of war . The captain entered Barnum 's Hotel with such a loving feeling as no hotel can kindle again . And the cheery proprietors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick officer 's blessing rests upon them-they seemed angels in disguise , with the difference that instead of seeking entertainment , they entertained . The captain found a friend at the hotel and they dined together in the ladies ' ordinary ; and the ladies appeared divinely graceful after one had seen , for weeks , nothing but men in stiff Quaker coats , dyed blue , with a row of brass buttons down the front . And after dinner the two friends smoked and talked , and felt so at ease , by their two selves , with no dense throng around them ; but part they must , for the lieutenant had been ill-lucky dog  --  and had a week 's // leave , and was not to go back to the barracks that night . When eight o'clock came the captain pulled on his overcoat , bade good-night , and with slow , reluctant steps , went down into the street . The orderly , true to a minute , was coming with the horses , riding the captain 's mare , to keep the saddle dry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blowing a gale and snow beating fiercely down . The captain pulled up his coat - collar and mounted ; the orderly swung himself into his own saddle , and off they went through deserted streets , and dark , bleak suburbs . But as they passed from the lights of the town into the gloom beyond , Aniinns again made one of his savage bolts , and again the orderly was half out of the saddle and clinging by the mane . The captain sung out to the horse as before , and the horse , as before , obeyed and stopped . They rode fast , they rode slowly , but again and again and again this performance was repeated ; the orderly never quite unhorsed , the horse always stopping the instant he was commanded . At length they reached the camp . As the captain dismounted at his quarters , he gave a reluctant , a delicate intimation to the orderly that it would be wise to dismount and lead the horses to the stable . The orderly , who was well-nigh in tears at Animus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was ; and he pleaded , with German vehemence , that the whole company would laugh at him and " the boys " would shout whenever they saw him : " Where 's the man who could n't ride his own horse to the barn ? " which they would . He also urged that he could ride any horse in the world , and that no horse in the world would " cut up " at the end of a day 's work , when his accustomed groom was taking him to his accustomed stable . The last argument seemed reasonable , and indeed the original suggestion began to appear absurd . The captain , in unspoken words , yielded the point ; the orderly wheeled the horses and moved off , riding the one and leadingthe other . A shadowy sense of coming catastrophe kept the captain at his door , watching them until he saw horses and horseman turn the corner of the barracks and disappear . Then he unpadlocked the door and lighted his candle . A small room roughly boarded off from the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rough army blankets , a " mess-chest table , " a camp chair , a spare saddle , and horse-trappings , a fireless stove , an atmosphere laden with the dust and noise and stale tobacco - smoke of the men 's quarters . The captain and his company were then the victims of a combination between unscrupulous political selfishness , on the one side , and arbitrary military power , on the other - a doubly dangerous union ; for military power is bad enough alone , and needs to be restrained and guided by honor and impartiality . The company had been stolen from the regiment in which all had enlisted , and been taken to help make up a new command for somebody 's son-in-law . Hence , at this time , the captain was friendless and alone . He did not unbutton his overcoat nor kindle his fire , but paced up and down the narrow room , thinking at first of the horse , and then of Barnum 's , and then of home . He thought and walked and walked and thought until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pain and mortification and truthful resolve struggled in the lines of his face . " Cap-c-tan , tee horse trow me ; he run away in the fair grounds , he jump over a pile of wood . I hay look-ed and look-ed , and can no find him . " What infernal imp had possessed this strange animal ? The orderly was a good rider , a good groom , possessed of great power over horses . Others would follow him without bridles , like dogs . Why had this brute flung him off on the instant that he turned toward his own stable , and then galloped off into the darkness and the storm ? When the orderly shot out of the saddle , the captain 's mare had gone straight to her own stall in the stable . The orderly got a lantern and led the way to the place where he was unhorsed , at the end of the barracks-thence and across the wide expanse of the parade , and into the Fair Grounds and to a pile of corded wood , five feet at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would choose to rush at such a leap on a dark night and with slippery , snowy footing-at such a needless leap ? But by the light of the lantern could be seen a horse 's trail which led up to the wood - pile , broke off , and reappeared on the other side . They resumed the search . The trail led through the grove of the Fair Grounds , and at last was lost in the deepening snow . As the searchers stopped , the storm roared through the swaying branches above them as if the powers of the air were on the blast , and the horse had gone to meet them . The captain and the orderly came back into the encampment , where a soldier , plodding through the snow , told them that he had just seen a horse near by . They resumed their quest , and soon found Animus standing within the shelter of an empty tent . But on the snowy floor beneath him was a small red pool , and on his right flank , between the body and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in carving the leg of a fowl - a " clean cut , " and large enough for one to lay in it his hand , wide-spread . Animus looked morose and stern-not sad or repentant . He was led to hisstable and the regimental farrier came , who brought other regimental farriers in consultation , just as humanity 's farriers come and consult over human victims . " Extraordinary , " they all pronounced the wound , and without a precedent ; and they all vouchsafed theories , but agreed on none ; and finally they all concluded that nothing could be done  --  the patient must be abandoned to nature and cooling washes , and his " chances . " A fortnight later , when the wound was at its worst , and the horse was standing , day and night , upon three legs , great news came roaring , and yelling , and hurrahing through Camp Benton-news of victory-of the first decisive victory of the war ; that Foote had taken Fort Henry with his " Tin-Clads , " that the river was open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later came more significant news for some- " The Fifth Iowa Cavalry will march instantly . " It takes a new regiment in barracks at least twelve hours to " march instantly . " Rations to be cooked , tents to be overhauled ( the guys gnawed by suspected mice , the pegs burnt by unsuspected criminals ) , men swearing that their horses must be shod , blacksmiths swearing that their forges must be packed , mules seditiously kicking the harness to pieces the moment they hear that they are to be put to some practical purpose ; every man suddenly discovering that somebody has jayhawked his boots or his blanket ; and the quarter-sergeant discovering that the boots are packed and loaded , and the blankets too few to go round ; lieutenants and sergeants , corporals and men excitedly rushing to their captain in their individual perplexity ; the captain for a time the unhappy mother of a distracted family , that wants everything and does n't know what it does n't want ; finally , the sergeant - major of the regiment , coming round every hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regiment is ready and waiting for this one , and that the colonel wants to know how much longer they must wait , etc . The turmoil lasted during the night , but as the sun came up o'er the smoky city , the column moved ; and the hoofbeats on the frozen ground and rumbling baggage wagons rolled out a farewell to Benton Barracks . The captain , then a member of a court-martial sitting at the Barracks , could not march with his men , and had to remain until the formal order should come dissolving the court . With an impatient heart he stood watching the long-drawn column wind around the parade and pass through the gateway of the camp , and saw , last of all , the orderly disappear leading his own blanketed horses . Then he turned and handed a " pass " to his servant , and gave him directions to lead Animus slowly to the " sick stable . " The " company stable " was but a stone 's throw distant from where they stood , and only a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the company horses had been led out , leaving the wounded horse the only tenant of the long shed . Moodily he had continued to gaze at his // manger , giving to his departing mates barely a glance , but neither whinny nor regret . The man took the " pass " and went directly to the shed . In the first moment , when all eyes were withdrawn , Animus had disappeared . " Disappeared but not lost , " everyone said ; for barracks and stables were enclosed by a wooden wall , twelve feet high and guarded by sentinels , and through the only exit no one could go without a " pass , ** and the guards at the gate were notified to stop him , thief and all . Moreover , the horse had not set his lame leg to the ground for a fortnight , and it was doubted whether he could hobble on three to the sick stable . Besides , who would want a disabled animal , not fit for service now , nor for months to come ; and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight a noticeable object , that a thousand men would see and remember ? The camp was searched-searched for two days through every stable , tent , and shed that could hold a horse . The case was stated to every cavalry commander and his word of honor pledged that , if the horse were " hidden away " by any one of " his boys , " no matter what their genius for hiding horses away might be , he should nevertheless be found and given up . A reward was offered , and Animus was described by his peculiar regimental brand and tongue and wound ; and the advertisement was posted in every quarter-master office and corral , and livery-stable . Finally a shrewd , quiet man was set at work as detective ; and , six months later , the captain , piqued by all his failures , went back to St. Louis and himself tried to find a clue to the mystery . No clue was found . Animus had disappeared ; that was what was said at first , and all that could be said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be sung of him as of Thomas the Rhymer , " And ne'er in haunts of living men Again was Thomas seen . " At this point , doubtless , there wil be expected an explanation such as comes at the end of a novel . But the tale is true . The mysteries of truth are often lacking in the explanations of fiction . The case was laid before D. , who had been a United States District Attorney before he became a captain of volunteers , and was versed in the ways of " working up a case " against counterfeiters on land or pirates at sea . He wrote back a letter  --  a beautiful letter - expressing in charming terms his regret , his very great regret , that so interesting a character as his friend Animus should have withdrawn from the sphere of human observation ; but when he came to the explanation , his professional experience and legal acumen were futile ; and he had to fall back ( evasively ) upon the supernatural ; Animus was clearly a fiend-an emissary of the Devil or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said ) , who had marked the captain for his peculiar prey . On the day of his wound ( which need not be accounted for ) , fearing that he was to become the orderly 's horse and that the captain would thereby escape his toils , he resorted to strategy ; and , like all fiends resorting to strategy , overacted his part ; whereby vice is defeated and virtue escapes . Finding his schemes subverted and his efforts brought to nought , and disbelieving that he was to be the object of humanitarian care or Christian charity  --  the latter , moreover , being justly offensive to him-he seized upon the first moment when unseen by mortal or equine eye to vanish in a puff of smoke.
