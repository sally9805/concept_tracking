Mr. Bailey has prepared a very shaky bill ? he can not be aware of all of its more serious defects , and no man could foretell its probable working . For one thing , the bill of Mr. Bailey , who is a very adYanced Democrat , knocks the doctrine of State rights into a cocked hat by providing that a petition in bankruptcy filed under its provisions shall vacate an attachment in a State court ? that is to say , the United States would say to the judicial officers of a State , Hands off !
