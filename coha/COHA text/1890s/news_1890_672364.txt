txt questions if they were to Dome up for adjudication , and in no oase would the two divisions sit together as one tribunal Hence an opinion of a majority of the fourteen Judges would by no means foreshadow the final judgment of the court . If there were any propriety in referring a bill passed by the Legislature to the Court of Appeals Judges for their opinion , the proper course would be to refer it to those Judges who really constitute the court . But perhaps the Governor was apprehensive of the result in that case , while he counted upon the Judges who owe their places in the second division to him as more likely to be favorable to his views . The Governor backed his request to the Legislature by a reference to the action of Gov . HOFFMAN in 1872 , but in that case the Governor was in. doubt as to the construction of " the language of the bill , " and was careful to ask only whether if it were passed without change there might not be doubts about its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it is enacted into law , the language of the bill should be so amended as to guard against such questions . " In deciding that serious questions might arise under the law unless its language should be modified , the court took pains to disclaim any intention of saying what the legal effect of the act would be , and confined itself to saying that a certain effect might be claimed which made it advisable to prepare the bill more carefully to avoid the objections raised . This is hardly a precedent such as Gov . HILL claimed it to be . Besides , Gov . B.OFFMAN did not feel called upon to get the Legislature to join in his request to the court . The Legislature was right enough in ' declining Gov . HILL 'S suggestion to call in the two divisions of the Court of Appeals to relieve his state of mind , but there is now no propriety in calling upon the people to decide between them by a vote on the general proposition of an exclusively official ballot . The Legislature has taken its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic members choose to sustain the latter in his position , the people will have to wait for ballot reform until they can elect a Governor who will approve a measure to secure it as well as a Legislature that will pass such a measure . We are not sure but Senator FASSETT 'S proposition to submit the question of ballot reform to a vote of the people at the next election was intended to invite the opposition of the Democrats to that course . It very promptly elicited an objection from Senator CANTOR to giving it a third reading at once , whereat Mr. ** seemed to be pleased at the opportunity of assuming that the Democrats were not willing to allow the people to pass upon the question . But if the proposition was made seriously , which we doubt , it is an ill-advised proceeding . There is no doubt about the sentiment of the people on this question . The position of the whole Republican Party has been declared upon it . Several Democratic organizations have put themselves on record in its favor , and among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large proportion of Democratic voters . The Ballot-Reform League is made up of men of both parties , and includes many Democrats of unquestionable standing . The labor organizations without exception have joined in the demand for an exclusively-official ballot and the Australian system of voting . There is no question of the popular demand for ballot reform .. Moreover , the submission of the question to a vote of the people would be no proper answer to the Governor 's veto , which Was based wholly on constitutional grounds . Even Gov . HILL did . not have the temerity to claim that the people are not in favor of the Saxton bill , and a popular vote can not settle constitutional questions . It might be overwhelmingly in favor of " a law  --  requiring all ballots to be voted at any public election to be printed at the public expense , and to be distributed to the electors by sworn public officials only at the polling place on election day , " and yet the Governor 's doubts , if they are genuine and sincere , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly claim that the people at large had no jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions . Besides , it is a bad practice for either the Legislature or the Governor to attempt to shirk their responsibility by referring legislative questions to the people , to say nothing of constitutional questions , They are chosen by the people to exercise their several functions , and if they fail to do so with fidelity they are accountable to the people . To submit this matter to a , popular vote would therefore be a useless formality . The Governor 's own proposition to refer the questions of constitutionality which he raised to the Judges of the Court of Appeals was more plausible , but that was lacking in good faith . The Ballot-Reform League , in submitting its objections to such a proceeding to the Legislature , pointed out the tricky nature of the Governor 's proposaL He suggested that the question be referred to the Judges of both divisions sitting together . Now , the Judges of the Second Division are appointed thereto by the Governor himself from those of the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Division is organized only to deal with arrears of oases on the calendar , taking such as are assigned to it by the permanent court .
