txt When the German Kaiser , in his dispatch of sympathy concerning the Illness Of RUDYARD KIPLING , spoke of " our common race , " Englishmen and Americans alike received the declaration with a certain shock . We know perfectly what Englishmen and Americans mean when , after dinner , they talk about our common race . Chiefly they mean that we talk dialects of the same language . We can understand each other . Even if we adopt the cynical statement of an English statesman that the common language is a delusion and that the belief that it is common and that we understand each other furnishes " an unequaled basis for mutual misapprehension , " we come nearer to understanding each other than any foreigner does to understanding either of us . In the same way , we may speak of the Germans as our kindred , whether they happen to be so genealogically to the Particular speaker or not . An American citizen , whatever his remote origin , conies a good deal nearer understanding German ways of thinking and behaving than he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. STEEVENS , put the case very well when he wrote a book about Germany after writing one about the - United States . The Americans , he says , are the brothers of Englishmen . The Germans are their cousins . Rut the proof that there is something a good deal alike in the intellectual habits of Germans and Englishspeaking people is found in the readiness with which the Germans in this country become assimilated and Americanized , even in the first generation , while in the second there is no noticeable difference at all between the American born of German parents and the American born of American parents . That was a pleasant tittle illustration of the readiness with which we understand each other that was furnished by the visit of Capt . COGHLAN to St. Louis , and his entertainment there by a German-speaking delegation from Cincinnati , If Capt . COGHLAN had been solemnly accused of " insulting " the sovereign of any other European country than Germany it will readily be seen that he would have had a very bad quarter of an hour when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " insulted " sovereign . If it had been an Italian . or a Spanish , or even a French delegation , it is quite certain that his repetition of the " insult " would have been a fresh cause of offense . " Instead of which , " when Capt . COGHLAN offered as a toast " Hoch der Kaiser , " the assembled German speakers " caught on , " for all the world as if they had been English speakers , and , to repeat the happy phrase of the dispatch , " the hatchet was drowned . " This little tale seems to teach in the first place that we must not attach too much importance to the reports of those newspapers which make their livings by emphasizing and exaggerating the differences between " German-Americans " and other kinds of Americans , and in the second place that there is a good deal of the same human nature , even including the Paine appreciation of what is comical , in a native American and in a " GermanAmerican . " Even the Kaiser , who takes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enjoyed meeting , in such circumstances , the Captain of the Raleigh .
