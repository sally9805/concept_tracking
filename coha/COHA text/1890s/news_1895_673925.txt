txt Those eminent lawyers who have taken up the cause of the ousted Police Justices are driven to the use of some queer arguments . They do not attack the title of the City Magistrates , but admit the power of the Legislature to establish the new courts .. Although this admission is inconsistent with the claim that the old Justices were Constitutional officers , that claim is insisted upon on the ground that their existence was recognized in the provision that those in office when the Constitution was adopted should remain until the expiration of their terms . This is taken as not only making them Constitutional officers , but as preventing the Legislature from abolishing the old courts when it established the new ones . Judge Davis said in his argument : " It may be that the Legislature intended that there should be more Justices than formerly . The Legislature may create as many Justices as it sees fit . " This seems to " give away " the whole case . As to intention , the same act which established the new courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old courts and terminate the official existence of the old Judges . There is no doubt about the intention , and the power is admitted so far as the new system of courts is concerned . That concedes that the inferior courts of criminal jurisdiction are legislative and not Constitutional in their origin , and ' What the Legislature has enacted it may repeat and replace with new enactments . The courts it has established ' it may abolish , and the terms of office it has created it may destroy . The argument of the counsel of the defunct Justices is hard to follow , but it seems in effect to be that certain terms of office continue to exist though the offices themselves have been abolished , and that the continued existence of the terms makes the abolition of the offices of no effect . The logic is surely very queer .
