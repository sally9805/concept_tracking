txt If the Rapid-Transit Commissioners abandon all further negotiations with the Manhattan Railway Company for an extension of the present elevated railroad system and an increase of its facilities , and proceed to lay out an independent line on the west side , what is the practical result likely to be I The most feasible route for such an independent line is up West Street , to a convenient point for connection , to Seventh Avenue , and then up that avenue , Broadway , and the Boulevard , which is substantially a route that the Manhattan Company desired to obtain when it made its own proposals to the commission . It was , in fact , a main feature of its plan Of extension on the west side , with various connections with its existing lines . Suppose such a line should be laid out for an elevated railroad and the franchise should be offered for sale at public auction . Who would be more likely to get possession of it than this same Manhattan Company I It could probably make use of it to better advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives for preventing it from falling into the hands of a rival corporation . If it got the franchise would the terms and conditions be likely to be morn favorable for the city than those upon which an extension of the present system could be obtained But suppose somebody else should offer a higher compensation and get the franchise . Ms a question whether the new line could be constructed and operated in competition with the Manhattan system and yield profitable returns without delay . If it should fail in the effort , what more likely result than that the Manhattan Company would get possession of it at less cost than if it had undertaken to construct it for itself t The ultimate fate of the independent new line is one of tho things to be considered in resorting to it as an alternative to any further negotiation with the Manhattan Company . The mon connected with the management of that corporation are accustomed to look ahead , and they are familiar with more than one way of accomplishing their purposes ; and we regret to say that they have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of those of the public .
