txt Ex-Speaker Reed is a conspicuous if not a confessed candidate for the Republican nomination to the Presidency , and his nearest friends make no secret of the fact . He has many claim ' to the honor . His service to his party has been long and consistent and on some , occasions has been valuable . He is fairly in sympathy with the ideas that have in the past been those of his party , though , unlike Mr. , he has some perception of the fact that they are no longer so interesting or for political purposes so available as they were a few years since . He shows this by an eager but rather vague curiosity as to new ideas with which to replace them . It is in this diffi-. cult and trying process that he is liable to come to embarrassment , if not to grief . His experience in the last Congress betrayed a lack of poise , of dignity , of ability to Wait onevents , of confidence in his own strength and in that of his party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of Mr. Reed 's public career he has been , on the whole , fortunately situated for an effective digplay of his peculiar qualities . He has been either the leader of his party in the minority or the representative of a minority in his party . The latter role he was compelled to assume while Mr. Blaine was the most prominent figure in Republican politics , and when , as there could not have been two great leaders from Maine , Mr. Reed had either openly to fight Mr. Blaine , which , of course , he never did , or take a subordinate place , which he did with such grace as he could command . While he was so situated , and also when his party was in opposition , Mr. Reed was at liberty , on the one hand , to attack the general enemy , and , on the other , to advocate those views which , though strictly orthodox , were not the extreme and risky and eccentric views with which Mr. Blaine chose apparently to identify himself . For this work Mr. Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker  --  clearness , force , and polish of expression , with a fine eye for an opponent 's weak points , and capacity for elaborating a subject without stumbling over its difficulties or committing himself too deeply . With these gifts , a good personal presence , and the tastes and manners of a gentleman . he won a place peculiarly his own , and a place of some distinction . Since he became Speaker of the House his career has been different , and though it has unquestionably given him a certain kind of popularity , and a great deal of it , it is doubtful if it has increased his chances for a Presidential nomination . His determined and vigorous policy as Speaker revealed a side of his nature that had not before been suspected . He showed capacity to take great risks , to reject precedent , to face ? ' bitter and violent opposition , and to defy the judgment of those with whom he had previously stood best that no one would have predicted of him . His course captured his party  --  there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been decided by the real sentiment of the party , or even of the great body of the delegates to the convention , it would unquestionably have gone to Mr. Reed . One reason why it did not go to him was that the machinery that is run with spoils had been set up against him . But another was that the practical men were afraid of him . His surprising development of energy and obstinacy literally scared them . It was very well when displayed in the interest of their plans , but it was not at all certain not to be employed against them . During the late Congress Mr. Reed has had a very difficult part to play . He had become too prominent to lapse into the manner and methods of the period before he became Speaker . Something considerable was expected of him . No one knew exactly what , and he , apparently , was unable to discover . But the expectation existed and was disappointed . Had he been content to do nothing , it would have been open to his friends to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a certain value . But he was not so content . As we have said , he saw that the old Republican ideas had lost their vitality and must be replaced . In an evil moment it occurred or was suggested to him  --  we fear that Senator Lodge is partly responsible in this case ? that the silver idea might be worked to advantage , especially if it could be associated in the public mind with a proper attitude toward the British lion . So he committed himself , not wholly , but far too much , to the notion of compelling England , by tariff discrimination , to give in her assent to international bimetallism . Later he thought it shrewd to try to dig a pit for the Administration in the February loan business . The net outcome was neither profit nor honor . Thus Mr. Reed stands on the threshold of the preparatory struggle for the nomination in a most uncertain condition . He will be the Speaker of the next House , and that , perhaps , is better for him than to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much risk as well as of some advantage . It is much too early for prediction , but Mr. Reed 's prominence at so early a time would - make favorable prediction extremely venturesome.
