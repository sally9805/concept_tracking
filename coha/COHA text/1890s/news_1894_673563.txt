txt When virtue is its own reward the reward is probably insufficient . The American people have long been accustomed to condemn with just severity their Senators and members of Congress who fall before the financial allurements of the lobbyist . A . Senator caught taking a bribe in any of its protean forms is pilloried in thousands of newspapers and from thousands of platforms and pulpits . On the other hand , the poor but virtuous Senator who never takes a bribe , who never speculates in sugar , even inadvertently , and never casts anchors to the windward , but lives a straightforward , manly , honest life , gets no word of . special praise or any individual apportionment of credit . In times of scandal no'rndy pays any attention to him . It is . lain that this custom should be turned around , or at least modified . Let the smirched ones be condemned , but would not it be well to reward with at least an honorable mention or resolution of thanks from constituents all the honest and unsmirched remainder ? Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the influence of protection it is evident that unusual incentives to virtue are demanded . It was inevitable , with the falling raveInes , that the Treasury statement for the 1st of June should show an increase in the debt , less cash in the Treasury . This increase amounts to $6,603,030 . The shrinkage in the receipts since July 1 , 1S93 ? within one month of a complete fiscal year  --  has been $84,000,000 , but there has also been a reduction in expenditures , so that the net falling off is $72,000,000 . This indicates a course of affairs corresponding very closely to the estimate of the Secretary in January , just before the last loan was made . The proceeds of that loan , in gold , have nearly disappeared , the Treasury now holding only $78,693,287 . But the Treasury is fairly strong in greenbacks , and no immediate action seems necessary . Probably none will be if the Tariff bill be got out of the way by the close of the fiscal year , as is now probable .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
