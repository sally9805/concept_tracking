txt The Pulitzer Building was set on fire shortly after 10 o'clock last night by an electric light wire , which in the delivery room under the sidewalk at Frankfort Street and Park Row , ignited waste paper , and before aid came the disaster had assumed such gravity that three alarms were struck , and every apparatus summoned was needed . While the fire was out before eleven o'clock and the damage was estimated at $3,000 , the consequential loss was great , as not only were the staff of editors , reporters , telegraphers , and artists and the compositors compelled to abandon their work for an hour , but the fire ravaged a cock loft between the main floor and the press rooms , and compelled the covering of the presses , and the abandonment of the press rooms . This necessitated such cleaning up and makeshifts that The World will to-day appear in abbreviated form , as it was impossible to issue it with the number of pages planned . George Cary Eggleston. editor of the newspaper , can claim the distinction of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of the offices was damaged . In a room on the tenth floor were Mr. Ecciesheimer , correspondent of The Philadelphia Press , and two boys . They started for the elevator , but were forced to retreat to the room and closed the door . After a moment 's pause , they made a second effort to escape , but again were obliged to rush back . Mr. Ecclesheimer then threw a camp chair out of a window , to attract attention , and followed that by a. note tied to a block of wood . This missive was seen falling by hundreds of spectators and the moment it reached the ground it was seized by a bridge policeman , who read it and found that it said that the writer and his companions were cut off from escape by the fire . The policeman rushed to the Captain of a hook and ladder truck , and the firemen rushed into the building with their scaling ladders . They soon had the imprisoned correspondent and his two boys out in the hall . Forcing them almost prone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stairs where there was an upward current of cooler air . The ninth floor being reached , all danger and most of the discomfort were passed . In the office of Friend &; House , lawyers , on the ninth floor , there was an exciting scene for a few moments . Here were Emanuel Friend , Martin Julian . Fitzsimmons 's manager ; Mr. Grossman and one or two others . They were preparing an agreement for the release of part of the ten-thousand-dollar stake put up by Fitzsimmons , which is now held impounded by the courts . This agreement is to be submitted to Judge Beekman to-day , and the lawyers were doing their utmost to have it ready . The smoke penetrated the lawyers ' office . They quickly realized the gravity of their situation . Hastily seizing some papers . Mr. Friend rushed for the stairs , followed by all the others , except Mr. Grossman . Seeing that he was left behind , Mr. Friend and Mr. Julian ran back , and , seizing Grossman , dragged him down stairs . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine cause for alarm existed . The rooms became unendurably hot , and the smoke was stifling . Mr. Eggleston was one of the first in the upper part of the building to become aware of the fire . He did what he could to give an- alarm , but all the telephone and telegraph wires were cut or burned out soon after the fire was discovered . Mr. Eggleston went to the elevator to go to the lower floor , but it had ceased to run . E. 0 . Chamberlin , Bradford Merrill , and C. E. Russell also tried to pass out through the halls , but found the heat and smoke too much for them . They were compelled to retreat , and found safety at the windows . John O'Neill , William A. Hoy , John Hunt , and C. IL Thomas also found exit cut off for a time . Some of them returned Fire Department . The fire had then rapidly eaten its way from the rubbish in the delivery room , in which were posted stringent orders against leaving refuse about , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main entrance to the Pulitzer Building . Deputy Chief of the Fire Department Francis J. Reilly had charge of the firemen , his chief aid being Battalion Chiefs and Cashman , and the tactics of the firefighters were to attack the flames from Park Row , William Street , and Frankfort Street . Before any water could be directed on the fire under the Park Row sidewalk , smoke from the burning paper and partition found its main chimney in the boiler-iron private elevator shaft which runs to the editorial and composing rooms and the dome . Other vents for the smoke were in pipes and flues leading to above the ninth floor , and the result was that the building was heavily charged with smoke from this floor up , and I wherever there was an exit smoke issued from it , giving the impression from the City Hall Park that the fire was high up instead of its having from the start been confined to the sidewalk floor . Because of the intensity of the fire in the delivery and paper roll rooms , electriaal connections , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dome and in many of the offices went out . It was , of course , impossible to use the private elevator of the newspaper and the main business elevators , but a rear elevator of small capacity was in order throughout the fire , and its services were ' timely , as descent by the stairs was cut off at the tenth floor soon after the fire was in full vigor . The firemen who faced the flames in that part of the delivery room and paper roll room where the blaze was fiercest suffered not only from heat and smoke , although large gaps were cut in the sidewalk vault skylights , but from apprehension . Probably a score of electric wires at different times broke away from their fastenings , and fell scintillating and spluttering around the feet of the firemen , but none was hurt or felt a shock . The fire was almost extinguished by hose played through the gaps in the sidewalk , when wooden beams . at the foot of the private elevator burst into flame , and but for the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance floor to the second floor , and the peril to the building would have been grave . As soon , however , as this last outbreak had been extinguished all danger was over , and employes of the newspaper began clearing away the wreck on the floor above the pressrooms , and the compositors and writers were endeavoring to redeem the situation . The members of Fire Patrol No. 1 had so covered the presses that there was little damage to them . The fire necessitated the closing of Perry 's pharmacy and Schulte 's cigar store . In neither place was any damage done , and the publication office of the newspaper was untouched even by water . As no water was to their rooms , while others forced their way to the stairway and so to the street . A. large number of out-of-town newspapers have offices in the Pulitzer Building , and the fire came when the correspondents were busiest . Among them no little alarm prevailed for awhile , but all got out in safety . In The World 's composing room there was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a panic prevailed . Long before the firemen ceased their labors the typesetting machines were clicking away as briskly as ever , and , had it not been for the odor of burning wood and Paper which permeated the rooms , no one would have known there had been a fire in the building .
