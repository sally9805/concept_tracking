txt THE STORY OF A LONG INHERITANCE . ON the 26th of July , last summer , there was a destructive tornado at Lawrence , Massachusetts . It arrived there about nine o'clock in the morning , advancing from the southwest at a rate of forty or fifty miles an hour , and rapidly passing on to the northeast . In its momentary passage , it tore down trees , wrecked buildings , killed or injured a number of persons , and left general desolation in its narrow path . It came with so little warning and passed so quickly that we have only insufficient accounts of its appearance and behavior . One man happened to be somewhat north of its path and facing it as it came , so that he had a sight of its approach . He said he saw a great quantity of rubbish of all kinds borne up into the centre of the storm , where two clouds were chasing each other around in such a way that the eastern or front cloud moved north ; that is , whirling from right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New England , but when they visit us they manifest all the characteristic features of their class . They are peculiar in their excessive violence , and in the narrow limits within which the violent winds rush around ; and from this , as well as from their sudden coming and short stay , there has been more mystery attached to them than they deserve . The theory by which they are now generally explained ascribes them to the whirling ascent of a mass of infiowing air from all sides ; for repeated observation demonstrates that they possess truly vorticular motion . The evidence of their whirling was found in the displacement of buildings and overturning of trees , but these effects are complicated by the combination of the whirling with the progressive advance of the vortex . At Lawrence , for example , where the tornado was turning from right to left as it moved swiftly northeastward , the overturning of trees to the northeast on the southern side of its central track was very general ; for here the two motions of progression and whirling agreed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . But on the north side of the track , while a number of trees were blown over to the west or backward , as if by the whirling component of the motion , and the little house in which the gate-tender stood at the railroad crossing was carried westward across the street and broken , killing the poor man inside of it , yet there were many other trees on the same side of the central path that were thrown down to the southeast or east , as if by the exaggerated indraught in the rear of the whirl ; for on the northern or left side // of the track the motion of advance would in part neutralize the whirling , particularly at a moderate distance away from the centre , where the whirl is less violent . All this has been carefully investigated at Lawrence by Mr. H. F. Mills , whose experience as an engineer gives his statements about the tornado an especial value . A careful survey was made , under his direction , of a park through which the tornado passed , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the overturned trees , that the destructive winds whirled about , and in the same direction as the observer on the northern side of the track saw them turning . Nearly the whole violence of a tornado depends on its whirling . if the inflowing air moved straight inwards on radial lines , directly to the centre , there is every reason for thinking that the velocity gained would seldom be destructive , and would never be of the terrific violence seen in the whirling storms . This may be simply illustrated by watching the downward escape of water from a basin through a vent at the bottom , where exactly the same mechanical principles are at work as in the upward escape of the air in a tornado . Fill the basin to a certain depth , and let the water come to rest ; carefully remove the stopper , and notice the velocity attained by the current in running out , no whirl occurring . Fill the basin to the same depth again , and set the water slowly rotating by a motion with the hand ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current is increased . But it is significant that the high velocity now gained is not directed radially inwards , but circularly around the central vortex . The whirling may be so rapid as to produce a centrifugal force much in excess of gravity ; for , when the vortex is well formed , an open core or eddy may be seen at the centre , where the free surface of the water does not stand level , as it would under the action of gravity alone , but nearly vertical , under the combined action of gravity and the local centrifugal force of the whirl . The surface of water stands at right angles to the forces acting on it ; arkd therefore , in the eddy , the centrifugal force , acting outwards horizontally , must be many times greater than gravity , . acting downwards , in order that the resultant of the two shall be so nearly in the direction of the former . Indeed , as a result of this active whirling , the rate of radial inflow is actually diminished , as may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the basin to be emptied when the water possesses an initial rotary motion than when it stands still . All this is undoubtedly true of tornadoes ; they would be weaker and shorter-lived if they did not whirl . We must give a few moments ' consideration to the increased velocity of the whirl as the centre is approached , for a general principle is involved here , of great importance and wide application . Tie one end of a string around a small stone or weight , and draw the other end through a small tube . Hold the tube in one hand , and the free end of the string in the other ; set the stone whirling , and then draw the string through the tube , so as to shorten the radius of rotation . As the centre is approached , the stone whirls faster ; and if the experiment could be performed without friction , it would be found that the linear velocity of the stone in its whirl increases as fast as the radius decreases . The two quantities , velocity and radius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the string in a given brief interval of time is constant ; for the area equals half the product of the distance moved over by the stone multiplied by the length of the string , and as these quantities vary inversely their product must be a constant . For this reason the mechanical principle here involved is called the " conservation of // areas . " Kepler showed that the velocities of the planets in their elliptical orbits follow this law , being accelerated as they draw nearer to the sun , and retarded as they move away . Newton proved that this variation of velocity must follow from the simple laws of motion . Like the stone on the string , so the water in an eddy or the air in a tornado whirls with increasing rapidity as it is drawn in toward the centre ; and there are many other examples of the same process . If it is now clearly understood that the violent blast of the tornado is a whirling wind , and that the tornado indraught would attain only a moderate velocity if its currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirl ; they would lose their terrors if they did not . But they all do . Here , for example , is the account of an eye-witness of a tornado that happened two hundred years ago in England . The Rev. Mr. A. de la Pryme records , in the twenty-third volume of the London Philosophical Transactions , that , on August 15 , 1687 , at two o'clock in the afternoon , there was a destructive storm at Hatfield , in Yorkshire , in which the wind " soon created a great vortex , giration and whirling among the clouds , the centre of which ever now and then dropt down in the shape of a thick long black pipe commonly called a spout ; in which I could plainly and most distinctly behold a motion , like that of a screw , continually drawing upwards , or screwing up ( as it were ) whatever it touched . " Coming at once to modern times , we may refer to an , account of tornadoes in our Southern States by H. S. Whitfield , professor of mathematics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that he had of an approaching tornado ( American Journal of Science , 1871 ) . When first seen it was about five miles away , and , judging by the angular altitude of its top , the height of its great funnel cloud must have been about forty-five hundred feet . It approached and passed south of him , about nine hundred feet away . " The gyratory motion was distinctly visible . When about a mile distant , I saw that it would go south of me , and at this time I first observed the surface drift rubbish , which appeared like an innumerable flock of birds flying around the summit of the column ; " and at about the same time the observer saw " a pine-tree , sixteen inches in diameter and sixty feet long , float out from the black vortex , at the height of a quarter of a mile , and sail round to all appearance , as light as a feather . " Such language from a professor of mathematics is directly to the point . There are many other accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm has been over and over again described as a " whirling vortex , " or as " whirling most violently upon its centre , " or in some such phrase . A number of my students have told me of tornadoes that they have seen in the West , all agreeing as to the whirling of the vicious funnel cloud . Tornadoes not only all whirl : they nearly all whirl in the same direction ; that is , from right to left , as the tornado at Lawrence did . It appears that a few are reported to have turned the other way , but by far the greater number of them exhibit a strong f amily likeness in this respect , and turn " against the sun . " Their whirling , therefore , can not be accidental : it must be controlled by some prevailing antecedent ; it must be an inheritance from some preceding condition . We must look into this . What are the conditions that give rise to tornadoes ? A few years ago this question could not have been answered satisfactorily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; but , thanks to the weather maps of Europe and this country , it is now // clear that most tornadoes are generated within the area of one of the large cyclonic storms , 1 to which we owe our spells of cloudy , rainy weather . The weather maps are so widely distributed , and publicly exhibited at so many places in our cities , that the phenomena of the larger cyclonic storms must be in a rough way familar to many persons who have perhaps little other knowledge of meteorology . They are seen to be areas of low barometric pressure , prevailingly cloudy and rainy or snowy near the centre , with their winds moving in great inward spiral circuits , and always , in our hemisphere , turning from right to left . There has never been found an exception to this rule . These cyclonic storms are so large that they may cover nearly all the States east of the Mississippi at once ; they move across country on their general eastward track at an average rate of nearly thirty miles an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to east . They usually require from one to three days for their passage ; giving us southeasterly winds with increasing dampness and cloudiness as they draw near ; rain beginning as the centre approaches , and the wind increasin0 in strength at the same time ; and as they pass on , the wind shifts , veering through the south if the centre passes north of the observer , as is generally the case , or backing through the north if the centre passes to the south , and leaving cooling and clearing westerly and northwesterly winds in their rear . Nearly all our weather changes depend upon the passage of these cyclonic storms ; and the problem of weather prediction is to foresee their movements and their changes in intensity . It is an easy matter to predict on the general rule that such stormy areas move eastward at a cer1 The reader will see that the words cyclone and cyclonic are used here in the sense properly given to them , and not to refer to tornadoes , tam rate ; but such predictions often fail , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocities . The weather prophet who discovers how to foretell the departures of single storms from the average behavior of many has a large future awaiting him . Now , returning to tornadoes , it is found that they nearly always occur in the southeastern quadrant of cyclonic storms , and from two hundred to six hundred miles from the low-pressure centre around which the cyclonic winds turn . The reason for so well defined a habitat of the tornado in the cyclone is undoubtedly to be found in the presence there of warm and damp southerly winds , over which there is good reason to think the cooler high-level westerly winds have advanced ; thus inducing a condition of instability from which an upsetting follows , and hence the indraught at the bottom by which the tornado is always characterized . But why should the indraught take on a whirling motion , and why should the whirl prevailingly turn one way , and why should that way be the same as the turning of the winds in the much larger cyclonic storm ? There is a simple and sufficient mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a larger whirl , the little one will begin to turn the same way as the larger one has been turning . They must turn the same way . In any small part of a large cyclonic storm , no one would perceive that it was possessed of a rotary motion with respect to its centre , several hundred miles away ; and yet the entire whirl of a cyclonic storm is made up of such parts , every one of which has truly a slight rotation about the cyclonic centre of low pressure . If the lower air in any one such part is drawn toward its local centre , as would occur in the which are storms of very different nature and dimensions . // case of an upsetting consequent on an unstable a*rangement of warm , damp lower air under cooler , drier upper air , the imperceptible cyclonic rotation will become apparent as the indraught currents move toward the centre of ascent ; and when the centre is closely approached , the whirling may become very violent . The connection of one of these rotary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need not doubt the inheritance of the prevalent right-to-left whirling of our tornadoes from the invariably left-handed turning of our cyclonic storms . The tornadoes that turn from left to right are of rare occurrence , and for the present have no adequate explanation ; their direction of turning must be called " accidental . " They hardly enter our story , for they have lost their inheritance . It is not my intention to present here an exposition of the theory of tornadoes ; if any reader wishes that , he may find it as given by its master , Professor William Ferrel , in his recent Popular Treatise on the Winds . Much that is here omitted is there stated in full , and with a coinpleteness of argument and demonstration that has placed its author at the head of American meteorologists . It appears , then , that our tornadoes whirl because the parent cyclones , in which the tornadoes are bred , also whirl ; the whirling in both being in the same direction . So far , so good ; it is a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it must now be asked , Why do the cyclones turn ? They have been described as areas of low barometric pressure at the centre , toward which the winds move inward , but obliquely , so that as a whole they sidle around the centre in an incurving spiral . Why do the winds not flow in directly to the centre of low pressure on radial paths ? It is a most natural expectation that the mobile air should move from where the pressure is high to where it is low ; and yet every weather map which includes a cyclonic storm - and this will be nearly every map in winter time - shows that the winds turn in the most persistent way aside from the direct path to the centre of low pressure , and always to the right , so as to form , as a whole , an inward left-handed spiral circulation . Not an exception to this rule of right-to-left cyclonic turning is known ; and if the objector to this wholesale statement would bring up the case of cyclonic storms in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must remember that , while it is true that they are there said to turn in a reversed direction , this change is only because they are there looked at from the southern side instead of from the northern . It is as if two persons were looking at a transparent watch , one seeing the face and the other the back . It would hardly be worth while for them to dispute about the direction in which the hands rotate , because one sees them turning from left to right , and the other from right to left . It appears , therefore , that the cyclonic storms are even more closely alike than the tornadoes , in this feature of rotation . Whence have they received so persistent a habit ? If the tornadoes have inherited the habit of turning from the cyclones , from what ancestor have the cyclones received it ? Just as we examined conditions in which tornadoes are formed , so must we now look to see where the cyclonic storms are bred . Those that we know in this country are affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them come from the torrid zone , but only a few , about five in a hundred . The daily international synchronous weather maps , published by our Signal Service from data gathered in all parts of the world , present the striking fact that our cyclonic storms march in an irregular procession around the north pole* along with the great // north polar whirl of the terrestrial winds . From latitude 30* north , the prevailing winds of our hemisphere may be described as forming a gigantic whirl from west to east around the north pole ; and it is in this gigantic whirl that our cyclonic storms are gen/ erated . It is then manifest that there is the same relation between the great polar whirl and the cyclonic storms that there is between the latter and the little tornadoes . The cyclonic storms arise in a whirling atmosphere , and they must turn in the same direction that it does . It is not necessary that they should occur at the centre of the great hemi-atmospheric whirl , that is at the pole ; it is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whirl , for reasons already given in explaining the origin of the tornado whirl within the cyclone . No new special process need be called in to explain this well-marked relationship ; the same general principle applies throughout , and in the southern hemisphere as well as in the northern . If the great polar whirls should stop . the cyclonic storms also would almost disappear ; for they , like the tornadoes , gain most of their distinctive features from their whirling . Our tornadoes would become rare , at the same time ; for their essential antecedent conditions , namely , those found in the southeastern quadrant of our larger rotating cyclonic storms , where tornadoes for the most part occur , would also be unusual . It is , therefore , hopeless for us to expect to get rid of the dangerous whirl of the tornadoes as long as the great parental cyclonic storms are required to turn around , because they are generated in the still greater general whirl around the north pole ; and there is no reason to think that the polar whirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its foundation . The sun shines strongest on our torrid zone , and warms the air there , in contrast to that which is cooled in the polar regions . The warm expanded equatorial air flows away aloft toward either pole ; and for this reason we should expect , at the first glance , to find a belt of low atmospheric pressure around the equator , and caps of high pressure at the poles , where the air , being cool and somewhat compressed , would accumulate in greater amount . But , curiously , there is lowest pressure at the poles : and this because the equatorial overflow , as it runs poleward , approaching the axis around which it rotates with the earth , is accelerated in its rotary motion , in accordance with the principle of the conservation of areas , even to such an extent as to generate a centrifugal force that holds the air somewhat away from the polar regions , and reverses the high pressure that we expected there as a result of the low polar temperatures into a low pressure , the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of the empty eddy in the basin of whirling water , where the centrifugal force held out the water from the centre . The same mechanical principle is known to be in part responsible for the moderately low pressure observed about the centre of cyclonic storms , and is supposed , on very reasonable grounds , to produce extremely 19w pressure in the spinning vortex of tornadoes . No direct observations can be expected of the latter ; the nearest one of value is from an autographic barometer at Oweusboro ' , Kentucky , about a mile and a half from the track of the severe Louisville tornado of March , 1890 ; but even this was too far away from the vortex to show the central low pressure , just as it was too far away to be destroyed by the central whirling winds . The evidence of doors and windows burst open in houses over which tornadoes have passed is more directly to the point . For example , we have the account of a sufferer in the Lawrence tornado , - a woman who // was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her brief story as given in the Boston Herald at the time tells us : " While caring for the fire , I heard it raining outside . It seemed to be pouring in torrents . Suddenly I heard a terrific noise and the breaking of glass behind me . Turning around , I saw that the blinds and windows had been blown out . I started toward the windows , but I guess I never got there . I heard one crash , and that was all . When I came to , I was lying in the ruins . " So direct a narrative has every appearance of truth , and one can hardly help regarding the blowing out of the windows as evidence of the decrease of pressure outside as the vortex came over the house . Another account of the effects of the apparent explosion of a building may be found in the memoir accompanying the remarkable map , prepared under the direction of H. L. Eustis , professor of engineering in the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University , of the destruction caused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on August 22 , 1851 . The map is doubtless the most extensive survey of the track of a tornado ever made . Professor Eustis generally refrained from theorizing , but made the followil4g statement : " In one case , particularly , of a factory near the West Cambridge road , the whole effect produced , and to my mind well and clearly defined , was precisely what we should have if we could suddenly place in a vacuum a building filled with atmospheric air of ordinary tension . Even the foundation walls were inclined outwards , and there was every evidence of a force acting from the interior to the exterior . " This report is to be found in the Memoirs of the American Academy of Boston for 1853 . To review : The relentless violence of tornadoes is a direct result of their whirling , and the whirling is a habit which they have inherited from the rotation of the cyclonic storms in which they are bred . The cyclones have not of themselves originated the rotation that so universally characterizes them , but in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general atmospheric circulation in which they are formed ; and this has come by immediate inheritance from the rotation of that persistent and inveterate spinner , old Mother Earth . The whirling that characterizes our tornadoes is therefore passed down to them in direct line of inheritance from the rotation of their great-grandparent , and you may ask any astronomer if he thinks that will soon cease . To be sure , there would be no polar whirl if there were no equatorial overflow , but there will be an overflow as long as the sun shines on the equator ; and the permanence of this may also be referred to the astronomers . They will indeed tell you that the duration of sunshine can not be expected to reach as far into the future as the endurance of the earth 's rotation ; but both are enduring enough for all practical purposes . It may be well to mention that most cyclones have no tornado offspring , for which we may be duly thankful ; but others have a rather large family . Consider the extraordinarily fruitful cyclonic storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1884 ; as its centre moved from Illinois into Canada , it gave birth to some forty or fifty vicious tornadoes in the Southern States . Most happily for us , these little whirls are short-lived : they seldom live more than half an hour , sometimes an hour , advancing in this brief time from ten to forty miles , although their parents may go on for a week or two , and cross a continent and an ocean ; indeed , one cyclonic storm has been traced in apparently continuous progress all around the world . Again , just as it is not every cyclonic storm that gives birth to tornadoes , // so even the tornado-breeders do not generate these violent offspring at all points on their course , but have their breeding-grounds ; and alas ! the favorite ground is our fruitful Mississippi Valley . As they cross over that superb stretch of country , particularly in the spring and early summer , the cyclonic indraught brings together the unlike elements from which the tornadoes arise : the warm , damp lower winds from the Gulf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or northwestern interior where the temperature is still low . Nowhere else in the world is there a like opportunity for the crossing of winds so strongly contrasted , and nowhere else do cyclonic storms so often give birth to tornadoes . The same relation of short-lived offspring and long-lived parent appears between the cyclonic storms , whose life-history we measure in days or in weeks , and the great polar whirl , whose duration we may almost call immortal . The polar whirl has times of greater activity in winter , when the contrast of temperature between equator and pole is at its maximum , and at this season the most and the strongest cyclones are generated in it . In summer time , when the difference of temperature between equator and pole is least , the whirl runs slower , and its cyclones are fewer and weaker ; but it is chiefly in these latter that the tornadoes are produced . The earth must therefore already have been , and continue to be for ages and ages to come , subject to cyclones and tornadoes ; yet if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be allowable to say that the polar whirl is not immortal , for it presumably was not at work when the earth was glowing with its own heat ; nor will it remain in operation when the heat of the sun , on which it now depends , is-exhausted . The polar whirl lives all through that immensity of time in which the sun determines our climate , but the rotation of the earth , on which the whirling of the atmosphere depends , is more enduring still . In the ardent youth of the world , long past , as well as in the cold old ale , in the distant future , its rotation prevails ; we must conceive of the turning being as long-lived as the earth itself . Whence did it come by this persistent habit ? The earth turns on its axis from west to east , or , as seen from the NorthStar side , from right to left . So do the moon and the sun , and Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn , the only other members of the solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Again the same strong family likeness . Not only so : the moon revolves around the earth in the same direction as both turn on their axes , and the planets all revolve around the sun in the same direction as they rotate day after day . Saturn 's rings turn in the same direction . Everywhere the same well - marked habit of turning from west to east , from right to left . The earth is by no means an isolated , lonesome old body , but one of a family of planets ; the members are scattered , to be sure , but they all bear a strong resemblance to one another . Can we venture so far back in the family history as to find the ancestor from which this resemblance has come down ? A clue to guide us in this search may be found in the case of Saturn 's rings , which are believed to consist of innumerable small separate bodies crowding around the planet in closely placed orbits . Imagine that at one part of a ring its material should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bodies next west of the clot would be hurried along by its attraction and drawn nearer to it , thus accelerating their revolution around Saturn ; the bodies next east of it would be held back or retarded in their revolution . Those lying on the outer margin of the ring , near the clot , would be drawn in // toward it , and those on the inner margin would be drawn out ; and after a long time , all the material of the rings might , in this way , be gathered about the clot , - not by any sudden disruption of the ring , but by a slow process of segregation . Throughout all this process , the conditions of the formation of a tornado in a cyclone , or of a cyclone in a polar whirl , are essentially repeated ; and the mass formed by the coalescence of the parts must inevitably rotate on its axis in the same direction as it revolves around Saturn . The more ingenious and daring astronomical speculators have supposed that all the planets once existed as rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a process of segregation like that just described the material in each ring gradually settled together and formed a planet . During the early stage of the planets , it is thought that rings may have been formed around their coalescing masses , and from these their moons have segregated . If this is admitted , we must go a step further , and say that , of all these rings , those of Saturn must have been the most regularly built , for they have not even yet broken up . They must be wonderfully well balanced . It is , then , from the very ancient time when the planets were rings , 41 turning one way around the sun , that they inherit the common impulse that gives them all the same direction of axial rotation . But why did all the rings revolve the same way ? Why not some one way , and some the other ? Is there , possibly , a primeval ancestor from which all the rings inherited their uniform revolution ? The most venturesome theorists have dared to search even further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they think that the rings were only annular segregations from a vague , irregularly scattered nebular mass , that , as a whole , turned one way in spiral courses and that this slow turning of the primeval nebula determined the direction in which the rings revolved , and all the rest from this . But why did the nebula turn ? Why did it not stand still ? It grew from chaos ; but the elemental parts of chaos possessed , presumably , some motion , unlike in its various regions ; and as their mutual attractions brought them nearer together , forming the primeval nebula , we can not suppose that they could have avoided some slow rotation . The antecedent motions of the chaotic parts would have had to be most particularly and especially adjusted to escape this result ; and chaos knew nothing of particular adjustments . Hence we may infer that when the North Star looked upon our patch of chaos , and watched its segregation into the primeval nebula , he probably noticed that it took on a rotation , a slow spiral inflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aries to Taurus , Gemini , and the rest , from west to east , from right to left ; and from that time to this , through sun , planets , and moons , winds , cyclones , and tornadoes , the habit then gained has never been lost . Literally , this is a universal habit ; and what an example of the importance of forming good habits in early youth ! It is not entirely to the imagination that we must trust for pictures of these past conditions . The earth is cold , having long ago lost its surface heat ; but the sun , being much larger , is still luminous , and preserves even to these late times an image of what the glowing earth was in its youth . The planetary rings are all outgrown , but from the well - balanced rings of Saturn , those extraordinary examples of retarded development , we may infer what the planetary rings once were . The primeval nebula is vastly ancient , but in some parts of the universe the nebulous phase of development is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter sky and there a // little misty object may be seen near the faintest of the three belt stars . When examined with a telescope , this is found to be a vast nebula . A magnificent photograph of the nebula has been taken by Roberts , of London . A large lens , a sensitive plate , a perfect clockwork to make the telescope follow the turning of the sky , and . a fourhour exposure have brought to sight many details not visible to the eye alone ; and , most wonderful to behold , there are the spiral incurvings of the nebulous streaks , such as the North Star might have seen while watching our early growth . There is the warrant for believing that our primitive nebula turned in its spiral courses , and gradually settled into revolving rings , from which the planets grew ; while the sun represents the great central mass into which most of the nebulous matter was drawn . But what a long inheritance is this ! You have heard of the glacial invasion from which New England and other northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses in the many scattered boulders on our hills : that was prehistoric , and yet it should not be regarded as ancient ; it may be placed about two inches back on a line that represents the scale of time . You have seen the splendid gorge of the Hudson through the Highlands : that was begun perhaps ten feet back on the scale . You have heard of those strange reptilian tracks in the sandstones of the Connecticut Valley : those are decidedly older , possibly fifty feet back . You know the coal from the mines down in Pennsylvania : the coal plants grew in the Pennsylvania marshes long before the reptiles made tracks in the Connecticut sand fiats , may be eighty or a hundred feet ago . You may have been down to Braintree , near Boston , and seen the trilobites in the slate quarry there : those are vastly more antique than the coal plants , two , or three , or four hundred feet distant on the time scale . But these examples are to be dated after the earth had taken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , as now , accompanied by a moon that ran around it in the same way as both bodies turned on their axes . It must then , as now , have had its lands and oceans ; its tides , currents , and winds ; its storms , with their clouds and rain . How much further back should we have to go to find the earth only just segregated from its ancestral ring , ana how much earlier still were the nebulous rings forming from chaos ? No one can say . And yet , through all this , time we trace the persistent inheritance of a primeval habit that was learned in the childhood of time . If that old nebula had taken on the habit of turning the other way , the sun would rise over our western hills and set on the Atlantic ; if that old nebula had turned the other way , the moon would work its way westward through the stars , and its first quarter would show us the left half illuminated , not the right ; if that old nebula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tempered breezes from the ocean for our habitual winds , while western Europe would suffer under harsh easterly winds from the interior of the vast Eurasian continent ; the seat of modern civilization in the Old World would be well-nigh uninhabitable , and bleak Labrador would enjoy a tempered climate . If that old nebula had turned the other way , the Lawrence tornado would have come from the east , not from the west ; it would have turned from left to right , not from right to left ; and the house in which the gatetender was killed would have been dashed eastward , not westward , on the north side of the track . When we speak of inheritance , we think generally of the inheritance of property from a parent ; and this means that we live in a country of established laws . Established laws give // us security in the transmission of inheritance . But how local , how shortlived , how vacillating , are our human laws of inheritance compared with these eternal laws of physical inheritance , persistently in operation since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first sight , seem to be one of danger ; but the larger lesson is one of safety , - safety under the constant operation of fixed natural laws .
