txt Mr. HArrisoN 's declaration of opinion that the Republican National Convention at Minneapolis would not be controlled by individual disappointments has exercised an extraordinary influence upon Mr. T. C. PLATT . The President merely exhibited a cap and Mr. PLATT has put it on . The public in such circumstances is at no loss to decide what kind of a cap it was , and it will certainly conclude that this was that kind of a cap , in spite of the cleverness with which Mr. PLATT 'S acceptance of it and his animosity toward the donor are put . This cleverness recalls rather the manner of Col. GEORGE BLISS in one of his frequent bilious seasons than that of Mr. PLATT , whose own utterances are wont to be of a flabby and gelatinous consistency . It will be remarked that Mr. PLATT does not pretend to quarrel with the fit of the cap , nor to deny that he has private griefs which he desires to control the Republican Convention . It is an " individual disappointment " arising out of a difference of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. PLArr 's support and the length to which it is worth the President 's while to go in order to secure that support . Undoubtedly he would have stood better with the respectable Republicans of New-York if he had not gone so far , but there was a point at which he found it necessary to draw the line . When that point was reached all that he had yielded to PLATT went for nothing with PLATT , though it continued to go for a good deal with the respectable Republicans , and , indeed , from the point of view of a respectable New-York Republican , his complaisance to PLATT is the chief objection to his renomination . As for Mr. PLATT , he does not resemble his predecessor in many things , but he does resemble him in an overweening sense of his own importance . Mr. CO.NKLING could have found much more severe and amusing things to say about Mr. HARRISON than Mr. PLATT has found to say , but they would have come to the same thing , and . that would have been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. QUAY is suffering from au individual disappointment arising from the coolness with which the President found himself forced to treat him after his loose handling of the public funds of Pennsylvania had been established . QUAY , though now an open enemy of the President 's , is still an incubus upon him by reason of WANAMAKER . So long as that remarkable Cheap Jack remains in the Cabinet . respectable Republicans , in common with respectable people of other parties , will bear a grievance against the President on account of QUAY . Mr. CLARKSON is another sufferer from " individual disappointment , " and these three are the leaders of the opposition to the renomination . Mr. PLATT is the most ' important of them . because nobody supposes that Mr. QUAY 'S efforts will affect the election in Pennsylvania , Or Mr. CLARKSON 'S in Iowa , while there is some doubt whether Mr. PLATT 'S grudge may not have an effect upon the vote of New-York . But the course of these " leaders " has been such as to reduce their influence in the councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect been for some weeks advertising for a candidate with whom to beat HARRISON , and they have failed to receive any satisfactory answers . The name of Mr. SHERMAN was the first they tried to conjure with , but Mr. SHERMAN was not to be had . He had experienced too much support for the nomination already , and saw no reason why be should offer himself to be betrayed yet again . The " availabilities " of the Republican Party are not many , and they were soon exhausted , and . then the " leaders " took the extraordinary step of falling back upon the once magnetic Mr. BLAINE . This was so plainly a resort of desperation as to make the whole exhibition of individual disappointments seem like a piece of buffoonery . The enthusiasm with which the boomers represent the Republican masses to be seething for Mr. ELAINE and the magnificent results which they have discovered to proceed from his scheme of " reciprocity " heighten the comedy of their situation . Although Mr. 131-kixE 's health has before this , and on the eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends , " it is now a public possession . Everybody knows , that is to say , that the Secretary of State has been disabled , for nferriths at a time , from the discharge of his official duties , and that his recovery has been far , from complete , if , indeed , there has been any such improvement as can be called a recovery . It is alleged , on what seems to be good authority , and it is commonly believed , that he is at the present time incapable of transacting ordinary business , or even of holding a connected conversation . Moreover , he has himself declined to be a candidate for the nomination in a manner so explicit as would place him at a special disadvantage in the canvass . His friends , who are really such and not merely the enemies of Mr. HARRISON , are taking no part whatever in the Blaine boom of PLATT and QUAY and CLARK SON . There never was a more desperate undertaking than these statesmen have ventured upon in endeavoring to " stampede " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant candidate . Mr. HARRISON had very good reason for his belief that the convention would not be controlled by " individual disappointments . "
