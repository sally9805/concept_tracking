By William Clarke . THE poet Shelley observed that " Hell is a city very much like London . " My own acquaintance with the former place is not extensive enough to warrant me in expressing any decided opinion as to the truth of this comparison ; but I am inclined from my knowledge of London to think that the comparison must be unfair to hell . For one can go to large areas of modern London in which happiness is little known and in which the strongest desire of the people is for a bath in the waters of Lethe , where they may forget their wretchedness . The benevolent British government provides the waters of Lethe in great quantity throughout London ; the liquid , however , is administered internally , and it is called gin . We must remember that the problem of great cities and their misery is , for our purposes , quite modern . It is true that great flourishing cities spread themselves around the Mediterranean in the later Roman Empire . How large they really were we do not know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at three quarters of a million ; but a modern French scholar believes that it was not less than five millions , or equal to the London of to-day . But it may any way be roughly said that , after the irruption of the barbarians into the Roman Empire there were no great cities in our sense of the word till the beginning of the present century . When the Continental Congress was sitting , New York , Philadelphia and Boston were but country towns . Even Paris , the first of cities at that time , had but half a million of people at the Revolution ; Berlin was a small , ugly place ; and St. Petersburg as raw as any " booming " town in Texas . London itself was but a pygmy compared with what it is now . In " Barnaby Rudge , " which deals with the Gordon riots of 1780 , Dickens represents Clerkenwell as a sort of pleasant village with a 57*i real well and country gardens . Now it is a foul , dreary , monotonous district in the very black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chartists selected Kennington Common for their demonstration , as being away from London crowds . The Common has long since been transformed into a little park where , on bank holidays , you can scarcely see the grass for the swarming children ; and all round is a huge network of streets and lanes . A still more striking instance of the invasion of bricks and mortar was pointed out to me by a fellow-journalist on the occasion of Cardinal Manning 's death . The Cardinal was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery , where he had himself officiated twenty-seven years before at the funeral of Cardinal Wiseman . On that occasion he had spoken of carrying Wiseman 's remains away from " this wild multitude of men " to a peaceful spot . To-day Kensal Green is a crowded district , and in the cemetery you hear on one side the shrieks of engines , and on the other the jingling of street-car bells all day long . Americans are apt to think of London as ancient ; but take away about half a dozen individual buildings and a few streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Smithfield ) and it is no more ancient than Chicago . It is not a city proper , but a huge wilderness of perhaps the most ugly houses in the world , nineteen out of twenty of which have been built since the century began . Hence the curious anachronisms in the names of London streets . You go to Clerkenwell Green and find , instead of a green , a hideous dirty paved square , where little knots of people gather on Sunday nights to denounce landlords , capitalists , the queen , the Archbishop of Canterbury and other objectionable persons . The " Angel " at Islington was a country tavern early in the century , now it is perhaps the busiest centre of street- // 573 car traffic in London . Bow Common reminds you so far as its name goes of geese and ducks waddling about over its expanse ; you go there and you find big sprawling match factories and thousands of dirty little houses all alike in their hideous monotony . Moorfields contains no fields at all , but two huge railway termini and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along which Goldsmith drove in a post chaise to the then rural village of Edgware , is now no road at all , but a noisy street of shops , the very quintessence of Cockneyism . Leicester Square , which was an unenclosed field in the time of George II. , where duels were fought , is now filled with French restaurants , London 's two biggest variety theatres and hospitals , and is , along with the Strand , one of the chief centres of European blackguardism . Only old people who have lived in London all their lives can realize the change . At the beginning of the century you had a comparatively small city with a few outlying suburbs to which prosperous tradesmen repaired , with country roads and little streams . The suburbs have become main streets , the country roads have been converted into prolonged rows of what William Morris calls " blackguardly villas , " and the little streams have disappeared . You have , in short , modern London . I dwell upon the suddenness of this change in order to insist upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Oh , the poor have always been , and will always be . " But the problem of a place like London is absolutely new , and the questions it suggests have arisen almost in our own time . You hear people discuss the question as to whether London is better than it was . It is a futile discussion . You can only compare things that are in pan ma/enia , and the London of Pitt 's time can no more be compared with the London of to-day than can the Paris of the National Convention with the Paris of 1893 . You have an essentially new phenomenon . To what causes is it due ? Briefly , to these : the decline of agricultural England and the invasion of London by swarming masses of country people ; the expansion of British trade and particularly of British shipping , which has given to London its largest single industry or group of industries ; the very bad tendency , as I think , towards extreme centralization , which , it is to be hoped , Home Rule will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual and political centres instead of the dead-alive places they are ; the relative decline of Paris as a centre of fashion and wealth since the Franco-German War , London to some extent taking its place ; the growth of the railway system , and other subsidiary causes . There is also the great twofold modern passion for moneymaking and for amusement , and there is the necessity for the literary and quasiliterary class to be in the great centre of journalism and making of books . When I say that there are some fifteen thousand people in London engaged in writing in some shape or form , it will be seen how immense is what may be called the intellectual , as apart from the industrial attraction of London . The result of this is that London now practically extends to Watford on the north , twenty miles away to Redhill , a similar distance in the south , to Tilbury , nearly as far in the east , and to Maidenhead ( in the summer when the river is crowded ) , more than twenty miles to the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see London and Brighton connected by houses all the way , and possibly continuous buildings from London to Birmingham . A glorious prospect for the speculative builder , for the landlords , and for the pestilent persons who cover the whole country with their advertisements of pills and soap and mustard ! But what a future vision for the artist and for the children of England , who already , in many districts , never come in contact with nature , and who , in the England of the future , unless the *5resent tendencies are checked , will know and care nothing about the charm of the green meadow bathed in sunlight or the wild heath with its golden gorse and purple heather and solemn pines , or the desolate shore by the resounding sea . But will the present tendencies continue ? Without dogmatizing , I think not . The shallow leaders of free-trade Manchesterism // held that England was to be the workshop of the world , other countries sending their fruits , grains and vegetables , and receiving back English cots , hats , shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , - but it did n't work . Other countries had coal and iron , and were able to manufacture as well as England ; and now England is hard pressed in the race , and is already beaten in some departments . The result in England is , that , spite of low prices , English warehouses have been crammed with things that could not be got rid of , for which there was no market . The recent great cotton lockout in Lancashire , which lasted there three months , was solely due to overstocked mills and warehouses . Thus the turn in the industrial tide has come , and this will affect London in due time . Another cause which will hamper the growth of London is the struggle between labor and capital and the demands of labor . London has been the centre of the newer trade-union movement , i. c. , the movement among the so-called unskilled . They have run wages up in some industries to a point higher than in provincial towns . The result has been that in numbers of big contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these firms bring their own workmen , and so oust the London men . Consequently , provincial firms are likely to grow and London firms to decline , - a very good result , as I think . In the next place , London has no bed of coal or iron near , and so it can not compete in numbers of industries with towns in other parts of England . As a result , shipbuilding has almost ceased on the Thames ; such a firm as Samudas , in Poplar , which used to employ five thousand persons , being now closed and in the market . I am sorry to say that there are reports of good coal being found within sixty miles of London . If true , the pretty Kent and Sussex country would be converted into heaps of cinders , yawning coal pits , and a general scene of black ruin and desolation , and Londoners would be twofold more the children of hell than they were , before . But let us hope that the people who are boring for coal there will fall down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sufferings they propose to inflict will be averted . But an even more important preventive of the future growth of London is its relative decline as a port . Every one has heard of the dock strike of 1889 , the first great effort of organized unskilled labor . It would never have succeeded had the London docks been in a good condition . But they are nearly all bankrupt ; and advantage was taken of a rising market to force the dock-owners ' hands . The bankruptcy of the docks and relative decline of London port are in the main due to a notable event , the making of the Suez Canal . Before that time London was the great emporium of Oriental produce , which was sent via the Cape , and was distributed from London . But the Suez Canal brought about the overland route from India , China , Australia and the Malay Archipelago to Europe , with the result that cargo is now discharged at a dozen ports which have grown during the last generation . Odessa has become a great and splendid city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adriatic by the Gotthard Railway , has become the third port in Europe ; Barcelona has enormously exp. *nded , as has Trieste ; and Genoa has revived from her long quiescence ; Hamburg , Marseilles and Havre have all gained . London has lost . A friend of mine tells me that when he first came to London you could scarcely get along Mincing Lane ( the centre of the Oriental trade ) in the busy part of the day ; now it is a comparatively quiet thoroughfare . It is worth noting that Palmerston , impostor as he was in many respects , saw what the effect of the Suez Canal must be , and did his best to thwart M. de Lesseps and the French government . The shares held by the British government in the canal , and the risks involved in holding Egypt against the wishes of her people , and in violation of the plainest principles of international law , are a poor compensation for the economic loss which the canal caused to London . There is one other fact concerning the port of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finds any of their characters making a Continental // tour , one invariably learns that their steamer sails from London . To-day this is not the case . The only boats that go to the Continent from London are those of the General Steam Navigation Company . But , on the other hand , think of the huge fleet of steamers sailing from other ports ,  --  from Hull , Dover , Folkestone , Grimsby , Newhaven , Parkeston , Newcastle , Southampton , Leith , Queenborough ,  --  employing thousands of persons and diverting traffic from London . The same is true of steamers to other continents . How many passengers in a year travel to America from the port of London ? Liverpool and Southampton take nearly all . People who want to travel quickly to India go overland to Brindisi ; those who travel to South Africa go to Southampton or to Dartmouth ; and for South America , to Southampton . I dwell on these facts to show how inevitable is the decline of the port of London ; and it must be remembered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries . Now of course it will be asked if this decline is going on , whether it is not being acutely felt . The answer is , yes . I have myself investigated the conditions of large districts in London , and my own feeling , as a result of that investigation , was expressed by one of the persons whom I interviewed : " It is a marvel to me how tens of thousands of them live at all . " Let me give a few facts which , as Burns has it , are " chiels that winna ding and downa be disputed . " London contains roughly , 120 square miles and about 6oo , ooo inhabited houses . In the beginning of the century it had only 136,000 houses . The population is a little under 5 , ooo , ooo . As regards means of living , how is this population distributed ? Here I must take the figures of Mr. Charles Booth , whose great work on London is now the text-book for all students of social life in the British capital . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent or nearly one third of the population were in a state of poverty , i. e. , their earnings were under $5.25 per week , which Mr. Booth takes to be the minimum on which a family can live in London ; and of these twenty and three fourths per cent were either loafers and semi-criminals or casual and intermittent workers . The largest section in East London , comprising forty-two and one fourth per cent , though in regular employment , never earn more than $ 7.50 per week . The higher class wage-earners only number thirteen and . one half per cent of the population of East London . Mr. Booth 's second volume , covering the whole of London , with the very useful colored maps , shows thirty and seven tenths per cent of the entire population in poverty . He found that South London was , in some parts , worse than East London ; the Southark district , e. g. , by the river-side , where Shakespeare 's Globe Theatre once stood , yielding sixty-seven and nine tenths per cent of poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Greenwich yields sixty-five and two tenths per cent of poverty . The Whitechapel murder district , on the other hand , yields forty-nine and one tenth per cent , and the Hoxton murder district forty-eight and four tenths per cent . A small area in West London , not far from very fashionable districts , enjoys the distinction of being the very worst district in all London . When we investigate still further , we find that the darkness is not lifted . In 1887 , out of 82,545 deaths in London , 9,399 were in workhouses , 7,201 in hospitals , and 400 in lunatic asylums . Thus showing that one out of every five persons will infallibly die in one or other of these institutions . On the ist of January , i888 , 117,139 persons in London were in receipt of pauper relief ; but to obtain the actual number of individuals who really get relief throughout the year , statisticians estimate that we must multiply the daily number by three or three and a half , which gives us one person in eleven as being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine . But the official figures by no means represent the real pauperism . For the first fact that strikes the investigator into the condition of the poor is the horror most of them have of applying for public relief . " The people will starve rather , " is what Catholic priests and Methodist ministers have told me over and over again . // I hold with the late Cardinal Manning that a starving man has a right to take bread wherever he can find it , and therefore I regard this unwillingness to accept public relief as , in itself , absurd . It is the degrading conditions that are attached to the receipt of relief in England that make it seem odious . The home is broken up , husband and wife are separated , and the receipt of relief disqualifies for the suffrage . It is distinctly better in " merry England " to-day to have done your six months in prison than to have been for the same time an inmate of a workhouse . I have merely introduced some statistics for the purpose of showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , is , and I could produce piles of statistics , were that necessary . But my object is to give some idea of the actual life of the London working classes as I know it . London has no huge staple industries like the large industrial towns of Nothern England . It has a number of small industries , involving casual labor and permanent lack of employment for large numbers . Tens of thousands are always out of work , living , or rather existing , from hand to mouth . Everything in their life tends to produce and confirm bad habits . It is futile to blame them , for they are the creatures of circumstances ; it is ridiculous to attempt to moralize them , for they are not open to moral appeal . The one sole thing to be done for them is to give them self-supporting industry . If they are not capable of useful work , I am afraid they must be simply left to die out . I will content myself with saying that present economic conditions produce this class , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitalist must have a margin of unemployed labor to draw upon in the event of any serious dispute with trade unions . The existence of unemployed loafers then is bound up with the system of modern capitalism . Destroy the one , and you destroy the other . I speak now , however , not of the unfortunate out-of-works , but of the aver-ge workman in employment . I should like you to realize his life , so far as is possible , and the manner of man he is . The average London workman , then , lives either in a small cottage or a big group of so-called " model dwellings , " let out in fiats , or else in two or three rooms in a lodging-house . He can not live where he likes , but must live where he can , proximity to his work being essential . House rent in London for a complete house is comparatively low , and the workman will pay perhaps from $6o to $75 a year for a house of from four to seven rooms , with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs . The fiat in the model dwellings will be $1.25 or $1.50 per week . Rooms in lodginghouses are proportionally much dearer . In the Soho district , e. g. , where higher class tailoring and shoemaking is done , it is not unusual to pay $2.50 per week for a single room , and two decent rooms in that district could scarcely be had for less than $3 a week . In this case , of course , there are no expenses for travel to and from work , the worker living within a stone 's throw of his workshop . The small workman 's house in London is usually of white brick , badly built , and is a stunted , dingy little place . In the East End there are hundreds of miles of streets made up entirely of such places , an hour 's walk through which leaves a fearful impression of ( Ireary monotony on your mind , and you see why it is that the flaming gin palace at the corner is well filled . Men must escape from this dismal monotony at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crammed with people , pour in from the suburbs . At one railway terminus alone nearly a quarter of a million of people are supposed to arrive and depart every day , seventy thousand of them within the space of two hours . The workman 's train is badly lighted , crowded and dirty . There is at present an admirable scheme before the London County Council for creating concentric railway zones around London , on the Hungarian principle ; the uniform fare within the first zone of two miles to be so much , within the next zone of five miles so much more , and within the third zone of twelve miles so much more still . The // fare of the first zone would be three cents . I need not say that this or any other scheme will have to be forced by law on the railway companies , for capitalism does not and from its nature can not carry out any reform merely because it is needed , but because it " pays , " which this might not do . There are no uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of the builders , who have secured an eight-hour day . The compositors also have a great and powerful union , and have long been well organized . From this to fourteen , fifteen , sixteen hours a day , all hours are worked in different trades . Those work longest who are least organized and who work in small workshops . It is the small workshop , in fact , which is peculiarly the curse of London labor , for it eludes the comprehensive glance of the factory inspector . I am glad to say , however , that the new women inspectors have begun vigorously to set the law in motion in dress and millinery workshops where young women and girls are employed . The worst cases of sweating are in the tailoring and upholstery trades . This involves literally thousands of small rooms being converted into workshops , and it is physically impossible for the inspectors , were they ten times as numerous as they are , to examine into all these places . The compulsory registration of every room , if even it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy penalties attached , is the first requisite . But more important and far reaching is the substitution of the large industry for the small , either under capitalist control or on co-operative principles . XVhen you have the large industry , then labor combination ( which is impossible or at least very difficult among isolated sweated workers ) becomes easy of achievement , and the sub-contract system , fruitful parent of evils , tends to decline and fall . Owing to Socialist and labor agitation in London , the London County Council and the London School Board have both decided to accept no contracts in which the contracting firms do not pay the trade union rate of wages , and it is to be hoped that in time the London County Council will have its own municipal workshops , leading to the elimination of the capitalist altogether . The average London worker is physically a stunted , badly nourished man , unless he is engaged in a healthy outdoor pursuit , like , e. g. , the licensed porters at Covent Garden or the laborers employed in the parks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London from the country , the marked ! Ilecline in physique would be startling . One of the busiest public medical officers of health in East London told me that every working-girl he had had under his hands suffered from awemia , and that not one was fit to be the mother of a family . The British army , as is generally known , has been compelled to lower its standard , because it could not get recruits up to mark . The Londoner , in fact , is about played out in three generations ; and as the supply from the country will not go on forever , - indeed , is already beginning to decline , - it is evident that some great social change must be brought about , if only to avert permanent physical decay . During the winter months medical inspectors have certified that nearly twentyfive per cent of the children in the London Board schools go to school of a morning without any breakfast , or with an insufficient one consisting of dry bread and weak tea . It is a physical impossibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rheumatism , typhoid , and consumption appear to be the most frequent diseases . And now look at the average workman from the moral and intellectual points of view . XVhat are his tastes , ideas , sentiments ? The working classes of England have great practical sagacity and judgment , as the management of their trade unions shows . But in the higher regions of intelligence they are usually sadly lacking . We must remember that the state did not provide education for the people in England until 1870 , and that consequently the country was far behind Germany , Scotland , Switzerland , Holland , Norway or the New England States . And even to-day , though much has been done , I should say that // England is ( excepting of course Russia ) the worst educated of the great countries of the world . The English people are not naturally a very intelligent people . Matthew Arnold said with truth that , while French literature was a literature of intelligence , English literature was a literature of power . A French workman is a polished gentleman compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to practical organization , the latter will beat the Frenchman out of the field . No artificial means will ever perhaps change the fundamental nature of the English people ; but unquestionably popular education is having its effect ; it is making people discontented , and that is the first step towards a better state of things . So long as people are willing to live in dirty slums , to work as long as a capitalist likes for such wages as he chooses to give them , and to be treated as scarcely human , so long they are hopeless . They must be incited to an active spirit of revolt before they are of any use . Nothincr b in the shape of political freedom or social betterment has been won for mankind without insurrection ; no possessing class ever concedes anything voluntarily , - there is not a single case of the kind recorded in history . Therefore the spirit of rebellion in the workman must be aroused . Whether that spirit involves physical revolt is a mere incident . It need not in modern times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and democratic institutions ; and heavy will be the responsibility of those who cause violence , directly or indirectly . But , violence or no violence , there must be revolt ; and the spirit of revolt has penetrated a section of the workingmen of London , and it is beginning to animate the working-women , without whose aid men by themselves can not effect the needful change . Increase of knowledge , somewhat keener intelligence , and a spirit of revolt , - these are among the results attained in recent years . The English workman receives , and I think will continue to receive , more real education from his work , his trade union and his intercourse with his fellows than from books . The trade union has been a most powerful educating force in England , where it is stronger and better than anywhere else in the world . Workmen are now also entering largely into municipal life , as members of town councils and school boards . There are several workmen on the London County Council and on the municipal councils in the North of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably forty or fifty workingmen candidates for Parliament . The London working classes , like the workmen in all modern cities , are great newspaper readers . They affect the evening and the weekly papers more than the morning journals , for they have no time in the mornings to read . Sunday is a great day for the papers . On Sunday morning the London workman , who has to rise early other days , indulges in the luxury of lying long in bed . He sends one of his children to the nearest news agent 's shop for a copy of a Sunday paper , which he reads in bed . I must say a word about the Sunday paper , - a great institution in London . The daily London papers do not appear on Sunday ; but their places are taken by a host of other weekly papers , some nine or ten in number , some of which have an enormous circulation ; e. g. , Lloyd 's circulates 710,000 copies , the People about 300,000 , Reynolds some 360,000 . This , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going all over the country . They are all fairly well written , and most of them contain serial stories ; but I believe it is the murders and the tragedies which take hold of the average reader most firmly . The English translation of Zola 's " Germinal " appeared in the People , and that of the same author 's " Debacle " in the Weekly Times and Echo , while Mrs. Besant 's autobiography has attracted a great many readers to the Weekly Sun . Socialism has now been preached for a good while by Reynolds and by the Weekly Times and Echo . The Referee is mainly a sporting paper , but many read it for the sake of the paragraphs written by Mr. George R. Sims , the popular writer , who , however , has greatly fallen off from his original promise . // One or other of these organs xviii be brought back from the news agent and duly handed up to father in his bed . That individual , after he has read what he wants , will rise , put on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barber 's , perhaps , to get a clean shave . After that , if he is a member of a club , he xviii stroll down there . And here I must again diverge to say something about workingmen 's clubs , which , if not peculiar to England , are far more developed there than anywhere else . There are some three hundred workingmen 's clubs in London , mostly political , but some purely social . The great majority of the political clubs are Radical ; what Conservative clubs for workmen there are are usually not established by the men themselves , but by some Conservative rich man , who wants - to put it plainly - to buy votes thereby . The Radical clubs are genuine workmen 's clubs , paid for and managed by workmen themselves , sometimes with pecuniary aid by the richer Radicals . They are of all sorts and sizes , the numbers ranging from one hundred to eighteen hundred . The annual subscription is usually $1.25 , and the work of the club is all done voluntarily . I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves working after hours . You must not suppose that all these clubs are composed of active politicians . Nothing of the kind . Out of a club of five hundred members , e. g. , you may find perhaps a dozen actively interested in politics . The rest have joined for social reasons . A political lecture takes place at nearly every club on Sunday morning , at many on Sunday evenings as well . The subjects treated are largely economic , and the majority of lecturers treat them from the Socialist point of view . Twenty years ago Secularism , as preached by the late Mr. Bradlaugh , was all the rage in these clubs ; now it is Socialism , labor struggles , cooperation , with a glance now and then at the iniquities of the House of Lords . Only a few go to the lectures ; the majority are otherwise employed . if you enter the club on Sunday morning at about eleven , you will find a considerable croxvd at the bar , mostly drinking beer , though a few take whiskey . If our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug of beer up to the lecture-room , where he will light his pipe and drink in the fluid and the oratory at the same time . Once in a while the bar attendant will come in and pots will be refilled . I may say that , although I have visited these clubs at least a hundred times , I have never seen any one drunk . I do n't say they never get drunk ; I merely state the fact . Clubs without drink have been tried , but they are usually failures . I know of only one such club - a small one - of those I have visited in London . The lecture is usually from three quarters of an hour to an hour in length , and is followed by a discussion , in which most of the speakers show that curious incapacity for lucid expression and consecutive reasoning which characterizes most London workingmen . The great mass of the members will probably be at a billiard handicap , which generally takes place on Sundays , or they will be playing chess or sitting round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief strike that happens to be on ; or , not seldom , I regret to say , about the odds on the next race . Here is England 's great vice , affecting all classes , the vice of perpetually betting on races . This is what distinguishes the English workman from his Continental brethren . Betting on the Continent is entirely confined to the rich and the bourgeoisie ; the workingmen there are free from this senseless and degrading vice , which , I am persuaded , does more to keep back the development of the labor cause in England ( associated as it is with the insane English love of sport ) than any other cause whatever . I was once standing in the railway station at Middlesbrough , the great iron town in the North of England , when I observed quite a rush of workmen , iron workers , for a train that came in with the evening papers . I found that all these men had heavy sums involved in a *ig race that was on the next week , and they wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // largely used for sporting information , so much so that in numbers of libraries now the authorities have caused the sporting column to be blackened out , just as the Russian censor blackens out obnoxious paragraphs . There is a deal of hypocritical cant in England about French vices ; but I am certain there is not a city in France where such a measure as this would be necessary . Vices are different in different countries , and most people are prone to condemn the vices of others and forget their own . For my part I should say that the harmfulness of any vice is exactly in proportion as it causes neglect of our social duties ; and from this point of view England certainly does not stand well as compared with many other of the leading countries of the civilized world . Do the London working classes read anything besides newspapers ? Well , not very much as a rule , unless you count the penny novelettes , read much by women , and having an enormous sale ; as literature these are of the good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young heroes who manage to come in at the right moment , and whom no one ever met in real life . Miss Agnes Repplier , in one of her bright essays , has given an account of this kind of reading . Working boys like to read blood-curdling stories of Sweeney Todd , the demon barber of London , or of Deadwood Dick , or some other wild West hero . Every now and then one hears of some unusual case of an artisan or even laborer showing a taste for a high order of writing . I have heard of one workman teaching himself Italian in order to read Dante . I have met another - a man who probably never earned five dollars a week regularly in his life - whose favorite author was Spinoza . I asked him one day in the little bar of a drinking shop what he had been reading last . " Well , " said he , " I have just been reading Mr. Symond 's book on Shelley " ; and he afterwards recited Shelley 's " Ode to Liberty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Mr. Augustine Birre 1 , the author of " Obiter Dicta , " say that he had gone a few days before into a bookshop and asked if Carlyle was still selling well . " Yes , " said the bookseller , " I sold two copies of Sartor Resartus ' yesterday to two gentlemen in black ; one was a clergyman and the other a chimney-sweep . " I know of an unskilled laborer , now on the London Trades Council , who taught himself French in order to read Marx 's " I ) as Kapital " in that language before it was translated into English ; though this , perhaps , indicates greater interest in political economy than in literature . These are , of course , exceptional cases . Speaking generally , the greater part of classical English poetry is a sealed book to English workingmen . We talk of such and such authors being popular ; but after all their popularity is middle class , not universal . England has never produced a great people 's poet like Burns ; and while in Wales the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated , in England the old ballads do not touch so deep a chord . It is significant , sadly significant , that while in Wales the popular festival is the Eisteddford , in England it is Derby day . At the same time , a good story of pathos &amp;r family life always takes well among the English masses . A friend of mine who superintends a night shelter for destitute men , where , once a week , readings and music are given , tells me that pathetic stories take best with the men . They like such things as Tennyson 's " Rizpah " or Dickens 's account of the death of " Little Nell , " or any short story of suffering , of lovers divided , of tragic death , or of those mortal things which , as the Latin writer says , touch the mind . There is now quite a deal of recitation in the parks on Sunday afternoon , and I have observed that at these the domestic pathetic story tells best . Any torcible story , song , or verse couched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kipling 's " Barrack-room Ballads , " always goes down well . Such being the intellectual interests of the London working classes , what is their moral state and their attitude toward religion ? John Stuart Mill incurred some temporary odium by declaring that the English working classes were largely venal // and lying . For my part , I have always found lying most prevalent among the shopkeeping class in every country ; and as trade is mostly a sort of trickery , a trying to persuade you to buy what you do n't need , it is not surprising that its methods should breed falsehood . There is a good deal of sexual irregularity among the London working classes , but much of it is connected with economic causes . There is a good deal of drunkenness also , though this I believe to be a declining factor all over England . The Labor Commission has recently reported a diminution of drunkenness all over the rural districts , and my own obseryation tells me that there is less in London than when I was a boy . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conspicuous in London , especially on holidays . I have spent the T4th of July , the French national fl/c , in Paris , walking about the whole day from ten A. M. till three the next morning , except during meals , in every part of the city , rich and poor , and I only saw one drunken man , and not a single act of rowdyism or even of marked impoliteness . In London I have seen fifty drunken people in a walk of a mile and a half on the weekly Saturday half-holiday , hundreds of times over . I was told by a government official in Vienna that , after a popular file in the Prater , where 300,000 people were assembled , there was not one single case the next day in the police courts ; in London there would have been hundreds of cases . XVhere people in London do not get drunk , they behave in a rowdy and offensive way after they have been drinking for a time . Indeed , what strikes one I think in London above everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , and nowhere more than among working-girls . A London bank holiday is an essentially vulgar thing . The people are good humored , they do not mean to be offensive , but they are vulgar and noisy . The quiet , easy way in which a Frenchman will enjoy himself with his family is one of the most pleasant traits in French character . The corresponding Englishman is apt to get angry with his children , then to quarrel with his wife , and then to adjourn to a public house where gin is served all round , often even to the children ; and they emerge more disagreeable and noisy than ever . The French family would have sat down to a bottle of light wine , with syrup for the children , and have arisen bright and gay as before . On the other hand , there is not the absinthe drinking in London which is having such a fatal effect on the Parisians . Gin , beer and whiskey are the chief London drinks , the beer often being adulterated to stimulate thirst . Crime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in such a way as to make it appear the other way . I can remember the time when a murder was a startling affair , which was enough of itself to sell an edition of a paper ; now the murder must be accompanied by sensational incidents to attract much attention . Scores of unrecorded murders take place in London every year . On the whole subject of the persistence and growth of crime I would refer readers to the able work by Mr. Morrison , in Sonnenschein 's " Social Science Library . " England is backward and unscientific in dealing with her criminal class , and is really helping to create criminals by the palpable injustice and absurdity of her sentences . Property is regarded as more sacred than life ; hence a poor woman who steals sixpence will get a far severer sentence than some brute who half murders his child . But of course this is the tendency of capitalist civilization everywhere . Modern crime is pretty evenly divided among all classes , except perhaps the highly cultivated and not too rich persons , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament now serving out their term in prison , some for revolting offences , it can not be said that the working classes are particularly bad . Crime is largely bred by enforced idleness , ( lue to our present commercial system , which is always throwing a large number of men on to the streets . A Catholic priest in a poor district of East London told me that , in the next street to where his church stood , every house was occupied by professional thieves , but they were largely // composed of , and the new members entirely recruited from , the class reduced to compulsory idleness . If a man has no work to do , he must beg or steal , unless he surrenders his liberty by going into the workhouse . And so we are brought round at every turn to the labor problem as being the root question . And now as to religion . If by religion is meant acceptance of a creed and joining in acts of worship , the London working classes have no religion , broadly speaking , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found at mass on Sunday morning . The Protestant Church in its various branches is essentially a middle-class institution . I must except certain churches where the younger High Church clergy minister and where a fair sprinkling of wage-earners may be found ; but these clergy , though Anglican , would repudiate the term Protestant , and therefore my generalization holds good . A chapel like that which was Spurgeon 's is shopkeeping , not working class ; and indeed , with a few exceptions here and there , the Dissenters are even more out of touch with the working classes than the Church of England is . I think if you asked the average London artisan what he thought of the Archbishop of Canterbury with his palaces and enormous salary and his brother bishops , that artisan would tell you that in his opinion they were humbugs . But I do not find that generally there is so much direct hostility to the church as indifference to it . The workingman no more concerns himself with churches and chapels than with Italian opera or the Royal Asiatic Society ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his line . You must not therefore suppose he is an Atheist , that his attitude is identical with that of the Berlin and Paris working classes . The Atheist and Secularist propaganda has been carried on , very vigorously in London and in other large English towns for the last thirty years . Its chief apostle was the late Mr. Charles Bradlaugh , a man of enormous energy , wielding immense influence over his fellows . But he has left no successor , and his death seemed to be the outward and visible sign of the inward decay of the Secularist movement . I recently asked two very prominent London clergymen who have had much to do with the working classes , Mr. Hugh Price Hughes of the Wesleyan Methodists , and Prof. Shuttleworth , Broad Churchman , to tell me what they thought about the position of Secularism . They both assured me it was dying out . I am told that Secularist lectures attract smaller and smaller audiences , and that Socialism has completely taken the place held by Secularism twenty years ago . In Manchester , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of that city three times on a Sunday with a paying audience . Nothing of the sort could be done now . Apparently people are tired of mere negation , tired of the Bradlaugh creed , which was thus wittily summed up by the late Archbishop of York : " No God , no king , and as few people as possible . " People want to know , not what does not exist , but what does ; they want to know how human life shall be made better and happier . I note this even in the Secular movement ; for Mr. Robertson , who is by far the ablest man Mr. Bradlaugh left behind him , occupies himself mainly with social questions and is indeed a kind of Socialist . Mrs. Besant , as is well known , broke with the Secularists some time ago . The working classes believe , and rightly believe , as I think , that their first need is a better material condition ; not only better food and clothes , but more leisure , and , above all , less precariousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less onerous and less dependent on the speculative gambling of capitalists . Till these things are in some degree secured , I am convinced the working classes will not trouble their heads with religion ; not because they are necessarily hostile , but because the daily battle for bread taxes the energies of their entire nature . I recently said this in an audience of London clergy , which I had been specially requested to address , and I found that nearly every one agreed ; and they were men all of whom had worked in poor parishes . I will say at the same time that all the prominent London labor leaders - and I count many of them among my personal friends - are as convinced as any religious // teacher can be that the life is more than meat and the body than raiment , and that material improvement is desirable chiefly because it will afford the basis for a higher moral and intellectual life . It would be absurd to draw a picture of the London workingman without telling about his amusements . In large sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in their lives . When you know that in London there are 5o , ooo families living in one room apiece , and 70,000 in two rooms , you at once see that here there is an enormous class , comprising altogether some 6oo , ooo human beings , to whom even . cheap amusement is scarcely possible . These people get their pleasures , such as they are , mainly in the street . The men of this class work fearfully hard when work is to be got , and either tramp about or loaf round posts at street corners when there is none . The children are very fond of dancing in the streets to the strains of Cockney music-hall songs ground out by the piano-organ men ; and they dance very well . The growing youths of this class are perhaps the greatest pests of London . Filthy in mind and language , they like to prowl about in gangs , yelling at the tops of their voices , and altogether behaving as I have never seen people behave in any other city of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . XVe may almost eliminate this large class in considering London amusements ; and we thus come to the class above , which is in the main the class above Mr. Charles Booth 's poverty line . London is a wonderful place of amusement , both for rich and comparatively poor . There are twice as many theatres as in Paris , and music halls innumerable . On the other hand , there are none of the beer gardens which are such picturesque objects in Germany and Switzerland . The number of people who get their living , directly or indirectly , by amusement is immense . On a recent occasion , when Augustus Harris , the noted impresario , brought out three operas in one night , five hundred and fifty people were employed , exclusive of dressers , scene shifters and ticket sellers . You do not find many purely workingclass people in the leading London theatres , as a general rule . You may go to some without seeing a single working man or woman . It is especially the music ball which is the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which American visitors to London would be likely to go , such as the Empire or the Tivoli , but places in out-of-the-way working-class districts , such as the Southwark Palace , the Washington Music Hall in Battersea , the Star Music Hall in Bermondsey , the East End Pavilion , the Queen Theatre of Varieties at Poplar , and dozens of small places which have a music and dancing license . Of late years quite a music-hall " cult " has grown up : it is the thing to go to music halls and to know all about the Cockney songs and the principal artists , who are all great heroes and heroines in the eyes of working-girls and street boys . Most of the songs are excessively vulgar , and some of them even more excessively stupid , but a few are real gems of pathos and humor , especially those sung by that prince of London humorists ; Albert Chevalier . The songs first produced at the more fashionable music halls filter down to the less fashionable ones , and are then reproduced a hundred thousand times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are then forgotten , to be succeeded by new favorites , which appear with startling rapidity ; you can go to one of the poorer music halls for four or five cents , and consequently they are usually pretty full . I have never heard in my rare visits to music halls a single song with any doubtful element in it . Most were vulgar , a few were pretty and pleasant , one or two simply inane , and a few almost drearily and painfully moral . Most had reference to some phase of London life . There was a fair sale of drink at the bar , but I saw no one drunk ; and the people as they came out were far less hilarious than are the well-to-do youths who emerge from the West End music halls . On bank holidays the seaside places near London are those most affected , particularly Margate , Brighton , Southend and Clactin ; as many as from ten thousand // to fifteen thousand persons will go for the day to Southend by rail , apart from those who go by river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive resort . The country is little frequented : you may spend a whole holiday within twenty miles of London and never see a single Cockney . The modern town-bred Englishman does not seem to care for the country at all , - a very fortunate fact for those of us who want a quiet holiday in woods and fields , for there is no quiet where Cockneydom is found . And now , finally , what are the politics of the London working classes ? Politically London has a curious record . In the Commonwealth times it was for the Parliament , and all through the last century it was Whig , " Wilkes and Liberty " being for years a popular cry . London was strongly for Parliamentary reform , and the public entrance of Garibaldi into London is still spoken of by those who saw it as the greatest celebration London ever witnessed . Of late years London has become so huge and amorphous that any active common political life has become almost impossible . At present the divisions of opinion are something like this : the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is Tory ; the aristocratic portion , where the town houses of peers and plutocrats are , is overwhelmingly Tory ; suburban villadom is still again Tory ; working-class London in east and south is mainly Radical or Labor . At the last reapportionment of seats , in 1884 , London was so shamefully gerrymandered that it is impossible to get at its true opinion . The older Liberalism is absolutely dead among the London working classes ; it has no chance at all as against a sort of democratic Toryism , with a strong flavor of protectionist opinion . The only real political life there is in London is among the Labor organizations ; and in order to win seats , Liberal candidates have adopted much of the Labor program , especially shorter hours , fair wages for public employees or workmen engaged on public contracts , municipalization of monopolies , and progressive taxation of unearned increment . London has fifty-nine members in Parliament , and of these thirty-four are Tory , twenty-three Liberal , and two Labor . In the County Council the majority is overwhelmingly Progressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having been almost annihilated at the last election . The Progressives , however , are likely to share the fate of all very big majorities , to divide among themselves , and their cause has been a good deal injured by two members of their party having been found guilty of petty frauds . We may therefore see a strong rally of the Moderates next time . The real line of division between the two parties may be said to be the line between Socialism and Individualism , the Progressives going for extending the powers and functions of the municipality , the Moderates being for individual ownership and control , or rather-for that is what it comes to in our times - ownership and control by private companies . That the Socialist solution will prevail through the votes of the working classes there is no more doubt than there is of the dawn of another day . The working classes of London do not care about what is ordinarily called politics , I. e. , constitutional forms . They are indifferent as to whether there is or is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of lords . But even that feeling is based on economic grounds , or the ground that the lords are " those who toil not , neithor do they spin , " but live in luxury on the toil of other people . In short , London working-class politics are , as Mr. John Burns put it , " bread-and-butter politics , " tile endeavor of those who live a hard , scrambling , hand-to-mouth existence to use the forces of the state for their own material improvement . In this their instinct is right . Edmond About said of the modern Greeks , that so long as they could obtain some of the luxuries of life , they could dispense with its necessaries . But under the murky gloom of a London sky , warmth , food and shelter must come first . Let these be secure , absolutely secure , to every human being , and we can on that basis rear a worthy human superstructure , but until that is done very little else is possible .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
