txt Some of the industrious members of what is called the National Executive Silver Committee may with good reason complain that the attitude of certain " friends of silver " toward them is very discouraging . Mr. IVAN C. MICHELS of Washington , D. C. , who says that he " first suggested the silver convention held in St. Louis in 1880 , " and that he was present by invitation at the first meeting of the committee , sends to the Engineering and Alining Journal a letter in which he asserts boldly that a prominent member of the committee is moved by considerations of a pecuniary and sordid character . It appears that some one has recently said that Mr. MICHELS " gives his aid and time to the silver men for revenue only . " ) Ir . MICHELS admits that this is true , and incidentally remarks that Senator JONES paid him for certain statistical facts prepared to be used in the Senator 's latest speech in the Senate on the silver question . Then ho asks why he should give his " services to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to say about a prominent member 's motives : " L. M. RUMSEY is the head and tail of that National Executive Silver Committee . ' His ? name appears in bold letters on all the manifestoes issued by that committee ; ho foots the bills , and well he may . Ms interests are to get $1.20 per ounce for fine silver , and ho can well afford to spend his money toward paying for the services , such as they are , of those connected with that association . Mr. L. M. RUMSEY , as the President of the Granite Mountain Mining Company , can well afford it ! " Mr. MicHELs then quotes the following , which he says can be found on page 5 of President Rehr Y 'S report for 1889. to the stockholders of the Granite Mountain Mining Company : " On this telegram , showing $75,000 not in sight , for $7,700 expended , the syndicate made the first payment of $20,000 on the bond duo . The quantity and quality of the ore having steadily improved , on Aug. 1 , .1881 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the syndicate owned the property , and proceeded to organize the company . " " Considering , " Mr. MICHELS continues , " that the company was floated with a nominal capital of $10,000,000 on $47,700 invested , and that according to page 20 of the same report the cost of production of pure silver is given at about 121 cents per fine ounce , and that dividends to the amount of about $2,000,000 per annum have been paid , it would be presumptuous , " in his opinion , to ask certain persons connected with the committee " to work for glory . " Of course it is true that Mr. RUMSEY 'S mine is a very valuable piece of property . Everybody knows that . Wo find in a Montana paper an abstract of the report of the Directors for the year ending on July 31 , 1890 , which shows that the receipts for that year wore $3,873,808 , of which the comfortable stint of $2,500,000 was paid in dividends . In the ten years that had elapsed since the beginning of work , dividends amounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently published in the Engineering and Mixing Journal shows that the stockholders have received $1,300,000 in dividends in ten months of the present year . The original investment ? which was $47,700 , if Mr. MICHELS has not been misinformed  --  has yielded a very handsome return , even if the price of silver has not been $1.20 per ounce . If it be true that it very large bliaro of the expenses of the National Executive hilver Committee is paid , and paid cheerfully , by Mr. IWMSEY , we presume that ho eau afford to display in this manner his friendship for " the white metal , " But does it fellow that he is moved only by a desire to procure legislation which would , in his opinion , raise the price of silver to $1.29 per ounce , and thus increase the already enormous profits of the Granite Mountain Mining Company I This may bo a narrow view of his motives , Mr. MZCILELS must have observed in his dealings with such men that they have come to regard the metal as a sentient substance which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable when treated with respect . Is it not possible that Mr. RUMSEY is moved by gratitude ? He is a " friend " of silver because silver has boon a good friend to him , and ho wants to show this friend that ho is not insensible to kindness and benefits . If it should happen incidentally that his efforts in behalf of his friend should increase the profits of his mine , he would accept the higher price , undoubtedly ,  --  but ho would not rejoice because his profits had become greater . He would be pleased because his friend had risen in public esteem , so to speak , and his feelings would be as unselfish as those of all owners of silver mines are when the price of silver stirs up their emotions .
