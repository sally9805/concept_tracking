txt While the award of contracts for the new torpedo boats will be a more complicated and difficult task than the award for the battleships , which is all plain sailing , the gratifying lesson is the same in both cases  --  namely , the gradual increase in the Government 's resources for building war vessels and the decrease in their cost . Never until now have me had . Eve bids for " building - Steel .. battleships ; and the bids of ' the ' DIALOGUES of Camden and of the Bath Iron Works of Maine , though unsuccessful , were only $11,000 and $30,000 , respectively , below that of the CRAMPS of Philadelphia , who were among the three winners . There was remarkably close figuring also ' among the winning bids , and the conclusion is not only that the probable cost of big ships of the line has become a matter of very exact calculation , but that we have at least five firms to count on for building such ships . As to price , although the Newport News Company asks $245,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for either the Kentucky or the Kearsarge , probably of about the same displacement and of the same speed , yet the Philadelphia firm bids $170,000 less for one ship this year , and the Union Iron Works of San Francisco $65,050 less . The Virginia firm was reputed to be so anxious last year to secure a battleship , even should little or no profit result , that its higher price now really indicates less accurately the general tendency than do the decreased bids of the other two firms . Besides , the financial disturbances of the present year were expected to have some influence , although happily they do not seem to have had much . But the true inference , as has been pointed out , may best be drawn from observing that six years ago the average contract price for the hull and machinery of our first three battleships , all built by the Pennsylvania and California firms that are now again successful bidders , exceeded $3,070,000 each , whereas the average successful bidding for the present two is not quite $2,640,000 , or over $430,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers on the three . Besides , this , year 's ships are much larger , perhaps displacing from 1,000 to 1,200 tons more than our first group , and their contracts also call for a full knot more speed . Again , for the Iowa , contracted for in 1893 , and probably of about the same displacement as these new ships , while having the same guaranteed speed of 16 knots , the stipulated price is $3,010,000 , so that we now have an average decrease of $370,000 from her cost , or $1,110,000 for the three ships . And to these gains for the Government must be added a decided fall of late in the price of armor plates
