txt Speaker REED shows a curious and foolish waywardness in his treatment of the House during the period that it is without established . rifles . The House having refused to adopt the rules of the last Congre , and not having yet adopted any fur itself , it is practically within the power of the Speaker to do anything that the majority will vote to sustain him in when an appeal IS taken . But this situation is one that is so obviously open to abuse that a sensitive man in the Speaker 's chair-would nat urally avoid all occasion for reasonable suspicion that he was willing to abuse it . Mr. REED , however , apparently in a mood of mere recklessness and with no serious advantage to gain for any good or bad purpose of his own or of his party's. wields this power in a most arbitrary fashion . Yesterday he overra:ed a point of order made by Mr. HoLmAx that a bill appropriating money must be read in Committee of the Whole , and on appeal he was sustained . lie then consented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whole on the bill , and it was carried . No mischief was done , therefore , but a thoroughly vicious proceeding - was indulged in , by the mere personal authority of the Speaker , - which might have resulted in serious mischief . Mr. REED , - who is not without ambition , ought to remember that a reputation for soberness of judgment , and , for prudence in guarding the public interests against even accidental injury or encroachment , is a valuable thing for a public man to possess .
