txt The firing by the New York , Oregon , and New Orleans , briefly reporCed last night , was directed against a Spanish torpedo-boat destroyer , probably the Furor or the Pluton . The character of the enemy was not definitely known until this afternoon , when the torpedo boat Porter found two loaded torpedoes floating off shOre . Neither of them had been discharged . One sank , but the other was hauled on board the Porter . It exactly fitted the ' description of the torpedoes carried by the Pluton and the Furor . It is believed the torpedo-boat destroyer escaped . She was seen first by  --  the New Orleans when too far away to do any damage , and the heavy fire must have driven her back . Commander Fremont of the Porter this afternoon brought the torpedo which he had recovered alongside the New York . It was a fourteen-inch Whitehead of modern make , and worth about $3,500 . It was in perfect condition , and had any of our ships struck it while it floated , it would have exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find was not only valuable , but most fortunate . The torpedo which sunk had an exercise head on , and had no war nose . In other words , it would not have exploded .. Vigilant precautions against a night torpedo attack have been a distinguishing feature of Admiral Sampson 's policy ever since the commencement of the war , and last night proved the efficiency of the arrangements . Everything moved just as smoothly as if in the case of a day engagement . In spite of the difficulty experienced in seeing the enemy , had a torpedo boat come anywhere near the range of the effective fire of the fleet it undoubtedly would have been shot to pieces . It is possible that there were two torpedo boats out last night , although only one is believed to have approached anywhere near our ships . The ability of a Spanish torpedo-boat destroyer to get out from the harbor is not regarded as a sign that the Merrimac does not block the channel leading into it . Torpedo-boat destroyers draw . so little water and have so little beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rimac would prevent them from coming out . It is pretty certain , however , that big 1$ships could not follow suit , even If they wished to , which is unlikely .
