txt The finest gun camera ever built is being constructed in Chicago by William Gaertner for the Smithsonian Institution at Washing-ton . The specifications for this splendid instrument require that it shall be capable of making a successful exposure in one six-hundredth of a second , and it is hoped that this speed will be so greatly increased that a good negative may be secured by an exposure of only a thousandth of a second . This marvelous rapidity in photographing has never been approached save by one camera , which is said to have secured a negative by an exposure of one five-hundredth of a second , but the history of this instrument is a matter of tradition rather than of actual record . Its origin and ownership seem to be unknown in the circles of scientific photography . Beyond all question the gun camera for the Smithsonian Institution is by far the best telephotographic Instrument ever attempted , and surpa , s$e all others of its kind . A better appreciation of the marvelous alertness of this mechanial eye is to be gained from the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow speeding through midair while the bowstring is still ouivering from the recoil of its propulsive action . The snap of its trigger , when its sights are well aimed for an instant on the body of the fleetest game bird in full flight , will impress on the negative a faithful picture of the bird , of which the naked ej e is unable to discern the wing movements . But the , principal purpose which this camera is designed to serve is tnat or photographing the aerodromes with which Prof. S. P. Langley , Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution , is conducting elaborate scientific experiments in an attempt at the solution of the problem of aerial navigation . How important a part this camera will play in the scientific record of these experiments is suggested by the fact that the instrument is fitted with delicate measuring apparatus , by which the precise angle at which the camera is tilted at the moment of the exposure is known to the operator , and is also photographed on the plate . This device will enable a scientist to determine , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object photographed .
