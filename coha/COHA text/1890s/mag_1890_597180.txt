THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOSEPH JEFFERSON.1 CROWN BY S. LAWRENCE . L*THOGRAPHED BY E. MORTON . EDWIN FORREST ABOUT 1835.2 EDWIN FORREST . N the year 8854 I became manager for John T. Ford of the theater in Richmond , Virginia . The romantic dramaof " The Seaof Ice " was produced with splendid success , and was followed by " The Naiad Qtieen , " which enjoyed equal popularity . The season was altogether quite a brilliant one , and included among its attractions some of the first stars of the country . Miss Agnes Robertson , known as the " Fairy Star , " accompanied by her husband , Mr. Dion t3oucicault , headed the list , which terminated with Edwin Forrest . This popular tragedian was then in his prime , anti what a handsome fellow he was The form of an Apollo , with the strength of a Hercules his deep , musical voice was under perfect control , and in the isathetic scenes of Gade and T7Iugbiius full of tears . As a melodramatic actor he stood 2 The pictures in this article are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his competitors . In Shakspercan characters he was considered too robust and extravagant . So far as matters relating to his own profession were concerned , he was undoubtedly a student , his readings being faultless , and fPll of feeling . In private he could be very agreeable ; his conversation was both humorous and witty , and his anecdotes were told with excellent effect . During my long professional life I met him frequently , and I should say that much of his unhappiness-for he was a very unhappy man-came from an irritable temper , under little control . His nature , unfortunately , was not softened by that sweet and gradual ascent to good fortune that is so humanizing . Happy are those who in the race for fame advance steadily and by degrees , making no hurried strides , but losing no ground ; shaking hands with their competitors as they go by them , and making honest room for them to pass should they come up again . Forrest with one leap bounded to the front . No new triumphs awaited him , and as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal pass him by . During those fits of anger which came upon him from the inefficiency of his dramatic support he was childish and unreasonable - having no power of recognizing the distinction between a man who tries his best and fails , and he who fails because he does not try at all . During the engagement of which I am about to speak , and on one occasion while we were rehearsing " Damon and Pythias , " Edwin Adams , who was cast for Py//ilas , was going through the exciting scene in which that character parts with Ga/azit/ic . Forrest took exception to the business arrangements of the stage ; but as this n-as one of his quiet , dignified mornings , he made his objections with respectful deference , saying that if Mr. Adams would allow him he would suggest some new business that might improve the scene . Adams expressed himself as quite willing to receive any instruction ; so Forrest went through the parting with Ga/ant/u ' , giving some new and very good suggestions . Adams tried but failed to catch Forrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally Forrest became impatient . Again taking Adams 's place , he rushed towards the fainting form of Ga/ant/ic , and as he dropped 1 Copyright , 1889 , hy JOSEPH JEFFERSON .

Now it is always a comical thing to see a man 's high black-silk hat tumble from his head , but especially when he is going through a tragic scene . Forrest for a moment hesitated whether he should pause and pick up the hat or not ; at last he made a savage grab for it , but it eluded his grasp , and , slipping through his fingers , rolled round the stage , he pursuing it with tragic passion . The company , one by one , turned their heads away , quietly enjoying his discomfiture . At last he secured it , and fixing it firmly on his head , he l ) roceeded with the action of the scene . He felt we had been laughing at him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again . " Farewell , my love , " cried he in dire woe . He then tore himself from her embrace , and madly careering up the stage ran head first into a scene that the carpenters were moving across the stage , mashing the unlucky hat over his eyes . He struggled manfully to get it off ; but with no effect till Adams and myself came to the rescue . We were now all in a roar of laughter . For a moment he looked bewildered and even angry , but as the absurdity of the scene dawned upon him he joined in the merriment , and said it was the most ridiculous thing that had ever occurred . At the conclusion of the Richmond engagement the company journeyed to Washington , where we were to open with Forrest as 1k/a ; ; wra-a character that he detested , and one that the public admired . Forrest was always in a state of intense irritation during the rehearsal and performance of this drama . Irregularities that he would have overlooked under ordinary circumstances were now magnified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buckskin shirt , and stuck the hunting-knife of the American savage in his wampum belt , he was ready to scalp any offending actor who dared to cross his path . The copper-colored liquid with which he stained his cheeks might literally have been called " war paint . " At the rehearsal the poor property man , old lake Search , got in a dreadful state of nervousness , and everything went wrong . The tragedian naturally held me , as stage-manager , responsible for these accidents , particularly as the unlucky Jake would conceal himself behind set l ) ieces , or mysteriously disappear through traps as each mishap occurred . In the midst of this dreadful confusion , principally brought about by his own ill-humor , Forrest turned on me , saying he would not act that night , and strode out of the theater . I hurried through the front of the house , and heading him off in the alley addressed him , as nearly as I can remember , in the following words : " Mr. Forrest , before you decide upon this step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not crossed your mind . " He saw I was in earnest , and stopped short to listen , as I resumed : " Mr. Ford , the manager , is absent , so I must take his responsibility to the public on myself . The blunders on the stage this morning have been unfortunate , perhaps culpable , but you must pardon me for saying that your excited manner and somewhat unreasonable demands have contributed not a little to confuse the company and bring about this disorder . But be that as it may , there is another and still more important matter to consider . Every seat in the theater is taken for to-night ; the audience will crowd the house in expectation of a great dramatic treat , to which they have been looking forward for some time . If you decline to act , and so break your contract with the public , what course is left for me ? Why , only this : I must wait for the vast concourse of people to assemble , and then go before them and explain the reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of the case , and say that you have refused to act because there were some slight discrepancies and irregularities in the rehearsal . The public are , you know , quite unreasonable when their diversion is checked , and it is likely that they will be indignant at the disappointment , failing to see the reason as clearly as you may have done . Now consider for a moment : under these circumstances will it not be more magnanimous in you to overlook the shortcomings and go on with the rehearsal ? He paused for a moment and said : " I will not go back to the rehearsal . I am too much excited , and my presence on the stage now will only make matters worse ; but if you will see that details are attended to , I will act tonight . " I promised to do so , and we parted . I was only too glad to get rid of him on those terms , in his then intemperate state of mind . I went back to the stage and dismissed the rehearsal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night 's performance creditable . I now began to hunt up the delinquent and frightened property man , Jake Search ,  --  an appropriate name for a fellow who needed so much looking after ,  --  and discovered him hiding under a pile of old scenery . " Is he gone ? " said Search . " Yes , " I answered , " but he will return to-night ; so see that your properties are in good condition , or he will be the death of you . " The night came and matters progressed favorably until the council scene . One of the characters here , being overcome with nervousness , reversed his questions to Me/arnora , // // giving the wrong lines , and of course receiving an absurd answer . The audience , recognizing the confusion of the dialogue , began to laugh , and of course this made matters worse . The act terminates with the Indian 's great speech , " From the east to the west , from the north to the south , the loud cry of vengeance shall be heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , where it quivers a defiance as the curtain falls . In his anger and excitement the blade failed to stick in the stage and bounded into the orchestra , the handle hitting the double-bass player on the top of his head , which was as innocent of hair as a billiardball , so as the curtain came down the old fellow was stamping about and rubbing his bald pate to the delight of the audience . I realized now that the storm had burst in earnest and that a total wreck would soon follow . Knowing that I could not avert the catastrophe , and having no desire to face the tragedian 's wrath , like a politic but disloyal cal ) tain I deserted the ship and went in front to see it go down . Byron says of a battle , Oh , what a sight to him who has no friend or brother there ! " to which Prentice adds , and is not there himself . " The latter was now my case . I was not there myself ; and I ( lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an upper private box I watched the progress of the most disastrous performance I had ever seen . As the curtain rises on the last act the tribe of Aife/amo ;  --  a should rush through the woods as their leader calls them ; but by this time the braves were so frightened that they had become demoralized , and as the foremost rushed through the opening in the woods his long bow got crosswise between two trees . This not only precipitated the redskin over it , but the entire tribe followed , tumbling head over heels into the middle of the stage . I trembled now lest the " big Injun " would refuse to put in an appearance . At last , to my relief , the audience quieted down and Forrest strode upon the stage . If I remember the story , at this point iletamora 's wife and children had been stolen away and murdered . His pathos was fine , and by his magnificent acting he reduced his audience to attention and enthusiasm . All was now going well , and I looked forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thankful to know had nearly reached its climax . A funeral l ) ile of burning fagots was then brought on , at which some pale-face was to he sacrificed . The two Indians in charge of this mysterious-looking article set it down so unsteadily that a large sponge , saturated with flaming alcohol , tumbled off and rolled down the stage , leaving a track of fire in its wake . VOL . XXXJX. - 69. 497 " Put it out ! " said Forrest , " put it out ! " whereupon the two Indians went down on their knees and began to blow alternately in a seesaw way , singeing each other 's eyebrows at every puff The audience could not stand this comical picture , and began to break forth in laughter . " Let the theater burn ! " roared Forrest . At last one tall Indian , supposed to be second in command , majestically waved off the two who were blowing , and stamped his foot with force and dignity upon the flaming sponge , at which a perfect fountain of burning alcohol spouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put himself out , rubbing and jumping about frantically , and at last danced off the stage in the most comical agony . Forrest made a furious exit ; the curtain was dropped , and the public , in perfect good nature , dispersed . I mingled with the crowd as it went forth , and I never saw an audience , at the end of a five-act comedy , wreathed in such smiles . Forrest 's first dramatic career in London was undoubtedly a success , though " The Gladiator " was an unwise selection for the opening night . Itis a bloody piece of business altogether , and it is a play that could not fail to disgust the sensibilities of a select audience . An actor visiting England , as Forrest did , not only with a great reputation , but as unquestionably at that time the representative tragedian of America , naturally drew the first people of the land to meet him . It must be borne in mind that a first night 's audience never represents the general public , particularly on an occasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first dramatic challenge that America had ever given to England . The theater was filled with a critical audience . Statesmen and authors , with the nobility and gentry of the land , were assembled at Drury Lane to witness the dibut . Upon an audience like this the most delicate coloring would have had its effect . An artist could scarcely be too subtle before an array of such nice discrimination . When the American actor came upon the stage the symmetry of his form , his manly bearing , and the deep music of his voice produced a strong impression upon the house ; but as the play progressed , revealing only the tumult of brutal passions , disappointment fell upon the house . This crude and extravagant drama ends with the central figure bathed in blood , biting the dust , and writhing in the agonies of death . Nothing but the fine acting of Forrest could have sustained this drama before such an audience . As an actor he was a success , and the play , that caught the public taste , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several nights . There can be no doubt that if he had played Lear or Othello before the rare audience that // came to witness his dThut , and which he could not hope again to assemble in such force , his success as a Shaksperean tragedian would have been pronounced . Forrest 's second visit was full of tumult . William Macready , then the reigning favorite as a Shaksperean actor in England , was an intimate friend of Mr. Forster , the dramatic critic ; and Forrest publicly declared that it was in consequence of this intimacy that he had been abused in the papers , and more than hinted that Macready was in a conspiracy with Forster to malign him . History will never join with Forrest in this belief . Macready 's position was so well assured in London that he could not possibly fear a rival . And the life-long record of Macready clearly shows that he was too honorable a man meanly to connive at another 's downfall . After his engagement was over Forrest went to see his rival act , and because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macready from the front of the house . To say that this was in bad taste is to put too mild a disapproval upon such a rude and unprofessional act . It was the culmination of Forrest 's waywardness and ill temper . But the unfavorable notices in London had stung him to the quick . The virus of adverse criticism rankled in his veins . The eagle of the American stage was in a frenzy ; his plumage had been ruffled by the British lion . So giving that intolerant animal one tremendous peck , he spread his wings and sailed away . I have no doubt that he had often acted Othello , Lear , and perhaps Ham/el with all that care and study could compass , but the audience refused to respond ; and knowing that there was a " lurking devil " in him , they sat dumb and sullen until it was let loose . A dramatic critic told me that he was paid a stated sum of money to go to the theater regularly every night during Forrest 's engagements at the Broadway Theater in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This gentleman ( ? ) had lately come from England , and until this time had scarcely seen a Shaksperean play . He was a fluent writer , but had not the remotest idea of the thought and philosophy contained in the plays of which he was to write . He said he would get a book of the tragedy that was to be acted at night , read it up , then form his own conception of how the character should be acted , and if Forrest did not render it to his way of thinking ,  --  which fortunately for the public he never did ,  --  he , as the critic , would cut the actor all to pieces . These criticisms did more good to the actor than harm . Unjust abuse generally has this effect . Feeling that these articles were actuated only by malice , the public came in crowds to indorse the actor . Unfortunately the tragedian lost his temper and addressed the audience from the stage , pleading his own case and hurling anathemas at the irresponsible assassins of the pen. ** There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up cudgels for him and rallied to his support . It was like a successful candidate asking his constituents , after they have elected him , to add to the obligation by throwing his unsuccessful rival out of the window . Edwin Forrest , with all his faults , had warm and generous impulses . I know of one instance where a poor , old actress went to him in distress . In former years he had known her father and respected him . Touched by her appeal for assistance , he lent her a large sum of money , with the almost certain knowledge that he would never get it back again . It was never made public ; no one knew of it but the receiver and myself . The Forrest Home has done much good , and is likely to do more ; and those actors who either by age or by infirmities have been debarred the privilege of following their profession will naturally be grateful for this rich legacy . Even in the days of his theatrical fame and prosperity Forrest was an austere man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding himself aloof from all but his most intimate friends . The latter part of his life was embittered , too , by illness and the loss of public favor . Until the closing years of his career he had been blessed with perfect health ; this became suddenly shattered , and the unexpected attack wrecked his dramatic power . He might have borne the stroke of illness , but to one whose imperious nature could not brook the faintest slight the loss of public admiration was a heavy blow ; one , too , that would have shocked a wiser and more even-tempered man than Edwin Forrest . Still he toiled on , and was unjustly censured for acting past his powers . But what was he to do ? His physicians told him that he must act if he would live ; the wheel must be kept in motion or it would fall . His performances in the larger cities were given to empty houses , while bright and youthful aspirants were drawing from him all his old adherents . His former friends forsook him , and naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favorite of other days declining night by night . No actor can hope to hold an interest in his audience merely by what he has done in years , gone by ; in acting it is the present that the public have to deal with , not the past . To witness age and decrepitude struggling to conceal their weakness in the mimic scene is too painful . The greater our affection for the artist the less can we bear to see him suffer and go down . // FORREST AS " KING LEAR . " ENGRAVED BY T. JOANGON. // In the vain hope of struggling on , the old tragedian sought " the provinces . " Here the people flocked in crowds to see the great actor that they had heard of from their childhood ; not with the faintest hope that they would find the grandeur of the past , but from the curious desire to see a ruined tower just before it falls . FROM LONDON TO PARIS . I SAILED for England in the clipper ship NeJz'une , in June , i8*6 . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare treat to me . It was rich in comedians and poor in tragedians . Robson and Wright were especially fine ; Compton was quaint and legitimate , and Buckstone funny . Mr. Phelps was an actor of such versatility that he could scarcely be called a tragedian . His range was wider than that of any other actor in England . Macbet/i , Sir Per/max McSyee*kan/i Ma ! - voilo , King Lear , Sir Anthony Absolute , and Bottom take in the vast area of the legitimate drama . I saw him in two of these characters only , but it is generally conceded that he was equally fine in all of them . From London I went to France . My mother 's parents were from this lovely country , and I longed to see it . We arrived quite early in the afternoon , and then I looked for the first time on the picturesque city of Dieppe . What a transformation had taken place in a few short hours from London Why , if a hole could have been bored at Waterloo Bridge and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrast would not have been greater . Climate , costume , architecture , and language  --  the change was complete : eightstoried picturesque houses , with three-storied roofs , each story proj ecting a little beyond the other till at the top they almost meet , making it quite convenient for the occupants in the garret windows to shake hands with one another across the street ; all the windows filled with the excited inhabitants chatting to one another and violently gesticulating . The streets were thronged with people : women in wooden shoes , blue petticoats , and high , stiff , white caps , carrying baskets and generally doing all the work ; lazy men in blue blouses , quietly submitting to it without a murmur ; they were lolling on the piers , slyly laughing and winking at one another as they guyed the cockney and Yankee tourists . A swell table d'hôte dinner , for swell tourists , was carefully avoided by myself and companion ; so we slipped around the corner and got a cheap repast , consoling ourselves that by traveling economically you always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object partly in view , and with knowledge of our slender VOL . XXXIX. - 7o- 7I. purse , we purchased second-class tickets on the train for Paris . It was midsummer , and as we started at 6 p . M. there were still three or four hours of golden twilight for us . What a panorama ofbeauty ! We saw the quaint French farms and picturesque chateaux as we skirted along the lovely banks of the Seine ; there Rouen with its majestic cathedral loomed up as the moon rose over the river . At eleven o'clock we arrived in Paris . I drove to H6tel Byron in Rue Richelien , and after supper determined to get a view that night of the church of Notre Dame . Past twelve o'clock and the full moon high in the heavens ; it was just the time to see it . A cab had us there in twenty minutes . How grandly it stood out against the dark blue sky ! We recrossed the Seine , and I stopped the cab to get out on the bridge . Straight before me were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reign of Terror . I almost fancied that I could see the pale face of the murdered queen gazing with anguish through the iron-grated windows . The French cabman did not quite get into his head what was the matter with me . I think my gloomy looks made him suspicious that I was contemplating suicide and had brought him there as an accessory ; for he got quite close to me , evidently intending to grab me by the collar and force me into the cab at the first hint of a plunge . He heaved a sigh of relief as I got into the cab , and drove away from the bridge much faster than he came to it . AN EARLY cOMEDY . H*TEL BYRON was in the busy part of the city , so I was awakened at sunrise by a hum of voices and the rattle of cabs : bakers , milkmen , and venders of fruit and vegetables were trying to drown one another with their various cries . Perhaps a week later than this it would have been annoying , but now the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too delighted to be awakened by them . I had just finished dressing when I heard a fearftil quarrel in the courtyard : looking out of the window I saw a most curious group of people . There was a fat man , in a white apron and cap ( the cook ) , armed with a large wooden spoon , and a thin baker , with a long loaf of bread , measuring at least four feet , beating each other over the head and shoulders with these deadly weapons . The landlord had embraced the baker and was trying to tug him away ; the landlady was endeavoring to do the same with the fat cook , but his dimensions defied her ; a kindly milkman and two waiters got in between the belligerents , and in so doing received most of the punishment . Nothing // could be more comical than to watch this exciting but bloodless encounter - the frantic yells of the landlord , the screams of the landlady , the milkman and the two waiters rubbing themselves as the spoon of the infuriated cook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . In the midst of the encounter and the thickest of the fight a huge milk-can was kicked over , and a foaming white flood deluged the middle of the yard . This dreadful accident stopped the fray at once - oil poured upon troubled water could not have been more effectual ; economy is a passion with the people of Paris . There was a groan of horror from the milkman , who stood with his shoulders shrugged up to his eyes , his arms stiffened , his hands spread out , and his legs wide apart , surveying the disaster ; his stock in trade , once pure and white as the driven snow , was slowly flowing down the middle of the yard , and as it " mixed with the baser matter " became a pearly gray , and so deepened into an inky hue as it reached the gutter of the street . The poor fellow was now the center of attraction . The belligerents crowded around him offering their sympathy ; if they could not restore his merchandise , they could at least smother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the baker looked on in self-reproaching silence , the waiters assisted the unfortunate man to a chair , and the landlady soothed him with a glass of claret . Now a reaction set in . A faint smile mantled the milkman 's face , then they all broke out into a roar of laughter as the coinical side of the picture presented itself ; the waiters fairly danced with merriment , the cook embraced the baker , who punched him in the stomach with delight , and so ended the first and only fight I ever saw in Paris . After breakfast I consulted my memorandum and guide-book . What a list of things to see ! How could I get through it in the time ? Where should I go first ? I have since seen my children in this uncertain condition in a toy-shop , and have always felt for them as I remembered this eventful time ; for we are only children of a larger growth , and must have all felt this delightful torture . My guide was now engaged ; his name was Fran9ois . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as industry was concerned ; his vitality , too , was wonderful . Quick , agile , witty , and vivacious , nothing was a trouble to him so long as it was to his taste ; but if I suggested some place to visit that he in his vocation was tired og the humbug of his nature came into full play , and he would disparage the proposal with the true tact of a Frenchman . Not that he was dishonest ; on the contrary , where money was concerned he was scrupulously particular , but the artistic side of his nature delighted to assert itself . On my second visit to Paris , twenty years after , I was struck . with some curious incidents that illustrate the devotion of the French to art and their uncertain loyalty to the reigning government . Over their doors and on the cornices of their public buildings the Republican motto " Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity " was painted ; but the prices of admission to the Grand Opera were carved in the stone , as though they plainly said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if we desire a change in the government we can wash it out ; but the price of admission to the grand opera can never be changed-*arnaLr I " Again : when the revolution was over , the names of many streets and buildings were changed , all reference to royalty or the empire was swept away , till they came to the Palais Royal ; this sacred title was not disturbed , as it was the name of the theater within its walls . How grand I felt on my first visit , to think that I was in Paris ; not the Paris of to-day , with its gilded domes and modern grandeur , but the old , quaint , dirty , gay , strange city in the early days of the Second Empire , with its high , toppling buildings , narrow streets , and lively people . What pride I should take , when I got back to America , in talking familiarly of well-known localities , and getting the French pronunciation pat and glib - rattling off the names with an easy air as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt in walking through the streets and looking in at the shop windows . Socrates , I think it was , who said , as he walked through Athens , " How happy I am that there are so many things here I do not want . " If his philosophy was correct - and I have no doubt it was - I must have been very unhappy and very unlike Socrates , for there were so many things that I did want . Of course I could not get them , but could price and admire them . Now I must be careful ; the money had to be recounted , and there should be enough kept to get back with . I had been saving up two years ' salary for this trip , so there must be no undue extravagance . This matter settled , I filled my purse with gold , hired a cab , and sallied forth with my guide to visit the theatrical wardrobe shops in the Temple . I shall never forget this lovely day , wandering into the little dens , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer old places , rummaging over quaint hats , square-toed shoes , character wigs , embroidered court suits , charming long silk stockings in all the magic colors of the rainbow , high boots , lovely gaiters , striped vests , and groves of old-fashioned liveries - it was a dramatic fairy-land. // IN THE SECOND-HAND SHOPS . THE second-hand shops of Paris are very different from those of Chatham Street and Petticoat Lane . In London and with us they are presided over by thrifty Jews , who glare at you with glittering black eyes and thrust their eager noses in your face , almost imploring you to buy . Not so in France : quiet old women sit in the doorways of their shops , or just outside , sewing or knitting ; no time is wasted by the women of France . They smile and nod as you pass by , but no rudeness , no urging you to buy ; in fact , they seem so perfectly self-satisfied that at times it is quite provoking to the would-be purchaser . I was all eyes , and longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a gentle nudge and admonish me not to appear so anxious . At these times I would assume a careless manner as if such scenes were quite usual to me . At last Fran*ois stopped in front of one of these shops : taking a survey with the air of a connoisseur , and nodding a cold approval of its contents , he invited me to enter . An old woman ,  --  knitting , of course ,  --  the exact counterpart of at least twenty we had already passed , followed us in . Here everything was in picturesque and artistic confusion - piles of curious costumes on the shelves , flowing scarfs , broad felt hats with ostrich feathers , russet boots , and big hilted swords and rapiers arranged in a half-careless , half-methodical way . There was an interior room from which issued sounds of merriment and laughter . I hesitated to pass through , but the old woman smiled and bade us enter , shrugging her shoulders and expressing in her way , " Only young people ; they will have their sport . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchmen , evidently actors , and a pretty coquette of a girl-the daughter of madame - having a royal time at flirting and acting . For a moment our entrance damped their ardor and the " sport , " whatever it was , came to a standstill . Then came some pantomime from my guide , who introduced me to the trio as an actor from America , at which they assumed an extravagant air of wonder and amazement , evidently guying me . So feeling themselves quite at ease , the merriment again proceeded . It was quite evident to me that there was a love affair between the pretty girl and the handsomer of the young actors . He was a graceful young fellow , with blonde , curly hair and blue eyes , and I presumed he was the rising young lover of some small theater in the neighborhood . The other actor was undoubtedly a low comedian of the same establishment . He was the reverse of the blonde lover , hideously ugly , with a turned-up nose , and a wide gash in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey and was quite as full of tricks . Assuming a grotesquely tragic air , he grasped me by the hand as if I were his long-lost brother , then , pointing despairingly at the lovers , gave me to understand in pantomime that his life was blasted by unrequited affection . Then he fell upon his knees to the girl and implored her love ; she laughed , of course . This started him to his feet , and with a sudden spring he picked up a Roman helmet , cocked it sidewise on his head , seized a poker , and rushed upon his rival . Then he paused , and , bursting into tears , relented . Now taking the lovers ' hands he joined them in wedlock , invoked a blessing on them from Heaven , stabbed himself with a poker , and rushed out into the front shop amidst the laughter and merriment of his audience . To me this seemed a very happy party , and though I understood very little of what they were saying , it was quite enough to convince me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman now led the way up a dark , narrow staircase to a room of wonders above . The walls were hung with fantastic dresses , spears , shields , and masks with decidedly French expressions of countenance . She pointed quietly to all these things , but rather disparaged them . Now she came to a high , black leather trunk with a round top and clamped all over with iron bands and hinges . This contained glittering suits of Roman armor . A shining breastplate was displayed to tempt me . I explained that that style of thing was not in my line . So with a sweet smile , somewhat tinged with pity , I think , she shrugged her shoulders and passed on to a large , flat , wooden box like a monster sea-chest with an old-fashioned padlock on it , big enough for the Bank of England . She pointed to the box with admiration , as though she would say , " Ah , you do n't know what lovely things are stored there , and so cheap . " She first displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , but too large and too somber . Next came a royal purple silk velvet one , embroidered with gold and foilstones . I lost my heart to this at once , and the sly old woman knew it . I tried to look as if I did n't care for it , but failed . It would n't do with her . She saw through me , and began to fold it up with a loving hand , as though she could n't part with it for the world . She spoke no English ; and as I was equally skilled in French , we talked through my guide . He , of course , professed to be on my side , but , from certain suspicious intonations , I fancy he slightly favored the old woman . " Well , what is the price ? " " Five hundred francs . " She said this with an injured air , as if she hoped I would n't give it , but of course I did give it . // One article after another was tried on ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new treasure came into my possession it was placed in the cab by my guide . I did not want them sent home-no , I would take them myself ; then I had misgivings that the cabman might drive off with my booty . I must have made Fran9ois take his number three times at least , and put it in my different pockets , fearing I should lose it . At last I had gone through all the shops in the Temple . The longing eyes of the old French woman followed me from door to door , the cab was full , the purse was empty , and now I had a feverish anxiety to get away . I was convinced I had bought these wonders at half their value , and I feared that the venders would regret having sold them , and before I could depart demand them back . So we jumped into the cab , gave the word , and drove to the hotel . Three lovely weeks in Paris ; it seemed like a dream . Then I awakened and sailed forhome.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
