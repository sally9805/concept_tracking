ARTICLE 11. - THE RACE PROBLEM AT THE SOUTH . THE " Race Problem , " which to-day confronts the American people , has long been interwoven with our party politics . If this is unavoidable it is not the less nnfortunate . A subject which demands for its proper consideration an unprejudiced mind , a clear head and a cool heart , will greatly suffer when it is cast into the arena where party interests contend for mastery . Undoubtedly parties are inevitable in free governments ; undoubtedly they are necessary for the conduct of free governments ; but it is quite as clear that one of the direct and universal results of party influence is to aronse passions , to cultivate prejudices , to make men blind to the true public weal , and even to put party , however unconscionsly , in place of country . " The blinding and distracting influences of party , " says Mr. Burke . " The headlong and plunging spirit of party , " says Mr. Webster . Independence of party does not imply disnse or disapproval of parties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should shrink from doing what our individual judgment condemns without the smallest hesitation or regard for party interests . The value of parties is conditioned on such inflexibility of private judgment . A party which is made up to a large extent of those who keep themselves free from all trammels in their judgment and action , and who are ready at all times to exercise " the divine right of bolting , " is the only party which in the long run will be kept true to purely public aims . It is proper , therefore , that I should begin by saying that I should not have attempted to discuss in these pages this socalled " Race Problem , " if I had not intended to discuss it without regard to party influences or interests , or if I had not felt that I could so discuss it . I do not affect to despise parties . I do not intend to underrate their value . I merely try to look clearly at this subject and to lay aside party feelings . Perhaps it is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our important present issues , my sympathy and judgment are // with the Democratic party . I am opposed to the enlargement , by construction or by practice , of the national functions and powers . I am in favor of the reform of the Civil Service on the lines of the present Civil Service statute . I am in favor of tariff reform and ballot reform . And because I am in favor of these causes , I am in greater sympathy with the Democratic than with the Republican party . The Negro question , the IRace problem , by whatever name we call it , is as old as our Constitution and government . It has had many phases . In 1863 , as a war measure , the slaves of the South were proclaimed free by President Lincoln . In 1865 , by the 13th Amendment of the Constitution , they were made free by civil law . They then numbered about 4,000,000 . In 1867 , by the Reconstruction Acts of Congress , they were made voters . The result of this was in three States - South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerical preponderance of voters to the race which four years before were slaves . Its result further was in many counties , cities , and precincts , throughout the South . to give a like preponderance to the black race . Under the practical operation of the Reconstruction Acts , ten of the Southern States-all the seceding States , in fact , except Yirginia , where subsequently the negro vote combined with the repudiation vote , and both led by Mahone , gained ascendency-passed under the control of the party which coinmanded the votes of the black race . In 1876 , all these States except three-South Carolina , Louisiana , and Florida-were under the undisputed control of the party which controlled scarcely an appreciable fraction of the black vote . In that year , the election of a President turned on the Electoral votes of these States . Immediately after the counting of those votes for the Republican candidate and his inauguration , the President withdrew the Federal troops from the capitals of those States , and the governments chosen mainly by the black vote disappeared , and the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Thus , within the brief space of thirteen years , the negro race was emancipated by proclamation , made free by // constitutional amendment , made voters by Acts of Congress , put in political control in eleven States , and finally overthrown and deprived of political control in all those States . All this is veritable history on which no controversy can arise . Since 1876 , the black race , now numbering over 8,000,000 , has , with slight exceptions , had no political influence in elections at the South . They remain , as before , a majority in fact of all the legal voters in three States-Sonth Carolina , Mississippi , and Louisiana-as well as in many smaller political divisions and communities , but they have almost no political power . By some process , the result has been reached , that the negro vote at the South is suppressed or silenced . The result is all that I am now concerned with . Accepting the fact of the suppression or silencing to so large a degree of the colored vote at the South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the national government , or the other States , or the people of the other States , have any duty to perforni , any interest to protect , or any right to assert ? This is our Race problem . The first and most significant fact to my mind which the history now recited presents , is the fact that in three whole States , and in many parts of other States , the numerical majority has been quite overcome and subdued by the numerical minority . It recalls and enforces the truth so often overlooked , that the real foundation of the rule of the majority is not the fact of the greater number of votes , but the fact that behind the greater number of votes is always presumed to stand the greater part of the physical force of the State or community . The rule of the numerical majority is possible or practicable , in case of contest or opposition , only on the assumption that the numerical majority represents and embodies a physical majority , a preponderance of physical power . There are such things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no power or force can destroy or diminish , but there is no firm basis for a civil government except in the assumption that it represents and on occasions can command enough physical power to enforce its will , its laws . Usually , in our country , a numerical majority does represent a physical majority . But // in the present case it does not . A relatively small numerical minority holds and exercises exclusively the powers of government . What lesson is here taught ? The lesson surely that the rule of a numerical majority has its limitations as a practical rule of governineut ,  --  the lesson that the rule of a numerical majority presupposes and assumes that the whole community is substantially homogeneous and equal , that its members , man for man , stand in substantial equality , that in case of necessity a numerical majority of one makes an absolute physical majority , so that such majority of one can , if need be , enforce its will by physical power . There are doubtless many numerical majorities which do not actually represent the preponderating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly be overthrown by the attack or resistance of a numerical minority , but it is nevertheless the assumption that a numerical majority is a physical majority that has made the rule of the majority possible and practicable . Here , now , we come upon a case in which a large numerical majority does not constitute or embody an actual or available physical majority . The result is that our familiar rule-the rule of the numerical majority-is summarily set aside , and the minority rules . This is commonly said to be repugnant to our American ideas of government . I do not think it is . It is only repugnant to the idea , that classes of men , who by race , or history , or other cause , are hostile or opposed to one another , can be counted , man against man , in a struggle for supremacy . There is a sense  --  and we have come upon it here-in which votes are weighed and not counted . Your man for man count will not always do . Government may in some measure protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make one man the equal of every other man . Bnt when the question is one of the power of the government itself , we find here , and we shall find in every similar t*st or crisis or emergency , that men can not always be counted by polls , that men in these last resorts must be weighed , that brains have weight , that blood tells , that experience is strength , that ancestry and history count , that race pride is a factor of untold power , that a servile history is a legacy and condition which no executive proclamation , no constitutional amendment can change or remove . // One lesson , then , taught by the situation at the South is that the rule of a numerical majority can not be maintained until the preponderance of weight as well as of numbers is on the side of the majority ; that until this is the condition , the rule of the numerical majority can not stand except through outside , extrinsic aid . But there is another lesson to which I wish to draw attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the black race , not good probably for any race , to exercise power or to stand in places of responsibility for which they are unfitted and unequal . The rule of the numerical majority at the South from 1867 to 1876 , wherever it prevailed , resulted in intolerable misgovernment . Whether the methods adopted by the white race for the removal of these evils were the only practical iuethods , were necessary methods , I do not here stop to inquire . That they were believed to be the only effective resort by those who employed them , can not be doubted . At any rate , as I then said and now say , the evils complained of were intolerable ; and when the struggle came , the governments resting on a mere numerical majority went down like frail wooden structures before some mighty cyclone . The numerical majority , with all its contrivances of government , passed away and has never since made even the show of resistance or reappearance . Fourteen years have now passed since the last State government at the South supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What has been the result ? I suppose I am a competent observer on this point . Recently a business errand has taken me to the State which was for twelve years my home . I have for several months mingled freely with all classes in that State . I find a vast and surprising advance in the wealth , productions , industries , modes of living , and general welfare of both races . I find , almost without exception , harmonions and friendly relations existing between the two races , except upon the subject of political parties . I find that on this latter topic the relations of the races are far less embittered than they were before 1876 . I find the negro more industrious than ever before , and I find him contented and happy , except when he is incited to political activity or unrest by the professional or party politicians who // still keep his ear . The negroes , nine out of ten , are now at work , politics are abandoned , the number of schools and children in attendance are greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools in South Carolina are worth stating . Not only has the length of the school year been increased , but the number of schools has increased since 1876 by 63 per cent. ; the number of teachers , by 55 per cent. ; and the number of pupils , by 89 per cent . The character and efficiency of the schools have increased , as will be apparent to any observer , in a far greater ratio . I find the race of colored politicians , so-called colored leaders , has passed away . One looks almost in vain for them . A few only linger on the stage . The race too of strangers and adventurers , without home or pursuits , except public plunder , has passed away . The old political machinery has fallen to pieces . Nothing but the skeleton or shadow of political organization remains . This is the result , as I see it , of fourteen years of the rule of the intelligent minority of South Carolina and of the suppression of the ignorant majority . I make this report neither eagerly nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . It is what I see or at least what I think I see . I have already said our IRace problem presents the question , whether we of the North have any duty to perform in this aspect of affairs , and if any , what ? One or two things are plain , I think , from the facts as they have now been stated : one is that if the colored numerical majority in any Southern States or parts of States are to be restored at present to political power , if their right to vote is to be presently secured to them , it must be done by some power outside of such majority itself or the States where such majority lives . There is certainly no power which can intervene except the general government of the United States . We arrive , then , at the question , ought the government of the United States to intervene ? My first answer is that I do not think any people which is free to help itself and does not , ought to have help from others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever helped before . He was set free by others , not by his own efforts . He was enfranchised by no efforts of // his own . lie had full opportunity to build up and protect his liberties . The whole power of the United States was at his call for eight years , and what was the result of it all ? Am I wrong when I say the result was that the negro showed only weakness , unfitness for the task laid upon him ? Is it not a mild statement of a clear fact , to say that the negro in South Carolina , in Mississippi , in Louisiana , is unequal to supporting a respectable or substantial government ? Why , then , should the general government of the United States seek to uphold him when he has shown his own incompetency to use the powers he has had ? I confess with all seriousness , I might say with sorrow-for my personal sympathies are still strong for that race-I confess I would not again put the negro , if I could , in the positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hard school of political adversity or even political servitude , if need be , how to hold , to keep , to use , the political powers of government . If ever that time comes , the negro will recover political power without your aid or mine . If it does not come , it will be idle and worse than idle for us to attempt to secure to him the rights which he has let drop from his weak , inexperienced , and nerveless grasp . But , if the aid of the general government would , if given , be of benefit to the negro , there is no legal , constitutional way in which it can be given . This government , it can never be too carefully remembered , is one of strictly limited powers . The power , the function , the right , of each branch or department of the government is strictly limited . The idea of unlimited power has no place in our political system , no analogue in our political vocabulary . These limitations were and are selfimposed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that the powers of no person , or department of their government , shall be absolute . We are obliged , therefore , when a demand is made for the action of the Federal government in behalf of the colored citizens of the Southern States , to ask whether the Federal government possesses such power . Such a system of government no doubt has its inconveniences . It is far simpler and more convenient in reaching a pre-determined end to have no constitutional hindrances . Noth // ing is so simple and convenient in this regard as a despotism or a highly autocratic monarchy . The emperors of Russia and Germany , the governments of England and France , can do many things for the protection as well as the oppression of their citizens which our national government can not do . The characteristic of our system is that the specific power to be called into exercise must be pointed out . It is a system which Americans approve and cherish , a system which through more than a century of experience has shown its strength for national defence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common domestic rights and interests of its citizens . No American , anywhere , I suppose , would suggest a change in the great characteristic which I have pointed out . Without entering here upon an original discussion of the present question , it will be sufficient to say that under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States , CQngress has not only exhausted but has exceeded its constitutional powers in the direction of attempts to enforce the rights of negroes within the several States . A series of Acts of Congress were enacted between 1868 and 1872 having for their object the enforcement of the negro 's right to vote . These Acts were enforced or sustained by all the power of the first administration of Gen. Grant . That the efforts made to enforce these Acts of Congress in behalf of colored voters went often beyond constitutional bounds , is now admitted , I think , by men of all parties . Gen. Grant himself confessed that the country did not approve the extent to which his efforts went in this direction , and that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public approval . The efforts to secure by congressional action the civil and political rights of colored citizens may be said to have culminated in the well-known Civil Rights statute of March 1 , 1875 , which was entitled " An Act to protect all citizens in their civil and legal rights . " This was in substance the measure which Senator Sumner devised and to which he made allusion in his last hours . The constitutionality of this statute was considered by the Supeme Court in 1883 and decided in what are known as the " Civil Rights Cases , " reported in the 109th volume of the Supreme Court Reports . It was there held that the 14th amendment applies // only to the State8 and not to individuals , to State action and not to individual action ; consequently , that when by that amendment Congress was given power to enforce its provisions , it was only given power to legislate in correction of State action and not in direct enforcement of civil rights as against individual action . Hence , the deAial of rights to colored citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a matter not within the constitutional power of Congress , but was left by the constitutional amendment exclusively within the power of the several States . From this it plainly follows that the denial of civil or political rights to colored citizens is not an evil which Congress can correct unless such cienial assumes the form of State action , that is to say , action in the form of a State statute or the official action of a State officer representing the State . If , therefore , any State by its action as thus defined , denies or abridges the rights of citizens of the United States , Congress may correct such legislation and may enact measures which will defeat such State action . If , on the other hand , individuals or collections of individuals , larger or smaller , combine or resolve to deny or defeat the rights of citizens of the United States , the offence is one which lies within the exclusive power and jurisdiction of the State . If the State neglects or refuses to punish the offender or to enforce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the whole general government in all its separate and aggregate powers and departments is powerless to act . Such is our constitutional system as interpreted and fixed by our highest Court , composed with but one exception of judges belonging to the Republican party . When , therefore , as recently , the President of a New England college gravely and passionately declared that his party would no sooner surrender Mr. Sumner 's Civil Rights Act than it would surrender Mr. Jefferson 's IDeclaration of Independence , did he not present an unbecoming example either of ignorance or of fanaticism ? The simple fact is that the negro has to-day all the protection our national government can give him , the same protection that the white man has , and if it were on any // account desirable to further aid him by the action of the general government , it is not within its power to grant that aid . And this conclusion which seems to be beyond the domain of discussion or doubt , leads again to the inquiry , why is it that the protection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient for the colored race ? I think the words of Cassius to Brutus give the true answer : " The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , But in ourselves , that we are underlings . " Race prejudice is most commonly named as the cause of this difference in respect to security of legal rights , but in my judgment it is not race prejudice alone or priucipally , but race weakness . Why is it , let me ask , that no other race or nationality of citizens in our country is subjected to the wrongs complained of by our colored citizens ? I think if we would look clearly and dispassionately at the question , our answer would be that it is because no other race or nationality has the qualities of self-assertion and self-defence to so small a degree . As I havesaid , no race was ever so oppressed at one time or ever so helped and patronized at another time . We have now reached the point where our legal means of aid is exhausted , and we must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can give you ; all we have for ourselves ; for the rest , you must help yourselves . " As Judge Bradley remarked in his opinion delivered in the Civil Rights cases : " When a uman has emerged from slavery , and by the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable concomitants of that state , there must be some stage in the progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a mere citizen , and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws , and when his rights as a citizen , or as a man , are to be protected in the ordinary modes by which other men 's rights are protected . " Precisely that stage has been reached , in my view , by the colored race in this country . More or greater aid can not be given him in his struggle for the enjoyment of equal rights because the constitutional limits set to our government in this direction have been reached . More or greater aid ought not to be given , if we were free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where self-reliance alone can establish the practical capability and value of the colored race as citizens . But there are more specially partisan aspects of the Race problem which must be considered . One of our great political parties professes to be the especial champion of the colored race . With each recurring election , it presents the claim to our confidence and support , that it is devoted to the great mission of securing a free vote and a fair count in all the States . This broad claim is not accompanied by any statement of methods or measures which will secure the end or redeem the promise implied . No platform or declaration of principles and purposes of that party anywhere informs us in what way a fair count and free vote can be secured to the colored voters . When the founders of the Republican party were fighting the early battles of the party , their demand was " No slavery in the territories , " and their banners bore the Wilmot proviso forbidding slavery in the . territories . It was a practical demand , sapported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent member of the Republican party tell me what single measure his party now presents for securing a free vote and a fair count at the South , for securing to the colored race the rights it does not now enjoy ? The evil complained of is that in South Carolina , for example , a majority of the legal voters are colored Republicans , but that the State is governed exclusively by white Democrats . Now , since 1876 , has any Republican statesman or party leader pointed out any means by which this evil can be corrected and this wrong redressed ? Prior to 1876 , that party had claimed and constantly exercised the right of employing the Federal troops for the protection of voters at the polls and for the support of the State governments elected and established by the colored voters of the Southern States . In 1876 , as has already been stated , the result of the Presidential election hung on the electoral votes of the three States of South Carolina , Louisiana , and Florida . In each of those States the Federal troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the inauguration of President Hayes the troops // were withdrawn . This was done , if not under an express agreement entered into prior to the declaration of the election , certainly as a policy of the Republican party , approved and sanctioned by that party . In other words , whatever the motive or merits of this action , it was a distinct announcement that in the view of the Republican party the policy of Federal interference in the States , and Federal military support of Southern State governments , was a policy no longer to be tolerated . That action meant that thenceforth the colored voters of the South must make their struggle for their political rights without Federal aid . It was a remission of the rights of the colored voter there to the same local arbitrament which prevailed at the North . The majority , there as here , must be able and ready to defend its rights , or it must go down . It did go down . It has never since regained or re-asserted its rights . It makes no effort to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the IRepublican party that something shall be done to restore power to the colored majority in the Southern States  --  a work which that party deliberately refnsed to do in 1876  --  a work which no man of that party can now point out a constitutional method of doing . I ask , is not this something less than statesmanship or patriotism ? Ought not all patriotic citizens , all true friends of the colored race , to look plainly at the facts ? The facts are , as we have seen , that there is no practical means of dealing with this matter on the part of the Federal government , or on the part of any people or power , except the States themselves where the alleged wrong exists ; that in 1876 , the Republican party abandoned the policy which alone could have enforced the present demands of that party . The true duty of patriotic men , then , is ,  --  is it not ?  --  to lay aside political agitation of a question which is beyond the reach of political action ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the colored citizens at the South should cease to deplore or denounce these wrongs . What I say is that while the redress of these wrongs is not within our political competency , it is futile and unstatesmanlike to attempt to make them a political issue . Political controversies , the interests of parties , inevitably complicate and delay the solu // 1890 . The Pace Pro6lem. tion of questions which are not political in their nature , or which can not be reached and settled by political methods . But if , as I have tried to show , the only remedy for the suppression of the colored vote at the South is the acquirement by that class of voters of qualities and attainments which they do not now possess-education , self-respect , seif-rehance , property , morality , the habits of self- control , of self-assertion , and self-defence ; in a word , the qualities which now mark their opponents , the white race-then it seems clear that our duty is quite other than political or partisan . No man can outdo me in readiness or determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid in fitting the colored race for the work of governing or sharing in the government of those States iu which he constitutes a large part of the legal voters . I am warranted in saying that such efforts for the enlightenment and elevation of the colored race will receive the support of the white race of the South . They are unalterably opposed to the political supremacy of that race in its present stage of development and progress . Upon that point the argument with them is closed ; but to efforts for the education and advancement of the colored race they are not opposed . The broad statement is justified that in view of the relative resources and taxable property of the South , the Southern States are expending relatively as much money for popular education and with as good relative results as are the Northern States . I have said that although the Republican party puts forward constantly the question of Southern elections , it does not even propose a plan of removing the evil complained of . Perhaps I ought , in order to be entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suggested , and one Senator , Mr. Sherman , by request and without endorsement , has introduced into the Senate , and more recently Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts has introduced into the House of Representatives , a bill for regulating by act of Congress the election of members of Congress . The constitutional warrant for such an act is thought to be found in the fourth clause of the fourth section of Article one , which is as follows : " The times , places , and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof . But the Congress may , // at any time , by law , make or alter such regulations , except as to the place of choosing senators . " Giving to this clause the fullest latitude which can be claimed for it , it would permit Congress to pass an act prescribing the time , place , and manner of holding elections for Congressional representatives . It would not affect any election for State officers or any election held under State laws . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purpose , it might secure to the colored voters of the Southern States the privilege of voting for members of Congress ; nothing more . It would leave untouched all the elections in which that race is most interested , which most affect its welfare and interests . For example , it is plainly the State legislatures and the State officers which determine to the greatest degree the negro 's enjoyment of civil and political rights . The questions of taxation , of public schools , of rights of property , of the law of contracts , marriage , divorce , descent and inheritance of property , the constitution of the courts , the choice of judges , of local justices , and their administration ; in truth , nearly all the common , every day interests which are at all affected by public laws and action , lie outside of the proposed measure of congressional legislation and will remain wholly unaffected by it . The only result will be that the colored voters may vote freely for members of Congress . And in what way or to what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Republican majority in Congress . If it does , how will this benefit the colored race ? If Congress has already , as we have seen , reached and in many instances overpassed the limits of its constitutional power in its efforts to deal with the matter in question , an increase of the Republican members of that body would not enlarge its power in that direction . No law could then be passed , which might not have been passed at almost any time since the enactment of the reconstruction measures . The colored race would , therefore , reap no benefit whatever in respect to their most vital interests by an act of Congress which should be effective to secure them a free vote and fair count in elections only for members of Congress . // But , further , how is such au act of Congress to be made effective for its end against the oppositiou which it must be assumed by those who favor such a measure , will be made by communities in which the evil aimed at exists ? It must , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agents and agencies of the general government . It must , in plain terms , be enforced , if need be , or if opposed , as former acts of Congress relating to the subject of elections at the South have been attempted to be enforced , by the army of the United States . This policy has heretofore been found to be disastrous and impracticable by the party which attempted it under the lead of President Grant . It was finally abandoned in 1876 . It had produced a situation of danger and disturbance so acute and threatening that the Republican party deliberately and formally abandoned it under circumstances which appealed to the interests and sympathies of that party as strongly , probably more strongly than any circumstances which will hereafter occur . I can not believe that the Republican party is ready to repeat the experiment of military coercion . I am perfectly sure the country will not consent to its repetition . We reach the conclusion , therefore , that the proposed measure as a measure to secure a free and full vote of the colored race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind , which failed in the hands of General Grant , backed by a large and eager party majority in the full flush of the anticipated party triumphs depending on the success of the attempt , will hardly come as near success hereafter . If , as General Grant confessed in one of his ast utterances as President , the country was tired of such attempts to enforce this class of laws by the use of the army , and if , as President Hayes declared , the spectacle of United States troops attending voters at the polls was " offensive to the political sense of the country , " it will scarcely come to pass again in this generation that the attempts will be repeated with the approval of the American people , however much party politicians and leaders may demand it . There is , then , no practicable legal or political means , in my judgment , for the reasons now stated , by which the right of the colored race to vote can be secured through any action of // Congress or of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and functions fixed , it was quite as much the purpose of its authors and framers to secure the autonomy of the States within certain well-defined limits , as to create and empower a national government which should be adequate for certain well-defined national objects . During the century of our national life and at its close , the world recognizes as never before the profound practical wisdom of the arrangements and adaptations which are embodied in our Constitution . If , now , we have come to a point in the evolution of our IRace problem where the national government has reached its limit of power , will any thoughtful , reasonable , patriotic American hesitate between the choice of abandoning , on the one hand , a party policy however fascinating or apparently advantageous , and , on the other hand , a firm adherence to constitutional duty and constitutional limitations ? To me the barriers to national or federal power are quite as sacred and inviolable as the barriers to State power . The colored race , not as a race but as American citizens , is entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising those rights , which the Constitution provides . No race , no class or body of our citizens , is entitled to more . The colored race throughout our land has to-day all the constitutional rights and all the protection in those rights which any class of our citizens can claim under the national constitution . If unfortunately the rights of that race are practically not enjoyed in some of the communities and States where it is found in largest numbers , it is a result , a situation , an evil , if you please , which must be left for correction to other influences and other agencies than our national government . I should speak far less than my whole mind on this subject , if I did not say , in terms , that I do not regard the denial of the negro 's or a white man 's right to vote , your right or mine to vote , as an occasion warranting the least departure from our approved authoritative standards of constitutional construction . The time has fully come , in my opinion , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the colored man " must take the rank of a mere citizen , and cease to be the special favorite of the laws , and when his rights as a citizen , or as a man , must be protected in the ordinary modes by which other // men 's rights are protected . " The colored race are no longer the " wards of the nation . " They are an integral part of the great body of our people , and new laws or attempts at new laws for the special advantage or protection of that race are out of date , impossible , and mischievous . I have already referred to the disturbing influences which party interests and party prejudices have thrown over this question . One of our great political parties sees or thinks it sees in the free vote of the colored race in the Southern States the means of its greater party power and success . The other party , undoubtedly for like reasons , looks with disfavor upon efforts to change the i ? resent situation . But I am persuaded that *if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem which we call oul ' Race problem , with unbiased and unprejudiced minds-if they could consider truly the conditions and limitations which surround it , its nature , its causes , its history , they would agree in the conclusion that it is a problem which can not be solved by party political action of any kind . Such minds would see a numerical majority of voters in some States and many smaller communities controlled absolutely by a numerical minority . They would further find this numerical majority unfit to govern , ignorant , inexperienced , the easy victims of false guides , the ready dupes of selfish demagogues , unable to grasp public interests or to perform public duties . Seeing all this , such observers would with one voice , I think , reach the conclusion that until the numerical majority could be transformed into the majority in character , education , experience in the arts of government , in self-respect and self-reliance , the same result would continue and the real power and rule would of necessity remain with the minority in numbers which was nevertheless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , I think , say the remedy for this situation lies not in an attempt to reverse a law of moral and intellectual gravitation or dynamics , but in an effort to convert the numerical majority , by education , by all the civilizing and elevating arts of social life , into a self-respecting , self-sustaining , actual majority . Such a remedial process would of course be slow . It would involve a long tutelage , a long probationary service in // the school of experience and practical discipline . But if the existing situation were seen to be the result of centuries of servile relations and history , no philosophical observer , no truly philanthropic mind , would wonder at the situation or be disheartened at the task . Especially would no statesmanlike mind for a moment dream of attempting by outside force to clothe the incompetent numerical majority with powers of government which they had proved themselves unable to grasp and hold . Along such lines , through such influences , by such aids , and not otherwise , I see a wise , practicable , lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in urging it , above all in deploring and discountenancing the spirit of party which now encompasses and complicates this problem , I am conscious of no diminution of my personal fidelity to old ideals and principles . The problem which we have discussed has reached a stage where its wise and successful treatment is beyond the ken of politicians or mere philanthropists . It is a problem of statesmanship , of high public economy , of enlightened , prudent management , of patient , far-looking , cautious , adaptation of means suited to the great ends which are in view . I have read very recently an address on the subject I am discussing , delivered at Cambridge by a gentleman* for whom I have all the respect which high character , unselfish aims , and deep convictions can command . He represents not the iRepublican party , but that small number of men who from genuine philanthropic impulses cling to the idea that the country still owes to the colored race the duty of securing to it its right to vote in the Southern States . I quote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair and fresh statement of a demand which is still made by the class or body whom the speaker represents : " The true solution , " says Mr. ilallowell , " of the Southern question can not come until , in tones strong and unmistakable , the proclamation and the edict go forth from Washington that this is not a white man 's government , nor is it a black man 's government , but it is a government of all the people , white and black . That the political suppression of the colored * Mr. Richard P. Hallowell. // man must cease . That the rights of every American citizen must and shall be preserved . That the federal Constitution must be respected and obeyed . ' Let us make American citizenship as secure in Sonth Carolina as it is Massachusetts . " Here is a demand and programme which lack nothing except the important element of practicability . If Mr. Hallowell had anywhere in his address hinted at a method or measure for enforcing the demand he states , he would have put his address on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from Washington , " you will observe , that the proclamation must " go forth . " That is , the federal government must enforce the demand ; must make " American citizenship as secure in South Carolina as it is in Massachusetts . " If , now , Mr. Hallowell , or any one who agrees with him in this demand , will tell us plainly in what way this can be done , he will raise his demand from the level of mere declamation to a veritable question which the country should gravely consider . I might safely challenge him , I might safely challenge all Republicans , all men who demand new or further protection for the colored race , to tell how it can be done . I do not think I do the least injustice when I say that I do not believe any man who has given serious thought to the question , can , or thinks he can , devise a practicable , constitutional mode of securing the right of the colored race to vote in South Carolina through the agency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dishonest pretence ; with Mr. ilallowell and such as he , it is not a dishonest pretense but it is a mistaken conception of the nature of our governments , and the functions , respectively , of the Nation and the States . If to-day in Massachusetts a minority , in numbers , of her voters and citizens should resolve to exclude , by whatever device or force which did not constitute State action , the majority from exercising their political rights , and should carry the resolve into effect , the federal government would be as powerless to prevent or correct it as it is to prevent or correct it in South Carolina ; and the simple reason why all men in Massachusetts enjoy their political rights is because no majority in Massachusetts , by their ignorance and inexperience , arouses the minority to such action , and because no majority in Massachusetts is so weak , by reason of its igno // rance and inexperience , that it can not defend and secure its own rights . It is obvious that if there is no practicable method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southern States can be enforced by our political action , or by the action of the federal government , there is neither wisdom nor prudence , statesmanship or philanthropy , in continuing to make our Race problem , a political or partisan issue . The only course for reasonable and patriotic men is to recognize the facts as they exist , and to deal with the situation according to its nature and causes . The foremost fact is the ignorance and inexperience of the colored race . From that single , indisputable fact has come the determination of the white race at the South to suppress the vote of the colored race , as well as the practicability of enforcing that determination . To change this situation , to make a lasting solution of the Race problem , requires the removal of its causes , namely , the ignorance and incapacity for public affairs of the colored race . Time and the long influence of education and the slowly-maturing results of freedom are the methods to secure that solution . When we reflect that only twenty-five years have passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem are the result of two and a half centuries of the slavery of the colored race ; that the freedom and civil rights of that race are now recognized and declared by our Constitution and laws , the work that remains-the practical qualification of the colored race to meet the responsibilities and to exercise the rights which have been conferred on it-surely ought not to arouse impatience or suggest discouragement to the friends of the complete and universal , practical , civil and political freedom and self-government of all races and all men who make a part of our great body of citizens . The colored race only twenty-five years ago began its experience of civil freedom and government . Our own race began it at least eight centuries ago . I see no serious source of danger to the peaceful settlement of the problem I have discussed , except from the haste and impatience which misguided philanthropy may excite , and the antagonisms and conflicts which party rancor and party interests may arouse and keep alive . If , laying aside some rooted misconceptions and fully compre // hending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian forces of the country can be united in a patient , courageous , unflagging effort to prepare the one race at the South to use their rights with wisdom and prudence , and to persuade the other race to use its power mildly and generously and to welcome and promote by all the influences of education and friendly relations , the progress and elevation of the humbler and less fortunate race , we shall see the beginning , and our children may see the end , of the solution of the problem which shall crown the mission and glory of the American people .
