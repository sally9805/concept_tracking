txt Henry Riversdale Grenfell , Director of the Bank of England and a former Governor , nes a letter in The Times this morning , in the course of which he says : " As a bimetallist and as one of the senior members of the Bank Court , I think I have a right to ask on what ground the writer of the article entitled A Remonstrance ' in your Saturday issue makes his assertion that the Bank has decided to hold a fifth of its reserve in silver . Had the Bank done so its action would have been strictly in accordance with tho Bank Act of 1844 , and equally in accordance with the action taken in 1881 by the Government then presided over by a monometallist , Mr. Gladstone . What the Bank did in 1881 was to assure the Treasury that the Bank would always be open to the purchase of silver on condition of the return of the mints of other countries to such rules as would insure certainty of conversion of gold into silver and of silver into gold . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France alone was that the two metals did exchange throughout the world at a legal ratio , or with such slight variations as might , in consideration of this great subject , be neglected . There is no ground for saying that any one connectd with the bank has officially gone beyond that position . Indeed , I doubt if any opinion has been recorded or any determination come to at all . Your correspondent 's whole letter seems founded on a supposition of what may or may not have arisen in the necessary preliminary discussions with regard to the watering of the bank 's reserve with silver on the conditions mentioned in 1881 . " If I am not mistaken the very persons who deprecate this dilution have always been most desirous of a much greater dilution by the issue of pound notes on a more or less fiduciary basis . I may conclude by saying that the expression certain Americans ' is scarcely a fitting description of the Commissioners now officially charged by their Government for their difficult and onerous task .
