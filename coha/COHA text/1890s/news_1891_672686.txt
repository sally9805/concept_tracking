txt It is not easy to gather from the latest in-itallmeut of Bering 6ea correspondence which side is chiefly responsible for the delay in bringing about an agreement for the suspension of sealing operations during the present season . There is the appearance of , a lack of promptness on both sides . A good deal of delay seems to have been caused by Mr. BLAINE 'S failure to respond to Lord SALISBURY 'S communication of February on the subject of arbitration . Having caused this delay , the Secretary of State further embarrassed the negotiation by insisting that the terms of the arbitration be settled first , which would manifestly have made it impossible to effect a close season for this year . Then came the modification of the first proposal , reserving to the : North American Commercial Company the right to secure 7,500 skins to cover the cost of providing for the various wants of the natives employed on the Pribilof Islands , which caused some hesitation on the part of the British Minister at Washington and Lord SALISBURY . All through it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree in their understanding or recollection of the latter 's representations . On the other hand , it is apparent that there was some delay on the British side , due to communication with the Canadian Government to get its assent to the proposed arrangement . It seems to be understood now that there is to lac a suspension of seal catching in the open sea , and that the capture on the islands is to be strictly limited to what is necessary to cover the expense of providing for the natives . Final action by both Governments is now awaiting the passage of the bill by the English Parliament which is to authorize the prohibition of seal catching by British vessels within the waters of Bering Sea .
