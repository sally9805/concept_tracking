txt The Sugar Trust has been so much encouraged by the surrender of Mr. MCKINLEY and his Republican associates in the Ways and Means Committee that it now seeks to obtain from these gentlemen terms even more favorable than those which were granted at the midnight conference in Mr. MCKUTLEY 'S private rooms the night before the Tariff bill was reported to the House . We have already pointed out that substantially all of the work done openly in behalf of the refining interest or the Trust has been done by the so-called independent refiners of Philadelphia , who have made millions by selling sugar at the prices fixed by the Trust or at a rate only Is of a cent lower . These most useful but apparently unwilling allies of the great combination are now laboring with the majority members of the committee and telling the most doleful tales about the impending ruin of the entire refining industry , while it is well known that those who represent the sentiments of the Trust in this city have been rejoicing ever since the midnight change was made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball movement " in the certificates of the Trust on the Stock Exchange , where the price was higher by $9 a share at one time yesterday than it was the day before the committee changed its figures . The refiners who are at work openly in Washington are Messrs . KNIGHT and FRAZIER of Philadelphia . It is these gentlemen who show to Mr. MCKINLEY and his associates such long faces while the jubilant speculators representing the opinions of the I Trust are looking forward to a rich harvest of profits under the terms of the midnight compact . The Philadelphia refiners are beseeching the committee to lower the dividing line between dutiable and free sugars from No. 16 to No. 13 of the Dutch color standard , so that the low-grade yellow sugars suitable for use may he shut out . The Washington correspondent of the Philadelphia Ledger is the Clerk of the Ways and Means Committee , and on yesterday morning he reported as follows the proceedings at a " conference " between the refiners and " the Republican members of the com-mittee " : " These gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at No. 13 instead of at 16 , and that a sliding scale for sugars above No. 13 should be adopted . They said that 4-10 of one cent was not sufficient duty to protect the refining industry , and with that rate the business of refining sugar would have to be abandoned in this country . If the color line be continued at No. 16 , it was urged that the duty from 16 to 20 should be fixed at t of one cent , and above No. 20 at 1 ' 4 cents . " A " staff correspondent " of the Philadelphia Press , who has followed very closely for some weeks the movements of Mr. MCKINLEY and his associates , sent to that ? paper an account of the " conference , " from Which we take the following : " These gentlemen claimed that the bill , if it should become a law in its present shape , would practically close up the American refineries , in which , Mr. lrancirr said , from 550,000,000 to 575,000,000 was invested as cost of plant alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the refiners who appeared before the committee have put the cost of refining sugar at half a cent a pound . The committee , when ? . it fixed the sugar schedule , concluded that , if the entire cost of refining sugar ; is only half a cent a pound , 4-10 of a cent would be . ample , protection , as the cost of freight transportation here would increase the protection : Mr. DINGLEY , who gave special atteition. , to4this question , said that it would be:Ye give the refiners a protect tion that Wenteciii al the whole coat of refining. but Mr. KNIGHT and Mr. FRAZIER declared today that 4-10 of a Cent was not sufficient . They also thought that the duties ought to be graded. so that sugars froni 13 to 16 made free in the bill would pay one rate of duty , and from No. 16 to No. 20 another , and from No. 20 up still another . " The generous estimate that the sugarrefining plant represents an investment of from $50,000,000 to $75,000,000 , with as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the actual value of the entire plant put into the Trust was not more than one-third of the par value of the certificate capital of $50,000,000 . " The friends of the Sugar Trust , " said the Sun of the 19th , " are fairly jubilant over the modifications in the sugar tariff proposed by the Committee on Ways and Means . " If Mr. MCKINLEY and his assistants will read the market reports of the journals published in - this city , they may become curious as to the strange depression of the gentlemen from Philadelphia . The Tribune of the 21st said in its editorial review of last week : " Sugar certificates rose from 6234 to 6958 in the belief that the proposed duty on refined sugar would make the Trust richer . " But if the Trust , having procured in the bill changes that would give it free raw material and a protective duty greater than the entire cost of refining , shall hear that the so-called independ- - ent refiners have induced the committee to double that duty , it will not reject the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
