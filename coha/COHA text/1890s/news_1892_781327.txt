txt Not since a Texan was run through the hip with a bayonet by a Fort Russell guard has there been a disturbance in the prison of the Johnson County invaders until just before daylight this morning . At that time Frederick 0 . Debellier , one of the Harvard graduates who joined Major Wolcott 's party to kill rustlers , went daft . He lost his mind almost completely . His delusion is embarrassing and painful . Debellier , more than half naked , took a position in the centre of the large hall used as a prison and created a great panto by his speech . He declared that the Texans of the party had been scheming for weeks to deprive him of life , and that he had known of their plans and had been prepared to cope with them . This secret dirty work has been going on long enough , " said he . " I am now ready for you , come one at a time , or all together , just as you like . This is a good time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet him and in an instant a general scramble was in progress . The guards took charge of the crazy man and he was removed to a hotel . H. E. Tesohmaoher , Debellier 's business associate and best friend , was allowed to go as nurse . As time passed the patient 's nervousness became greater , and the strongest sedatives had no effect . A council of physicians was held this evening . Gov . Barber , a graduate from the Philadelphia University and Hospital and an insanity expert , was a member of the board . It was decided that Debellier would become hopelessly insane unless taken to the seashore . The court and Johnson County counsel will excuse him . Debellier is only thirty . His people are wealthy New-Yorkers . With Tescheinaoher he came to Wyoming in 1885 , and they have cattle and a ranch a hundred miles north of Cheyenne . The Texans. of whom fears have grown up in the mind of the demented man , are the fellows who came from the South under pay to assist in the work of exterminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest man on earth . At the " T. A. " siege and in all actions during the Johnson County war , Debellier was more recklessly brave than any other man in the party . On numerous occasions he walked or rode about in a shower of bullets and was always the first to volunteer for a hazardous undertaking . Being skilled he has led in all athlete sports . The Texans feel very bad about the case . It is learned that Debellier became overheated in a football game at Fort Russell ten days ago , but his mental troubles are ascribed to meditation over the war of the North and the approaching trial of the cattle men for the murder of Champion and Rae . In the venue trial to-morrow Laramie County will be considered , and forty Cheyenne residents have been called to testify . Redistricting Queens County . The Democratic Central Committee of Queens County met at Newtown , L. L , yesterday , and adopted a plan for redistricting the county in accordance With the now apportionment , which gives it three instead of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted , are as follows : First , the towns of Oyster Bay , Flushing , and North Hempstead ; Second . Long Island City . Newtown , Jamaica , and Hempstead . The plan recommended to the Supervisors , which the board , being Democratic , will doubtless approve , is as follows : First District . I , ong Island City : Second , Newtown , North Hempstead , and b'nluahing ; Third , Oyster Bay , Hempstead , and Jamaica . Oyster Bay and North Hempstead desired to have the districts remain as they are , excepting that Long island City be set apart as the new district . The new plan will - insure two Democratic members and make the third district close . Mfrs . George F. Adee hurt . While Mrs. George F. Adee , widow of George Adee , formerly Vice President of the Bank of Commerce of this city , was driving through the village of Westchester yesterday afternoon , the horses suddenly became frightened and dashed down the road , and she was thrown violently from the carriage . ' Her daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only slightinjuries . Mrs. Adee was removed to her home in Throgg 's Neek . Dr. Deming was summoned , and ho pronounced her injuries of a serious and perhaps fatal nature .
