txt For the first time since the new Government bond issue , gold was taken yesterday from the Sub-Treasury for export . The amount was $1,250,000 . It will be shipped to-day . Soon after the announcement of the withdrawal , came news that the Bank of England had reduced the price of gold ye pence per ounce . Bankers at once figured that in consequence shipments could not be made at a profit at present rates of exchange . Thereupon exchange-eased , and danger of further immediate engagements was averted . Another cause affecting exchange was the arrival . of wheat bills in the market . The New-York Times indicated several days ago that this would occur . Wheat has enjoyed an active export demand for the last fortnight . Ordinarily the movement begins early in the Fall . Abundant supplies from Russia and Argentina have , fed Europe until this time . Now that the appetite for American wheat has returned , it is expected to continue , and to offset in a measure the call from foreign money centres for American gold . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make gold remittances of $2,000,000 to Europe to-day , and which had intended to borrow it from banks and to replace it in installments by exchanges at the Sub-Treasury , bought wheat bills yesterday , and will send them to-day instead of gold . Should rates of exchange make no further advance , the Treasury gold reserve , it is thought , will not drop to $100,000,000 for some time . There have been daily gold withdrawals all this Week by bond purchasers who borrowed gold from the banks and are now repaying it . The amount taken from the reserve on this account reached $4,500,000 by Wednesday . Drafts on the reserve , including the amount taken for export , were estimated yesterday when business closed , at $7,000,000 . With the conditions now promised , bankers hope that , the local demand having been nearly satisfied apparently , the reserve will suffer no further decrease , until called upon to meet interest on American investments abroad , at the beginning of the new year .               @ @ @ @ @ @
