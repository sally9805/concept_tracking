SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND . By Samuel Eliot . HE history of the Perkins Institution has been written in its reports , in the biography of its first superintendent , in sketches of its more especially interesting pupils , and in other printed material . All this can be brought together , and the chief points in it can be touched upon once more . But the larger and the deeper history may still remain unwritten . When we would recall the work of an ordinary school for ordinary pupils , there is no great difficulty , though much must be left to the sensitiveness or the imagination of the inquirer . But a school for the blind is to be appreciated by the imagination , or by a sensitive conception of those whom it trains , their condition before they come to it , their experience in it , and after it , rather than by mere statistics , mere dates , or names , or outward memorials of any kind . In this spirit and taking for granted the willingness of our readers to make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into the life of one of the most remarkable of our charitable and educational institutions , we need not despair of conveying some general idea of its foundation and its subsequent development . The earliest outspoken proposal of founding a school for the blind in the United States was in 1826 . In that year a young physician of Boston returned from his medical studies in Paris resolved to make some provision for the blind at home corresponding to that which he had seen and repeatedly examined abroad . Paris had for about forty years pos-673 sessed a school in which pupils without sight had learned almost , and in some branches quite , as much as those with sight in the schools , and at last a stranger came from our shores by whom the value of the Parisian institution could be accepted , and its fitness to serve as a model for American institutions of similar character could be apprehended . If such instruction could succeed in France , there seemed no possible reason why it should not be equally and even more successful in America . Blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible , their neighbors would not be less concerned for them , and the situation might prove more favorable among our people than in Europe . It was a great purpose , a great hope , greater than can be measured to-day , unless the Boston of that time , nay more , the country of that time , is clearly DR . JOHN D. FISHER . // remembered . Precedents in this new direction were wanting , benevolent enterprises were very much slower in winning support , the public treasury was very much less easily drawn upon , while all available resources were already strained , or thought to be so , in sustaining existing charities . The young physician was John D. Fisher ; and to him , if to any one , belongs the signal distinction of having founded this school ,  --  not only this , but every other like school which followed after this , in the United States . It has been a matter of idle controversy when the first handful of blind children was gathered in our country to receive instruction , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher was the first to propose such a step , and the first also to lead in the measures essential to carry it into execution . Little is known concerning the personality of the founder . His name appears in the Boston directory of 1828 as that of a physician in practice , residing in his father 's house in Hayward Place . By that time he had succeeded in interesting some of his fellow-townsmen in his plans ; and early in 1829 a meeting was called to take action regarding them . He then made an address setting forth the character of the books required by the blind , the methods of teaching and particularly of manual training to be employed in their behalf . A committee appointed to consider the establishment of an institution reported within ten days , at an adjourned meeting in the Representatives ' chamber at the State House , a resolution in favor of the enterprise ; and after another address from Dr. Fisher , and commendatory remarks from several others a strong committee was named to obtain an act of incorporation , which passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asylum for the Blind , for the purpose of educating blind persons , " dated March 2 , 1829 . A pamphlet in explanation of the scheme and calling for contributions in its favor was immediately issued , and after considerable delay , the Corporation under the Act met , framed its by-laws , and in 1830 chose its first officers , Jonathan Phillips , president , and John D. Fisher at the head of the trustees . Another trustee was William H. Prescott , not DR . SAMUEL G. HOWE IN LATER LIFE . DR . SAMUEL G. HOWE IN EARLY MANHOOD . // 675 then the historian except in his studies , but an exceptionally attractive man , and much regarded in Boston . An article by him on the Education of the Blind , in the North American Review for July , 1830 , was a fresh starting-point for the institution in whose interest it was written . His own experience of partial blindness attracted his personal sympathy to the blind , and gave him clearer understanding of their situation than understand its limitations and sink beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more . Prescott 's article was a plea for a more cheerful view . Fisher probably asked him to write it , and supplied him with much of the material needed for it . He wrote calmly , and without entering into all the arguments that might have been employed . But he gave his readers ample reason to recon was at all common . Generally thought incapable to a great degree of really effective training , and utterly incapable of being trained to self-instruction or self-support , they appeared to be a peculiarly afflicted class , shut out from every enjoyment which sight can give , and , harder still , from every exertion to which sight was considered indispensable . The more they were taught , it was commonly supposed , the graver became their lot , for they would better sider any unfavorable opinions they might have formed with regard to the instruction or the possible self-dependence of the blind . He was just the champion they needed , making no claim to be their leader , but proving himself their friend ; and if one recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarly , and a man of Prescott 's social position exerted strong influence among his acquaintance , there is no need of saying more to show TilE PERKINs IN5TITUTION. // how quickening an impulse he must have given to a cause as yet but nominally set forth . He died nearly thirty years later amid the applause and lamentation of many nations , but no one , so far as we know , recalled his paper in the North American as a writing of his , or as a sign of his character , for which , as well as for his histories , praise and tears were due . It stands out still as a striking landmark in this present survey . No writings , however , could accomplish what was to be done . Action , and very resolute and able action , alone could give the needed impetus to a movement so original as this which had been started . Not the least , nay , the very greatest , of Dr. Fisher 's services was the enlistment of another young physician of Boston in his undertaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humane labors for the independence of Greece , now in the field , then among his own countrymen from whom he obtained supplies for his adopted people , his fellowBostonians were proudly familiar . Another sort of independence was now at stake , and Dr. Howe cast in his lot with it , and went to Paris to study there and elsewhere the work already accomplished for the blind in Europe . The formal record of this epoch in our history is as follows : " Articles of Agreement between the Trustees of the New England Asylum for the Blind and Dr. Samuel G. Howe . " 1st . It is agreedonthe part of Dr. Howe that he is to become from this date Principal or Superintendent of the Asylum for education of blind persons , and in this capacity to perform such duties as in the opinion of the Trustees the interests of the Asylum may from time to time require . " 2nd . The Trustees on their part agree to pay Dr. Howe for his services the sum of fifteen hundred dollars per annum ; or at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of Principal . " 3rd . The first duty of Dr. Howe will be to embark for Europe in order to make himself fully acquainted with the mode of conducting such Institutions , to procure one , or at most two , instructed blind as assistant teachers ; also the necessary apparatus . He is empowered to engage such persons as he may think qualified , and the Trustees bind themselves to fulfil any contracts he may make for such purposes . " 4th . The Trustees agree to allow Dr. Howe INSTITUTION . cOL . THOMA5 H. PERKINS . // his necessary travelling expenses when abroad on their service . " 5th . It is mutually understood and agreed that either of the parties may put an end to this agreement by giving to the other party six months notice - but in no other manner . " SAMUEL G. HowE . " " Boston , August i8th , 1831 , On the part of the Trustees of the New England Asylum for the Blind , " EDWARD BROOKS , JOHN D. FISHER , JOHN HOMANS . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher from the Paris school and another from an Edinburgh school , the latter to assume the manual training of the Boston school . In August the school was opened in the Pleasant Street house of Dr. Howe 's father , with six pupils . Writing of the day of the small beginnings of the school , an early visitor says : " Here in the simplest surroundings we found Dr. Howe . . . . He had then been about six months at work , and had invented and laboriously executed some books with raised letters to teach them to read , some geographical maps , and the geometrical diagrams necessary for instruction in mathematics . He had gummed twine upon cardboard , an enormous labor , to form the letters of the alphabet . " The gathering of the first pupils in the summer of 1832 determined the trustees of 1882 to celebrate their semi-centennial at that time , although they might have fixed upon 1829 , the date of incorporation , or 1831 , the engagement of Dr. Howe , as their starting-point . But they thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six sat at their superintendent 's feet , and were taught by those whom he had brought with European experience to teach them , then the real life of the school opened , and the prenatal period of mere foundation was complete . Dr. Fisher must have been content . He was a trustee , as has been mentioned , from 1830 , and continued such for twenty years . During a THE CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA . // year when Dr. Howe was absent , he took charge , and wrote the twelfth annual report , in which " its present condition " is described to be " such as to carry out in all respects the desires of its benevolent founders . " He died in 1850 ; and though the nearly half a century intervening has blanched his memory into a shade , it is one which every member of the school should continue to cherish . In January , 1833 , the trustees addressed a memorial to the Massachusetts legislature , from which some pecuniary assistance had been already derived , saying that they are " desirous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prosecute their design thus far , should witness the success of their experiment . Without further aid it will be impossible to continue the establishment even in its present humble condition , much less to extend its usefulness . " This memorial was referred to a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives , by whom a very sympathetic report was made , recognizing the results already achieved and opening the way to much larger ones by recommending an appropriation of six thousand dollars annually from the State Treasury . Legislative bounty was soon followed by private benefactions . Exhibitions of the pupils , and addresses in their behalf were given in various places , and nowhere without effect . A new emotion , not to say enthusi LAURA BRIDGMAN TEACHING OLIVER CASWELL TO READ . FLOWER MODELS FOR THE BOTANY CLASS . // asm , sprang up , first in eastern Massachusetts and then throughout New England , whose name it will be remembered had been given to the infant institution . The women of Salem , Marblehead and Newburyport united in a fair which produced nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a fair in Fanenil Hall , where many of those called leaders of society gave not time alone , or handiwork , but an influence which quickened the zeal of the community in the cause . A few copies of a dramatic sketch entitled " Scenes at the Fair " may still linger in the recesses of old Boston libraries . It made a great sensation in its day , for its . characters were not even thinly veiled under the names they bore , so true were they to their wellknown originals . It was something more than a jeu d'esprit , and added much to the prevailing interest in the school . The fair was followed , or rather accompanied , by " an act , " as the grateful trustees describe it , " so munificent as to excite astonishment and admiration even at the moment when all were generous . " Thomas H. Perkins , an eminent Bostonian , offered his house in Pearl Street , a large and attractive mansion with open spaces about it , for the permanent use of the blind and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition that a subscription of equal value , or twenty-five thousand dollars , should be made by the public ; and the condition was met twice over by fifty thousand contributed within a month . That month of May , 1833 , brought full bloom to the institution . As Emerson writes : " What potent blood bath modest May , For happy Spring To-day shall all her dowry bring , The love of kind , the joy , the grace , Hymen of element and race . " Exhibitions continued to take place in Massachusetts , then in Connecticut and other states , several of which sent blind pupils to the Boston school and made more or less liberal appropriations for their support . This course was pursued on ' a broader scale during subsequent years . Dr. Howe would take some of his children with him , allow them to go through their exercises , and in the strength which they showed and inspired urge legislatures and authorities to establish similar institutions for the blind . Thus the New England organization became seed for the country at large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street having been enlarged and adapted to its unwonted inmates , they were moved into it in September , 1833 . Thirtyfour pupils were in training at the end of the year , and the number continued to increase until within less than six years a removal to ampler quarters became necessary . Colonel Perkins again proved his liberality by consenting to the sale of the estate LAURA BRIDGMAN. // which he had unquestionably expected to be associated with him for a much longer period . An exchange was soon made for the Mount Washington House at South Boston , a large building with abundance of room , at least for the time ; and there in May , 1839 , the school settled under its new name of Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind . Asylum was then the prevailing name for all sorts of charitable institutions , and to this one it cleaved far longer than was reasonable ; but at length , in 1877 , it released its hold , making *yay for the more appropriate title of school . It need hardly be said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more out of town in 1839 than it is now . It had been built as a partly seaside hotel ; and the rude cut representing it in the Trustees ' Report of the year when it was occupied under their charge represents a large building on high and open ground above the waters of the harbor . They speak of " the greater salubrity of the location at South Boston , the advantages of unobstructed streets and open grounds in the neighborhood , and the facilities for sea-bathing . " In the more than half a century since then , not only have surrounding buildings pressed upon the estate , but many buildings of the school itself have been erected within its borders , until it has become something like a village encompassed by city streets and edifices . The year after the removal , a work department was organized for the benefit of blind men and women , mostly , if not entirely , former pupils of the school . As pupils , they and their companions had received indus trial training from the start , working on brooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane seats and other lines within the reach of hands unguided by eyes . This work department has been kept up at an annual loss of no great amount ; but had it been greater , it would appear to have been a judicious outlay , for without it many of our adult blind would have fallen perilously near to pauperism . A different labor has proved much more remunerative . It was early demonstrated that the blind were especially successful in pianotuning , and this has been developed under school influences into a widespread and highly satisfactory employment . Meantime the Commonwealth has persisted in its generosities . Nearly one hundred thousand dollars were appropriated in i868 and 1869 for buildings in which the girls might be quartered apart from boys , and other special grants were made at intervals . The annual allowance for the school // TIlE COTTAGES . tion ; for while other schools and charities of hers have had their dark days , her light has always streamed upon this one , and no name comes closer to its life than hers . Private benefactors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bequest of more than $40,000 from William Oliver of Dorchester in 1847 down to the little contributions of children , and even blind children of the school , the endowment of the institution has been constantly increased while special and cnrrent expenses have been met by offerings from hundreds and even thousands of annual or occasional subscribers . It would be vain to enumerate them here , nor would it be altogether just , unless an account were attempted of the circumstances attending the subscriptions , the very limited means of many rendering some of the smaller gifts the most generous of all . The brightest feature of our history is the self-sacrifice by which the work has been maintained . In 1837 a pupil of memorable character was received . Her training became the chief interest of the school for several years , and was watched throughout the country and abroad with intense sympathy . Indeed no member of our body has ever attracted such general consideration . Laura Bridgman , a child of eight years , was living in or near Hanover , N. H. , when Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and her parents , and win their consent to her being placed under his care . The first annual report after her arrival descrjbes her as " entirely blind , deaf , dumb , and almost entirely deprived of smell . . . . Here is a human soul shut up in a dark and silent cell ; all the avenues to it are closed except that of touch , and it would seem that it must be a blank ; nevertheless , it is active , and struggling continually not only to put itself in touch with things without but to manifest what is going on within itself . " These are Dr. Howe 's words , and they express the problem which he had underrose from six thousand dollars in 1833 to thirty thousand in later years , and is still maintained at that figure . Massachusetts has thus been the chief benefactor of her institution , and one may say her chosen institu // taken to solve . His deep satisfaction at persuading Laura Bridgman 's parents to entrust her to him on the afternoon of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and no set-back followed , no lessening of purpose , no discouragement at repeated failures to reach the imprisoned soul , until success was won . It is a story told in repeated reports and other publications , so that it need not be told anew , and there is nothing to add to the thrilling narratives of former years . Laura continued a pupil till she became a woman , and then , with some intervals of absence , resided in the institution till her death . Interest in her awl her marvellous expansion under her master 's h a n d s and heart was the very strongest feeling excited by his work ; and when he died , nearly forty years after he first saw her , she was his living memorial . At his funeral , she stood by his coffin , and let her hands stray from one end of it to the other with feelings which none but herself could express . She died in 1889 at the institution . Other pupils , similarly bereft of more senses than one , have succeeded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual power , but none have surpassed her prominence in the history of education . She owed an almost infinite debt to Dr. Howe and the institution , and they also owed much to her for the interest she aroused and the good will she inspired . Dr. Howe closed his earthly labors for the blind in January , 1876 . When his labors since his death will end no one can foresee , indeed they can never end . He was wonderfully fitted for them . Clear insight , strong convictions , unfailing courage and perseverance were among many qualities which made him an ideal helper of men , especially of individuals or classes in any way deprived of common human advantages . A man of very wide views , more given in truth to generalization than to details , extremely sensitive to every inaudible as well as every audible call upon his sympathies , and loving a forlorn hope much better than any hopeful certainty , he listened to Dr. Fisher in his early manhood , a n d gave himself readily and unreservedly to the work which proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o m 1830 or 1831 to 1876 , forty-five years were spent for the blind , the feebleminded , the prisoner , the slave and the suffering of every condition . It is vain to imagine what the Perkins Institution would have been without him . His ideas of administration , discipline , instruction and comprehensive organization were the ruling ones from the first , and if there were some mistakes in them , as there must have been , they were outweighed a hundredfold by his wisdom and his leadership . He forms , and will always form , the dominant personal element in our life as an institution , and just as John Harvard is the personality at Cambridge , Samuel G. Howe is that in South Boston . The obligation to him is not only for himself , but for his family , his wife and children , all of whom enlisted at one time or another in his work for MRs. JULIA HOWE ANAGNOS. // the blind . His eldest daughter , Julia , the wife of his successor , Michael Anagnos , is thus commemorated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One who grew up with this school , and who gave her energies and her rich resources of mind and character to its advancement and to the welfare of the blind . . . . From her childhood her sympathies were irresistibly drawn to her father 's enterprise ; and she became year by year , though not officially , a more and more valuable assistant . . She not only contributed to the instruction , teaching languages , reading choicest literature to classes of the pupils , conversing with them , and in a very quickening way , on serious and improving topics , but she was in an important sense the confidential friend of many of the girls . . . and also of the boys . . . . She did all she could to make their life here happy. ** Perhaps her most conspicuous service was her devotion to the kindergarten , for which her last words as she lay dying were breathed : " Take care of the little blind children . " A kindergarten class was formed at South Boston in 1879 , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather postponed , in a year or two . Before the postponement , in i88o , Mr. Anagnos made the first public proposal of a separate department , and repeated it with greater emphasis in 1882 . The list of contributors begins with January , 1883 , and from this date there is no delay in moving forward , until in 1887 the kindergarten is incorporated under the wing of the parent school , and the dedication of its first building at Jamaica Plain is celebrated with children 's exercises and several addresses from their friends on the 19th of April . That was a glad day in this story . It assured to little children , then and thereafter , the training hitherto beyond their reach simply because they were little , the very reason which now made their presence welcome . It gave them the care as well as the instruction , the play as well as the work , the cherishing nurture , for all of which they had been waiting , and which would now invest the blind themselves and every labor bestowed upon them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLIND .

No description in detail is called for in this article , as a year since the New England Magazine gave a very full account of the kindergarten. * The first contribution was from the children of the Perkins Institution , who were followed by many men and women , some with large , very large , *some with small offerings . Among those already passed away were 1-Jelen C. Bradlee , Lucy Ann Dwight , Mrs. Richard Perkins , Mrs. Benjamin S. Rotch , Henry B. Rogers , Sidney Bartlett and Royal W.

The formal announcement that the kindergarten was at hand proved to be the principal sensation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another crown of the anniversary was the completion of the printing fund of one hundred thousand dollars by private subscription , to endow the Howe Memorial Press . More felicitous memorial could not have been devised . Dr. Howe , though not unaided , had been foremost in improving the style and detail of printing for the blind , and during his long administration had rendered it far more manageable than he found it ; and with these fresh resources it promised to be of much greater service . The trustees adopted the following resolves : " Whereas , The object of the friends of the blind in raising an endowment of one hundred thousand dollars for the Howe Memorial Press , ' is not only to provide the pupils of our institution with an adequate supply of embossed books and tangible apparatus , but also to render our publications accessible to all sightless readers in New England , and to aid , so far as it lies in our power , all other MODELLING IN SAND . // GIRLS ' SEWING ROOM . schools similar to our own in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolved , That copies of the books issued by our press be placed in the public libraries of Providence , Rhode Island ; Worcester , Massachusetts ; Hartford , Connecticut ; and Lewiston , Maine , to be loaned free of charge to all blind persons who may desire to read them . " Resolved , That all our publications be sold to regular institutions at fifteen per cent below the actual cost marked on our catalogue. ** The publications of the Perkins Institution now embrace a long list of works , both old and new , and a few in Latin and German . There are also very many pieces of sheet music , for band , piano , violin , and the voice . A collection of wall maps and dissected maps supplements the textbooks in geography and history . They are made at the institution , and considered superior to those of other manufacture . A full account of the semicentennial appeared as a supplement to the fifty-first annual report .

The spirit of the hour is in some lines by Mrs. Anagnos read during the celebration : " Not the serpent , but the dove , Heralds forth the cause we love ; Cause which all conspire to aid , Which the great their own have made , And the gentle for it prayed , And the strong worked undismayed .

Their happiness has been the aim of those 1*ThO founded and first administered these schools ; it is the aim of their successors ; and the eye fails to see what is to be seen , the spirit fails to understand what is to be understood , if the little children of the kindergarten , the older boys and girls of the Perkins Institution are not regarded among those whom God himself wills to be happy .
