SOME MEMORIES OF HAWTHORNE . Iv . IN order to give an idea of how it happened that our family could return from Europe to Concord with a few great expectations , I will rehearse somewhat of the charm which had been found in the illustrious village when my father and mother first knew it . There a group of people conversed together who have left an echo that is still heard . There also is still heard " the shot fired round the world , " which of course returned to Concord on completing its circuit . But even the endless concourse of visitors , making the claims of any region wearisomely familiar , can not diminish the simple solemnity of the town 's historical as well as literary importance ; and indeed it has so many medals for various merit that it is no wonder its residents have a way of speaking about it which some of us would call Bostonian . Emerson , Thoreau , Channing , Margaret Fuller , and Alcott dispersed a fragrance that attracted at once , and all they said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed to a member of her family unbroken murmurs of satisfaction in the peaceful experiences at The Wayside : - July 3 , 1852 . Last week was memorable in the children 's life by the occurrence of a party . Mrs. Emerson , with magnificent hospitality , invited all the children in town , from babyhood upwards ( and their mothers ) , for a great festival . Rose and I were prevented from going by the arrival of three gentlemen from Boston , who stayed to tea ; one being the brilliant Mr. Whipple . . . . First arrived General Solomon McNeil , an old veteran nearly seven feet tall , whose head was amazingly near the ceiling of our low dining - room . His gray hair stood up straight , full of deriioniac energy , and his gray eyes flashed beneath overhanging brows . As he entered the room I advanced to meet him , and he said : " Mrs. Hawthorne , I presume . I have scarcely seen your husband , hut I have known him well for fifteen years . " At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wielding a sword with intent to do battle . . . . Mr. Hawthorne came in , and the old gentleman placed his hand with such force on his shoulder that you would have supposed he had dubbed him knight . . . . They left the room for the 1896. 649 // study , the general brandishing the sword tremendously at every sentence he uttered . . . . The next day I went to see Mrs. Emerson . I found Mr. Emerson sitting on the side doorstep , with Edith on his knee , and Edward riding about the lawn on his pony . Mr. Emerson said that " the show of children was very pretty ; but Julian ! He makes his mark everywhere ; there is no child so fine as Juhan . " Was not that pleasant to hear , from him ? I told him how singular it was that Julian should find in Concord a pony , the desire of his imagination for two years . He smiled like Sirius . " Well , that is good . Send him this afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me on the pony , mount Julian , and fetch him back . And this was accordingly done . First , however , he invited me to go up on the hilltop opposite his house , whence there is a fine view . July 4th . Mr. Hawthorne , Una , and Julian have gone to a picnic with Ellen and Edith Emerson . This morning I went to the post-office , and Julian , who always is my shadow , went with me . I stopped at Mrs. Emerson 's to ask her when and how her children were going . I found a superb Washington in the dining-room , nearly as large as life , engraved from Stuart . We saw no one of the family ; but finally a door opened , and the rich music of Mr. Emerson 's voice filled the entry , and Ellen and her father caine into the room . Mix Emerson asked me if that head ( pointing to Washington ) were not a fine celebration of the Fourth of July . " He would seem to have absorbed into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left none elsewhere , excepting , " and he laid his hand on Juhian , " excepting what is in Julian . Washington is the Great Repose , and Julian is the Little Repose , hereafter to become also the Great Repose ! He asked if Juhian were going to the picnic , and I told him " no , " as I was not going . " Oh , but if Una is going , that would be a divided cherry , would it not ? " Finding that Mrs. Emerson was to go , and that they were all to ride , I of course had no objection . And then Mr. Emerson wanted Mr. Hawthorne to go with him at five o'clock . My lord consented , and so they are all gone . Last evening Mrs. Emerson came to see us , loaded with roses . . . . My husband has sold the grass for thirty dollars , and has cut all his bean-poles in his own woods . We find The Wayside prettier and prettier . A few words from a letter of Emerson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true impression of the friendship which existed strongly between the two lovers of their race , who , though they did not have time to meet often , may be said to have been together through oneness of aim - July 11 , 1864 . I have had my own pain in the loss of your husband . He was always a mine of hope to me , and I promised myself a rich future in achieving at some day , when we should both be less engaged to tyrannical studies and habitudes , an unreserved intercourse with him . I thought I could well wait his time and mine for what was so well worth waiting . And as he always appeared to me superior to his own performances , I counted this yet untold force an insurance of a long life . . R. W. EMERSON . If my father expected a full renewal of comradeship with American men of his own circle , and even the deeper pleasure of such friendship in a maturer prime alluded to by Emerson , circumstances sadly intervened . The thunderstorm of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into himself than he had done in Europe , although he felt that sorrow heavily . Or perhaps I might say with greater correctness that when he appeared , it was without the joyous air // that he had lately displayed in England , among his particular friends , when his literary work was over for the time being after the finishing of Monte Beni . I remember that he often attended the dinners of the Saturday Club . A bill of fare of one of the banquets , but belonging to an early date , 1852 , reads : " Tremont House . Paran Stevens , Proprietor . Dinner for Twelve Persons , at three o'clock . " A superb menu follows , wherein canvasback ducks and Madeira testify to the satisfaction felt by the gentlemen whose names my father penciled in the order in which they sat ; Mr. Emerson , Mr. Clough , Mr. Ellery Channing , Mr. Charles Sumner , Mr. Theodore Parker , Mr. Longfellow , Mr. Lowell , Mr. Greenough , Mr. Samuel Ward , and several others making the shining list . His keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hold back from visits even to his of physical strength , which had now begun to sink . Lowell tried to fascinate him out of seclusion , in the frisky letter given in A Study of Hawthorne ; but very likely did not gain his point , since Longfellow and others did not have much success in similar attempts . I chanced to discover the impression my father made upon Dr. Holmes , as we sat beside each other at a dinner given by the Papyrus Club of Boston more than fifteen years ago , on ladies ' night . That same evening I dashed down a verbatim account of part of our conversation , which I will insert here . He passed his card over to my goblet , and took mine . " That is the simplest way , is it not ? " he asked . " I was just going to introduce myself , " said I. Then Mrs. Elizabeth Stoddard sat down by me , and I turned to speak with her . In a moment Dr. Holmes held my card forward again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you do n't know who I am , yet ? " I asked . He smiled , gazed at the card through his eyeglasses , and leaned towards me hesitatingly . " And what was your name ? " he ventured . " Rose Hawthorne . " He started , and beamed . " There ! I thought - but you understand how - if I had made a mistake - Could anything have been worse if you had not been ? I was looking , you know , for the resemblance . Some look I seemed to discover , but " - " The complexion , " I helped him by interrupting , " is entirely different . " He went on : " I was - no , I can not say I was intimate with your father , as others may have been ; and yet a very delightful kind of intercourse existed between us . I did not see him often ; but when I did , I had no difficulty in making him converse with me . My intercourse with your mother was also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied respecting the admiration of my parents for him . " I delighted in suggesting a train of thought to your father , " Dr. Holmes ran on , in his exquisitely cultured way , and with the esprit which has surprised us all by its loveliness . " Perhaps he would not answer for some time . Sometimes it was a long while before the answer came , like an echo ; but it was sure to come . It was as if the high mountain range , you know ! - The house-wall there would have rapped out a speedy , babbling response at once ; but the mountain ! - I not long ago was visiting the Custom House at Salem , the place in which your father discovered those mysterious records that unfolded into The Scarlet Letter . Ah , how suddenly and easily genius renders the spot rare and full of a great and new virtue ( however ordinary and bare in reality ) when it has looked and dwelt ! A light falls upon the place not of land or sea ! How much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the soft haze , that now rests upon our glaring New England ! He has done it , and it will never be harsh country again . How perfectly he understood Salem ! " " Salem is certainly very remarkable , " I responded . Yes , certainly so , " he agreed . " Strange folk ! Salem had a type of itself in its very harbor . The ship America , at Downer 's wharf , grew old and went to pieces in that one spot , through years . Bit by bit it fell to atoms , but never ceded itself to the new era . So with Salem , precisely . It is the most delightful place to visit for this reason , because it so carefully retains the spirit of the past ; and The House of the Seven Gables ! " Dr. Holmes smiled , well knowing the intangibility of that house . Said I : " The people are rich in extraordinary oddities . At every turn a stranger is astonished by some intense characteristic . One feels strongly its different atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Holmes cried , vivacious in movement and glance as a boy . " Where else are the little door.yards that hold their glint of sunlight so tenaciously , like the still light of wine in a glass ? Year after year it is ever there , the golden square of precious sunbeams , held on the palm of the jealous garden . patch , as we would hold the vial of radiant wine in our hand ! Do you know ? " He so forcibly appealed to my ability to follow his thought that I seemed to know anything he wished . " I hope I shall not be doing wrong , " he continued , - " I hope not , - in asking if you have any preference among your father 's books ; supposing you read them , which I believe is by no means always the case with the children of authors . " " I am surprised by that remark . After the age of fifteen , when I read all my father 's writings except The Scarlet Letter , which I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study his books thoroughly till several years ago , in order to cherish the enjoyment of fresh effects , - except The Marble Faun , which I think I prefer . " He answered : " I feel that The Scar . let Letter is the greatest . It will be , it seems to me , the one upon which his future renown will rest . " I admitted that I also considered it the greatest . In the above conversation I was entranced by what I have experienced often : the praise of my father 's personality or work ( in many cases by people who have never met him ) is not only the courtesy that might be thought decorous towards a member of his family , or the bright zest of a student of literature , but also the glowing ardor of a creature feeling itself a part of him in spirit ; one who longs for the human sweetness of the grasp of his hand ; who longs to hear him speak , to meet his fellowship , but finds the limit reached in saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him ! " I have lowered my eyes before the emotion to be observed in the faces of some of his readers who were trying to reach him through a spoken word of eagerness . Very few have seen him , but *how glad I am to cross their paths ! Dr. Holmes 's warmth of enthusiasm was so radiant that it could not be forgotten . It lit every word with the magic of the passion we feel for what is perfect , unique , and beyond our actual possession , now and forever . After our return home , the first notes of the requiem about to envelop us fell through the sound of daily affairs , at long intervals , because my father , from that year , began to grow less and less vigorous . But I will give a few glimpses of our neighbors and surroundings . It was never so well understood at The Wayside that its owner had somewhat retiring habits as when Alcott was reported to be approaching along the Larch Path , // which stretched in feathery bowers between our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seer failed at any hour to gain admittance , - one cause , perhaps , of the awe in which his visits were held . I remember that my observation was attracted to him curiously from the fact that my mother 's eyes changed to a darker gray at his advents , as they did only when she was silently sacrificing herself . I clearly understood that Mr. Alcott was admirable ; but he sometimes brought manuscript poetry with him , the dear child of his own Muse , and a guest more unwelcome than the proverbial enfant terrible of the drawing-room . There was one particularly long poem which he had read aloud to my mother and father ; a seemingly harmless thing , from which they never recovered . Out of the mentions made of this effusion I gathered that it was like a moonlit expanse , quiet , somnolent , cool , and fiat as a month of prairies . Rapture , conviction , tenderness , often glowed upon Alcott 's features and trembled in his voice . I believe he was never once startled from the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible of realization through talk . Another peculiar spirit now and then haunted us , usually sad as a pine - tree , - Thoreau . His enormous eyes , tame with religious intellect and wild with the loose rein , making a steady flash in this strange unison of forces , frightened me dreadfully at first . The unanswerable argument which he unwittingly made to soften my heart towards him was to fall desperatelyill . During hi* long illness my mother lent him our sweet old music - box , which softly dreamed forth its tunes in a mellow tone . When he died , it seemed as if an anemone , more lovely than any other , had been carried from the borders of a wood into its silent depths , and dropped , in solitude and shadow , among the recluse ferns and mosses which are so seldom disturbed by passing feet . Son of freedom and oppor tunity that he was , he touched the heart by going to nature 's peacefulness like the saints , and girding upon his American sovereignty the hair-shirt of service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever we walked in them . Hawthorne had returned , for the purpose of cherishing American loyalty in his children , from a scene that was after his own heart , even to the actors in it . He had hoped for quietude and the inimitable flavor of , home , of course ; but this hope was chiefly a self-persuasion . The title of his first book after returning , Our Old Home , was a concise confession . He would have considered it a base resource to live abroad during the war , bringing up his son in an alien land , however dear and related it might be to our bone and sinew ; and if his children did not enjoy the American phase of the universe in its crude stage , he , at any rate , had done his best to make them love it . His loyalty was always something flawless . A friend might treat him with the grossest dishonor , but he would let you think he was himself deficient in perception or in a proper regard for his money before he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With loyal love , he had , for his part , wound about New England the purple haze of which Dr. Holmes spoke in ecstasy , because he had found his country standing only half appreciated , though with a wealth of virtue and meaning that makes her fairer every year . With love , also , he came home , after having barely tasted the delights of London and Oxford completeness . In Concord he entered upon a long renunciation . Of necessity this was beneficial to his art . He was now fully primed with observation , and The Dolliver Romance , hammered out from several beginnings that he successively cast aside , appeared so exquisitely pure and fine because of the hush of fasting and reflection which environed the worker . // It is the unfailing history of great souls that they seem to destroy themselves most in relation to the world 's happiness when they most deserve and acquire a better reward . He was starving , but he steadily wrote . He was weary of the pinched and unpromising condition of our daily life , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unflagging manliness , though with longer and longer intervals of wordless reserve . As to any- - thing that interested us , he joined in it at least sufficiently to turn his luminous eyes upon our enthusiasm with his genial " h'm-m " of permission . I was never afraid to run to him for his sympathy , as he sat reading in an easy-chair , in some one of those positions of his which looked as if he could so sit and peruse till the end of time . I knew that his response would be so cordially given that it would brim over me , and so melodiously that it would echo in my heart for a great while ; yet it would be as brief as the single murmurous stroke of one from a cathedral tower , half startling by its intensity , but which attracts the birds , who wing by preference to that lofty spot . There are many references in my mother 's diaries and letters to my father 's enforced monotony , and also to his gradually failing health , which , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed as fatal ; though , from his expression of face , if for no other reason , I judge he himself understood it perfectly . Death sat with him , at his right hand , long before he allowed his physical decline to change his mode of life . He tried to stem the tide setting against him , because it is the drowning maim 's part , even if hopeless . He walked a great deal upon the high hill-ridge behind the house , his dark , quietly moving figure passing slowly across the dun light of mingled sky and branches , as seen from the large lawn , around which the embowered terraces rose like an amphitheatre . A friend tells me that , from a neighboring farm , he sometimes watched my father in an occupation which he had undertaken for his health . A cord of wood had been cut upon the hill , and he deliberately dragged it to the lower level of his dwelling , two logs at a time , by means of a rope . Along the ridge and down the winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up , stopping to solve some point of plot or morals ; and meanwhile the cord of wood changed its abiding-place as surely as water may wear away a stone . But his splendid vigor paled , his hair grew snowy white , before the end . My mother wrote to him in the following manner from time to time , when he was away for change of scene - September 9 , 1860 . My crown of glory . This morning I waked to clouds and rain , but for myself I did not care , as you were not here to be depressed by it . There was a clear and golden sunset , making the loveliest shadows and lights on the meadows and across my straight path over the field to the willows , between firs , and now the stars shimme. - The way in which Concordians observe Fast is by loafing about the streets , driving up and down , and dawdling generally . No one seems to mourn over his own or his country 's sins . Such behavior must disturb our Puritan fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the evening Julian brought me a letter . " It is from New York , " said he , " but not from papa . " But my heart knew better , though I did not know the handwriting . I dashed is open , and saw , " N.

I could see and hear everything growing around me in the warm rain . The army corn has hopped up as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies . Pigweed has become camelopard weed . . . . Alas that you should be insulted with dried-apple pie and molasses preserves ! Oh , horror ! I thought that you would have fresh fruit and vegetables . Pray go to a civilized house and have decent fare . - I know it will do you immense good to make this journey . You should oftener make such visits , and then you would " like things " better . Your spirits get below concert pitch by staying in one place so long at a time . I am glad Leutze keeps you on to paint his portrait . Do not come home till the middle of September . Just remember how hot and dead it is here in hot weather , and how you can not bear it . - I do not think I have a purer pleasure and completer satisfaction , nowadays , than I am conscious of when I get you fairly away from Concord influences . I then sit down and feel rested through my whole constitution . All care seems at an end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . It was red-hot from morn to dewy eve . We burned without motion or sound . But you were in Boston , and not under this hill . If you wish me to be happy , you must consent to spend the dogdays at the sea . - After a cool morning followed a red-hot day . It seemed to me more intolerable than any before . You could not have borne such dead weather . The house was a refrigerator in comparison to the outdoor atmosphere . - We have had some intolerably muggy days . That is , they would have been so , if you had not been at the sea . - You have been far too long in one place without change , and I am sure you will get benefit under such pleasant conditions as being the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Horatio Bridge , and a witness of such new phases of life as those in Washington . - Splendors upon splendors have been heaped into this day . Loads of silky plumed corn or even sheaves of cardinal flowers can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have filled the earth from early dawn . The brook that became a broad river in the flood of yesterday made our landscape perfect . It seemed to me that I must dance and sing , and now I know it was because you were writing to me . Rose and I went down the straight path called later the Cathedral Aisle to look at the fresh river . I delayed to be embroidered with gold sun over and over , and through and through . At the gate I was arrested by the tower , also illustrious with the glory of the atmosphere , and very pretty indeed , lifting its nice , shapely head above the decrepit old ridge-pole of the ancient house . - I took my saw and went on a lovely wander , with a fell intent against all dead and confusing branches . How infinitely sweet it is to have access to this woodland virtue ! It does me measureless good ; and I am sure such air as we have on these fine days must be the effect of heroic and gentle deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , but tens of thousands of heroes on this earth , keeping it in life and being . - Your letter has kindled us all up into lamps of light to-day . But I am wholly dissatisfied with your boarding-house , so full of deaf wonien , and violin din , and schoolgirls ! Pray change your residence and have peace . You will curse your stars if you have to " bellow " for three weeks , when you so hate to speak even in your natural inward tone . - Mary has just sent me a note , saying that there is a paragraph in the paper about your being at Washington , and that the President Lincoln received you with especial graciousness . Stay as long as you can , and get great good . I can not have you return yet . - The President has had a delicious palaver with a deputation of // black folk , talking to them as to babies . I suspect the President is a jewel . I like him very well . - If it were not such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crisis , and show the world what can be done by using two eyes , and turning each thing upside down and inside out , before judging and acting . I should not wonder if thy great presence in Washington niight affect the moral air and work good . If you like the President , then give him my love and blessing . - The President 's immortal special message fills me with unbounded satisfaction . It is so almost superhumanly wise , moderate , fitting , that I am ready to believe an angel came straight from heaven to him with it . He must be honest and true , or an angel would not come to him . Mary Mann says she thinks the message feeble , and not to the point . But I think a man shows strength when he can be moderate at such a moment as this . Thou hadst better give my high regards to the President . I meant to write to him ; but that mood has passed . I wish to express my obligations for the wisdom of his message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother s consciousness , so that she gave every evidence of foretelling my father 's death without once presenting the possibility to herself . This little note of mine , dated April 4 , 1864 , six weeks before he died , shows the truth : - " I am so glad that you are getting on so well ; but for your own sake I think you had better stay somewhere till you get entirely well . Mamma thought from the last letter from Mr. Ticknor that you were not so well ; but Julian explained to her that , as Mr. Ticknor said in every line that you were better , he did not see how it could possibly be . I do not either . " . From the first year of our return to America letters and visitors from abroad had interrupted the sense of utter quiet ; and many friends called in amiable pil May , grimage . But a week of monotony is immensely long , and a few hours of zest are provokingly short . Nature and seclusion are welcome when , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England is refreshing with the nearness of London . In the rush of cares and interruptions which we suppose will kill the opportunity , while we half lose ourselves and our intellectual threads of speculation , the flowers of inspiration suddenly blow , the gems flash color . This is a pleasant , but not always an essential satisfaction ; yet , in my father 's case , I think his life suffered with peculiar severity from the sudden dashing aside of manly interests which he had already denied to himself , or which circumstances had denied to him , with the utmost per . sistence ever known in so perceptive a genius . He undoubtedly had a large store of inherited experiences to draw upon ; he was richly endowed with these , and could sit and walk alone , year after year ( except for occasional warm reunions with friends of the cleanest joviality ) , and feel the intercourse with the world , of his ancestors , stirring in his veins . He tells us that this was ghostly pastime ; but it is an inheritance that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When too late , the great men about him realized that they had estimated his presence very cheaply , considering his worth . Should he frequently have sought them out , and asked if they were inclined to spare a chat to Hawthorne ; or should they have insisted upon strengthening their greatness from his inimitably pure and unerring perception and his never weary imagination ? It is impossible to ignore the superiority of his simplicity of truth over the often labored searchings for it of the men and women he knew , whose very diction shows the straining after effect , the desire to enchant themselves with their own minds , which is the bane of greatness , or else the uneasy skip and jump of a wit that dares not keep still . As time ri*ens , // these things are more and more apparent to all , as they were to him . In a manner similar to Emerson 's , who spoke of his regret for losing the chance of associating fully with my father , Longfellow wrote to my mother : - June 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the volume of Goldsmith . There are some things one can not say ; and I hardly need tell you how much I value your gift , and how often I shall look at the familiar name on the blank leaf , - a name which more than any other links me to my youth . I have written a few lines trying to express the impressions of May 23 1864 , the date of Hawthorne 's burial . I trust you will pardon their deficiencies for the love I bear his memory . More than ever I regret that I postponed from day to day coming to see you in Concord . With deepest sympiithy , Yours truly , HENRY W. LONGFELLOW . To go back to our Concord amusements . Mr. Bright caroled out a greeting not very long after our return : - WEST DERBY , September 8 , 1860 . DEAR MR .

Do you remember all our talks in that odious office of yours ; my visits to Rockferry ; my one visit , all in the snow , to Southport ; our excursions into Wales , and through the London streets , and to Rugby and to Cambridge ; and how you plucked the laurel at Addison 's Bilton , and found the skeleton in Dr. Williams 's library ; and lost your umbrella in those dark rooms in Trinity ; and dined at Richmond , and saw the old lady looking like a maid of honor of Queen Charlotte 's time ; and chatted at the Cosmopolitan ; and heard Tom Hughes sing the Tight Little Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only trust that now at last you will be convinced of my existence , and remnember your promise , and write me a good long letter about everything and everybody .

And so did Mrs. Ainsworth , whom I met two days ago . But she says you promised to write her the story of the Bloody Footstep The Ancestral Footstep , and have never done it .

Ask Longfellow to come over here very // soon . And for yourself , ever believe me most heartily yours , H. A. BRIGHT . A friend of Mr. Bright 's pardons my father 's unfeeling indifference by a request - WALTHAM HOUSE , WALTHAM CRoss , August 10 , 1861 . DEAR MR .

Then , again , Concord itself sparkled occasionally , even outside of its perfect Junes and Octobers , as we can see here in the merry geniality of Louisa Alcott , who no more failed to make people laugh than she failed to live one of the bravest and best of lives . In return for a package of birthday gifts she sent us a poem , from which I take these verses - The Hawthorne is a gracious tree From latest twig to parent root , For when all others leafless stand It gayly blossoms and bears fruit . On certain days a friendly wind Wafts from its spreading boughs a store Of canny gifts that flutter in Like snowflakes at a neighbor 's door .

Time will give it an evergreen name , Axe can not harm it , frost can not kill ; With Emerson 's pine and Thoreau 's oak Will the Hawthorne be loved and honored still ! A source of deep enjoyment to my father was a long visit from his sister , Ebie Hawthorne ( he having given her that pretty title instead of any other abbreviation of Elizabeth ) . I came to know her very well in after- years , and was astonished at her magic resemblance to my father in many ways . I always felt her unmistakable power . She was chock-full of worldly wisdom , though living in the utmost monastic retirement , only allowing herself to browse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew the latest news from the papers , and the oldest classics alongside of them . She was potentially , we thought , rather hazardous , or perverse . But language refuses to explain her . Her brother seemed not to dream of this , yet no doubt relished the fact that a nature as unique as any he had drawn sparkled in his sister . She was a good deal unspiritual in everything ; but all besides in her was fine mind , wisdom , and loving-kindness of a lazy , artistic sort . That is to say , she was unregenerate , but excellent ; and she fascinated like a wood-creature seldom seen and observant , refined and untrained . My sister was devoted to her , and says , for the hundredth time , in a passage among many pages of their correspondence bequeathed to me - M* OWN DEAR AUNTIE , - I was made very happy by your letter this week . What perfectly charming letters you write ! Now , do n't laugh and say I am talking nonsense ; it is really true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of telling them ; and your observations and humor are so keen that I often feel sorry the world does not know something of them . I never remember you to have told me anything twice , and that can be said of very few people ; but // there are few enough people in the least like you , my dearest auntie . My father began to express his wishes in regard to provision for our aunt in case of his death ; to burn old letters ; and to impart to my mother and lJna all that he particularly desired to say to them , among other things his dislike of biographies , and that he forbade any such matter in connection with himself in any distance of the future . This command , respected for a number of years , has been , like all such forcible and prophetic demurs , most signally set aside . It would take long to explain my own modifications of opinion from are , uments of fierce resistance to the request for a biographical handling of him ; and it matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thoroughly known , as great saints are always sooner or later known , though endeavoring to hide their victories of holiness and charity . Certainly my father did not like to die , though he now wished to do so . My mother , later , often spoke , in consolation for us and for herself , of his dread of helpless old age ; and she tried to be glad that his desire to disappear before decrepitude had been fulfilled . But such wise wishes are not carried out as we might choose . The sudden transformation which took place in my father after his coming to America was like an instant 's change in the atmosphere from sunshine to dusky cold . I have never had the least difficulty in explaining it to myself ; but I might ramble on unpardonably if I developed here the hints already given of my view . One large item in the sum of his regrets was his unexpectedlynarrowed means . It would have required a generous amount of money to put The Wayside and its grounds into the delectable order at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English perfection , and my parents found that they could not afford it ; and so all resulted in semi-comfort and rough appearances . This narrowing of means was caused not a little by the want of veracity of a person whom my father had trusted with entire affection and a very considerable loan , about which we none of us ever heard again . A crust becomes more than proverbially dry under these circumstances . My mother bore every reverse nobly . She writes , after her husband 's death : " I have enjoyed life , ' and its hard pinches ' have not too deeply bitten into my heart . But this has been because I am not only hopeful and of indomitable credence by nature , but because this temperament , together with the silent ministry of pain , has helped me to the perfect , the unshadowed belief in the instant providence of God ; in his eternal love , patience , sweetness ; in his shining face , never averted . It is because I can not be disappointed on account of this belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my instinct , my best wisdom , my inspiration ; and I always hear the still , small voice at last . If man would not babble so much , we could much oftener hear God . The lesson of my life has been patience . It has only made me feel the more humble that God has been so beyond count benignant to me . I have been cushioned and pillowed with tender love from the cradle . Such a mother seldom falls to the lot of mortals . She was the angel of my life . Her looks and tones and her acts of high-bred womanhood were the light and music and model of my childhood . Then God joined my destiny with him who was to be all relations in one . Pain passed away when my husband came . Poverty was lighter than a thistledown with such a power of felicity to uphold it . With lowering clouds ' I have never been long darkened , because the sun above has been so penetrating that their tissue has directly become silvered and goldened . Our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ever-shining sun . I // hold all as if it were not mine , but God 's , and ready to resign it . " It seemed to me a terrible thing that one so peculiarly strong , sentient , luminous , as my father should grow feebler and fainter , and finally ghostly still and white . Yet when his step was tottering and his frame that of a wraith , he was as dignified as in the days of greater pride , holding himself , in military self-command , even more erect than before . He did not omit to come in his very best black coat to the dinner-table , where the extremely prosaic fare had no effect upon the distinction of the meal . He hated failure , dependence , and disorder , broken rules and weariness of discipline , as he hated cowardice . I can not express how brave he seemed to me . The last time I saw him , he was leaving the house to take the journey for his health which led suddenly to the next world . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she who , at the moment when it was said that he died , staggered and groaned , though so far from him , telling us that something seemed to be sapping all her strength ; I could hardly bear to let my eyes rest upon her shrunken , suffering form on this day of farewell . My father certainly knew , what she vaguely felt , that he would never return . Like a snow image of an unbending but an old , old man , he stood for a moment gazing at me . My mother sobbed , as she walked beside him to the carriage . We have missed him in the sunshine , in the storm , in the twilight , ever since .
