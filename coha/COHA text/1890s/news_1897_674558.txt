txt President Ratchford to-day summed up the strike situation as follows : " The manner in which . the miners are conducting themselves commends itself to the country and gives their officers renewed encouragement , am ; strengthens the belief that victory ultimate- , ly will crown their efforts . " Reports from some of the cities to the effect that the coal supply is not short are only intended to discourage the miners . If the coal supply is not short why are prices advancing ? Why is coal worth a dollar a ton and even a dollar and a half more than it was two weeks ago ? Why are the railroads confiscating coal shipments ? Why are the shops and factories whose wheels are put in motion by the labor of the miner ceasing to operate ? Why are operators all over the States offering their miners a rate even higher than the one demanded if they will only continue at work ? The reason is patent to all  --  coal is scarce . " We have started into this movement realizing fully the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and after two weeks of suspension , involving more than 150,000 miners , we are well satisfied with the results . " Only those who are best acquainted with the condition of the miners have any idea of the extent of this suspension and its paralyzing effects upon the labor and business of the country . It has not yet reached its full proportions . " The coming week will add 20,000 men tO the idle column . The week following will bring greater accessions to our ranks . The movement will continue to grow , not only from the point of the number involved , but public opinion will become crystallized more fully , and through the press of the country will demand a solution of this great difficulty .
