GEORGE WASHINGTON was cast for his career by a very scant and homely training . Augustine Washington , his father , lacked neither the will nor the means to set him handsomely afoot , with as good a schooling , both in books and in affairs , as was to be had ; he would have done all that a liberal and provident man should do to advance his boy in the world had lie lived to go with him through his youth . He owned land in four counties , more than five thousand acres all told , and lying upon both the rivers that refresh the fruitful Northern Neck , besides several plots of ground in the promising village of Fredericksburg , which lay opposite his lands upon the iRappahannock ; and one-twelfth part of the stock of the Principio Iron Company , whose miiies and furnaces in Maryland and Virginia yielded a better profit than any others in the two colonies . He had commanded a ship in his time , as so many of his neighbors had in that maritime province , carrying iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convict Y*L . XcII. - No. 550-61 laborers back upon his voyage home again . He himself raised the ore from the mines that lay upon his own land , close to the Potomac , and had it carried the easy six miles to the river . Matters were very well managed there , Colonel Byrd said , and no pains were spared to make the business profitable . Captain Washington had represented Isis home parish of Truro , too , in the House of Burgesses , where his athletic figure , his ruddy skin , and frank gray eyes must have made him as conspicuous as his constituents could have wished . He was a man of the world , every inch , generous , hardy , independent . He lived long enough , too , to see how stalwart and capable and of how noble a spirit his young son was to be , with how manly a bearing he was to carry himself in the world ; and had loved him and made him his companion accordingly . But the end came for him before lie could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1743 , when he was but forty-nine years of age , and before George was twelve ; and in his will Colonel WM*hington // there was , of course , for George oniy a younger son 's portion . The active gentleman had been twice married , and there were seven children to be provided for . Two sons of the first marriage survived . The bulk of the estate went , as Virginian custom dictated , to Lawrence , the eldest son . To Augustine , the second son , fell most of the rich lands in Westmoreland . George , the eldest born of the second marriage , left to the gnardianship of his young mother , shared with the four younger children the residue of the estate . He was to inherit his father 's farm upon the Rappahannock , to possess , and to cultivate if he would , when lie should come of age ; but for the rest his fortunes were to make . He must get such serviceable training as he could for a life of indel ) erldent endeavor . The two older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preparation for life , as their father before them had been to get hisLawrence to make ready to take his father 's place when the time should come ; Augustine , it was at first planned , to fit himself for the law . George could now look for nothing of the kind . He must continue , as lie had begun , to get such elementary and practical instruction as was to be had of schoolmasters in Virginia , and the young mother 's care must stand him in the stead of a father 's pilotage and oversight . Fortunately Mary Washington was a wise and provident mother , a woman of too firm a character and too steadfast a courage to be dismayed by responsibility . She had seemed only a fair and beautiful girl when Augustine Washington married her , and there was a romantic story told of how that gallant Virginian sailor and gentleman had literally been thrown at her feet out of a carriage in the London streets by way of introduction ,  - -  where she , too , was a visiting stranger out of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the romantic days of courtship were over . Lawrence Washington , too , though but five-andtwenty when his father died and left him head of the family , proved himself such an elder brother as it could but better and elevate a boy to have . For all he was so young , he had seen something of the world , and had already made notable friends . He had not returned home out of England until he was turned of twenty-one , and he had been back scarcely a twelvemonthi before he was off again , to seek service in the war against Spain . The colonies had responded with an unwonted willingness and spirit to the home g*wernment 's call for troops to go against the Spaniard in the West Indies in 1740 ; and Lawrence Washington had sought and obtained a commission as captain in the Virginian regiment which had volunteered for the duty . He had seen those terrible days at Cartagena , with Vernon 's fleet and Wentworth 's army , when the deadly heat and blighting damps of the tropics wrought a work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish cannon could . He had been one of that devoted force which threw itself twelve hundred strong upon Fort San Lazaro , and came away beaten with six hundred only . He had seen the raw provincials out of the colonies carry themselves as gallantly as any veterans through all the fiery trial ; had seen the storm and the valor , the vacillation and the blundering , and the shame of all the rash affair ; and had come away the friend and admirer of the gallant Vernon , despite his headstrong folly and sad miscarriage . He had reached home again , late in the year 1742 , only to see his fathier presently snatched away by a sudden illness , and to find himself become head of thie family in his stead . All thought of further service away from home was dismissed . He accepted a commission as Major in the colonial militia , and an appointment as Adjutant-General of the military district in which his lands lay ; but lie meant that for the future his duties should be civil rather than military in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quietly to the business and the social duty of a proprietor amongst his neighbors in Fairfax County , upon the broad estates to which he gave the name Mount Vernon , in compliment to the brave sailor whose friend he had become in the far , unhappy South . Marriage was , of course , his first step towards domestication , and the woman he chose brought him into new connections which suited both his tastes and his training . Three months after his father 's death he married Anne Fairfax , daughter to William Fairfax , his neighbor . T was . William Fairfax 's granduncle Thomas , third Lord Fairfax , who had in that revolutionary year 1646 summoned Colonel Henry Washington to give into his hands // the city of Worcester , and who had got so sharp an answer from the King 's stout soldier . But the Fairfaxes had soon enough turned royalists again when they saw whither the Parliament men would carry them .

Her father had served the Kind , , as her lover had-with more hardship than reward , as behooved a soldierin Spain and in the Bahamas ; and was now , when turned of fifty , agent here in Virginia to his cousin Tlionzias , sixth Baron Fairfax , in the management of his great estates , lying upon the Northern Neck and in the fruitful valleys beyond .

In 1746 Thomas , Lord Fairfax , himself came to Virginia- a man strayed out of the world of fashion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better part of his ancestral estates in Yorkshire had been sold to satisfy the creditors of his spendthrift father . These untilled stretches of land in the Old Dominion were now become the chief part of his patrimony . T was said , too , that he had suffered a cruel misadventure in love at the hands of a fair jilt in London , and so had become the austere , eccentric bachelor he showed himself to be in the free and quiet colony . A man of taste and culture , he had written with Addison and Steele for the Spectator ; a man of the world , he had acquired , for all his reserve , that easy touch and intimate mastery in dealing with men which come with the long practice of such men of fashion as are also men of sense . He brought with him to Virginia , though past fifty , the fresh vigor of a young man , eager for the free pioneer life of such a province . He tarried but two years with his cousin , where the colony had settled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roomy lodge , shadowed by spreading piazzas , and fitted with such simple appointments as sufficed for comfort at the depths of the forest , close upon seventy miles away , within the valley of the Shenandoah , where a hardy frontier people had but begun to gather . The great manor-house he had meant to build was never begun . The plain comforts of " Greenway Court " satisfied him more and more easily as the years passed , and the habits of a simple life grew increasingly pleasant and familiar , till thirty years and more had slipped away and lie was dead , at ninetyone-broken - hearted , men said , because the King 's government had fallen upon final defeat and was done with in America . It was in the company of these men , and of those who naturally gathered about them in that hospitable country , that Geor*e Washington was bred . " A stranger had no more to do , " says Beverhey , " but to inquire upon the road where any gentleman or good housekeeper lived , and there he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t was cer tam many besides strangers would seek out the young Major at Mount Vernon , whom his neighbors had hastened to make their representative in the House of*d3urgesses , and the old soldier of the soldierly house of Fairfax . who was President of the King 's Counci , and so next to the Governor himself . A boy who was much at Mount Vernon and at Mr. Fairfax 's seat . Belvoir , might expect to see not a little that was worth seeing of the life of the colony . George was kept at school until lie was close upon sixteen ; but there was ample vacation time for visiting . Mrs. Washington did not keep him at her apron strings . He even lived , when it was necessary , with his brother Augustine , at the old home on Bridges Creek , in order to be near the best school that was accessible , while the mother was far away on the farm that lay upon the Rappahian nock . Mrs. Washington saw to it , nevertheless , that she should not lose sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should be sent to sea , as so many lads were , no doubt , from that maritime province ; but the prudent mother preferred he should not leave Virginia , and the schooling went on as before  --  the schooling of books and manly sports . Every lad learned to ride  --  to ride colt or horse , regardless of training , gait , or temper-in that country , where no one went afoot except to catch his mount in the pasture . Every lad , black or white , bond or free , knew where to find and how to take the roving game in the forests . And young Washington , robust boy tl.iat lie was , not to be daunted while that strong spirit sat in him which lie got from his father and mother alike , took his apprenticeship on horseback and in the tangled woods with characteristic zest and ardor . He was , above all things else , a capable executive boy . He loved mastery , and lie relished acquiring the most effective means of mastery in all practical affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They were filled , not only with the rules , forrnul* , diagrams , and exercises of surveying , which lie was taking special pains to learn , at the advice of his friends , but also with careful copies of legal and mercantile papers , bills of exchange , bills of sale , bonds , indentures , land warrants , leases , deeds , and wills , as if lie nieant to be a lawyer 's or a merchant 's clerk . It would seem // that , passionate and full of warm blood as he was , be conned these things as be studied tbe use and structure of his fowling-piece , the bridle he used for his colts , his saddle - girth , and the best ways of mounting . He copied these forms of business as he might have copied Beverley 's account of the way fox or possum or beaver was to be taken or the wild turkey trapped . The men lie most admired , his elder brothers , Mr. Fairfax , and the gentlemen planters who were so much at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who valued good surveying as much as they admired good horsemanship and skill in sport . They were their own merchants , and looked upon forms of business paper as quite as useful as ploughs and hogsheads . Careful exercise in such matters might well enough accompany practice in the equally formal minuet in Virginia . And so this boy learned to show in almost everything he did the careful precision of the perfect marksman . In the autumn of 1747 , when he was not yet quite sixteen , George quit his formal schooling , and presently joined his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon to seek counsel and companionship . Lawrence had conceived a strong affection for his manly younger brother . Himself a man of spirit and honor , he had a highhearted man 's liking for all that lie saw that was indomitable and well purposed in the lad , a generous man 's tenderness in looking to the development of this thoroughbred boy , and lie took him into his confidence as if he had been his own son . Not only upon his vacations now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie were already himself a man with the rest , he could live in the comradeship that obtained at Belvoir and Mount Vernon . Men of all sorts , it seemed , took pleasure in his company . Lads could be the companions of men in Virginia . Her outdoor life of journeyings , sport , adventure , put them as it were upon equal terms with their elders , where spirit , audacity , invention , prudence , man I mess , resource , told for success and comradeship . Young MOUNT VERNON AT THE PRE5ENT DAY . // men and old can be companions in arms , in sport , in woodcraft , and on the trail of the fox . T was not an in-door life of con ference , but an out-door life of affairs in this rural colony . One man , indeed , gave at least a touch of another quality to the life Washiiigtoii saw . This was Lord Fairfax , who had been almost two years in Virginia when the boy quit school , and who was now determined , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest lodge within the Blue Ridge . George greatly struck his lordship 's fancy , as he did that of all capable men , as a daring lad in the hunt and a sober lad in counsel ; and drawn into such companionship , he learned a great deal that no one else in Virginia could have taught him so well  --  the scrupulous deportment of a high-bred and honorable man of the world ; the use of books by those who preferred affairs ; the way in which strength may be rendered gracious , and independence made generous . A touch of Old World address was to be learned at Belvoir . His association with Lord Fairfax , moreover , put him in the way of making his first earnings as a surveyor . Fairfax had not come to America merely to get away from the world of fashion in London and bury himself in the wilderness . His chief motive was one which did him much more credit , and bespoke him a man and a true colonist . It was his purpose , he declared , to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and fertile land he had inherited in Virginia , and he proved his sincerity by immediately setting about the business . It was necessary as a first step that he should have surveys made , in order that he might know how his lands lay , how bounded and disposed through the glades and upon the streams of the untrodden forests ; and in young Washington he had a surveyor ready to his hand . The lad was but sixteei* , indeed : was largely selftaught in surveying ; and had had no business yet that made test of his quality . But surveyors were scarce , and boys were not tender at sixteen in that robust , out-of-door colony . Fairfax had an eye for capacity . He knew the athletic boy to be a fearless woodsman , with that odd calm judgment looking forth at his steady gray eyes ; perceived how seriously he took himself in all that lie did , and how thorough he was at succeeding ; and had no doubt he could run his lines through the thicketed forests as well as any mami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task , and was not disappointed in the way he performed it . Within a *zery few weeks Washington conclusively showed his capacity . In March , 1748 , with George Fairfax , William Faii ' - fax 's son , for company , he rode forth with his little band of assistants through the mountains to the wild country where his work lay , and within the month almost he was back again , with maps and figures which showed his lordship very clearly what lands he had upon the sparkling Shenandoah and the swollen upper waters of the Potomac . T was all he wanted before making his home where his estate lay in the wilderness . Before the year was out lie had established himself at Greenway Court ; huntsmen and tenants and guests had found their way thither , and life was fairly begun upon the rough rural barony . It had been wild and even perilous work for the young surveyor , but just out of school , to go in the wet springtime into that wilderness , when the rivers were swollen and ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where there was scarcely a lodging to be had except in the stray comfortless cabins of the scattered settlers , or on the ground about a fire in the open woods . and where a woodman 's wits were needed to come even tolerably off . But there was a strong relish in such an experience for Washington , which did not wear off with the novelty of it . There is an unmistakable note of boyish satisfaction in the tone in which he speaks of it . " Since you received my letter in October last , " he writes to a young comrade , " I have not sleep 'd above three nights or four in a bed , but , after walking a good deal all the day , I lay down before the fire upon a little hay , straw , fodder , or bear-skin , whichever is to be had , with man , wife , and children , like a parcel of dogs and cats ; and happy is lie who gets the berth nearest the fire .... I have never had my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few nights I have lay'ni in Frederick Town . " For three years lie kept steadily at the trying business , without loss either of health or courage , now deep in the forests laboriously laying off the rich bottom lands and swelling hillsides of that wild but goodly country between // the mountains , now at Greenway Court with his lordship , intent upon the busy life there ,  --  following the hounds , consorting with huntsmen and Indians and traders , waiting upon the ladies who now and again visited the lodge ; when other occupations failed , reading up and down in his lordship 's copy of the Spectator , or in the historians who told the great English story . His first success in surveying brought him abundant employment in the valley . Settlers were steadily making their way thither , who must needs have their holdings clearly hounded and defined . Upon his lordship 's recornmendation and his own showing of what he knew and could do , he obtained appointment at the hands of the President and Master of William and Mary , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyor for Culpeper County , " took the usual oaths to his Majesty 's person and government , " and so got for his work the privilege of authoritative public record . Competent surveyors were much in demand , and , when once he had been otlicially accredited in his profession , Washington had as much to do both upon new lands and old as even a young man s energy and liking fur an independent income could reasonably demand . His home he made with his brother at Mount Vernon , where he was always so welcome ; and he was as often as possible with his mother at her place upon the Rappahannock , to lend the efficient lady such assistance as she needed in the business of the estate she held for herself and her children . At odd intervals he studied tactics , practised the manual of arms or took a turn at the broadsword with the old soldiers who so easily found excuses for visiting Major Washington at Mount Vernon . But , except when winter weather forbade him the fields , he was abroad far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making trial of his neighbors up and down all the country-side round about , as his errands threw their open doors in his way . His pleasant bearing and his quiet satisfaction at being busy , his manly efficient ways , his evident self-respect , and his frank enjoyment of life , the engaging mixture in him of man and boy , must have become THE POTOMAC FROM MOUNT VERNON . // familiar to everybody worth krtowing throughout all the Northern Neck . But three years put a term to his surveying . In 1751 he was called imperatively off , and had the whole course of his life changed , by the illness of his brother . Lawrence Washington had never been robust ; those long months spent at the heart of the fiery South with Vernon s fever-stricken fleet had touched his sensitive constitution to the quick , and at last a fatal consumption fastened upon him . Neither a trip to England nor the waters of the warm springs at home brought him recuperation , and in the autumn of 1751 his physician ordered him to the Bahamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trusted , went with him , to nurse and cheer him . But even the gentle sea air of the islands wrought no cure of the stubborn malady . The ster* ling , gifted , lovable gentleman , who had LAWRENCE WASHINGTON . From a portrait , by an anknown artist , to use possession of Loesrooce Washington , Atoxandrto* Virginia . // made his quiet seat at Mount Vernon the home of so much that was honorable and of good report , came back the next summer to die in his prime , at thirty-four . George found himself named executor in his brother 's will , and looked to of a sudden to guard all the interests of the young widow and her little daughter in the management of a large estate . That trip to the Bahamas had been his last outing as a boy . He had enjoyed the novel journey with a very keen and natural relish while it promised his brother health . The radiant air of those summer isles had touched him with a new pleasure , and the cordial hospitality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had braved the small - pox in one household with true Virginian punctilio rather than refuse an iiivitation to dinner , had taken the infection , and had come home at last bearing some permanent marks of a three weeks ' sharp illness upon him . But lie had had entertainment enough to strike the balance handsomely against such inconveniences , had borne whatever came in his way very cheerily , with that wholesome strength of mind which made older men like him , and would have come off remembering nothing but the pleasure of the trip had his noble brother only found his health again . As it was , Lawrence 's death put a final term to his youth . Five other executors were named in the will ; but George , as it turned out , was to be looked to to carry the burden of administration , and give full proof of the qualities that had made his brother trust him with so generous a confidence . His brother 's death , in truth , changed everything for him . He seemed of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for the Bahamas Lawrence had transferred to him his place in the militia , obtaining for him , though he was but nineteen , a commission as Major and District Adjutant in his stead ; and after his return , in 1752 , Lieutenant-Governor Dinwiddie , the crown 's new representative in Virginia , added still further to his responsibilities as a soldier by reducing the military districts of the colony to four , and assigning to him one of the four , under a renewed commission as Major and Adjutant-General . His brother 's will not only named him an executor , but also made him residuary legatee of the estate of Mount VOL. xcJL. - No. 550-62 Vernon in case his child should die . He had to look to the discipline and accoutrement of the militia of eleven counties , aid his mother in her business , administer hi* brother 's estate , and assume on all hands the duties and responsibilities of a man of affairs when he was but just turned of twenty . The action of the colonial government in compacting the organization and discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was significant of a sinister change in the posture of affairs beyond the borders . The movements of the French in the West had of late become more ominous than ever ; t was possible the Virginian militia mlght any day see an end of that " everlasting peace " which good Mr. Beverley had smiled to see them complacently enjoy , and that the young Major , who was now Adjutant-General of the northern division , might find duties abroad even more serious and responsible than his duties at home . Whoever should be commissioned to meet and deal with the French upon the western rivers would have to handle truly critical affairs , decisive of the fate of the continent , and it looked as if Virginia must undertake the fateful business . The northern borders , indeed , were sadly harried by the savage allies of the French ; the brunt of the fighting hitherto had fallen upon the hardy militiamen of Massachusetts and Connecticut , in the slow contest for English mastery upon the continent . But there was really nothing to be decided in that quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of driving out the thickly set English population , already established , hundreds of thousands strong , upon the eastern coasts . Their true lines of conquest ran within . Their strength lay in their command of the great watercourses which flanked the English colonies both north and west . T was a long frontier to hold , that mazy line *f lake and river that ran all the way from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the wide mouths of the sluggish Mississippi . Throughout all the posts and settlements that lay upon it from end to end there were scarcely eighty thousand Frenchmen , while the English teemed upon the coasts more than a million strong . But the forces of New France could be handled like an army , while the English swarmed slowly westward without discipline or direction , the headstrong // subjects of a distant government they would not obey , the wayward constituents of a score of petty and jealous assemblies , tardy at planning , clumsy at executing plans . They were still far away , too , from th' mid-waters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where lonely boats floated slowly down , with their cargoes of grain , meat , tallow , tobacco , oil , hides , and lead , out of the country of the Illinois , past the long thin Line of tiny isolated posts , to the growing village at New Orleans and the southern Gulf . But they were to be feared , none the less . If their tide once flowed in , the French well knew it could not be turned back again . It was not far away from the Ohio now ; and if once settlers out of Pennsylvania and Virginia gained a foothold in any numbers on that river , they would control one of the great highways that led to the main basins of the continent . It was imperative they should be effectually forestalled , and that at once . The Marquis Duquesne , with his quick soldier blood , at last took the decisive step for France . He had hardly come to his colony , to serve his royal master as Governor upon the St. Lawrence , when he determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western passes against the English with a line of military posts . The matter did not seem urgent to the doubting ministers at Versailles . " Be on your guard against new undertakings , " said official letters out of France ; " private interests are generally at the bottom of them . " But Duquesne knew that it was no mere private interest of fur-trader or speculator that was at stake now . The rivalry between the two nations had gone too far to make it possible to draw back . Military posts had already been established by the bold energy of the French at Niagara , the key to the western lakes , and at Crown Point upon Obamplain , where lake and river struck straight towards the heart of the English trading settlements upon the Hudson . The English , accepting the challenge , had planted themselves at Oswego , upon the very lake route itself , and had made a port there to take the furs that came out of the West , arid though very sluggish in the business , showed purpose of aggressive movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pressing towards the western mountains in Pennsylvania , and down into that " Virginian Arcady , " the sweet valley of the Shenandoah ; thrifty Germans , a few ; hardy Scots-Irish , a great many ,  --  the blood most Pr be feared and checked . It was said that quite three hundred English traders passed the mountains every year into the region of the Ohio . Enterprising gentlemen in Virginia-Lawrence and Augustine Washington among the rest- had joined influential partners in London in the formation of an Ohio Company for the settlement of the western country and the absorption of the western trade ; had sent out men who knew the region to make interest with the Indians and fix upon points of vantage for tradingposts and settlements ; had already set out upon its business by erecting storehouses at Will 's Creek , in the heart of the Alleghanies , and , further westward still , upon Redstone Creek , a branch of the Monongahela itself . It was high time to act ; and Duquesne , having no colonial assembly to hamper him , acted very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred men into Lake Erie , to Presque Isle , where a fort of squared logs was built , and a road cut through the forests to a little river whose waters , when at the flood , would carry boats direct to the Alleghany and the great waterway of the Ohio itself . An English lieutenant at Oswego had descried the multitudinous fleet of canoes upon Ontario carrying this levy to its place of landing in the lake beyond , and a vagrant Frenchman had told him plainly what it was . It was an army of six thousand men , he boasted , going to the Ohio , " to cause all the English to quit those parts . " It was plain to every English Governor in the colonies who had his eyes open that the French would not stop with planting a fort upon an obscure branch of the Alleghany , but that they would indeed press forward to take possession of the Ohio , drive every English trader forth , draw all the native tribes to their interest by force or favor , and close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest against all the King 's subjects . Governor Dinwiddie was among the first to ' see the danger and the need for action , as , in truth , was very natural . In office and out , his study had been the colonial trade , and he had been merchant and official now a long time . He was // one of the twenty stockholders of the Ohio Company , and had come to his governorship in Virginia with his eye upon the western country . He had but to look about him to perceive that Virginia would very likely be obliged to meet the crisis unaided , if , indeed , he could induce even her to meet it . Governor Hamilton of Pennsylvania also saw how critically affairs stood , it is true , and what ought to be done . His agents had met and acted with the agents of the Ohio Company already in seeking Indian alliances and fixing upon points of vantage beyond the Alleghanies . But the Pennsylvania Assembly could by no argument or device FRENCH AND ENGLISH IN NORTH AMERICA 1755 SCALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote money or measures in the business . The placid Quaker traders were as stubborn as the stolid German farmers . They opposed warlike action on principle . The Germans opposed it because they could not for the life of them see the necessity of parting with their money to send troops upon so remote an errand . Dinwiddie did not wait or parley . He acted first , and consulted his Legislature afterwards . In was in his Scots blood to take the business very strenuously , and in his trader 's blood to take it very anxiously . He had kept himself advised from the first of the movements of the French . Their vanguard had scarcely reached Presque Isle ere lie despatched letters to England apprising the government of the danger . Answer had come very promptly , too , authorizing him to build forts upon the Ohio , if he could get the money from the Burgesses ; and meantime , should the French trespass further , " to require of them peaceably to depart . " If they would not desist for a warning , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command you to drive them off by force of arms. , * Even to send a warning to the French was no easy matter when the King 's letter came , and the chill autumn rains were at hand . The mountain streams , already swollen , presently to be full of ice , would be very dangerous for men and horses , and the forests were likely enough to teem with hostile savages now the French were there . A proper messenger was found and despatched , neverthelessyoung Major George Washington , of the northern district . The errand lay in his quarter ; his three years of surveying at the heart of the wilderness had made him an experienced woodsman and hardy traveller , had tested his pluck and made proof of his character ; he was well known upon the frontier , and his friends were very influential , and very cordial in recommending him for this or any other manly service that called for steadiness , hardihood , and resource . Dinwiddie had been a correspondent of Lawrence Washington 's ever since the presidency of the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neighbor Thomas Lee , writing to him upon terms of intiniacv . He knew the stock of which George , the younger brother , came , and the interests in which he might be expected to embark with ardor ; he could feel that he took small risk in selecting such an agent . Knowing him , too , thus through his family and like a friend , he did not hesitate in writing to Governor Hamilton of Pennsylvania to speak of this youth of twenty-one as " a person of distinction . " Washington performed his errand as Dinwiddie must have expected he would . He received his commission and the Governor 's letter to the French commandant on the last day of October , and set out the same day for the mountains . Jacob Vanbraam , the Dutch soldier of fortune who had been his fencing - master at Mount Vernon , accompanied him as interpreter , and Christopher Gist , the hardy , self-reliant frontier trader , whom the Ohio Company had employed to make interest for them among the Indians of the far region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged to act as his guide and counsellor ; and with a few servants and pack-horses he struck straight into the forests in the middle of bleak November . It was the 11th of December before the jaded party rode , in the cold dusk , into the drenched and miry clearing where the dreary little fort stood that held the French commander . Through two hundred and fifty miles and more of forest they had dragged themselves over swollen rivers , amidst an almost ceaseless fall of *rain or snow , with not always an Indian trail , even , or the beaten track of the bison , to open the forest growth for their flagging horses , and on the watch always against savage treachery . It had become plain enough before they reached their destination what answer they should get from the French . Sixty miles nearer home than these lonely headquarters of the French commander at Fort Le Boeuf they had come upon an outpost where the French colors were to be seen flying from a house from which an English trader had been driven out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowal of their purpose in that wilderness as they sat at wine with the alert and temperate young Virginian . " It was their absolute design , " they said , " to take possession of the Ohio , and , by G- , they would do it ....

As the spring advanced , the French force upon the river grew from five to fourteen hundred men , and work was pushed rapidly forward upon fortifications such as the little band of Englishmen they had ousted had not thought of attempting  --  a veritable fort , albeit of a rude frontier pattern , which its builders called Duquesne , in honor of their Governor .

An " Independent Company " of provincials in the King 's pay joined him out of South Carolina , whence they had been sent forward by express orders from England ; and the rest of the Virginia // volunteers at last came up to join their comrades at the Meadows-without good Colonel Fry , the doughty mathematician , who had sickened and died on the wayso that there were presently more than three hundred men at the camp , and Washington was now their commander-in-chief . The officers of the Independent Company from South Carolina , holding their commissions from the King , would not , indeed , take their orders from Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse , their men would not work ; but there was no doubt they would fight with proper dignity and spirit for his Majesty , their royal master . The first blood had already been drawn , on the 28th of May , before re-enforcements l ) ad arrived , when Washington had but just come to camp . Upon the morning of that day , Washington , with forty men , guided by friendly Indians , had come upon a party of some thirty Frenchmen where they lurked deep with in the thickets of the dripping forest , and with thrust of bayonet when the wet guns failed had brought them to a surrender within fifteen minutes of the first surprise . No one in the Virginian camp doubted that there was war already , or dreamed of awaiting the action of diplomats and cabinets over sea . The French had driven an English garrison from the forks of the Ohio with thi-eats of force , which would certainly have been executed had there been need . These men hidden in the thickets at Great Meadows would have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come as messengers merely to bear a peaceful summons ; but did it need thirty-odd armed men to bear a message ? Why had they lurked for five days so stealthily in the forest ; and why had they sent runners back post-haste to Fort Duquesne to obtain support for their diplomacy ? Washington might regret that young M. Jumonville , their commander , had lost his life in the encountei ' , but he had no doubt he had done right to order his men to fire when he saw the French spring for their arms at the first surprise . Now , at any rate , war was unquestionably begun . That sudden volley fired in the wet woods at the heart of ' the lonely Alleghanies had set the final struggle ablaze . It was now either French or English in America : it could no longer be both . Jumonville with his thirty Frenchmen was followed ere many weeks were out by Coulon de Villiers with seven hundred-some of them come all the way from Montreal at news of what had happened to Frahces lui-king ambassadors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July they closed to an encounter at " Fort Necessity , " Washington 's rude intrenchments upon the Great Meadows . There were three hundred and fifty Englishmen with him able to fight , spite of sickness and short ratiol ) s and as . the enemy began to show themselves at the edges of the neighboring woods through the damp mists of that dreary morning , Washington drew his little force up outside their works upon the open meadow . He " thought the French would come up to him in open field , " laughed a wily Indian , who gave him counsel freely , but no aid in the fight ; but Villiers had no mind to meet the gallant young Virginian in that manly fashion . Once , indeed , they rushed to his trenches , but finding hot reception there , kept their distance afterwards . Vilhers brought them after that only " as near as possible without uselessly exposing the lives of the King 's subjects , " and poured his fire in from the cover of the woods . For nine hours the unequal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing themselves outside the shelter of the forest , the English crouching knee - deep in water in their rude trenches , while the rain poured incessantly , reducing their breastworks to a mass of slimy mud , and filling all the air with a chill and pallid mist . Day insensibly darkened into night in such an air , and it was eight o'clock when the firing ceased and the French asked a parley . Their men were tired of the dreary fight , their Indian allies threatened to leave them when morning should come , and they were willing the English should withdraw , if they would , without further hurt or molestation . The terms they offered seemed very acceptable to Washington 's officers as the interpreter read them out , standing there in the drenching downpour and the black night . " It rained so hard we could hardly keep the candle lighted to read them by , " said an officer ; but there was really no choice what to do . More than fifty men lay dead or wounded in the flooded camp ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly been touched in the fight , and // might at any moment be increased . Capitulation was inevitable , and Washington did not hesitate . The next morning saw his wretched force making their way back again along the rude road they had cut through the forests . They had neither horses nor wagons to carry their baggage . What they could they burned ; and then set out , sore stricken in heart and body , their wounded comrades and their scant store of food slung upon their backs , and dragged themselves very wearily , all the fifty miles to the settlements at home . Two of the King 's Independent Companies from New York ought to have joined them long ago , but had gotten no further than Alexandria when the fatal day came at the Great Meadows . North Carolina had despatched three hundred and fifty of her militiamen under an experienced officer to aid them , but they also came too late . It had been expected that Maryland would raise two hundred and fifty men , and Pennsylvania had at last voted money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy no men ; but no succor had come from any quarter when it should . The English were driven in , and all their plans were worse than undone . It was a bitter trial for the young Virginian commander to have his first campaign end so disastrously  --  to be worsted in a petty fight , and driven back hopelessly outdone . No one he cared for in Virginia blamed him . His ragged troops had borne themselves like men in the fight ; his own gallantry no man could doubt . The House of Burgesses thanked him and voted money to his men . But it had been a rough apprenticeship , and Washington felt to the quick the lessons it had taught him . The discouraging work of recruiting at Alexandria , the ragged idlers to be governed there , the fruitless drilling of listless and insolent men , the two months ' work with axe and spade cutting a way through the forests , the whole disheartening work of making ready for the fight , of seeking the enemy , and of choosing a field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can while his digestion holds good . He had at least himself done everything that was possible , and it had been no small relief to him to write plain-spoken letters to the men who were supposed to be helping him in Williamsburg , telling them exactly how things were going and who was to blame-letters which showed both how*efficient and how proud he was . He had even showed a sort of boyish zest in the affair when it came to actual fighting with Jumonville and his scouts hidden in the forest . He had pressed to the thick of that hot and sudden skirmish , and had taken the French volleys with a lad 's relish of the danger . " I heard the bullets whistle , " he wrote his br*ther , " and believe me there is something charming in the sound . " But after he had stood a day in the flooded trenches of his wretched " fort " at Great Meadows , and fought till evening from the open with an enemy he could not see , he knew that he had been taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible business of fighting ; and that something more must be learned than could be read in the books at Mount Vernon . He kept a cheerful front in the dreary retreat , heartening his men bravely by word and example of steadfastness ; but it was a sore blow to his pride and his hopes , and he must only have winced without protest could he have heard how Horace Walpole called him a " brave braggart " for his rodomontade about the music of deadly missiles . He had no thought , however , of quitting his duty because his first campaign had miscarried . When he had made his report at Williamsburg he rejoined his demoralized 1-egi ment at Alexandria , where it lay but an hour 's ride from Mount Vernon , and set about executing his orders to recruit once more as if the business were only just begun . Captain Innes , who had brought three hundred and fifty men from North Carolina too late to be of assistance at the Meadows , and who had had the chagrin of seeing them take themselves off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them what had been promised , remained at Will 's Creek , amid the back settlements , to command the King 's provincials from South Carolina who had been with Washington at the Meadows , and the two Independent Companies from New York who had lingered so long on the way , in the building of a rough fortification , to be named Fort Cumberland , in honor of the far-away Duke who was commander-in - chief in England . Dinwiddie , having such hot Scots blood in him as could brook no delays , and haying // been bred no soldier or frontiersman , but a merchant and man of business , would have had Washington 's recruiting despatched at once , like a bill of goods , and a new force sent hot-foot to the Ohio again to catch the French while they weie at ease over their victory and slackly upon their guard at Duquesne . When he was flatly told it was impossible , he turned to other plans , equally ill - considered , though no doubt equally well meant . By October he had obtained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home ten thousand more in good specie , such as was scarce in the colony ,  --  for the sharp stir of actual fighting had had its effect alike upon King and Burgesses  --  and had ordered the formation and equipment of ten full companies for the frontier . But VOL. xcIL. - No. 550-63 the new orders contained a sad civilian blunder . The ten companies should all be Independent Companies ; there should be no officer higher than a captain amongst them . This , the good Scotsman thought , would accommodate all disputes about rank and precedence , such as l ) ad come near to making trouble between Washington and Captain Mackay , of the Independent Company from South Carolina , while they waited for the French at Great Meadows . Washington at once resigned , indignant to be so dealt with . Not only would he be reduced to a captaincy undei* such an arrangement , but every petty officer would outrank him who could show the King 's commission . It was no tradition of his class to submit to degradation of rank thus by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his pride and sense of personal dignity , for all he was so young , were as high - strung as any man 's in Virginia . He had shown his quality in such matters already six months ago , while he lay in camp in the wilderness on his way toward the Ohio . The Burgesses had appointed a committee of their own to spend the money they had voted to put his expedition afoot in the spring , lest Dinwiddie should think , were they to give him the spending of it , that they had relented in the matter of the fees ; and these gentlemen , in their careful parsimony , had cut the officers of the already straitened little force down to such pay and food as Washington deemed unworthy a gentleman 's acceptance . He would not resign his commission there at the head of his men upon the march , but he asked to be considered a volunteer without pay , that he might be quit of the humiliation of being stirited like a beggar . Now that it was autumn , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach , and he did so very promptly , in spite of protests and earnest solicitations from many quarters . " I am concerned to find Colonel Washington 's conduct so imprudent , " wrote Thomas Penn . But the high - spirited young officer deemed it no imprudence to insist upon a just consideration of his rank and services , and quietly withdrew to Mount Vernon , to go thence to his mother at the " ferry farm " upon the Rappahannock , and see again all the fields and friends he loved so well . It was a very brief respite . He had been scarcely five months out of harness when he found himself again in camp , his plans and hopes once more turned towards the far wilderness where the French lay . He had set a great war ablaze that day he led his forty men into the thicket and bade them fire upon M. Jumonville and his scouts lurking there ; and he could not , loving the deep business as he did , keep himself aloof from it when he saw how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair , but French and English statesmen alike - even Newcastle , England 's Prime Minister , as busy about nothing as an old woman , and as thoroughly ignorant of affairs as a young man - knew that something must be done , politics hanging at so doubtful a balance between them , now that Frederick of Prussia had driven France . Austria , and Russia into league against him . The French minister in London and the British minister in Paris vowed their governments still loved arid trusted one another , and there was no declaration of war . But in the spring of 1755 eighteen French ships of war put to sea from Brest and Rocliefort , carrying six battalions and a new Governor to Canada , and as many ships got away under press of sail from English ports to intercept and destroy them . Transports carrying two English regiments had sailed for Virginia in January , and by the 20th of February had reached the Chesapeake . The French ships got safely in at the St. Lawrence despite pursuit , losing but two of their fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English befogged and bewildered off the coast . The colonies were to see fighting on a new scale . The English ministers , with whom just then all things went either by favor or by accident , had made a sorry blunder in the choice of a commander . Major-General Edward Braddock , whom they had commissioned to take the two regiments out and act as commander-in-chief in America , was a brave man , a veteran soldier , bred in a thorough school of action , a man quick with energy and indomitable in resolution , but every quality he had unfitted him to learn . Self- confident , brutal , headstrong , " a very Iroquois in disposition , " he would take neither check nor suggestion . But energy , resolution , good soldiers , and a proper equipment might of themselves suffice to do much in the crisis that had come , whether wisdom held the reins or not ; and it gave the Old Dominion a thrill of quickened hope and purpose to see Keppel 's transports in the Potomac and Braddock 's redcoats ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way slowly up the river , passed beneath the very windows of Mount Vernon , to put the troops ash ore only eight miles beyond . Washington had left off being soldier for Din widdie , but he had resigned only to avoid an intolerable indignity , not to shun service and he made no pretence of indifference when he saw the redcoats come to camp at Alexandria . Again and again was he early in the saddle to see the stir and order of the troops , make the acquaintance of the officers , and learn , if he might , what it was that fitted his Majesty 's regulars for their stern business . TIme // self-confident gentlemen who wore his Majesty 's uniform and carried his Majesty 's commissions in their pockets had scant regard , most of them , for the raw folk of the colony , who had never been in London or seen the set array of battle . They were not a little impatient that they must recruit among such a people . The transports had brought but a thousand men-two half-regiments of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h undred men apiece to their force in the colony . Six companies of " rangers , " too , the colonists were to furnish , and one company of light horse , besides carpenters and teamsters . By all these General Braddock 's officers set small store , deeming it likely they must depend , not upon the provincials , but upon themselves for success . They were at small pains to conceal their hearty contempt for the people they had come to help . But with Washington it was a different matter . There was that in his proud eyes and gentleman 's bearing that marked him a man to be made friends with and respected . A good comrade he proved , without pretence or bravado , but an ill man to scorn , as lie went his way among them , lithe and alert , full six feet in his boots , with that strong gait as of a backwoodsman , and that haughty carriage as of a man born to have his will . He won their liking , and even their admiration , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing he desired to make the campaign if he might do so without sacrifice of self - respect , promptly invited him to go as a member of his staff , where there could be no question of rank , asking him , besides , to name any young gentlemen of his acquaintance he chose for several vacant ensigucies in the two regiments . The letter of invitation , written by Captain Orme , aide-decamp , was couched in terms of unaffected cordiality . Washington very gladly accepted , in a letter that had just a touch of the young provincial in it , so elaborate and over-long was its explanation of its writer 's delicate position and self-respecting motives , but with so much more of the proud gentleman and resolute man that the smile with which Captain Orme must have read it could have nothing of disrelish in it . The young aide-de-carrip and all the other members of the General 's military " family " found its author , at any rate , a man after their own hearts when it came to terms of intimacy amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together at Alexan*dria , in obedience to his call for an immediate conference-William Shirley . of Massachusetts , the stout - hearted old lawyer , every inch " a gentleman and politician , " who had of a sudden turned soldier to face the French , for all he was past sixty ; James De Lancey , of New York , astute man of the people ; the brave and energetic Horatio Sharpe , of Maryland ; Robert Hunter Morris , fresh from the latest wrangles with the headstrong Quakers and Germans of Pennsylvania ; and Robert Din widdie , the busy merchantGovernor of the Old Dominion , whose urgent letters to the government at home had brought Braddock and his regiments to the Potomac . Plans were promptly agreed upon . New York and New England , seeing war come on apace , were astir no less than Virginia , and in active correspondence with the ministers in London . Two regiments had already been raised and taken into the King 's pay ; the militia of all the threatened colonies were afoot ; in all quarters action was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should strike at once at Niagara with the King 's new provincial regiments , in the hope to cut the enemy 's connections with their western posts ; Colonel William Johnson , the cool-headed trader and borderer , who had lived and thriven so long in the forests where the dreaded Mohawks had their strength , should lead a levy from New England , New York , and New Jersey to an attack upon Crown Point , where for twenty-four years the French had held Champlain ; and Lieutenant-Colonel Monckton , of the King 's regulars , must take a similar force against Beaus*jour in Acadia , while General Braddock struck straight into the western wilderness to take Duquesne . T were best to be prompt in every part of the hazardous business , and Braddock turned from the conference to push his own expedition forward at once . " After taking Fort Duquesne " he said to Franklin , " I am to proceed to Niagara ; and after having taken that , to Frontenac , if the season will allow time ; and I suppose it will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ; and then I can see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara . " " To be sure , sir ; " // quietly replied the sagacious Franklin , " if you arrive well before Duquesne with these fine troops , so well provided with artillery , the fort .... can probably make but a short resistance . " But there was the trouble . Twoulci have been better , no doubt , had a route through Pennsylvania been chosen , where cultivated farms already stretched well into the West , with their own roads and grain and cattle and wagons to serve an army with ; but the Virginia route had been selected ( by intrigue of gentlemen interested in the Ohio Company , it was hinted ) , and must needs be made the best of . There was there , at the least , the rough track Washington 's men had cut to the Great Meadows . This must now be widened and levelled for an army with its cumbrous train of artillery , and its endless procession of wagons laden with baggage and provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the military trappings and supplies of a European army would be to put , it might be , four miles of its rough trail between van and rear of the struggling line , and it would be a clumsy enemy , as fighting went in the woods , who could not cut such a force into pieces " like thread , " as Franklin said . The thing was to be attempted , nevertheless , with stubborn British resolution . It was the 19th of May before all the forces intended for the march were finally collected at Fort Cumberland , twenty-two hundred men in all-fourteen hundred regulars , now the recruits were in ; nearly five hundred Virginians , horse and foot ; two Independent Companies from New York ; and a small force of sailors from the transports to rig tackle for the ordnance when there was need on the rough way . And it was the 10th of June when the advance began , straight into that " realm of forests ancient as the world " that lay without limit upon all the western ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbering train through the tangled wilderness , and it kept the temper of the truculent Braddock very hot to see how it played havoc with every principle and practice of campaigning he had ever heard of . He charged the colonists with an utter want alike of honor and of honesty to have kept him so long awaiting the transportation and supplies they had promised , and to have done so little to end with , and so drew Washington into " frequent dis putes , maintained with warmth on both sides " ; but the difficulties of the march presently wrought a certain forest change upon him , and disposed him to take counsel of his young Virginian aide  --  the only man in all his company who could speak out of knowledge in that wild country . On the 19th , at Wasbingtou 's advice , he took twelve hundred men and pressed forward with a lightened train to a quicker advance , leaving ' Colonel Dunbar to bring up the rest of the troops with the baggage . Even this lightened force halted to level every mole-hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington chafed to see , and " were four days in getting twelve miles " ; but the pace was better than before , and brought them at last almost to their destination . On the 9th of July , at mid-day , they waded the shallow Monongahela , but eight miles from Duquesne , making a brave show as the sun struck upon their serried ranks , their bright uniforms , their fluttering banners , and their glittering arms , and went straight into the rough ' and shadowed forest path that led to the French post . Upon a sudden there came a man bounding along the path to meet them , wearing the gorget of a French officer , and the forest behind him swarmed with a great host of but half-discovered men . Upon signal given , these spread themselves to right and left within the shelter of the forest , and from their covert poured a deadly fire upon Braddock 's advancing lines . With good British pluck the steady regulars formed their accustomed ranks , crying , " God save the King ! " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest ; the ordnance was brought up and swung to its work ; all the force pressed forward to take what place it could in the fight ; but where was the use ? Washington besought General Braddock to scatter his men too , and meet the enemy under cover as they came , but he would not listen . They must stand in ranks , as they were bidden , and take the fire of their hidden foes like men , without breach of discipline . When they would have broken in spite of him , in their panic at being slaughtered there in the open glade without sight of the enemy , Braddock beat them back with his sword , and bitterly cursed them for cowards . He would have kept the Virginians , too , back from the covert if he could , when he saw them seek to close with the attacking // // party in true forest fashion . As it was , they were as often shot down by the terror-stricken regulars behind them as by their right foes in front . They alone made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a place how the battle fared ? No one could count the enemy where they sprang from covert to covert . They were , in fact , near a thousand strong at the first meeting in the way ,  --  more than six hundred Indians , a motley host gathered from far and near at the suminons of the French , sevenscore Canadian rangers , seventy-odd regulars from the fort , and thirty or forty French officers , come out of sheer eagerness to have a hand in the daring game . Contrecceur could not spare more Frenchmen from his little garrison , his connections at the lakes being threatened , and he sorely straitened for men and stores . He was staking everything , as it was , upon this encounter on the way . If the English should shake the savages off , as he deemed they would , he must no doubt withdraw as he could ere the lines of siege were closed about him . He never dreamed of such largess of good fortune as came pouring in upon him . The English were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen business like this . T was a pitiful , shameful slaughter , - men shot like beasts in a pen there where they cowered close in their scarlet ranks . Their first blazing volleys had sent the craven Canadians scampering back the way they had come ; Beaujeu , who led the attack , was killed almost at the first onset , but the gallant youngsters who led the motley array wavered never an- instant , and readily held the Indians to their easy work . Washington did all that furious energy and reckless courage could to keep the order of battle his commander had so madly chosen , to hold the regulars to their blind work and hearten the Virginians to stay the threatened rout , driving his horse everywhere into the thick of the murderous firing , and crying upon all alike to keep to it steadily like men . He had but yesterday rejoined the advance , having for almost two weeks lain stricken with a fever in Dunbar 's camp . He could hardly sit his cushioned saddle for weakness when the fight began ; but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly like that of one possessed , and his immunity from harm like that of one charmed . Thrice a horse was shot under him , many bullets cut his clothing , but he went without a wound . A like mad energy drove Braddock storming up and down the breaking lines ; but he *was mortally stricken at last , and Washington alone remained to exercise such control as was possible when the inevitable rout came . It was impossible to hold the ground in such fashion . The stubborn Braddock himself had ordered a retreat ere the fatal bullet found him . Sixty-three out of the eighty-six officers of his force were killed or disabled ; less than five hundred men out of all the thirteen hundred who had but just now passed so gallantly through the ford remained unhurt : the deadly slaughter must have gone on to utter destruction . Retreat was inevitable-'twas blessed good fortune that it was still possible . When once it began it was headlong , reckless , frenzied . The men ran wildly , blindly , as if hunted by demons whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful cries , maddened by the searching and secret fire of their foes , now coining hot upon their heels . Wounded comrades , military stores , baggage , their very arms , they left upon the ground , abandoned . Far into the night they ran madly on , in frantic search for the camp of the rear division , crying , as they ran , for help ; they even passed the camp in their uncontrollable terror of pursuit , and went desperately on towards the settlenients . Washington and the few officers and provincials who scorned the terror found the utmost difficulty in bringing off their stricken General , where he lay wishing to die . Upon the fourth day after the battle lie died , loathing the sight of a redcoat , they said , and murmuring praises of " the blues , " the once despised Virginians . They buried his body in the road , that the army wagons might pass over the place and obliterate every trace of a grave their savage enemies might rejoice to find and desecrate . He had lived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shameful rout . The terror mastered the rear-guard too . They destroyed their artillery , burned their wagons and stores , emptied their powder into the streams , and themselves broke into a disordered , feverish retreat which was a mere flight , their craven commander shamefully acquiescing . He would not even hold or rally them at Fort Cumberland , but went on , as if upon // a hurried errand , all the way to Philadelphia , leaving the fort , and all the frontier with it , " to be defended by invalids and a few Virginians . " " I acknowledge , " cried Dinwiddie , " I was not brought up to arms ; but I think common-sense would have prevailed not to leave the frontier exposed after having opened a road over the mountains to the Ohio , by which the enemy can the more easily invade us . The whole conduct of Colonel Dunbar seems to be monstrous . " And so , indeed , it was . But the colonies at large had little time to think of it . Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for him at every point , now that they had read Braddock 's papers , taken at Duquesne , and to come back again without doing anything . Beausejour had been taken in Acadia , but it lay apart from the main field of struggle . Johnson beat the French off at Lake George when they attacked him , and took Dieskau , their commander ; but he contented himself with that , and left Crown Point untouched . There were other frontiers besides those of Virginia and Pennsylvania to be looked to and guarded . For three long years did the fortunes of the English settlements go steadily from danger to desperation , as the French and their savage allies advanced from victory to victory . In 1756 Oswego was taken ; in 1757 , Fort William Henry . Commander succeeded commander among the English , only to add blunder to blunder , failure to failure . And all the while it fell to Washington , Virginia 's only stay in her desperate trouble , to stand steadfastly to the hopeless work of keeping three hundred and fifty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of savages , masters of the craft of swift and secret attack , " dexterous at skulking , " in a country " mountainous and full of swamps and hollow ways covered with woods . " For twenty years now settlers had been coming steadily into this wilderness that lay up and down upon the nearer slopes of the great mountains-Germans , ScotsIrish , a hardy breed . Their settlements lay scattered far and near among the foothills and valleys . Their men were valiant and stout-hearted , quick with the rifle , hard as flint when they were once afoot to revenge themselves for murdered wives and children and comrades . But how could they , scattered as they were , meet these covert sallies in the dead of night  --  a sudden rush of men with torches , the keen knife , the quick rifle ? The country filled with fugitives , for whom Washington 's militiamen could find neither food nor shelter . " The supplicating tears of the women , and moving petitions of the men , " cried the young commander , " melt me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my own mind , I could offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy , provided that would contribute to the people 's ease .... I would be a willing offering to savage fury , and die by inches to save a people . " It was a comfort to know , at the least , that he was trusted and believed in . The Burgesses had thanked him under the very stroke of Braddock 's defeat , in terms which could not be doubted sincere . In the very thick of his deep troubles , when he would have guarded the helpless people of the border but could not , Colonel Fairfax could send him word from Williamsburg , " Your good health and fortune are the toast at every table . " " Our Colonel , " wrote a young comrade in arms , is an example of fortitude in either danger or hardships , and by his easy , polite behavior has gained not only the regard but affection of both officers and soldiers . " But it took all the steadiness that had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disheartening task , from which he could not in honor break away . His plans , lie complained , were " to-day approved , tomorrow condemned . " He was bidden do what was impossible . It would require fewer men to go against Duquesne again and remove the cause of danger than to prevent the effects while the cause remained . Many of his officers were careless and inefficient , many of his men mutinous . " Your Hon or will , I hope , excuse my hang ing instead of shooting them , " he wrote to the Governor ; " it conveyed much more terror to others , and it was for example sake that we did it . " It was a test as of fire for a young Colonel in his twenties . But a single light lies upon the picture . Early in 1756 , ere the summer 's terror had come upon the border , and while he could be spared , he took horse and made his way to Boston to see Governor Shirley , now acting as commander-in-chief in the colonies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasing question of rank that had already driven this young officer once from the service . He went // WASHINGTON AND MARY PHILIPSE. // very bravely dight in proper uniform of buff and blue , a white and scarlet cloak upon his shoulders , the sword at his side knotted with red and gold , his horse 's fittings eiigraved with the Washington arms , and trimmed in the best style of the London saddlers . With him rode two aides in their uniforms , and two servants in their white and scarlet livery . Curious folk who looked upon the celebrated young officci ' upon the road saw him fare upon his way with all the pride of a Vii ' - ginian gentleman , a handsome man , and an admirable horseman ,  --  a very gallant figure , no one could deny . Everywhere lie was feted as he went ; everywhere lie showed himself the earnest , high-strung , achieving youth he was . In New York he fell into a new ambush , from which he did not come off without a wound . His friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house there , a beauty and an heiress , and Washington came away from her with a sharp rigor at his heart . But lie could not leave that desolate frontier at home unprotected to stay for a siege upon a lady 's heart ; he had recovered from such wounds before , had before that left pleasure for duty ; and in proper season was back at his post , with papers from Shirley which left no doubt who should command in Virginia . At last , in 1758 , the end came , when William Pitt thrust smaller men aside and became Prime Minister in England . Amherst took Louisbourg ' , Wolf came to Quebec , and General Forbes , that stout and steady soldier , was sent to Virginia to go again against Duquesne . The advance was slow to exasperation in the view of every ardent man like Washington , and cautious almost to timidity ; but the very delay redounded to its success at last . T was November before Duquesne was reached . The Indians gathered there , seeing winter come on , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time knew themselves in danger of being cut off by the English operations in the North . When Forbes 's forces , therefore , at last entered those fatal woods again , where Braddock 's slaughtered men had lain to rot , the French had withdrawn ; nothing remained but to enter the smoking ruins of their abandoned fort , hoist the King 's flag , and * the post Fort Pitt , and Washington turned home ward again to seek the rest he so much needed . It had been almost a bloodless campaign , but such danger as it had brought , Washington had shared to the utmost . The French had not taken themselves off without at least one trial of the English strength . While yet Forbes lay within the mountains a large detachment had come from Duquesne to test and reconnoitre his force . Colonel Mercer , of the Virginian line , had been ordered forward with a party to meet them . He stayed so long , and the noise of the firing came back with so doubtful a meaning to the anxious ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relief . In the dusk the two bodies of Englishmen met , mistook each other for enemies , exchanged a deadly fire , and were checked only because Washington , rushing between their lines , even while their pieces blazed , cried his hot comniands to stop , and struck up the smoking muzzles with his sword . T was through no prudence of his he was not shot . For a long time his friends had felt a deep uneasiness about his health . They had very earnestly besought him not to attempt a new campaign . " You will in all probability bring on a relapse , " George Mason had warned him , " and render yourself incapable of serving the public at a time when there may be the utmost occasion . There is nothing more certain than that a gentleman of your station owes the care of his health and his life not only to himself and his friends , but to his country . " But he had deemed the nearest duty the most imperative ; and it was only after that duty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek home and new pleasures along with new duties . The winter brought news from Quebec of the fall of the French power in America , which made rest and home and pleasure the more grateful and full of zest .
