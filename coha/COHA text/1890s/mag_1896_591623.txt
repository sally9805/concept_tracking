THOREAU . IT lay at the root of Thoreau 's peculiarity that he insisted upon being himself . Having certain opinions , he held them ; having certain tastes , he encouraged them ; having a certain faculty , he ma ( le the most of it : all of which , natural and reasonable as it may sound , is as far as possible from what is expected of the average citizen , who may be almost what he will , to be sure , if he will first observe the golden rule of good society , to be " like other folks . " Society is still a kind of self-constituted militia , a mutual protective association , - an army , in short ; and in an army , as everybody knows , the first duty of man is to keep step . What made matters worse in Thoreau 's case was , that his tastes and opinions , on which he so stoutly insisted , were in themselves far out of the common . Not only would ho be himself , but the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude ; in other words , he liked to think . He loved the society of trees and all manner of growing things . He found fellowship in them , they were of his kin ; which is not at all the same as to say that he enjoyed looking at them as objects of beauty . He lived in a world of his own , a world of ideas , and was strangely indifferent to much that other men found absorbing . He could get along without a daily newspaper , but not without a daily walk . He spent hours and hours of honest daylight in what looked for all the world like idleness ; and lie did it on principle . He was more anxious to live well - according to an inward standard of his own - than to lodge well , or to dress well , or to stand well with his townsmen . A good name , even , was relatively unimportant . He found easy sundry New Testament scriptures which the church would still be stumbling over , only that it has long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low value on money . It might be of service to him , he once confessed , underscoring the doubt , but in // general he accepted poverty as the better part . " We are often reminded , " he said , " that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of Crwsus , our aims must still be the same , and our means essentially the same . " Highly exalted aims they must have been , to bear such a test . Even the preacher is apt to find his health uncertain if by any chance a fortune drops into his lap . As for houses and lands , to Thoreau 's mind they were often no better than incumbrances . Some of his wealthier neighbors were as good as in prison , he thought . In what sense were men to be called free , if their " property " had put them under bonds to stay in such a place and do only such and such things ? Life was more than meat , as he reckoned , and having trained himself to " strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not believe in swapping a better thing for a poorer one . To him it was amazing that hardheaded , sensible men should stand at a desk the greater part of their days , and " glimmer and rust , and finally go out there . " *Jf they know anything , " lie exclaimed , " what under the sun do they do that for ? " He speaks as if the question were unanswerable ; but no doubt some readers will think it easy enough , the only real difficulty being a deplorable scarcity of desks . For Thoreau 's part , at any rate , other men might save dollars if they would ; he meant to save his soul . It should not glimmer and rust and go out , if a manly endeavor was good for anything . And he saved it . To the end he kept it alive ; and though he died young , he lived a long life and did a long life 's work , and what is more to the present purpose , he left behind him a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rigorous , were worthy of a nian . In kind , they were such as any man must practice who , having a task assigned him , is set upon doing it . If the river is to run the mill , it must contract itself . Rightly considered , Thoreau 's singularity consisted , not in his lodging in a cabin , nor in his wearing coarse clothes , nor in his non-observance of socalled social amenities , nor even in his passion for the wild , but in his view of the world and of his own place in it . He was a poet-naturalist , an idealist , an individualist , a tramiscendental philosopher , what you will ; but first of all he was a prophet . " I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , " he might have said ; and the locusts and wild honey followed as things of course . It followed , also , that the fathers neglected him , - stoning having gone out of fashion , - and the children garnish his sepulchre . A prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therm come biographies , eulogies , and new editions of his works , including his journals and private letters . Fame is a plant that blossoms on graves ; as a manual of such botany might say , " a late-flowering perennial , nowhere common , to be looked for in old cemeteries. ** A prophet , a writer , a student of nature this was Thoreau , and the three were one . He preached faith , simplicity , devotion to the ideal ; and with all a prophet 's freedom he denounced everything antagonistic to these . He was not one of those nice people who are contented to speak handsomely of God and say nothing about the devil . No man was more of a believer and less of a skeptic . Faith and hope , " infinite expectation , " were his daily breath . Charity was his , also , but less conspicuously , and after a standard of his own , philanthropy being one of his prime aversions . He knew not the meaning of pessimism . The world was good . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanksgiving is perpetual . " To the final Imour existence was a boon ho him . " For joy I could embrace the earth , " lie declared , though he seldom indulged hAmself in emotional expression ; " I shall delight to be buried in it . " " It was not possible to be sad in his presence , " said // his sister , speaking of his last illness . His may have been " a solitary and critical way of living , " to quote Emerson 's phrase , but in his work there is no trace of anything morbid or unwholesome . Some who would hesitate to rank themselves among his disciples keep by them a copy of Walden or the Week , to dip into for refreshment and invigoration when life runs low and desire begins to fail . Readers of this kind please him better , we may guess , if he kno*vs of them , than those who skim his pages for the natural history and the scenery . Such is the fate of prophets . The fulminations and entreaties of Isaiah are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , worse things may happen to a man than to be partially appreciated . As Thoreau himself said " It is the characteristic of great poems that they will yield of their sense in due proportion to the hasty and the deliberate reader . To the practical they will be common sense , and to the wise wisdom ; as either the traveler may wet his lips , or an army may fill its watercasks at a full stream . " His own was hardly a " full stream , " perhaps ; a mountain brook rather than one of the world 's rivers ; clear , cold , running from the spring , untainted by the swamp ; less majestic than the Amazons , but not less unfailing , and for those who can climb , and who know the taste of purity , infinitely sweeter to drink from . Simplicity of life and devotion to the ideal , the one a means to the other , - these he would preach , in season and , if possible , out of season . " Simplicity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as two or three , and not a hundred or a thousand ; instead of a million count half a dozen , and keep your accounts on your thumb - nail . " This , which , after all , is nothing but the old doctrine of the one thing needful , - since it is one mark of a prophet that he deals not in novelties , but in truth , - all this spiritual economy is connected at the root with Thoreau 's belief in free will , his vital assurance that the nobility or meanness of a man 's life is left largely to his own choice . He may waste it on the trivial , or spend it on the essential . There is " no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor . " And what a man is inwardly , that to him* will the world be outwardly ; his mood affects the very " quality of the day . " Could anything be truer or more finely suggested ? For himself , Thoreau was resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He refused to be hurried . The hour was too precious . " If the bell rings , why should we run ? " Neither would he knowingly be put off with a sham , - as if there were nothing real ! He would not " drive a nail into mere lath and plastering , " he declared . Such a deed would keep him awake nights . A very reasonable and practical kind of doctrine , certainly , whether it be called transcendentalism or common sense . Perhaps we accuse it with a long word because of the obligation it lays us under . And possibly it is for a similar reason that the world in general has agreed to regard Thoreau not as a preacher of righteousness , but as an interpreter of nature . For those who have settled down to take things as they are , having knocked under and gone with the stream , in Thoreau 's language , it is pleasanter to read of beds of water-lilies flashing open at sunrise or of a squirrel 's pranks upon a bough than of daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thoreau is to the many a man who lived out of doors , and wrote of outdoor things . His attainments as a naturalist have been by turns exaggerated and belittled , one extreme following naturally upon the other . As for the exaggeration , nothing else was to be expected , things being as they were . It is what happens in every such case . If a man knows some of the birds , his neighbors , who know none of // them , celebrate him at once as an ornitholooist . If he is reputed to " analyze " flowers , - pull them to pieces under a pocket-lens , and by means of a key find out their polysyllabic names , - he straightway becomes famous as a botalAst ; all of which is a little as if the ticket-seller and the grocer 's clerk should he hailed as financiers because of their facility in making change . Thoreau knew his local fauna and flora after a method of his own , - a method which , for lack of a better word , may be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bird ; and that , from his point of view and for his purpose , - and not less for ours who read him , - was the one important thing . After that it mattered little if some of his flying neighbors escaped his notice altogether , while others led him a vain chase year after year , and are still , in his published journals , a puzzle to all readers . Who knows what his night warbler was , or , with certainty , his seringo bird ? The latter , indeed , a native of his own Concord hay-fields , he seems to have been pretty well acquainted with ns a bird ; its song was familiar to him , and less frequently he cau , , ht sight of the singer itself perched upon a fencepost or threading its way through the grass ; but he had found no means of ascertaining its nnme , and so was driven to the primitive expedient of christening it with an invention of his own . His description of its appearance and notes leaves us in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savanna sparrow ; but how completely in the dark he himself was upon this point may be gathered from an entry in his journal of 1854 . He had gone to Nantucket , in late December , and there saw , running along the ruts , flocks of " a gray , bunting-like bird about the size of the snowbunting . Can it be the seaside finch , " he asks , " or the savanna sparrow , or the shore lark ? " The man who has " named all the birds without a gun " is yet to be announced ; the youngest reader of the present article will not live long enough to see him ; and Thoreau s studies in this line , it is fair to add , were pursued under limitations and disadvantages to which the amateur of our later day is happily a stranger . Ornitlmologically , it is a long time since Thoreau s death , though it is less than thirty-five years . If any be disposed to insist , as some have insisted , that he made no discoveries ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing ) , and was more curious than scientific in his spirit and method as an observer , it is perhaps sufficient to reply that he cultivated his own field . From first to last lie refused the claims of science , - whether rightly or wrongly is not here in question , - and with the exception of one or two brief essays wrote nothing directly upon natural history . He worshiped Nature , even while he played the spy upon her , fearing her enchantments and " looking at her with the side of his eye . " Run over the titles of his books : A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers , Walden , The Maine Woods , Cape Cod , A Yankee in Canada , Excursions . rrhe first two are studies in high and plain living , - practical philosophy , spiritual economy , the right use of society and solitude , books and nature . The rest are narratives of travel , with a record of what the traveler saw and thought and felt . In Excursions , to be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , to which , by straining a point , we may add one on The Succession of Forest Trees , another on Autunmnl Tints , and still another on Wild Apples . Elsewhere , though the landscape is always carefully stu ( lied , it is always a landscape with figures . In truth , while he wrote so much of outward nature , and so often seenied to find his fellow-mortals no better than intruders upon the scene , his real subject was man . " Man is all in all , " he says // " Nature nothing but as she draws him out and reflects him . " And again lie said , " Any affecting human event may blind our eyes to natural objects . " The latter sentence was written shortly after the death of John Brown , in whose fate Thoreau had been so conipletely absorbed that his old Concord world , when he came back to it , had almost a foreign look to him , and he saw with surprise that the little grebe was still diving in the river as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was the " human event " that really concerned him . But then he had ideas of his own as to what constituted an event . As for men 's so-called affairs , and all that passes current under the name of news , nothing could be less eventful ; for all such things lie could never sufficiently express his contempt . " In proportion as our inward life fails , " he says , " we go more constantly and desperately to the post-office . " And he adds , in that peculiarly airy manner of his to which one is tempted sometimes to apply the old Yankee adjective " toplofty , " " I would not run round the corner to see the world blow up . " After which , the reader whose bump of incuriosity is less highly developed may console himself by remembering that when a powder - mill blew up in the next town , Thoreau , hearing the noise , ran downstairs , jumped into a wagon , and drove post-haste to the scene of the disaster . So true is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Heights which the soul is competent to gain . " Careful economist as Thoreau was , bravely as he trusted his own intuitions and kept to his own path , much as he preached simplicity and heroically as he practiced it , he shared the common lot and fell short of his own ideal . Life is never quite so simple as he tried to make it , and he , like other men , was conscious of a divided mind . He had by nature a bias toward the investigation of natural phenomena , a passion for particulars , which , if he had been less a poet and philosopher , might have made him a man of science . He knew it , and was inwardly chafed by it . Perhaps it was because of this chafing that he fell into the habit of speaking so almost spitefully of science and scientific men . Not to lay stress upon his frequent paradoxes about the superiority of superstition to knowledge , the advantages of astrology over astronomy , the slight importance of precision in matters of detail ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say nothing of these things , which , taken as they were meant , are not without a mneasure of truth , and with which no lover of Thoreau will be much disposed to quarrel ( those who can not abide a paradox or a grain or two of exaggeration may as well let him alone ) , it is plain that in certain moods , especially in his later years , his own semi-scientific researches were felt to be a hindrance to the play of his higher faculties . " It is impossible for the same person to see timings from the poet 's point of view and that of the mami of science , " he writes in 1842 . " Man can not afford to be a naturalist , " lie says again , in 1853 . " I feel that I am dissipated by so many observations . . . . Oh , for a little Lethe ! And a week afterward he takes up the same strain , in a tone of reminiscence that is of the very rarest with him . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they never to return ? when the walker does not too enviously observe particulars , but sees , hears , scents , tastes , and feels only himself , the phenomena that showed themselves in him , his expanding body , his intellect and heart . No worm or insect , quadruped or bird , confined his view , but the unbounded universe was his . A bird has now become a mote in his eye . " What devotee of natural science , if lie be also a man of sensibility and imagination , does not feel the sincerity of this cry ? But having delivered himself thus passionately , what does the diarist set down // next ? Without a break he goes on : " Dug into what I take to be a woodchuck 's burrow in the low knoll below the cliffs . It was in the side of the hill , and sloped gently downward at first diagonally into the hill about five feet , perhaps westerly , then turned and ran north about three feet , then northwest further into the hill four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know not how far , the last five feet , perhaps , ascending , " - with as much more of the same tenor and equally detailed . A laughable paragraph , surely , to follow a lament over a too envious observation of particulars ; with its " perhaps " four times repeated , its five feet westerly , three feet northerly , and so on , like a conveyancer 's description of a wood ! lot : and all about a hole in the ground which he " took to be " a woodchuck 's burrow ! In vain shall a man bestir himself to run away from his own instincts . In vain , in such a warfare , shall he trust to the freedom of the will . Happily for himself , and happily for the world , Thoreau could never cease from his too envious observation . By inclination and habit he liked to see and do things for himself , as if they had never been seen or done before . That was one mark of his individualistic temper . He describes in his journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maple trees . Here , too , he goes into the minutest details , not omitting the size of the holes he bored and the frequency with which the drops fell , - about as fast as his pulse beat . His father , he mentions ( the son was then forty years old ) , chided him for wasting his time . There was no occasion f or the experiment , the father thought ; it was well known that the thing could be done ; and as for the sugar , it could be bought cheaper at the village shop . " He said it took me from my studies , " the journal records . " I said that I made it my study , and felt as if I had been to a university . " ( If fault-finding is in order , an individualist prefers to do , it on his own account . ) But whether the old gentleman or the son may be supposed to have been right in the present instance , there can be no doubt that by habits of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old or new , keeps something of the freshness of discovery upon it . The critic nmny smile , but even lie will not dispute the charm of writing done in such a spirit , - the very spirit in which the 01 ( 1 books were writteii , in the childhood of the world . Even the edibility of white-oak acorns affected Thoreau , at the age of forty , as a new fact . So far as his feeling about it was concerned , the fruit might have been that morning created . " The whole world is sweeter ' ' to him for having " discovered " it . " To have found two Indian gouges and tasted sweet acorns , is it not enough for one afternoon ? " he asks himself . And the next day , shrewd economist and exaggerator that he is , he tastes his new dainty again , and behold , a second discovery . The acorns " appear to dry sweet " ! One need not be a critic , but only a country-bred Yankee , to smile at this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile now and then at one who held himself so high and aloof , - " a Switzer on the edge of time glacier , " as he called himself ; who found no wisdom too lofty for him , no companionship quite lofty enough ; and who , in his longing for something better than the best , could exclaim , " Give me a sentence which no intelligence can understand . " Not that we feel any diminution of our respect and affection ; but it pleases us to have met our Switzer for once on something near our own level . In an author , as in a friend , an amiable weakness , if there be strength enough behind it , is only another poiImt of attraction . As a writer Thoreau is by himself . There are no other books like Walden and the Week . The reader may like them or leave them ( unless he is pretty sure of himself , he may be advised to try Walden first ) , he will find nowhere // else the same combination of pure nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what to compare them , or to conceive of any one else as having written them . If Marcus Aurelius , with half his sweetness of temper eliminated , and something of sharpness , together with liberal measures of cool intellectuality , injected , could have been united with Gilbert White rather less radically transformed , and if the resultant complex person had made it his business to write , we can perhaps imagine that his work would not have been in all respects unlike that of the sage of Walden ; in saying which we have but taken a circuitous course back to our former position , that Thoreau was a man of his own kind . He was an author from the beginning . Of that , as he said himself , he was never in doubt . His ceaseless observation of nature - which some have decried as lacking purpose and method - and his daily journal were deliberately chosen means to that end . " Here have I been these forty years learning the language of these fields that I may the better express myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject be what it might , - to express himself . Few writers have ever treated their work more seriously , or studied their art more industriously . He talked sometimes , to be sure , as if there were no art about it . To listen to him in such a mood , one might suppose that the fact and the thought were the only things to be considered , and that language followed of itself . Such was neither his belief nor his practice . But he was one of the fortunate ones who by taking pains can produce an effect of easiness who can recast and recast a sentence , an ( l in the end leave it looking as if it had ( Iropped from a running pen . One of the fortunates , we say ; for an expression of innocent unconsciousness is as becoming in a sentence as in a face . On this point a useful study in contrasts might be made between Thoreau and a man who gladly acknowledged him as one of his masters . " Upon me , " says Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascetic Thoreau had exercised a great charm . I have scarce written ten sentences since I was introduced to him , but his influence might be somexvhere detected by a close observer . " The observer would need to be very close indeed , the majority of Stevensonians will think , but that , true or false , is nothing to the purpose here . Stevenson and Thoreau both made writing a lifelong study , and with exceedingly diverse results . The Scotchman 's style is the finer , but then it is sometimes in danger of becoming superfine . We may not wish it different . Such work must be as it is . It could'hardly be better without being worse , the writing of fine prose being always a question of compromises , a gain here for a loss there , a choice of imperfections ; perfect prose being in fact impossible , except in the briefest snatches . But surely Stevenson 's gift was not an absolute naturalness and transparency , such as lets the thought show through on the instant , and leaves the beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader will . " For love of lovely words " an artist of Stevenson 's temperament , however sound his theories , may sometimes find it hard to make a righteous choice betweemi the music of an exquisite cadence and the pure expressiveness of a halting phrase . The author of Walden had his literary temptations , but not of this kind . Let the phrase halt , so long as it expressed a sturdy truth in sturdy fashion . As for that homely quality - " careless country talk " - which Thoreau prayed for , and in a measure received , it is questionable whether Stevenson ever sought it , though he would no doubt have assented to Thoreau 's words " Homeliness is almost as great a merit in a book as in a house , if the reader would abide there . It is next to beauty , and a very high art . " Thoreau , indeed , first as a spiritual // economist , and next as an artist , had a natural relish for the common and the plain . Every landscape that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a certain beauty in his eyes . Whether in literature or in life , he preferred the beauty that is inherent . Ornament , beauty laid on , did not much attract him . Among persons , it was the wilder-seeming , the less tamed and cultivated , with whom he liked to converse , and whose sayings he oftenest recorded . Though they might be crabbed specimens , " run all to thorn and rind , and crowded out of shape by adverse circumstances , like the third chestnut in the burr , " they were still what nature made them . Even a crowd pleased him , if it was composed of the right materials , - that is to say , if it was rude enough . Thus he , a hermit , took pleasure in the autumnal cattle-show . With what a touch of affection he lays on the colors " The wind goes hurrying down the country , gleaning every loose straw that is left in the fields , while every farmer lad too appears to scud before it , - having donned his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigging of duck or kerseyrnere or corduroy , and his furry hat withal , - to country fairs and cattle-shows , to that Rome among the villages where the treasures of the year are gathered . All the land over they go leaping the fences with their tough , idle palms , which have never learned to hang by their sides , amid the low of calves and the bleating of sheep , - Amos , Abner , Elnathan , Elbridge , - From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain . ' I love these sons of earth , every mother 's son of them . " It is worth while to see the country 's people , he thinks , and even the ? upple vagabond , " who is " sure to appear on the least rumor of such a gathering , and the next day to disappear , and go into his hole like the seventeen-year locust . " For the average reader , be it said , there is nothing better in I'horeau than his thumb-nail sketches of humble , everyday humanity ; as there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly conformity or his picturing of nature 's moods , which is done more truly con arnore . A man need not be an idealist or a nature-worshiper to like the Canadian wood-chopper , for example , cousin to the pine and the rock , who never was tired in his life , and , stranger still , sometimes acted as if he were " thinking for himself and expressing his own opinions ; " or the old fisherman , ys haunting the river in serene afternoons , and " almost rustling with the sedge ; " or the Cape Cod wrecker , whose face was " like an 01 ( 1 sail endowed with life , " - one of the Pilgrims , perhaps , who had " kept on the back side of the Cape and let the centuries go by ; or the free-spoken Welifleet oysterman , " a poor good-for-nothing crittur , " now " under petticoat government , " who yet remembered George Washington as " a r-a-ther large and portly - looking man , with a pretty good leg as he sat on his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shouting at you through a breaker , and who looked * as if it made her head ache to live ; " or the country soldier boy on his way to muster , in full regimentals , with shouldered musket and military step , who in a lonely place in the woods is suddenly abashed at the sight of a stranger approaching , and is hard put to it to get by in anything like military order . Men like these , natural men , Thoreau could describe as sympathetically as if they had been so many woodchucks or hen-hawks . As he said of his own boyhood , they were " part and parcel of nature " itself . As for fine manners para ( ling about in fine clothes , how should he , a rustic jealous of his rusticity , presume to know what , if anything , might be going on under all that broadcloth ? Whether it would have been better for him had his taste been more liberal in // this respect is a question about which it might be useless to speculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense , especially by one who has a distinct and highly individual work to accomplish . Economy , even at its best , has something pinched and ungenerous in its look , if not in its very nature , and it is not every good quality that a spiritual economist can afford to cultivate . First of all he must be himself . But that some of Thoreau 's private and hasty remarks , in his letters and journals , about the meanness of his fellow - creatures , might profitably have been left unprinted , is less open to doubt . They were expressions of moods rather than of convictions , it is fair to assume , and in any event would never have been printed by their author , one of whose cravings was for some kind of india-rubber that would rub out at once all which it cost him so many perusals and so much reluctance to erase . It is pretty hard justice that holds a man publicly to everything he scribbles in private , - as if no allowance were to be made for whim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal , as Thoreau says , consists in a " certain greenness . " It is " a record of experiences and growth , not a preserve of things well done or said . " After which it may be confessed that even from Walden and the Week , published in the author 's lifetime , it is possible to discover that charity and sweetness were not his most noticeable characteristics . Taste him after Gilbert White , and contrast the mellowness of the one with the sharp , assertive quality of the other . Thoreau was a wild apple , and would have been proud of the name , suggestive of that " tang and smack " which he so feelingly celebrated . " Nonesuches " and " seekno-furthers " were very tame and forgetable , he thought , as compared with the wildings , even the acrid and the puckery among which he begrudged to the cidermill . It is in part this very " tang and smack , " we may be sure , that makes his books keep so well in Time 's literary cellar . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as he calls it , is of that best of fruity flavors , a pleasant sour . Some , indeed , emulating his own fertility in paradox , have maintained that he had no humor , while others have rebuked him for priggishly excluding it from his later work . Did such critics never read Cape Cod ? There , surely , Thoreau gave his natural drollery full play , - an almost antinomian liberty , to take a word out of those ecclesiastical histories , with the reading of which , under his umbrella , he so patiently enlivened his sandy march from Orleans to Provincetown . " As I sat on a hill one sultry Sunday afternoon , " he says , " the meeting-house windows being open , my meditations were interrupted by the noise of a preacher who shouted like a boatswain , profaning the quiet atmosphere , and who , I fancied , must have taken off his coat . Few things could have been more disgusting or disheartening . I wished the tithing-man would stop him . " Charles Lamb himself could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not this Boanergian minister , but a man of an earlier generation , of whom we are told that he wrote a Body of Divinity , a book " frequently sneered at , particularly by those who have read it . " The whole Cape , past and present , was looked at half quizzically by its inland visitor . The very houses " seemed , like mariners ashore , to have sat right down to enjoy the firmness of the land , without studying their postures or habiliments , " - a description not to be fully appreciated except by those who have seen a Cape Cod village , with its buildings dropped here and there at huphazard upon the sand . Here , as everywhere , he was hungry for particulars ; now improvising a rude quadrant with which to calculate the height of the bank at Highland Light , now , by ingenious but " not impertinent " // questions , and for his private satisfaction only , getting at the contents of a schoolboy 's dinner-pail , - the homeliest facts being always " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother , by the bye , had some reputation as a gossip . His work , humorous or serious , transcendental or matter-of-fact , is all the fruit of his own tree . Whatever its theme , nature or man , it is all of one spirit . Say what you will of it , it is never insipid . As his friend Channing said , it has its " stoical merits , " its " uncomfortableness . " Well might its author express his sympathy with the barberry bush , whose business is to ripen its fruit , not to sweeten it , - and to protect it with thorns . " Seek the lotus , and take a draught of ra.pture , " was Margaret Fuller 's rather high-flown advice to him ; yet she too perceived that his mind was " not a soil for the citron and the rose , but for the whortleberry , the pine , or the heather . " In all his I*ooks it would be next to impossible to find a pretty phrase or a sentimental one . He resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood into which it put him , the invigoration , the serenity , the mental activity it communicated . But his pleasure in it , as compared with Wordsworth 's or Hazlitt 's , to take very dissimilar exampies , was mostly an intellectual affair , the reader is tempted to say , though the remark needs qualification . One remembers such a passage as that descriptive of a winter twilight in Yellow Birch Swamp , where the gleams of the birches , as he came to one after another of them , " each time made his heart beat faster . " Yet even here we are told of his ecstasy rather than made to feel it ; and in general , surely , though he valued his emotions , and went to the woods and fields to enjoy them , they were such emotions as belonged to a pretty stoical sort of Epicurean ; less rapturous than Wordsworth 's , less tender than Hazlitt 's , and with no trace of the brooding melancholy which makes the charm of books like Obermaun and the journal of Amid . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lie ever heard any other , and of course he felicitated himself upon this as upon all the rest of his poverty ; it was only the depraved ear , he thought , that needed the opera ) , hut let any reader try to imagine him writing this bit out of one of Hazlitt 's essays : " I remember once strolling along the margin of a stream , skirted with willows and plashy sedges , in one of those low , sheltered valleys on Salisbury Plain , where the monks of former ages had planted chapels and built hermits ' cells . There was a little parish church near , but tall elms and quivering alders hid it from sight , when , all of a sudden , I was startled by the sound of the full organ pealing on the ear , accompanied by rustic voices and tIme willing quire of village maids and children . It rose , indeed , like an exhalation of rich distilled perfumes . ' The dew from a thousand pastures was gathered in its softness ; the silence of a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the calm beauty of death ; fancy caught the sound , and faith niounted on it to the skies . It filled the valley like a mist , and still poured out its endless chant , and still it swells upon the ear , and wraps me in a golden trance , drowning the noisy tumult of the world ! " Here is another spirit than Thoreau 's , another voice , another kind of prose , - prose with the throb and even time accent of poetry . Stoics and spiritual economists do not write in this strain , nor is this the manner of a too envious observer of particulars . For better or worse , the prose of our poet-naturalist went squarely on its feet . His fancy might be never so nimble ; conceit and paradox might fairly make a cloud about him ; but lie essayed no flights . If his heart beat fastci ' at some beauty of sight or sound , he sai ( l so quietly , with no change of voice , and passed on . As far as the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest fashion , as if a man rather than an author held the pen . Thoreau believed in well-packed sentences , each expressive of its own thought , rememberable and quotable . Of the beauties of a flowing style he had heard something too much . In practice , nevertheless , whether through design or by some natural felicity , lie steered a middle course . The sentences might be complete in themselves , detachable , able to stand alone , but the paragraph never lacked a logical and even a formal cohesion . It was not a collection of " infinitely repellent particles , " nor even a " basket of nuts . " A great share of the writer 's art , as he taught it , lay in leaving out the unessential , - the getting in of the essential having first been taken for granted . As for readers , in his more exalted moods he wished to write so well that there would be few to appreciate him ; sometimes , indeed , he seemed to desire no readers at all . He speaks with stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would fain have one reader before they die . " A lamentable weakness , truly . In his present estate , however , let us hope that he carries himself a shade less haughtily , and is not above an innocent pleasure in the spread of his earthly fame , in new readers and new editions , and such choicely limited popularity as befits a classic . Even in his lifetime , as Emerson tells the story , he once tried to believe that something in his lecture might interest a little girl who told him she was going to hear it if it was n't to be one of those old philosophical things that she did not care about ; and this although he had just been maintaining , characteristically , that whatever succeeded with an audience must be bad . He speaks somewhere against luxurious books , with superfluous paper and marginal embellishments . His taste was Spartan in those days . But he was never a stickler for consistency , and we may indulge a comfortable assurance that he takes no offense now at the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on that soft , leg-tiring Back-Side beach to get the ocean into him - decked out in colors and set forth sumptuously in two volumes . It is a very modest author who fears that his text will be outshone by any pictures , no matter how splendid . But who would have thought it , fifty years ago , - a book by the hermit of Walden in an *ditiom de lu e , to lie on parlor tables ! If only his father and his brother John could have seen it ! Thoreau believed in himself and in the soundness of his work . He coveted readers , and believed that he should have them . Without question he wrote for the future , and foresaw himself safe from oblivion . Emerson regretted Henry 's want of ambition , we are told . He might have spared himself . " Show me a man who consults his genius , " said Thoreau , " and you have shown me a man who can not be advised . " And he was the man . He was following an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step with his companions , it was because he " heard a different drumnier . " His ambition and what seemed his wayward singularity have been justified by the event . His " strange , self-centred , solitary figure , unique in the annals of literature , " is in no danger of being forgotten . But what is most cheering about his present increasing vogue , especially in England , is that it arises from the very quality that Thoreau himself most prized , the innermost thing in him , - the loftiness and purity of his thought . Simplicity , faith , devotion to the essential and the permanent , - these were never more needed than now . These he taught , and , by a happy fate , he linked them with those natural themes that change not with time , and so can never become obsolete .
