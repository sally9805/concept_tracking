" This statement was made to W. G. Davis- of Sidney . Ohio , who discussed National - matters with Senator Hanna at some length . Speaking of the matter , Mr. Davis said to-day : " I urged Senator Hanna to favor a bill creating another Cabinet department , to look after the commerce of the Nation . " Senator Hanna replied as above stated , and added : " I am certainly in favor of having a Secretary of Commerce in the Cabinet . Such a department has long been needed . Too many great branches of business and Governmental departments are grouped under the control of a single Cabinet officer ? I for instance , the Interior Department . Think of it ! It embraces the Land Office , I Pension Department , the Indians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the treasury . Rightly , they should be in the proposed new Department ofCom merce . " It- is stated that Senator Hanna - and Gen. Henderson had some talk to , t-day - in Cleveland about the committees and Chairmanships of the new Congress . TEXAS STEER ON A RAMPAGE . " Bunts " Bicyclists , Drags His Stout Captor , and Resents Tail Twisting with a Solar Plexus Kick . Escaping from his pen in the Schwarz-child &; Sulzberger yards at Thirty-first Street and the East River at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon , a giant three-year-old steer from Texas made things lively for two hours . Thousands of west-sklers joined in the efforts to recapture him and foundplenty of excitement in the chase . When the steer obtained his freedom he ran straight across town until he reached Eighth Avenue . Leaving Eighth Avenue he turned into Thirty-eighth Street and made direct for the North River . He brought up short at the river and retraced his steps on Thirty-eighth Street . When he , arrived near Ninth Avenue Edward O'Brien of 406 West Thirty-eighth Street , and Charles Fleischman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several loops of a strong manila clothes line . Either by skill or mere luck , O'Brien threw the improvised lasso over the runaway 's horns and drew the slip noose taut . He yelled for Fleischman and William Garrity of 401 West Thirty-eighth Street , to grab hold . They did so to their sorrow . Feeling the noose , the steer gave a jump that took the three men by surprise , and they were lifted from their ' feet and jerked through space for some distance . They came down hard . Relieved of the three men the steer ran bellowing up Ninth Avenue as far as Fortieth Street . There were by this time over 1,000 persons in pursuit . At Thirty-eighth Street and Ninth AValrae the steer ran into a bicycle rider , , knocking- , him of his wheel , and giving hitn several ' painful bruises . Near Ninth Avenue and Fortieth Street a woman bicyclist had a similar experience , but escaped ' serious injury . A little further on the steer , which insisted on an absolute right of way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many nine-pins . At Fortieth Street the steer ran toward Tenth Avenue . When ha.lf way down the block a stout man , whose weight was not less than 250 pounds , ran out . The steer dodged him , but the man got hold of the rope . By some strange freak of fortune he held on . Bracing his feet  --  very large ones , by the way  --  on the asphalt , he was dragged to Tenth Avenue as easily as if he had been on ice and wearing skates . Policemen and Ryan of the West Thirty-seventn Street Station and a score of citizens got hold of the rope at Tenth Avenue and ran around a lamppost with it . This brought the steer to a sudden stop . The policemen procured a truck and tied the steer to the rear and proceeded slowly to a livery stable in West Thirty-seventh Street . Isidore Scholer , a poundmaster , was sent for , and he arrived with a heavy truck and several assistants . The steer was led out and with a heavy rope tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for half a block and then decided to go no further . " Twist his tail , " advised a small man with a red beard . " Good scheme ! I 'll make him go , " said John Stinson , who lives in West Thirty- , seventh Street , near Tenth Avenue . It appeared that the steer was expecting such an onslaught , for when Stinson got within range the animal shot out both hind legs . They caught Stinson squarely in the solar plexus , and he was unable to move again for a good half hour . At the end of that time he was able to walk slowly home . The steer declined absolutely to go with the poundmaster , and lay down in the middle of the street . The wheels were then taken off the truck to lower it , and the rope was fastened about the steer 's body , and the team of horses attached to the other end . In this way the refractory bovine was dragged upon the truck . The horses were then put back in their places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pens . Fortunately for some hundreds of persons who happened to be In the animal 's route , the steer had no horns . All he could do was ' bunt " and kick . Had ' he possessed the horns of the average Texas steer he would have injured many persons .
