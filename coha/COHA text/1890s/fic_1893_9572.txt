Note : 1Kb Main text MISS TEMPLE : Why is he coming so early ? MISS LETTICE TEMPLE : Why , Aunt Catherine , do you call it early ? MISS TEMPLE : Why is he coming so early ? Gentlemen do n't usually call at ten o'clock in the forenoon . LETTICE : Oh , certainly , if you look at it in that light . ( She goes about the veranda of the cottage , opening seaward over a stretch of informal lawn , and closed at either end with meshes of honeysuckle in bloom . ) I think these flowers are rather oppressive , do n't you ? ( She gives a series of superfluous touches to the summer furnishings of the place , especially the arrangement of the cushions in a deep armchair . ) I suppose he 'll hate them , anyway , and tumble them all on to the floor ! ( She retires a step or two , and considers the cushions . Then she puts a willow table at the side of the chair , and regards it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front ? MISS TEMPLE , looking austerely up from the needle she is threading over a lapful of work overflowing from a basket , held in place by an adamantine rigidity of the knees , and an iron compression of the lips : What in the world are you doing , Lettice ? And why do n't you answer my question ? She pulls the thread out its full length , and knots it without removing her thumb and finger . LETTICE : Well , of course he would n't naturally come so early . But  --  I said he might . MISS TEMPLE : You said he might ? LETTICE : He asked if he might n't . MISS TEMPLE : Then it 's an appointment ! LETTICE : I do n't know whether I should call it an appointment . MISS TEMPLE : It has every appearance of it . What 's the table for ? Are you going to give him afternoon tea at this hour of the morning ? LETTICE , with a touch of indignation : Tea ! Certainly not ! It 's for his manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISS TEMPLE : Really , this is mystery upon mystery . I do n't know what to make of you , Lettice . What are you up to ? LETTICE : I do n't like being supposed to be " up " to anything , Aunt Catherine . It 's a very simple matter . Why do you make a mystery of it ? MISS TEMPLE : I 'm only too glad to make anything at all of it . If you like I will go away . LETTICE : How can you say such a thing , Aunt Catherine ? I would n't have you , for anything . And I do n't believe he would , either . You must certainly stay and receive him , at least . MISS TEMPLE : Very well ! It 's a beautiful morning . LETTICE : So it is . I had n't noticed . ( She approaches with a somewhat wistful air . Not being encouraged in her advances by her aunt , who is sewing with a certain degree of resentment , she sinks into the chair next her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . ) I think that was such a pretty custom , tying scarfs through the backs of chairs . He 's put the time back in that period , you know . He thinks the middle eighteen-seventies was the most charming period of any . He got to telling me about it , just before we began to break up last night , and I thought it was very interesting , and he asked me if he might tell me all about it some time , and of course I said yes , and he asked if he might n't come this morning , and of course I could n't refuse . Do you think it was so very odd ? MISS TEMPLE : I have n't the least idea what you are talking about , my dear . ( She lifts her eyes from her sewing , and glances at her niece 's face , which droops . ) What is it , and why should he want to tell you all about it ? LETTICE : Of course it must sound ridiculous to you , Aunt Catherine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had a great deal of insight ; I 'm sure I do n't know what he meant . I never knew that I was much of a judge of stories . MISS TEMPLE : What has that got to do with it ? LETTICE : Why , that 's the whole thing . He 's been writing a story . Well , it is n't the first one he 's written , but it 's the first he has any real chance of getting accepted , as he calls it . The editor sent back something he had done , with just a printed notice that editors use for such things , but he wrote with a pen at the bottom of the notice , and said that he should be glad to see anything else that Mr. Holyford did . Mr. Holyford said this was going pretty far , for an editor , and so he was doing his best , and he does n't want to offer it till he 's got it quite perfect . He 's read it to a friend of his , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and  --  and  --  he wants to submit it to me . MISS TEMPLE : Oh ! I thought Mr. Holyford was a lawyer . LETTICE : This is just in the intervals of practice , he says . He 's only just out of the law school . He writes fiction when he has nothing else to do . MISS TEMPLE : Oh , that is the way . LETTICE : Yes , that is the way . He says that if a man makes a hit in literature , it 's a great thing , and a good deal better than the law is at the beginning . He would rather be a literary man , anyway . MISS TEMPLE : Does he go round telling every body that ? I should n't think it would be very good for his law practice . LETTICE , thoughtfully : I do n't suppose he tells everybody . But he got to talking , last night , and he said he wanted me to believe that he did n't often talk so much about himself . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met a listener  --  one who could understand at the first word  --  that he was tempted to go on before he knew it . He has very little sympathy in his own family , I think . He says his father says he had better go fishing in the intervals of practice . Of course he laughed when he told me , but I could see that he felt it . He has a great deal of humor ; though this is n't a humorous story . He did write poetry at one time , but he 's dropped that . He thinks that if a man has really anything to say he can say it best in prose . MISS TEMPLE : Is he going to read his story to you ? LETTICE : No , he says he wo n't do that . But he is going to bring it , and refer to it . He 's got it all typewritten , so that if it interests me , he can let me have it to read myself . That 's the reason I wanted to arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he wants to refer to it . Do n't you think that 's a good idea ? MISS TEMPLE , rising , and gathering her sewing into her basket : Well , you wo n't want me here listening . LETTICE : Do you think you ought to go , Aunt Catherine ? Well ! ( She gathers up some of the sewing which has dropped from the basket , and holds it provisionally in her hand . Then , as if struck by a sudden inspiration ) Aunt Catherine ! I believe he would rather have you stay . He said himself that two heads were better than one . MISS TEMPLE : Yes , but three are not . Give me that , Lettice . She indicates with a gesture of her chin where Lettice shall put the piece of sewing . LETTICE , putting it behind her : No , I wo n't do it , Aunt Catherine . It looks as if I had no confidence in you . MISS TEMPLE : Why , goodness , child ! You talk as if you wanted my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me how far this has gone . When I asked you here , and promised your mother that I would take good care of you , I did n't expect  --  You are too young , altogether . LETTICE : I do n't see why I should be so very young . I 'm eighteen . But that has nothing to do with it . He wishes my opinion of his story , and that is all . If you are suspicious of me , Aunt Catherine , you had better stay , decidedly . I shall not know where to look , now , when he 's talking . MISS TEMPLE : You had better look at him , then . At any rate , I shall not stay to see where you look , if you think I 'm suspicious of you . She rises , and moves proudly toward the door . LETTICE , placing herself quickly before her : No , Aunt Catherine . I did n't mean that . MISS TEMPLE : You said it . Let me pass , please . ( Lettice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lettice ? LETTICE : You must stay here to receive him with me . Oh ! At the sound of a step on the veranda stairs she utters a nervous whoop , and with a sudden dash round her aunt 's figure she vanishes indoors , while Mr. Holyford , with a flat parcel , as of manuscript , under his arm , comes toward Miss Temple . He extends his hand tentatively , but realizing that one of Miss Temple 's hands is preoccupied with her sewing-basket and the other with her skirt , he converts his proposed greeting into a graceful gesticulation . HOLYFORD : How do you do , Miss Temple ? I am afraid you do n't remember me : Mr. Holyford . I was here at the Kelp Inn , last summer . MISS TEMPLE : Oh , yes , Mr. Holyford . Wo n't you sit down . My niece was expecting you . She sits down herself , and waves him to the chair prepared for him . HOLYFORD : Thank you , but wo n't you take this chair yourself ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She keeps her seat decisively . ) It 's low , and nicer for sewing . ( She takes the piece of work from the top of her basket , and unfolds it . ) Besides , Lettice got that ready for you , with the table to put your manuscript on . HOLYFORD : She has told you of my audacious proposition ? I only brought it along for reference . It is n't so bad as if I were going to read it to her . She 's told you  --  MISS TEMPLE : That you were going to ask her criticism of your story . She 's very much flattered . It is n't often that authors submit their work to Lettice . HOLYFORD : So much the worse for authors , if they have the chance . I feel very much flattered myself . I think Miss Lettice 's intuitions are  --  are most valuable . I only hope she wo n't find me and my story too tiresome , or my story alone . MISS TEMPLE , non-committally : She seemed anxious to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad . I proposed it on the impulse of the moment , yesterday evening , and I spent the rest of the night composing appropriate names for myself . I think some of them would have pleased my father . He does n't go in much for my fiction . Holyford attempts a gratuitous hilarity , and rather fails of imparting gayety to his laugh . At least it does not infect Miss Temple , who has resumed her sewing seriously . MISS TEMPLE : May I ask what kind of story it is ? HOLYFORD : Well  --  Are you much opposed to psychological novels ? MISS TEMPLE : Is it a question of my opinion ? HOLYFORD , laughing with rather more enjoyment : Well , yes , provisionally . MISS TEMPLE : You mean till Lettice comes ? HOLYFORD : I should be glad to have it , even after she comes . MISS TEMPLE , looking over her shoulder toward the door : I 'm sure I do n't know what 's keeping her . Ah ! There she comes . HOLYFORD : Just as they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person comes in ; I 've often noticed it . And the others always hear them coming , and say they 're coming . ( He goes forward , and offers Lettice his hand . ) You see how punctual I am . But if you are sorry , you know you can have a headache . Only , you ought to have had it behind the scenes , and sent word . Now it will be doubly difficult to get rid of me . But say the word ! LETTICE , embarrassed : You know Mr. Holyford , Aunt Catherine ? HOLYFORD : I 've been introducing myself as hard as I can , and trying to make her believe she remembers my being at the Kelp Inn last summer . I do n't know whether I told you I had put the scene at the Kelp Inn ? LETTICE : Have you ? I always thought it was so picturesque . HOLYFORD : And such a good name . Yes ; there , and at a cottage in the neighborhood . It works in nicely , and marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've made a very careful study of the period : got in Eastlake furniture and the last of the hoop skirts . It 's just the end of the Franco-Prussian war , and I 've had my fellow out there fighting on the French side . Footnote : 1Kb He 's an ardent Republican . LETTICE : Republican ? HOLYFORD : Yes . He 's an American , and after the fall of Louis Napoleon , he stays on through the seige of Paris , and helps fight the Germans . LETTICE : Oh ! That kind of Republican . I thought you meant a Roosevelt man . HOLYFORD : How delightfully actual you are , Miss Temple ! It almost makes me sorry I had n't laid the scene in the present time . But as it is , I suspect I 've got my heroine too modern . It 's she I want to tell you about more particularly . I 've tried to keep her back in that period , by having her rather petite . You know the latter-day girl is so tall . LETTICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her : Well , not invariably . But that was the time before tall girls came in so much . I make up for it by having the hero rather tall  --  quite tall , in fact . As they stand confronting each other , he overtops her by a head . LETTICE : Had n't we better sit down ? You can throw the cushions out if you do n't want them . But I thought you would like a table to put your manuscript on . HOLYFORD : Oh , thank you . But I sha' n't allow myself to use it for fear I might get to reading my story . Where he has sat down , he holds the tied-up parcel on his knees , with his hands nervously outspread on it , as if to keep it down . LETTICE , demurely , from where she sits diagonally from him , with her face three-quarters averted : I 'm sure I should be very glad to bear it . HOLYFORD , impulsively : Should you really ? You tempt me almost beyond my strength . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was saying ! LETTICE : That it was after the Franco-Prussian war . HOLYFORD : Oh , thank you . He comes back and throws himself heart and soul into Civil Service Reform . He 's seen the rottenness of the Second Empire , and he wants to save us from the same fate . But that 's a detail . The main thing is that he has n't a cent , and that when he sees Dorrance  --  Do you like the name ? Dorrance ? LETTICE : Yes , it 's so quaint ! Is it a girl 's name ? HOLYFORD : I 'm sure I do n't know . If it is n't I can change it . I do n't know where I got it exactly . I think your own name is charming , Miss Temple . I beg your pardon ! I do n't mean to be personal . LETTICE : Not at all . I like it myself . It 's better than Gladys . HOLYFORD , with scorn : Oh , Gladys ! I 'm so glad my name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my yearnings for Lionel . LETTICE : Lionel would go very nicely with Holyford . HOLYFORD : Yes , I do n't deny it . And I 'm rather well satisfied with my surname . LETTICE : I believe it was my grandmother 's . HOLYFORD : What ! Holyford ? Then we 're cousins ! May I call you cousin ? LETTICE : No , Lettice ! I do n't mean that you may call me Lettice , but that I was called Lettice for my grandmother . Was n't I , Aunt Ca  --  ( She looks round to where Miss Temple has been sitting . ) Why , she 's gone ! HOLYFORD , in dismay : So she is ! I 'm sorry , I did n't realize that I was sitting with my back to her . I 'm really very much ashamed  --  LETTICE : Not at all . She 'll be back in a moment . And then ? HOLYFORD : And when ? LETTICE : When he has n't a cent . HOLYFORD : Oh , yes ! Well , Dorrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father is a millionaire  --  I hope you do n't mind her being a millionaire 's daughter ? LETTICE : Oh , not in the least . I should like to be rich myself . HOLYFORD : Well , these are not at all vulgar millionaires ; it was when millionaires were just coming in ; and when the father accidentally finds out that Paul  --  I mean Lionel ; Hugh , I mean  --  Hugh Lionel is his name ; at any rate provisionally , for if it strikes you as too romantic  --  LETTICE : I think it 's fine . HOLYFORD : I 'm so glad . When he finds out that Hugh is in love with his daughter , and wo n't offer himself because she 's rich and he 's poor , he argues with him and tries to convince him that he 's a fool . I think I 've got a great scene , there . I think it 's something quite new in fiction , do n't you ? LETTICE : I never heard of anything like it . HOLYFORD : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time it has to be boldly treated , too . I think I 've got over it pretty well . I 've managed it humorously , or semi-humorously . The father is Western , and he has all that grotesque Western humor , and argues it out with him , man to man  --  takes the bull by the horns , you know . LETTICE : How perfectly original ! HOLYFORD : Yes , is n't it new ? I should really like to read that scene to you , Miss Temple , if  --  LETTICE : Oh , do ! I should like it of all things . HOLYFORD : Well , if I must ! ( He rises to lay open his manuscript on the table , and confronts Miss Temple , at the door . He starts guiltily back . ) Oh ! LETTICE , jumping to her feet : Oh ! MISS TEMPLE : Oh ! I just came to see if I had dropped a spool of  --  HOLYFORD , looking eagerly about the veranda : Thread ? Let me find it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you dropped it , Aunt Catherine ? MISS TEMPLE , vanishing indoors : If I knew , I should n't be looking for it . But it does n't the least matter . I can get another . ( Then from within ) I 've found it . Here it is . LETTICE AND HOLYFORD : Oh ! HOLYFORD : Ought I to have urged her to stay ? LETTICE : No , no . It would have just bored her . Go on ! HOLYFORD : And bore you ? LETTICE : How can you ? You know I did n't mean that . Now you shall read me every word , so as to prove that you do n't think I meant anything . HOLYFORD : Could n't I convince you with a chapter or two ? I understand just what you meant , but I 'd really rather tell you about the story than read it . The fact is , that until I 've had your judgment on some points , I should n't like to read it to you . LETTICE : I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I ca n't let you say that . Besides , the points are points of psychology . LETTICE : Psychology ? Is n't that rather formidable ? HOLYFORD : Well , say natural history . It 's about what a girl would do in a given case . LETTICE : I do n't believe any living girl could tell you . But what case ? HOLYFORD : Well , it 's rather difficult . Why are we standing up ? I do n't want to go , yet ! LETTICE : And I do n't want you to . ( They both laugh and sit down . ) Well ? HOLYFORD : Well , it 's something that comes up , after the father has had his talk with the hero . The hero gives the heroine a hint of his position , and then , as they know each other 's feeling  --  I 'm afraid you 'll think it 's rather a daring experiment ! LETTICE : Oh , I like those daring things . HOLYFORD : Do you , indeed ? Do you think I could venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that the consciousness of his being poor and her being rich forbids him to think of her love ? LETTICE : She would n't understand him , and so she could n't argue the point . But it would be very interesting if she could . If she really cared for him , she could n't think of herself at all . Not if she was a real girl . HOLYFORD : I want her to be a real girl . ( He muses a moment , before yielding to an impulse . ) Miss Lettice , I do n't believe you girls know how terrible you are to us poor fellows . I mean how much we 're afraid of you . I do n't believe any man would have the courage to offer himself to a girl unless  --  unless  --  LETTICE : But if the hero has n't offered himself , how can he expect her to refuse him ? HOLYFORD : I was n't thinking of that . I was thinking of the matter in the abstract . LETTICE : I do n't believe a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to have an actual case . Does Dorrance convince Hugh that her money does n't matter ? HOLYFORD : How nice of you to remember their names ! Why , you see if she convinces him then they get married , and the story stops . LETTICE , thoughtfully : That is true . HOLYFORD : I ca n't have my story stop in the second chapter , and so I had fancied having him tell her that until he can come back to her with as much money as she has he can never ask her to be his . LETTICE , fired with the idea : That would be grand ! And then I suppose you have him go off , and have a lot of adventures , trying to make the money . It would be splendid to have him shipwrecked , somewhere , and find a hidden treasure on the island . HOLYFORD : Well , yes . But I am afraid that would seem too easy . I have him go into business , and try to make the money . Of course , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a very good businessman , and he 's a good many years about it . Once or twice he loses his money , and has to begin over again . It gives me plenty of room for my story , but I 'm afraid people wo n't like her marrying somebody else in the meanwhile . LETTICE : A real girl would never do that in the world ! HOLYFORD : Would n't she ? I 'm sorry . You see , she has to be doing something , while they are both getting along in the thirties ; and the gray hairs are beginning to show themselves . I had thought of her going into some sort of university settlement work , but it 's hard to make that attractive , and it does n't involve as much suffering as I should like to have in . As the story now stands , I have her marry and then , when he has lost his money the second time , and is prostrated by the blow , she comes to him  --  LETTICE : Oh , do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . I was in hopes you would think she might . It 's rather a pet scene with me when they meet and argue it over the second time . LETTICE : Of course , not explicitly ; but with a perfect understanding ? HOLYFORD : Not exactly , or not absolutely . What should you think of my having him die , and leave the problem for each reader to solve in his own way ? LETTICE : I do n't believe I should like that . Why could n't they get married ? HOLYFORD : They do , in one of the endings . I 've written two . That 's the great point I wanted to submit to you . Of course people like a good ending , but I ca n't help feeling that it would be more artistic , and more powerful , to have him die . LETTICE : But would n't it be nicer to have her marry him , when they suppose he 's going to die , and then nurse him back to life and health ? HOLYFORD : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessness . LETTICE : Oh , you ought n't to mind the critics . HOLYFORD : I should n't if I were sure of your approval . LETTICE : Then you do n't consider me a critic ! HOLYFORD : The best in the world . But I want you to be awfully frank . Do you honestly think I could leave it as I 've got it ? LETTICE : Perhaps it would do . But I do n't know that I ever heard of a story with two endings before . HOLYFORD : I do n't mean that part . ( Laughing ) That would be rather a joke . ( Seriously ) It might n't be such a bad notion , though . It would certainly be novel . No , of course it would n't do . What I meant was , do you think I could have her come , and when she sees that he wo n't have the courage to offer himself  --  LETTICE : I do n't believe any girl would do it . HOLYFORD : But this is a widow . LETTICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a difference . Perhaps a widow might . HOLYFORD : And I 've got a great scene out of it . I make it the climax . But after all , that is n't the point , the psychological point . LETTICE : Is n't it ? I do n't see how anything could be more psychological . HOLYFORD : Well , you see the case is this . They have to understand each other fully before he comes to her and tells her that he ca n't marry her till he 's as rich as she is , and I want to arrange it so that they shall understand each other without saying anything . LETTICE , falteringly : I do n't believe I know what you mean . HOLYFORD : Miss Lettice , do you believe that a girl ever thinks a man cares for her before he tells her in so many words ? LETTICE : I  --  I do n't believe  --  That is , I do n't think  --  a real girl does . HOLYFORD : That 's discouraging . I 've got to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her , and yet he must not tell her so , till he tells her that he ca n't offer himself because she is rich and he is poor . If he has offered himself , in so many words , and asked her to be his wife , already , then he ca n't tell her that she 's too rich for him , without seeming to want to get out of it for some other reason . Besides , if she does n't know that he cares for her , and that she cares for him , she might say , " Nobody asked you , sir . " LETTICE : That is true . HOLYFORD : You see the point , do n't you ? It has to be very delicately contrived , somehow . LETTICE : Oh , yes . HOLYFORD : It was what I hoped you could help me about . But if you say it could n't happen , I must give it up and try something else . You do n't believe it could happen in some cases ? LETTICE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose  --  HOLYFORD : Suppose what ? LETTICE : Nothing ! HOLYFORD : Oh , but do suppose something , Miss Lettice ! Make the case your own . LETTICE : But how could I ? I 'm not rich . HOLYFORD : Oh , but there are other things  --  more precious than riches , more  --  more  --  Ca n't you imagine that you  --  that is  --  that some one  --  some one very much attached to you might want to find out  --  Or , no , that is n't the point , either . ( He has been leaning forward in her direction , and speaking very rapidly , and stopping abruptly , and then beginning again . Now he falls back in his chair with a long breath . ) I do n't see how it can be done . LETTICE : I should n't give it up if I were you . It 's so original . HOLYFORD , laughing ruefully : It 's too original , I 'm afraid . You ca n't have a thing happen that actually never happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But lots of things happen in stories that never happened in the world , do n't they ? HOLYFORD : You might say that . But this that I 've planned seems rather indelicate . If he finds out that she likes him without asking her , wo n't she think it 's selfish and sneaking of him ? Would n't she despise him for it ? LETTICE : I do n't know whether she would despise him , exactly . She gives the question apparently thoughtful attention , looking down at the toe of her slipper . HOLYFORD : It 's essential to the story that he should know she likes him , and that she should know he knows ; or else it 's impossible for her to take that step at the end , which forms the only possible dnouement , unless we have them both die . LETTICE , faintly : You ought n't to have them die . HOLYFORD : No , it 's begging the question . And I do n't see how I can have them marry . Of course , she ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage . LETTICE : He might , if he thought he was dying . I 've read stories where they did . I do n't believe but what you can make it come out all right . HOLYFORD , hopefully : Do n't you , Miss Lettice ? And you think that I  --  if he , that is  --  I mean if  --  No , no , I do n't mean that . I do n't know where I was ! LETTICE : Then , why not begin at the beginning , and  --  HOLYFORD : Oh , there never was any beginning , and there never will be any ending ! I believe it was ordained from everlasting to everlasting . Lettice ! Do n't you see that it 's you ,  --  I mean that it 's I  --  I mean , do n't you know that I care all the world for you ? He starts toward her , and she rises phantom-like to her feet . LETTICE , in a ghostly whisper : Then  --  then , it was all a pretence ! You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! LETTICE : You wanted to play upon me , and find out what a girl would do  --  would say  --  would  --  Oh ! HOLYFORD : Yes , indeed ! What would you say if I told you what I have told you , and what would you do ? Do n't tell me you never can care for me . LETTICE , with a nervous burst : Oh , it 's all horrid , horrid ! You 've mixed me up so that I do n't know which is which , and I never can look myself in the face again ! How could you ? How could you ? She dashes by him , as he tries to intercept her , and escapes down the steps and over the lawn . Holyford stands clutching his head with both hands . Miss Temple appears in the doorway from the house . MISS TEMPLE : What is the matter ? Why is Lettice running away ? HOLYFORD : Oh , Miss Temple ! I 've made such a fool of myself . I 've tried to tell Miss Lettice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . I did n't mean  --  to tell her  --  or not to  --  day ; but it turned into that , before I knew it . I was tempted on and on , and now she says I 've mixed her up so that she does n't know which is which , and I know she loathes us both ! MISS TEMPLE : Both ? HOLYFORD : Yes  --  my story and me ! MISS TEMPLE : You ? What have you got to do with it ? HOLYFORD , stopping before her in distractedly rushing to and fro on the veranda : Everything ! Do n't you understand that Lettice is all the world to me ? And that I 've told her so ? MISS TEMPLE : Be still a moment ! And what did she say ? HOLYFORD : She said  --  she said my story was horrid . MISS TEMPLE : What has your story got to do with it ? Did you offer her your story or yourself ? HOLYFORD : Oh , do n't laugh at me , Miss Temple ! What shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ? MISS TEMPLE , grimly and somewhat contemptuously : Well , if she simply said my story was horrid , I think I should go after her and ask her what she meant . HOLYFORD : Would you , Miss Temple ? Oh , bless you , bless you ! And you do n't think  --  MISS TEMPLE : How do I know ? But it 's the only way . HOLYFORD , plunging wildly down the steps , and over the lawn toward Lettice , where she is seen in half-length above the rocks : Bless  --  MISS TEMPLE , going to the edge of the veranda , and watching , till Holyford comes up to Lettice : Simpleton ! ( Then she starts back and runs indoors . ) Oh ! Oh !
