" The Times thinks the advocacy by The Chicago Tribune and The New York Herald of the joint construction of the Nicaragua Canal is significant evidence of the dominance of this feeling , and adds : " Whether or not such a condominium would be entirely free from objections we hesitate to say , but that it is suggested is a substantial proof of friendly feeling .
