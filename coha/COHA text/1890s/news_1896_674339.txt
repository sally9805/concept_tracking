txt The exaggerated and sensational statements that appeared In a couple of morning papers that brutal hazing has been revived at Princeton were read here to-day with surprise and disgust . An investigation has brought to light the exact facts , which show that the statements of these journals are so exaggerated as to answer to falsehood . Proctor Topley gives the lie to the whole story as told in these papers . He says that some time ago a score of sophomores took as many freshmen out one night for a frolic , but no real hazing was indulged in . The freshmen were guyed and made to give the college cheer for the sophs , and were called upon for songs . Then an impromptu football game was played . Mr. Topley reported the case to the Faculty , and Dean Murray turned the whole thing over to the Student Committee on Cheating and Hazing . A member of this committee said to-night that , although the offense was slight , the committee had decided to punish the leading participants , in order to stamp out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the offenders were suspended from college till Feb. 22 . The story that the freshmen were tied face downward in the mud , while the  --  sophs walked over them , is hooted at as the wild dream of some overzealous reporter . It is true , however , that a. freshman named Clark was hurt , but this Is said to have occurred in the rough and tumble of the mimic football game . The student sentiment is strongly in favor of the action of the committee , as every effort Is being made to reduce even guying to a minimum . The suspended students are Marshall Geer , Summit , N. J. ; Andrew Thompson , Albany , N. Y. ; Frederibk Rosengarten , Philadelphia ; M. K. Fuller , Scranton , Penn. ; S. K. Martin , Chicago , and S. Loose , Baltimore .
