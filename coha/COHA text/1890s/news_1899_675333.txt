He came to Peoria about three years ago from Cuba , where he had fought in the revolutionary army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that by bravery in the war he had risen to the rank of Captain . He spent nearly all his wages here in an effort to raise funds for his countrymen . He was instrumental in raising several thousands of dollars throughout the . State by means of fairs in the interest of the Cubans . It was at one of these fairs , where she presided over a booth , that Miss Mahoney first met Garcia .

His visits to Miss Mahoney were less frequent , but it is said that they saw each other clandestinely.
