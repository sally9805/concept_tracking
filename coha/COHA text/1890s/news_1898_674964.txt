txt In his capacity . as Chairman , of the Chickamauga Park Commission , Gen. H. V. Boynton has furnished the War Department with a copy of a retraction made by Major John C. Martin , Chief Surgeon , First Brigade , Second Division , First Corps , of certain statements reflecting upon the purity of the drinking water in the park . The Surgeon , In his testimony before the Sanger Board of Inquiry , attributed the large per cent . of typhoid fever in Camp Thomas to polluted surface wells and to the contamination of Chickamauga Creek above the uptake to the pipe system . Gen. Boynton says Col. Martin made these statements to him in public , cOupled with the statement that the military authorities were trying to suppress such information , and that the Chief Surgeon 's reports were not true . Gen. Boynton had the Surgeon promptly summoned before headquarters , where , after admitting that he must make his assertions good or retract them , he wrote : " Chickamauga Park , Sept. 16 , 1898 . " To the Assistant Adjutant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir : I desire to , and do , retract each and every word spoken and statement made by me to Gen. Boynton during a , private conversation held in the Read Hotel , in Chattanooga , Ga. , on the evening of July 14 , 1898 , believing it best for myself and for the interests of the public service . " JOHN C. MARTIN , " Major and Surgeon . " Gen. Boynton has also made a report to the Adjutant General at Camp . Thomas , giving certain observations in answer to the published report of the Sanger board , criticising the fitness of Chickamauga Park as a camp site . He expresses regret that various favorable opinions of regimental officers testifying to the healthfulness of the park and the wholesomeness of its water supply , were not referred to in the report of the board , which did not , also , allude to the only analysis of the water it possessed , one pronouncing it to be pure , made by the chemists of the Philadelphia Board of Health . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , the Park Board had every spring used by the troops analyzed , and all were shown to be pure . Gen. Boynton does not agree with the board 's report as to the garbage being " generally burned , " but ' shows that there was great laxity in this matter , which continued up to the time the troops guilty of this neglect left the camp . The park force of laborers is still gathering and burning garbage left by the troops . Gen. Boynton says further that in the camps of the Ninth Pennsylvania , Twelfth New York , Fifth Pennsylvania , and Twelfth Minnesota Regiments of Gen. Sanger 's Division , the sinks were very bad , and so near the tents in some cases that swarms of flies went back and forth from the tents to the kitchens , and in one case to the officers , mess . The dstance from the kitchens of the Eighth New York to the sinks of the men was thirty steps on one flank and fifty at the centre of the camp , and the sinks were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' quite sufficient to account for disease without condemning the water supply .
