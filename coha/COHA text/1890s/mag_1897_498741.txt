PLAY IN LONDON . THE GARDEN . WITH PICTURES BY JOSEPH PENNELL . PARTLY because James Thomson happened once to sing of London as ( ( the city of dreadful night , ) ) its name has become a synonym for gloom .

Saquis on the slack rope ascending to the stars , the hermit in the illuminated hermitage , the dark walks so favorable to lovers , the pots of stout , the dinners and suppers-in a word , the sort of combination of caf6 , music-hall , restaurant , and Fourth of July that nowhere else has been brought to such perfection ; that to Sir Roger had seemed , long before Thackeray 's day , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what everybody does not know so well is that London still has its garden , called by another name , to be sure , ignored by Murray and Baedeker , and offering another program , - Mine . Saquis and hermits gone from it apparently forevermore ,  --  but precisely the same in principle and practice . Vauxhall has vanished ; Cremorne sends up no more rockets skyward to fill the night with beauty ; the Crystal Palace is only for the suburb and the country cousin : but every summer Earl 's Court has its exhibition-an exhibition only by courtesy , only out of deference to the present fashion of gathering our knowledge , or pretending to , while we play . One year it was called Italian , and there were macaroni and Chianti in the restaurants , and a nice new pasteboard Forum . Another year it was German , and the air was heavy with the fragrance of Schnitzel and Wurst . Then it was American , for a change , and cow-boys and Red Indians swaggered across the scene , and soda-water and maple-sugar figured on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine Oriental flavor ; but by the time this is published it will be something else , and it really matters very little . The exhibition , attributed to any nation , would be as gay . Nobody cares , save , perhaps , a few tradesmen and mummers , who smell the commercial battle from afar . It is an open secret that the semblance of a show is there merely to court avoidance ; the years , in passing , have turned it into a big bazaar , but not even in this guise can it prove the chief attraction . No ; the great thing , the only thing that counts , is the garden , where one may walk under pleasant trees ; where one may ape the Continental , and drink tea or coffee at little tables ,  --  but mostly tea , in capacious pots ,  --  to the accompaniment of thick slabs of cake ; where one may be still more un-English , and eat one 's dinner outdoors-not like a wild beast in a cage , as in the old " box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low , broad veranda , where there are side-shows more diverting than Pepys ever dreamed of ; where one may loaf away the summer evening , listening to music which is at least as good as the honest Briton likes it . For the truth is , the garden furnishes just that form of amusement which Mr. Henry James has lamented was not to be found in London ; and so long as it is open one need not , as he thought , ( ( give up the idea of going to sit somewhere in the open air , to eat an ice and listen to a band of music . ) ) Only the amusement must be shared with so big a crowd that one will have to scramble for a chair , engage a dinner-table full twelve hours beforehand , A cAFfi. and struggle to get home by underground or bus as furiously as the mob fights to push into the pit of a popular theater .

Call the garden Vauxhall , or Cremorne , or Earl 's Court Exhibition , and it must still depend for its chief triumph upon the last feature in the day 's program . This it is which draws Kensington and Earl 's Court , just as the first blaze of a burning house collects the idlers of a town . But indeed I do not know where an illumination is better ordered , with at once greater splendor and greater restraint .

THE Presidential election was now approaching , and provisions were being carried out for receiving the ballots of the soldiers who came from those States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast their votes . General Grant had been consulted in regard to the propriety and practicability of permitting the soldiers to vote , and he had written a letter which contains such broad principles of statesmanship , and exhibits so much foresight as to the checks and restraints with which the matter should be guarded , and produced so profound an impression at the time , that it is given in full : CITY POINT , VA. , September 27 , 1864 . THE HON. E. M. STANTON , Secretary of War , Washington , D. C. The exercise of the right of suffrage by the officers and soldiers of armies in the field is a novel thing . It has , I believe , generally been considered dangerous to constitutional liberty and subversive of military discipline . But our circumstances are novel and exceptional . A very large proportion of the legal voters of the United States are now either under arms in the field , or in hospitals , or otherwise engaged in the military service of the United States . Most of these men are not regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less are they mercenaries who give their services to the government simply for its pay , having little understanding of political questions , or feeling little or no interest in them . On the contrary , they are American citizens , having still their homes and social and political ties binding them to the States and districts from which they come and to which they expect to return . They have left their homes temporarily , to sustain the cause of their country in the hour of its trial . In performing this sacred duty , they should not be deprived of a most precious privilege . They have as much right to demand that their votes shall he counted in the choice of their rulers as those citizens who remain at home-nay , more ; for they have sacrificed more for their country . I state these reasons in full , for the unusual thing of allowing armies in the field to vote , that I may urge , on the other hand , that nothing more than the fullest exercise of this right should be allowed ; for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to the liberties of the country . VOL . LIV. - 45 . The officers and soldiers have every means of understanding the questions before the country . The newspapers are freely circulated , and so , I believe , are the documents prepared by both parties to set forth the merits and claims of their candidates . Beyond this , nothing whatever should be allowed-no political meetings , no harangues from soldiers or citizens , and no canvassing of camps or regiments for votes . I see not why a single individual not belonging to the armies should be admitted into their lines to deliver tickets . In my opinion , the tickets should be furnished by the chief provost-marshal of each army , by them to the provost-marshal ( or some other appointed officer ) of each brigade or regiment , who shall , on the day of election , deliver tickets , irrespective of party , to whoever may call for them . If , however , it shall be deemed expedient to admit citizens to deliver tickets , then it should be most positively prohibited that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anyway . Their business should be , and only be , to distribute on a certain fixed day tickets to whoever may call for them . In the cases of those States whose soldiers vote by proxy , proper State authority could be given to officers belonging to regiments so voting to receive and forward votes . As it is intended that all soldiers entitled to vote shall exercise that privilege according to their own convictions of right , unmolested and unrestricted , there will be no objection to each party sending to armies easy of access a number of respectable gentlemen to see that these views are fully carried out . To the army at Atlanta , and those armies on the sea-coast from New Berne to New Orleans , not to exceed three citizens of each party should be admitted . * . S. GuANT , Lieutenant-General . LINCOLN 'S SECOND ELECTION . FOURTEEN of the loyal States authorized their troops in the field to vote . General Grant felt that he was simply a soldier , and he took no active part in the political campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ardently desired the triumph of the party which was in favor of vigorously prosecuting the war to a successful termination . He had been exceedingly annoyed by the fact that the Missouri State Convention had instructed its delegates to the National Convention which nominated Lincoln to ( ( cast 353 // their twenty-two votes for Ulysses S. Grant , * and exerted what influence he could not to have his name mentioned in any way in the convention ; but as the delegates had received instructions , they felt that they could not disobey them . The Hon. John F. Hume , chairman of the Missouri delegation , therefore cast the votes of his State for General Grant ; but before the result of the ballot was announced he changed them to Mr. Lincoln . General Grant did not have an opportunity to vote at the election , as his State ( Illinois ) had made no provision for allowing her soldiers at the front to cast their ballots . On the 8th of November the Presidential election took place . The voting passed off very quietly in the camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candidates , and perhaps no election had ever been conducted with greater fairness . The soldiers ' vote in favor of Lincoln over McClellan was in the proportion of more than three to one . General Grant strolled through some of the neighboring camps while the voting was going on , and watched with interest how quietly and effectively the system for depositingthe ballots worked . On the 10th of November enough was known at headquarters to make it plain that Lincoln was elected . That night Grant telegraphed to Halleck : * . Congratulate the President for me for the double victory . The election having passed off quietly , no bloodshed or riot throughout the land , is a victory worth more to the country than a battle won . . . General Grant had a marked aversion to interfering in any matters which pertained to the civil administration of the government . He had contented himself with sending to points in the North such troops as were really necessary as precautionary steps , and had left it entirely to the War Department to carry out measures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and breaking up the bands of conspirators who were plotting against the government . GRANT VISITS NEW YORK . CONSIDERING the positions of the armies of Sherman and Thomas , General Grant was still anxious that Lee should send no troops to the West ; and he determined to watch him closely , but not to make any move which might have the effect of inducing him to evacuate Richmond and Petersburg . As the apprehension throughout the North had been allayed , and as there were no operations in contemplation in Virginia , General Grant started on the 17th of November , and made a short trip to Burlington , New Jersey , to see his children , who had been placed at school there , and his wife , who was with them . There went with the party an expert telegraph operator , familiar with the cipher used in official despatches , who was used in keeping up telegraphic communication with the front . On November 19 news was received at headquarters , through Confederate sources , that Lee had recalled Early 's command from the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He telegraphed at once to Sheridan , mentioning this news , and saying that if he was satisfied that it was so , to send Wright 's corps to City Point without delay , and move with his cavalry to cut the Virginia Central Railroad . There was destined to be no respite for the general-in-chief . Even while snatching a couple of days ' rest in the quiet of his little family , he was still called on to direct important movements in the field . Finding that there was no immediate need of his presence at the front , he decided to run over to New York for a couple of days . He had promised Mrs. Grant to go there on a shopping expedition , and he also felt some curiosity to take a look at the city , as he had not seen it since he was graduated from the Military Academy , twenty-one years before . He went with Mrs. Grant to the Astor House , quietly and unannounced , being particularly desirous of avoiding any public demonstrations . He did not realize , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create . The news spread rapidly throughout the city , and the greatest eagerness was manifested on the part of the people to get a sight of the famous commander . The foremost citizens presented themselves at the hotel to pay their respects to him , and enthusiastic crowds filled the streets and stood for hours gazing at the windows of his rooms , in the hope of catching a glimpse of him . Entertainments of every kind were tendered him , and invitations poured in from every quarter . He received many prominent citizens in his rooms , and had a great many interesting talks with them ; but the invitations to entertainments were declined , and all public demonstrations avoided as much as possible . The next morning after his arrival the general strolled out into the streets with a former staff-officer then living in New York , and being in plain citizen 's clothes , was for some time unobserved ; but finally his features , which had been made known by means of the portraits everywhere displayed , // were r6cognized , and finding a crowd surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , finding no vacant seat , asked the conductor to have the people sit closer together and make room for General Grant . The conductor put on a broad grin , and quietly winked one eye , as much as to say , ( ( You ca n't fool me with such a cockand-bull story as that ) ) ; and the general quietly took hold of a strap , and rode throughout the trip standing with a number of others who had crowded into the car . A PHILADELPHIA OVATION TO GRANT . AFTER remaining two days in the city , seeing what little he could in that time of the vast improvements which had taken place since he was last there , he started for Washington , but on the way decided to remain over a day in Philadelphia . After he had spent a little while at the Continental Hotel , he attempted to take a walk down Chestnut street ; but his features had become as familiar to the people of the Quaker City as to the New-Yorkers , and he was promptly recognized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . Soon the people rushed out in crowds from the stores on both sides of the way , and curiosity was on tiptoe to see him . First those near by took off their hats to him then they crowded up to shake hands ; then applause was started along the sidewalks , and soon cheer after cheer arose . He was now near Independence Hall , and the crowd , in its good nature and enthusiasm , pressed upon him so vigorously that he was compelled to take refuge in the building . His presence was now announced to the mayor , who set to work hurriedly to improvise a reception . The news of the commander 's presence had spread in the meantime like wild-fire , and a dense mass of people had crowded into the hall . In their eagerness to shake hands with him , they soon lost all restraint , and many were in danger of being injured in the crush . His friends now induced him to consent to an act which his enemies had never succeeded in compelling him to perform  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall by a private exit , placed in a carriage , and the coachman was directed to drive rapidly back to the hotel . In this flank movement , however , the general did not meet with the success which had crowned his efforts in the field . The admiring crowd of people soon discovered his change of base , and those in front , being pressed on by those in rear , surged up against the carriage , checking its movement , breaking some of the windows , and nearly toppling it over . Never had there been a greater necessity for the prayer , ( ( Save me from my friends ! ) ) Finally , however , the hotel was safely reached . The general treated the matter throughout with his accustomed good nature and his usual calmness . In the entire mass of people he was perhaps the only one unexcited and unruffled . The only feeling he exhibited was one of intense surprise that he should attract so much attention . GRANT AND LINCOLN IN CONFERENCE . HE then proceeded to Washington , and on November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had extended interviews with them . One object in his going to Washington was to make a determined effort to obtain promotion for his officers who had made themselves conspicuous for their gallantry and efficiency in the field . In order to create the necessary vacancies , he recommended that the inefficient general officers be mustered out of service , and gave a list of eight major-generals and thirty-three brigadiers whose services the government could dispense with to advantage . In the matter of relieving these useless officers the general was entirely impartial , as the list contained a number of his warm personal friends . The President said to him : ( ( Why , I find that lots of the officers on this list are very close friends of yours ; do you want them all dropped ? ) ) The general replied : ( ( That s very true , Mr. President ; but my personal friends are not always good generals , and I think it but just to adhere to my recommendation . ) ) The Secretary of War had impaired his health by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary conduct had created an opposition to himself in many quarters , and there were rumors at this time that he might retire from his position . This subject was brought up by the President in his conversation with the general-in-chief , and he was considerate enough to say that in case such a change should occur , he would not appoint another secretary without giving the general an opportunity to express his views as to the selection . General Grant took occasion to say to Mr. Lincoln at this interview : " I doubt very much whether you could select as efficient a Secretary of War as the present incumbent . He is not only a man of untiring energy and devotion to duty , but even his worst enemies never for a moment doubt his personal integrity and the purity of his mo // tives ; and it tends largely to reconcile the people to the heavy taxes they are paying when they feel an absolute certainty that the chief of the department which is giving out contracts for countless millions of dollars is a person of scrupulous honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling much gratified with his visit to Washington , and well satisfied with what he had accomplished while there . General Hancock was suffering so intensely from his wounds that he was given a leave of absence for twenty days , it being hoped that at the end ofthattime he mightbe better ; but he was unable to return , and General A. A. Humphreys thereafter commanded the 2d Corps . His assignment was dated November 25 . He was a most accomplished officer , and by his talents and his personal gallantry had already won great distinction . His appointment was recognized as eminently fitting , and met with favor throughout the entire army . GRANT 'S WINTER QUARTERS AT CITY POINT . THE camp at City Point had now given place to winter *juarters ; for in view of the character of the campaigns that were to be conducted by our armies in the West and South , it was decided to make no immediate attempt to dislodge Lee 's army from Petersburg and Richmond , and preparations were made by the general-in-chief to pass the winter months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn , had become very uncomfortable as the cold weather set in ; and they were removed , and log huts were erected in their stead . Each hut contained space enough for bunks for two officers , and had a small door in front ; a window on each side , and an open fireplace at the rear end . General Grant 's hut was as plain as the others , and was constructed with a sitting-room in front , and a small apartment used as a bedroom in rear , with a communicating door between them . An iron camp-bed , an iron wash-stand , a couple of pine tables , and a few common wooden chairs constituted the furniture . The floor was entirely bare . There were many comments in the newspapers about this time upon the preparations for winter quarters . One comic paper had a picture of the general 's hut , with smoke curling out of the chimney , and under it the words : ( ( Grant fought it out on this line , though it took him all summer , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause gave the establishment of winter quarters as a proof that the oldest inhabitant would not be likely to live long enough to see Grant enter Richmond . Some of the jocose remarks referring to this subject displayed no little wit , and many of them were a source of considerable amusement to the general and those about him . INGALLS 'S SPOTTED DOG . GENERAL INGALLS had just returned from a trip to Washington , and brought with him an English spotted coach-dog , which followed him everywhere through camp , and attracted no end of attention . A dog of any kind was rather an unusual sight in an army in the field , and an animal of the peculiar marks and aristocratic bearing of Ingalls 's companion excited wide-spread remark . Every time the dog came to headquarters , General Grant was certain to comment upon the animal , and perpetrate some good-natured joke at the expense of his classmate . The dog followed the usual canine custom , and expressed his feelings by an agitation of his caudal appendage . To describe his actions astronomically , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tail a series of longitudinalvibrations , and pleasure bygiving it a gentle ( ( motion in azimuth * - familiarly known as a wag . One evening , as the general was sitting in front of his quarters , Ingalls came up to have a chat with him , and was followed by the dog , which sat down in the usual place at its master 's feet . The animal squatted upon its hind quarters , licked its chops , pricked up its ears , and looked first at one officer and then at the other , as if to say : " I am General Ingalls 's dog ; whose pup are you ? ) ) In the course of his remarks General Grant took a look at the animal , and said : ( ( Well , Ingalls , what are your real intentions in regard to that dog ? Do you expect to take it into Richmond with you ? ) ) Ingalls , who was noted for his dry humor , replied with mock seriousness and an air of extreme patience : " I hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ) This retort , coupled with the comical attitude of the dog at the time , turned the laugh upon the general , who joined heartily in the merriment , and seemed to enjoy the joke as much as any of the party . GRANT 'S INTERCOURSE WITH HIS ASSOCIATES . WHILE the general 's manners were simple and unconstrained , and his conversation with his staff was of the most sociable nature , yet he always maintained a dignity of demeanor which set bounds to any undue familiarity on the part of those who held intercourse with him . However close they were to him in their relations , there was never any obtrusive intimacy . He always addressed his chief of // staff as *Rawlins , * General Sherman as ( ( Sherman , ) ) and usually called his cavalry leader ( ( Sheridan ) ) ; but in addressing Meade and nearly all the other commanders he invariably employed the title ( ( general . ) ) Sherman always called the general-in-chief ( ( Grant ) ) in public and private conversation . Ingalls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when others were present they gave him his military title . All other officers in the service addressed him invariably as ( ( general . ) ) In conversation with his personal aides , who had served intimately with him , he would call them sometimes by their last names , and at other times by their military titles . He was scrupulously careful under all circumstances not to neglect the little courtesies which are the stamp of genuine politeness . When a general officer came to his headquarters , the general-in-chief always rose to receive him , shook hands , and invited him to sit down . If smoking at the time , he offered the visitor a cigar , and if it was near the hour for a meal , invited him to be a guest at the mess . He never made any remarks in criticism of a person who had called on him after the visitor had left , and by his manner always showed an objection to hearing others talk about people behind their backs . He never had the slightest fondness for gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in the presence of others , while he did not openly rebuke the offender , he always managed in some way to make it evident that the practice was distasteful to him . Usually when any one came close to him and started to communicate with him in a whisper before company , he drew slightly back , and at once began to reply in a loud tone of voice , which was a sufficient indication that he regarded the whispering as an impoliteness . If there was really any reason for a confidential interview , he would proceed to his back room and hold it there . His conduct was particularly courteous in the presence of ladies , and he never neglected those little attentions to their sex which constitute true politeness . If he were reclining on a bench or sitting in a lounging attitude in a chair after a fatiguing day , when any lady approached , whether a visitor or a person of his own household , he would at once assume a more deferential position , and show her every possible courtesy . CORRESPONDENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time in the movements of Sherman and Thomas . Sherman was marching rapidly into the interior of Georgia , cut off from all communication . The general , in speaking of the movement one evening , said : ( ( Sherman 's army is now somewhat in the condition of a ground-mole when he disappears under a lawn . You can here and there trace his track , but you are not quite certain where he will come out till you see his head . ) ) Hood had abandoned Georgia to Sherman , and was moving north with his whole force against Thomas . His army now consisted of about 45,000 men . Schofield , who , under Thomas 's orders , was in advance watching Hood 's movements and endeavoring to delay him , had less than 25,000 troops . On November 80 Hood closed up on Schofield and attacked him . This brought on the desperate battle of Franklin , and the fighting continued until long after nightfall . The enemy was handsomely repulsed , with a loss of over 6000 men , while Schofield lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reason of Sherman 's capturing Millen , Georgia , at the same time that Schofield was achieving his signal victory in Tennessee . The night of the battle of Franklin , Thomas was reinforced at Nashville by two divisions from Missouri , and the next day by two divisions of his own troops that he had brought in from the front . The day after the battle of Franklin ( December 1 ) , General Thomas reported that he bad retired to the fortifications around Nashville until he could get his cavalry equipped , which was then outnumbered by that of the enemy four to one , adding that if Hood attacked that position he would be seriously damaged , and if he made no attack until our cavalry could be equipped , he or Schofield would move against him at once . General Grant telegraphed Thomas on December 2 : ( ( If Hood is permitted to remain quietly about Nashville , you will lose all the road back to Chattanooga , and possibly have to abandon the line of the Tennessee . Should he attack you , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should attack him before he fortifies . Arm and put in the trenches your quartermaster 's employees , citizens , etc . ) ) Nashville was a large military depot where there were nearly 10,000 employees , mainly quartermaster 's men . The same day the Secretary of War telegraphed Grant : ( ( The President feels solicitous about the disposition of General Tbomas to lay in fortifications for an indefinite period ( until Wilson gets equipments . ) This looks like the McClellan and Rosecrans strategy of do nothing and let the rebels raid the country . // The President wishes you to consider the matter . ) ) That afternoonthe general sent a second despatch to General Thomas , urging him to dispose of Hood as speedily as possible , and if he got him to retreating to give him no peace . General Thomas replied at some length , stating his weak condition , and recalling the fact that his command was made up of Sherman 's two weakest corps and all his dismounted cavalry except one brigade ; and he also called his attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that his cavalry was still outnumbered four to one , but that he had just received reinforcements of infantry , and now had infantry enough , though not sufficient cavalry , to assume the offensive , but that he expected more cavalry , and in a few days more should be able to give Hood another fight . General Grant 's instructions had been put in the form of suggestions thus far , as he was reluctant to give positive orders . He entertained a high regard for General Thomas personally , and the greatest respect for his military capacity . Thomas was a cdnspicuous representative of the loyal Virginians . At the breaking out of the war he had shown great strength of character and determination of purpose in deciding to remain loyal to the country which had educated him as a soldier , and to defend the flag which he had sworn to uphold . No one had displayed greater devotion to the cause , and few officers in the service stood higher in the affection of their associates or in the confidence of their superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single army , looked naturally to the means of securing the largest measure of success in his immediate front , and it was not likely that he would regard time as of so much importance as the general-in-chief of all the armies . With Grant , the movements of Thomas 's army were a part of a series of coöperative campaigns , and unnecessary delays in the movements of any one army might seriously affect contemplated operations on the part of the others . Canby was expected to send a force into the interior , but he could not do so until Thomas had assumed the offensive against Hood ; and he was compelled to postpone his expedition , and to hold Vicksburg and Memphis , and patrol the Mississippi to try to prevent troops from crossing from the Trans-Mississippi Department to relieve Hood . On December 3 General Thomas described the situation further , and closed by saying that he would feel able to march against Hood in less than a week . The seat of war in the West had been transferred from Atlanta as far north as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cross the Cumberland River , move into Kentucky , and cut Thomas 's railroad communications , and that the theater of operations in that region might be transferred even to the Ohio River , the disastrous moral effect of which would be beyond calculation . General Thomas telegraphed , December 6 , that he thought he ought to have 6000 cavalry mounted before attacking Hood , and hoped to have such a mounted force in three days . General Grant 's anxiety was increased by the fact that he realized that the inclement season was at hand , and feared that the winter storms might appear at any time and prove unfavorable for attack . Thomas had concentrated the forces in his department , troops had been hurried forward from Missouri , and the cavalry was being remounted by General James H. Wilson with unparalleled energy . PLANNING THE FIRST FORT FISHER EXPEDITION . DECISIONS of the utmost importance had to be made at this time in regard to movements on foot in other directions . The enemy was found to be making desperate efforts to collect troops to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest consternation in the State of Georgia . News received from prisoners and spies , as well as from Southern newspapers , all confirmed the rumor that Sherman was destroying large quantities of supplies essential to the enemy , and striking terror at all points on his line of march . The governors of five Southern States were sending their reserves to confront Sherman , and the garrison of Fort Fisher , near Wilmington , North Carolina , was largely reduced for the same purpose . The latter news now made the general-in-chief anxious to start the expedition which he had in contemplation against Wilmington . This port had become the principal resort for vessels running the blockade , and was of incalculable importance to the enemy on account of the supplies received from foreign countries . A large fleet of naval vessels had been put under the command of Admiral Porter , and a force of 6500 men of Butler 's army was held in readiness to be placed upon transports and sent to the mouth of the Cape Fear River , under the command of General Weitzel , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable earthwork which constituted the main defense of // the mouth of the Cape Fear River and the city of Wilmington . General Butler , who was always prolific in ideas , made an original suggestion in regard to this expedition , which he believed would accomplish immensely important results . His proposition was to load a vessel with powder , tow it up as near as possible to Fort Fisher , and explode it , in the hope of shaking up the fort so seriously that its parapet would be sufficiently injured greatly to weaken its defense . Admiral Porter and other naval authorities seemed to favor the project , and General Grant finally agreed to let the experiment be tried , although his own judgment was decidedly against it . He said , in speaking of it : ( ( Whether the report will be sufficient even to wake up the garrison in the fort , if they happen to be asleep at the time of the explosion , I do not know . It is at least foolish to think that the effect of the explosion could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fort . However , they can use an old boat which is not of much value , and we have plenty of damaged powder which is unserviceable for aziy other purpose , so that the experiment will not cost much , at any rate. * Mr. Lincoln , in assenting to it , said facetiously : ( ( We might as well explode the notion with powder as with anything else . ) ) On December 3 General Grant wrote Sherman a letter , which he sent down the coast , to be delivered as soon as the Western commander reached the sea in the vicinity of Savannah , in which he said : ( ( Bragg has gone from Wilmington . I am trying to take advantage of his absence to get possession of that place . Owing to some preparations that Admiral Porter and General Butler are making to blow up Fort Fisher , and which , while I hope for the best , I do not believe a particle in , there is a delay in getting the expedition off . . . As Thomas 's army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grant was much disturbed at the delay in striking Hood ; and his anxiety had become so great that at 4 P. M. on December 6 he telegraphed Thomas : ( ( Attack Hood at once , and wait no longer for a remount of your cavalry . There is great danger of delay resulting in a campaign back to the Ohio River . ) ) Thomas replied at 9 o'clock that night : .... . I will make the necessary dispositions , and attack Hood at once , agreeably to your order , though I believe it will be hazardous with the small force of cavalrynowat myservice. * News had been received that Hood was moving a force toward Harpeth Shoals on the Cumberland . That night Weitzel 's troops embarked for the Fort Fisher expedition . Butler came over to headquarters , and announced his purpose of accompanying the expedition . This was the first intimation the general had that Butler was ambitious to go in person with the troops , as it was not the intention that he should command . Grant had selected in Weitzel an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a delicate undertaking . However , it would have been , under the circumstances , a mortal affront to prevent the commander of the troops and of the department in which they were operating from accompanying them ; and the alternative was presented to General Grant 's mind of either letting Butler go on the expedition or relieving him from duty altogether . Butler set great store upon the explosion of the powder-boat , and had counted upon being present at the attack ; and finally the general-in-chief , rather than wound his feelings at such a crisis , did not order him to remain behind . He felt that Weitzel would have immediate command of the attacking party . General Grant now wrote instructions to Sherman directing him to move his army by sea to Richmond , it appearing to him , under all the circumstances at that time , that it would be the means of dealing a death-blow to the Confederacy , and prove the quickest method of bringing the war to a close . GRANT 'S AVERSION TO LIARS . LATE that night the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two others , were sitting by the camp-fire . The general was seated on a rustic bench as usual , and was wrapped in his blue overcoat . He loved the open air , and nothing but a rain-storm could drive him into his hut . Some camp rumors had just been received which bore on their face the assurance that they were manufactured out of whole cloth . The discussion which ensued led the general to relate a story which was particularly well told . He said : ( ( There was a man at the same post with me who had such a propensity for lying that his example taught every one a lesson as to the evil and absurdity of the practice . He seemed to believe that a lie told with particularity was more convincing than a general truth ; but he frequently tripped himself up on account of his bad memory , for in order to be a successful liar a man ought to have a good memory . One day there were some strangers invited to . dinner , and the champion was urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his statements as possible , so as not to mortify the company more than was necessary . This he promised , and evidently in good faith ; for he asked an officer to touch his foot under the table if he told anything that might to unimaginative persons appear to be an exaggeration . Before the soup was finished , however , he began to indulge in his Munchausenisms . A person at the table mentioned the existing tendency to build hotels larger and larger every year . The champion joined in the conversation by saying : ( But it s not a new thing , after all . As long ago as when I was a mere boy , my father built a bigger hotel in our place than anybody has ever attempted since . ) ( About how big was it asked one of the strangers . ( Why , ) was the answer , ( it was two hundred and ninety-six feet high , five hundred and eighty feet long , and- ) here the officer kicked his foot under the table , and he continued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half wide . ) ) ) After the laughter which followed this story had ceased , the general arose from his seat , threw away the stump of his cigar , and said : ( ( Well , I think I 11 turn in . Good night , ) ) and retired to his sleeping-apartment . After he had gone , Rawlins remarked : ( ( The general always likes to tell an anecdote that points a moral on the subject of lying . He hates only two kinds of people , liars and cowards . He has no patience with them , and never fails to show his aversion for them . ) ) Ingalls added : " Such traits are so foreign to his own nature that it is not surprising that he should not tolerate them in others . As man and boy he has always been the most absolutely truthful person in the whole range of my acquaintance . I never knew him to run into the slightest exaggeration or to borrow in the least degree from his imagination in relating an occurrence . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused one day to hear an officer say that the general was ( tediously truthful . ) He explained that what he meant by that was that the general , in mentioning something that had taken place , would direct his mind so earnestly to stating unimportant details with entire accuracy that he would mar the interest of the story . For instance , after returning from a walk around camp he would say : ( I was told so and so about the wounded by Dr. while we were talking this morning inside of his tent ; and a halfhour afterward he would take the trouble to come back and say , as if it were a matter of the greatest importance : ( I was mistaken when I told you that my conversation with Dr. occurred inside his tent ; that was not correct : it took place while we were standing in front of his tent . ) ) ) There was much truth in this comment . No one who had served any time with the general could fail to be struck with his excellent memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive accuracy , even in the most unimportant particulars . When he became President , an usher brought him a card one day while he was in a private room writing a message to Congress . ( ( Shall I tell the gentleman you are not in ? ) ) asked the usher . ( ( No , ) ) answered the President ; **you will say nothing of the kind . I do n't lie myself , and I wo n't have any one lie for me. * REMINISCENCES OF GRANT 'S CADET LIFE . A STAFF-OFFICER inquired of Ingalls whether General Grant , when at West Point , gave any promise of his future greatness . Ingalls replied : ( ( Grant was such a quiet , unassuming fellow when a cadet that nobody would have picked him out as one who was destined to occupy a conspicuous place in history ; and yet he had certain qualities which attracted attention and commanded the respect of all those in the corps with him . He was always frank , generous , and manly . At cavalry drill he excelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great delight in mounting and breaking in the most intractable of the new horses that were purchased from time to time and put in the squad . He succeeded in this , not by punishing the animal he had taken in hand , but by patience and tact , and his skill in making the creature know what he wanted to have it do . He was a particularly daring jumper . In jumping hurdles , when Grant 's turn came the soldiers in attendance would , at an indication from him , raise the top bar a foot or so higher than usual , and he would generally manage to clear it . In his studies he was lazy and careless . Instead of studying a lesson , he would merely read it over once or twice ; but he was so quick in his perceptions that he usually made very fair recitations even with so little preparation . His memory was not at all good in an attempt to learn anything by heart accurately , and this made his grade low in those branches of study which required a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very bright , and if he had labored hard he would have stood very high in them . Our class had sixty members the first year , but eight failed to pass the examinations , and the number was reduced to fifty-two . The second year 's // course had in it the hardest mathematics ; Grant 's grade in that branch was number ten . The next year he stood fifteen in natural philosophy , which stumped so many of us , and in the graduating year he was sixteen in engineering , the principal study in the first-class course . He was rather slouchy and unmilitary at infantry drills , and received about the average number of demerits . The principal reputation he gained among his fellow-cadets was for common sense , good judgment , entire unselfishness , and absolute fairness in everything he did . When we would get into an excited dispute over any subject , it was a very common thing to say , ( Well , suppose we see what Sam Grant has to say about it , and leave it to his decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam from his initials , and this was often shortened into ( Sam . ) As I said , while he was not by any means conspicuous in the class , and never sought to be , he had enough marked characteristics to prevent him from being considered commonplace , and every one associated with him was sure to remember him and*retain a high regard for him . ) ) GRANT ORDERS THOMAS TO MOVE AGAINST HOOD . THE anxiety of the authorities at Washington had now become so intense regarding Thomas 's delay that Grant became more anxious than ever to have prompt action taken in Tennessee . On the morning of December 7 , Stanton sent a despatch to City Point , saying : " . . . Thomas seems unwilling to attack , because it is hazardous-as if all war was anything but hazardous . . . . * The government was throwing the entire responsibility upon General Grant , and really censuring him in its criticisms of Thomas . Grant telegraphed to Washington : ( ( There is no better man to repel an attack than Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initiative . ) ) On the 8th he sent a long despatch to General Thomas , urging him strenuously to attack , picturing the consequences which might follow longer delay , and appealing to his pride and patriotism . He wound up by saying : ( ( Now is one of the finest opportunities ever presented of destroying one of the three armies of the enemy . If destroyed , he can never replace it . Use the means at your command , and you can do this , and cause a rejoicing that will resound from one end of the land to another . ) ) The next morning Halleck , too , telegraphed Thomas , urging him to wait no longer , and saying that if he delayed till all the cavalry was mounted he would wait till doomsday , as the waste was equaling the supply . On the 8th Grant learned that there was still no certainty as to when an attack would be made ; and he telegraphed to Halleck , though with much reluctance , saying that if Thomas had not struck yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schofield . To this Halleck replied : ( ( If you wish General Thomas relieved , give the order . No one here will , I think , interfere . The responsibility , however , will be yours , as no 9ne here , so far as I am informed , wishes General Thomas 's removal . ) ) Grant replied to Halleck that he would not ask to have Thomas relieved until he heard further from him . While the authorities at Washington were prodding Grant , demanding of him an immediate and vigorous movement in Tennessee , and shaping a correspondence which would have thrown all the blame on him if Hood had passed around Thomas and moved north , yet when severe measures were to be taken General Grant was promptly informed that he must assume all responsibility for any seemingly harsh treatment . He was , however , the last man to be timid about shouldering responsibilities , however disagreeable , and he was not acting upon the goadings received from Washington , but upon his own military judgment . On December 9 , at 1 P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( ( Your despatch of 8:30 P. M. of the 8th is just received . I had nearly completed my preparations to attack the enemy to-morrow morning , but a terrible storm of freezing rain has come on to-day , which will make it impossible for our men to fight to any advantage . I am therefore compelled to wait for the storm to break , and make the attack immediately after . Admiral Lee is patrolling the river above and below the city , and , I believe , will be able to prevent the enemy from crossing . There is no doubt but that Hood 's forces are considerably scattered along the river , with the view of attempting a crossing ; but it has been impossible for me to organize and equip the troops for an attack at an earlier time . Major-General Halleck informs me that you are very much dissatisfied with my delay in attacking . I can only say I have done all in my power to prepare , and if you should deem it necessary to relieve me I shall submit without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thomas 's character , and his unselfishness and devotion to duty , than the words of this despatch . It was dignified in tone , and entirely subordinate in spirit . While the gen // eral fully appreciated the manly character of the despatch , it was nevertheless a grievous disappointment to him . He had felt that in war delays are always dangerous , and there is no telling what adverse circumstances may occur meanwhile . His worst apprehensions were now realized . The season was far into the winter , and a freezing storm had set in , which might prove a serious disadvantage to General Thomas 's army . Rumors were abroad that Hood confidently expected reinforcements from the Trans-Mississippi Department , and these might now reach him before the coming battle . General Grant replied to General Thomas , at 7:30 P. M. that day : " I have as much confidence in your conducting a battle rightly as I have in any other officer ; but it has seemed to me that you have been slow , and I have had no explanation of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. M. from General Halleck before I did the one to me , I telegraphed to suspend the order relieving you until we should hear further . I hope most sincerely that there will be no necessity of repeating the order , ana that the facts will show that you have been right all the time . ) ) Notwithstanding the radical difference in judgment between the general and his distinguished subordinate , he was willing to give every reasonable consideration to his views , and even to express the hope that events might prove that he was wrong and Thomas right . That night Thomas telegraphed to both Grant and Halleck , explaining his condition , and saying that the storm continued . Still no attack was made , and General Grant curbed his impatience , and hoped to hear from hour to hour that his orders would be obeyed without further urging . He forbore from further suggestions until 4 P. M. on the 11th , when he telegraphed Thomas the following : ( ( If you delay attack longer , the mortifying spectacle will be witnessed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be forced to act , accepting such weather as you find . Let there be no further delay . Hood can not stand even a drawn battle so far from his supplies of ordnance stores . If he retreats , and you follow , he must lose his material and much of his army . I am in hopes of receiving a despatch from you today announcing that you have moved . Delay no longer for weather or reinforcements . ) ) To add to General Grant 's discomfort , Butler 's expedition had not yet got off from Fort Monroe for Fort Fisher . This gave the general-in-chief anxiety for the reason that news was received this day , from the Richmond papers of the day before , that Sherman 's advance was within twenty-five miles of Savannah , and that he was approaching at the rate of about eighteen miles a day . Grant felt that if the enemy were driven from Savannah , troops would be sent back to Fort Fisher , and that garrison strengthened sufficiently to make the success of any assault upon it doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance of surprise . He therefore telegraphed Butler , urging him to start immediately . The only good news received at headquarters upon this important day was the information that a movement made by Warren had been successful . He had destroyed the Weldon Railroad from Nottoway River to Hicksford , with but little loss , and his troops were now on their return to the Army of the Potomac . Grant promptly telegraphed the situation to Sheridan , and impressed upon him the importance of destroying the roads north of Richmond , in furtherance of the plan of cutting off the supplies of that city . The next morning a reply came from Thomas to General Grant 's last despatch , saying that he would obey the orders as promptly as possible , but the country was covered with a sheet of ice and sleet , and the attack would be made under every disadvantage . About four hours afterward he telegraphed again that the condition of the country was no better , and it was impossible for cavalry , or even infantry , to move in anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in a useless sacrifice of life . Another day of anxiety passed , and another telegram came , saying there was no change in the weather . At 12:30 P. M. on the 14th Halleck telegraphed Thomas from Washington , reiterating that it was felt that every delay on his part seriously interfered with the general plans . The past week had been the most anxious period of Grant 's entire military career , and he suffered mental torture . On the one hand , he felt that he was submitting to delays which might seriously interfere with his general plans ; that he was placed in an attitude in which he was virtually incapable of having his most positive orders carried out ; and that he was occupying a position of almost insubordination to the authorities at Washington . On the other hand , he realized that nothing but the most extreme case imaginable should lead him to do even a seeming injustice to a distinguished and capable commander by relieving him when he was on the eve of a decided victory ; for // his military instincts convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas moved , and he wished that loyal and devoted army commander to reap all the laurels of such a triumph . However , there was yet no time named for the attack , and Grant felt himself compelled to take some further steps . General John A. Logan happened to be at this time on a visit to headquarters at City Point . Logan had served under General Grant in the West , and held a high place in his estimation as a vigorous fighter . The general talked over the situation with Logan , and finally directed him to start at once for Nashville , with a view to putting him in command of the operations there , provided , upon his arrival , it was still found that no attack had been made . He gave him the requisite order in writing , to be used if necessary ; and told him to say nothing about it , but to telegraph his arrival at Nashville , and if it was found that Thomas had already moved , not to deliver it or act upon it . Logan started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and General Grant , being still more exercised in mind over the situation , determined to carry out a design which he had had in view for several days  --  to proceed to Nashville and take command there in person . The only thing which had prevented him from doing this earlier was the feeling which always dominated him in similar cases , and made him shrink from having even the appearance of receiving the credit of a victory the honor of which he preferred to have fall upon a subordinate . He now thought that his taking command in person would avoid the necessity of relieving Thomas , and be much less offensive to that officer than superseding him by some one else . THOMAS CRUSHES HOOD . GENERAL GRANT therefore started for Washington that night , the 14th . When he arrived there the next evening , as soon as the steamboat touched the wharf a despatch of the night before was shown him from Thomas to Halleck , saying that the enemy would be attacked in the morning ; and also a telegram of the 15th from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , announcing that Thomas had attacked the enemy early that morning , driving him back at all points . This was an incalculable relief to the general , and lifted a heavy load from his mind . He at once telegraphed Thomas : *I was just on my way to Nashville , but receiving a despatch from Van Du zer detailing your splendid success of today , I shall go no farther . Push the enemy now , and give him no rest until he is entirely destroyed . Your army will cheerfully suffer many privations to break up Hood 's army and render it useless for future operations . Do not stop for trains or supplies , but take them from the country , as the enemy has done . Much is now expected . ) ) The general had scarcely arrived at his hotel when a despatch came in from Thomas , saying : " I attacked the enemy 's left this morning and drove it from the river , below the city , very nearly to the Franklin Pike , distance about eight miles . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thomas , dated midnight , as follows : ( ( Your despatch of this evening just received . I congratulate you and the army under your command for to-day 's operations , and feel a conviction that to-morrow will add more fruits to your victory . ) ) Mr. Lincoln , on hearing the news , telegraphed Thomas : ( ( You have made a magnificent beginning . A grand consummation is within your easy reach . Do not let it slip. * Logan had proceeded as far as Louisville when he heard the news of Thomas 's first day 's fight . Grant received a telegram from him there , saying : ( ( People here jubilant over Thomas 's success . Confidence seems to be restored . . . . All things going right . It would seem best that I return to join my command with Sherman. * The general sent him a reply , saying : ( ( The news from Thomas so far is in the highest degree gratifying . You need not go farther . ) ) General Grant was now a much happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the victory , but because it had at last come in time to spare him from resorting to extreme measures regarding one of his most trusted lieutenants . He went from Washington to Burlington , spent a day with his family , where a general rejoicing took place over the good news from Tennessee , and then returned to City Point . It was not until the 17th that the full details of Thomas 's victory were received . His army from the very outset of the battle had charged the enemy so vigorously at all points that his lines were completely broken and his troops thrown into confusion , which , upon the second day , resulted in a panic . The most heroic defense the enemy could make did not enable him to stay the impetuosity of Thomas 's troops . Battery after battery fell into the hands of our forces , and prisoners were captured by the thousand . All the // enemy 's dead and wounded were abandoned on the field , and the line of his retreat was covered with abandoned wagons , gun-carriages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days Thomas had captured over 4000 prisoners and 53 pieces of artillery , and left Hood 's army a wreck . The pursuit of the enemy was continued for several days , and much additional damage inflicted . On the 18th General Grant telegraphed to Thomas : ( ( The armies operating against Richmond have fired two hundred guns in honor of your great victory . . . . * One hundred guns had been the salute fired in honor of other victories . Hood 's army was pursued and driven south of the Tennessee River . In this campaign he had suffered ignominious defeat , with the loss of half his army . Thomas 's captures amounted to more than 13,000 prisoners and 72 pieces of artillery ; 2000 deserters had also given themselves up to the Union forces , and taken the oath of allegiance to the United States government . The remnant of Hood 's demoralized sand disorganized troops were no longer held together in one army . Some of them were furloughed and allowed to return to their homes , and the rest were transferred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposing Sherman . Thomas 's entire loss in this campaign was about 10,000 men in killed , wounded , and missing . General Grant 's predictions that Hood would turn north , and not follow Sherman when the latter cut loose from Atlanta , and that Thomas 's army would crush Hood 's as soon as it was led against it , were completely fulfilled . There has been so much discussion in regard to the actions of General Grant and General Thomas during the two weeks preceding the battle of Nashville that a synopsis of the correspondence between them has been given in order that the reader may form his own conclusions . General Grant has been charged with being inimical to Thomas , allowing himself to become unduly irritated over the delay of the latter , and ordering an ill-advised advance of the army , against Thomas 's expressed judgment . The general-in-chief had had a larger experience with Confederate armies than any one else , and felt that the urgent orders he gave were necessary ; and as he was held responsible by the government and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the success of the coöperative movements which he had planned , he certainly exercised a perfectly proper authority in giving the orders he issued . When General Thomas did not obey the instructions repeatedly sent him , the general-in-chief did not treat the case as one of insubordination or defiance , and act hastily or arbitrarily in taking steps immediately to enforce his orders , but exercised a patience which he would not have done under other circumstances or toward any other army commander . He felt while sending his urgent despatches for an advance of the army that he was doing Thomas a positive service ; for he knew better than any one else could know that as soon as Thomas launched his army against Hood 's forces he would win triumphantly , and demonstrate to the country what was already known to his fellowofficers-that the ( ( Rock of Chickamauga ) ) was worthy of being placed in the front rank of the great commanders of the war . It was because he felt entire confidence in Thomas 's ability to whip Hood that he urged Thomas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Grant made his report of the operations , he stated , in referring to General Thomas , substantially what he had said in conversation at headquarters after the victory of Nashville : ( ( His final defeat of Hood was so complete that it would be accepted as a vindication of that distinguished officer 's judgment . ) ) On the other hand , there were those who criticized General Thomas severely for disobedience of orders of his superior officer , and manifesting a spirit of insubordination at a critical crisis of the war . Such insinuations , when all the circumstances are taken into consideration , would attribute to General Thomas traits of character which were certainly foreign to his nature . He believed that he was right , and that he was acting for the best interests of the service , and evidently felt so thoroughly convinced of this that he was willing to run the risk of assuming all responsibility , and to submit to being displaced from his command , rather than yield his judgment . There is very little doubt that if any other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same trying circumstances there would have been an open rupture ; but both being men of patience as well as firmness , their correspondence was conducted without acrimony , the services of both were utilized for the benefit of the country , and each was prompt to acknowledge the high qualifications of the other . Their personal relations were not broken , as has been alleged , by this circumstance , as far as an observer could judge . General Thomas , when he came to Washington after the close of the war , dined with General Grant at his house , and at the table with // him at the houses of common friends , where I was present , and their intercourse never seemed to be marked by any lack of cordiality on either side . SENATOR NESMITH VISITS GRANT . UPON the return of Ingalls from another trip to Washington , he brought with him on a visit to City Point Senator Nesmith of Oregon , who had been an intimate acquaintance of Generals Grant and Ingalls when these two officers were stationed at Fort Vancouver , Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used to sit by the headquarters camp-fire in the evening , and tell no end of Pacific-coast stories . By the way in which he elaborated all the incidents , and led up with increasing humor to the climax of an anecdote , he stamped himself a true artist as a raconteur . One evening he told General Grant of a trip he had made on the Pacific coast with a number of politicians just after his election by the Democratic legislature of Oregon to the LTnited States Senate . In the party was thee Republican governor of California . Nesmith said : ( ( The governor got to deviling me about my election , and rather got the laugh on me by inquiring : ( Now , Nesmith , make a clean breast of it , and tell us just how much money it costs to get run into the Senate by an Oregon legislature . ) To strike back at him , I replied : ( Well , I 11 give you a little account of my experience in dealing with the boys , and leave you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had corraled a majority of one certain on joint ballot of the two houses ; but that did n't make things quite safe , and I told my friends that we ought to have still another fellow persuaded of what was due to my eminence as a statesman ; that it was altogether likely that if we relied on the one man , he would be shot , or landed in jail , or get blind drunk about the time the vote was to be taken , and we were playing too big a game to take any such chances . Well , they said there was a man that had recently come into the State from California , and had managed to get himself elected to our legislature , and they thought , from what they had heard of him , that he would n't be stubborn enough to hold on blindly to the candidate of his choice if arguments sufficiently convincing in favor of some one else were laid before him ; that he was a great fellow to ( ( coincide ) ) if it was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , times were hard , and the price of everything was high . Two years before Bibles were given away free , and now jack-rabbits were selling at two dollars and a half a pair . Most men 's possessions were reduced to a hair-brush and a tooth-brush , though they never had time to use either . I said : ( ( Send the man to my hotel to-night ; there 's no time to be lost . I intend to handle this rooster myself . ) ) When he came to my room , I shoved him into a chair , locked the door , seated myself in front of him , folded my arms , looked him square in the face , and said : ( ( See here ! I want your vote . How much ? ) ) He glued his eyes on me , and remarked : *Now , pard , yer talkin ' business . I do n't know just what the state of the market is in Oregon , but what would you propose as a kind o ' starter ? ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty dollars strike you ? ) ) He rose up out of his chair , looking as if he actually felt hurt by my evident lack of appreciation , and roared out in a tone of voice calculated to wake the dead : ( ( A hundred and fifty hells ! I paid the governor of California twice that much last year to pardon me out of the penitentiary , or else I would n't be up here in your blank old legislature to vote for anybody ! ) ) ) ) ) We were assured that after the recital of this story , which Nesmith had , of course , invented for the purpose of retaliating upon the California governor , there were no further questions from that official as to the methods pursued in Oregon elections . was n't at all surprised , Nes , to see you go to the Senate , ) ) said Ingalls ; 4 always believed old Vancouver could furnish talent enough to supply both the civil and military branches of the government . ) ) ( ( Well , you may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senator . " I said to the members of our committee one day : ( When I came here from the wilds of Oregon as senator of the United States I could n't realize it ; I felt that it was a greater honor than to have been a Roman senator ; I could n't help wondering how I ev*3*r got here . ) ( Well , ) said Preston King of New York , *now that you have been here a couple of weeks , and have got the ( ( hang of the school-house , * how do you feel about it ? My answer was , ( Well , since I ye had time to look round and size things up , my wonder now is , how in thunder the rest of you fellows ever got here . ) ) ) Upon this , as upon one or two other occasions , some stories were attempted which were too broad to suit the taste of the general-in-chief , but they were effectually suppressed . He believed that stories , like diamonds , are always of greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) If reference were // made to subjects which warred against his notions of propriety , while he seldom checked them by words , he would show immediately , by the blush which mantled his cheek , and by his refusal to smile at a joke which depended for its success upon its coarseness , that such things were objectionable to him . The same evening a citizen who had come to camp with Nesmith said he would tell a story , and began by looking around significantly and saying , *I see there are no ladies present . ) ) The general interrupted him with the remark , ( ( No ; but there are gentlemen ) ) ; and the subject was at once changed , and the story was not attempted . The senator , after seeing the lines around Petersburg , expressed a desire to pay a visit to General Butler , and Ingalls and I volunteered to take him to that officer 's headquarters by boat . Butler greeted the senator warmly , and the two soon began to discuss the war , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a radical Republican , and the other a war Democrat . Nesmith drew an amusing picture of Butler 's propensity for confiscation and destruction of property . In the course of the conversation Butler referred to some pranks played in his boyish days , and said : ( ( There was a cake-peddler who used to come by our school-house every day , and during recess we would ( play cakes ) with him ; that is , he would set his basket on the ground , and a boy , by paying twenty-five cents , could have the privilege of starting from a certain distance , and by a series of designated hops , skips , and jumps , trying to land in the basket and break as many cakes as he could . If be succeeded he had a right to take all the cakes he had damaged . The game was pretty difficult , and the cake-man generally came out ahead ; but one day I strained every nerve to win , and succeeded in landing in the middle of the basket with both feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comment upon this story was : " Well , that s just like you , general ; you seem to have spent all your life in trying to break other people 's cakes . ) ) The joke , which had been rather in Butler 's favor up to that time , was now turned against him , but he took it all in good part . In discussing General Grant 's popularity , Butler remarked : ( ( Grant first touched the popular chord when he gained his signal victory at Donelson. * ( ( No , ) ) said Nesmith , who always went round with a huge joke concealed somewhere about his person ; *I think he first touched the popular cord when he hauled wood from his farm and sold it at full measure in St. Louis . ) ) That night Nesmith told General Grant the story of the cipher correspondence he and Ingalls had carried on the year before . He said : ( ( One day the Secretary of War sent me a message that he would like to see me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of public importance . Well , I was rather flattered by that . I says to myself : ( Perhaps the whole Southern Confederacy is moving on Stanton , and he has sent for a war Democrat to get between him and them and sort of whirl em back . ) I hurried up to his office , and when I got in he closed the door , looked all around the room like a stage assassin to be sure that we were alone , then thrust a telegram under my nose , and cried , ( Read that ! ) I suppose I ought to have appeared scared , and tried to find a trapdoor in the floor to fall through , but I did n't . I ran my eye over the despatch , seeing that it was addressed to me and signed by Ingalls , and read : ( Klat-a-wa ni-ka sit-kum mo-litsh weght o-coke kon-a-mox lum . Stanton , who was glaring at me over the top of his spectacles , looking as savage as a one-eyed dog in a meat-shop , now roared out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed back the despatch , and said , ( Well , if you ye discovered everything , what do you want with me ? ) He cried : ( I m determined , at all bazards , to intercept every cipher despatch from officers at the front to their friends in the North , to enable them to speculate in the stock-markets upon early information as to the movements of our armies . ) I said : ( Well , I ca n't help but admire your pluck ; but it seems to me you omitted one little matter : you forgot to read the despatch . ) ( How can I read your incomprehensible hieroglyphics ? ) he replied . ( Hieroglyphics-thunder ! ) I said ; ( why , that 's Chinook . ) ( And what 's Chinook ? ) he asked . ( What ! you do n't know Chinook ? Oh , I see your early education as a linguist has been neglected , ) I answered . ( Why , Chinook is the court language of the Northwestern Indian tribes . Ingalls and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up that jargon . Now I 11 read it to you in English : ( ( Send me half barrel more that same whisky . ) ) You see , Ingalls always trusts my judgment on whisky . He thinks I can tell the quality of the liquor by feeling the head of the barrel in the dark . ) That was too much for the great War Secretary , and be broke out with a laugh such as I do n't believe the War Department bad ever heard since he was appointed to office ; but I learned afterward that be took the precaution , nevertheless , to show the despatch to an army officer // who had served in the Northwest , to get him to verify my translation . ) ) As General Grant knew a good deal of Chinook , he was able to appreciate the joke fully , and he enjoyed the story greatly . Nesmith had served to enliven the camp for several days with his humorous reminiscences of life in the West , and when he left every one parted with him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 Sherman reached Ossabaw Sound , southeast of Savannah , just a month after he had left Atlanta , and communicated with the fleet which had been sent to meet him . His 65,000 men and half that number of animals had been abundantly fed , and his losses had been only 103 killed , 428 wounded , and 278 missing . The destruction of the enemy 's property has been estimated as high as one hundred millions of dollars . On December 15 Sherman received General Grant 's letter of the 3d . In this he said , among other things : ( ( Not liking to rejoice before the victory is assiired , I abstain from congratulating you and those under your command until bottom has been struck . I have never had a fear of the result . ) ) The next day Sherman received General Grant 's orders outlining the plan of transferring the greater part of Sherman 's army by sea to join the armies in front of Petersburg , and end the war . As the enemy 's troops were now nearly all in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South had been pretty well destroyed , it would bring hostilities to a close quicker to move Sherman by sea than to consume the time and subject the men to the fatigue of marching by land . General Grant said this would be the plan unless Sherman saw objections to it . A prompt and enthusiastic letter was written by Sherman , saying his army could join Grant before the middle of January if sent on transports by sea , and that he expected to take Savannah meanwhile . When General Grant visited the capital he consulted as to the means of ocean transportation , and became convinced that with all the sea-going vessels that could be procured it would take two months to move Sherman 's army , with its artillery and trains , to the James River ; and he therefore wrote him from Washington : *I did think the best thing to do was to bring the greater part of your army here and wipe out Lee . The turn affairs now seem to be taking has shaken me in that opinion . I doubt whether you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if brought here , especially as I am informed since my arrival in the city Washington that it would take about two months to get you here , with all the other calls there are for ocean transportation . I want to get your views about what ought to be done . . . . My own opinion is that Lee is averse to going out of Virginia , and if the cause of the South is lost , he wants Richmond to be the last place surrendered . If he has such views , it may be well to indulge him until we get everything else in our hands . Congratulating you and the army again upon the splendid result of your campaign , the like of which is not read of in past history , I subscribe myself more than ever , if possible , your friend . ) ) Sherman now invested Savannah on the south side , but the enemy evacuated the city on the night of December 20 . Sherman 's army then entered , and on the 22d the general sent his famous despatch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah , with 150 heavy guns and plenty of ammunition , and also about 25,000 bales of cotton. * BUTLER 'S EXPEDITION AGAINST FORT FISHER . ON December 8 General Butler had come over to see General Grant at headquarters , and said that as his troops would be aboard the transports at Fort Monroe the next day , he would start in the afternoon for that place , and see that the expedition was promptly started . They had a general conversation in regard to what would be required of the expedition , which was merely a reiteration of the written orders which had been carefully prepared . It was decided that one of General Grant 's staff should accompany the expedition , and Colonel Comstock was designated for that duty . Delay in taking aboard additional supplies , and severe storms , prevented the expedition from beginning operations against Fort Fisher before December 24 . The navy had converted a gunboat , the Louisiana , into a powder-boat . She was filled with 250 tons of powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run in toward the beach , anchored about five hundred yards from the fort , and exploded about 2 A.M. on the 24th . The report was not much greater than the discharge of a piece of heavy artillery ; no damage was done to the enemy 's earthworks , and no result accomplished . A negro on shore was afterward reported to have said when he heard the sound : " I // reckon de Yankees hab done bust one ob dah b'ilers. * At daylight on the 24th the naval fleet of fifty vessels moved forward and began the bombardment of the fort . About noon on the 25th General Ames 's division landed , and a skirmish-line was pushed to within a few yards of the fort . It was reported that the fort had not been materially damaged , and that Hoke 's command had been sent south from Lee 's army , and was approaching to reinforce the garrison . Butler now decided not to make an attack , and r&amp;imbarked all of his troops , except Curtis 's brigade , on the transports , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27th . Curtis 's brigade also reembarked on the 27th , and followed the other forces . On the 28th General Butler came to headquarters , and had an interview with General Grant , in which he sought to explain the causes of the failure . General Grant expressed himself very positively on the subject . He said he considered the whole affair a gross and culpable failure , and that he proposed to make it his business to ascertain who was to blame for the want of success . The delays from storms were , of course , unavoidable . The preparation of the powderboat had caused a loss of several weeks . It was found that the written orders which General Grant had given to General Butler to govern the movements of the expedition had not been shown to Weitzel . An important part of these instructions provided thatunder certain contingencies the troops were expected to intrench and hold themselves in readiness to coöperate with the navy for the reduction of the fort , instead of re*mbarking on the transports . General Grant had not positively ordered an assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to assault had been the only error ; but he was exceedingly dissatisfied that the important part of his instructions as to gaining and holding an intrenched position had been disobeyed , and the troops withdrawn , and all further efforts abandoned . GRANT 'S CHILDREN AT CITY POINT . MRS . GRANT , Fred , and Jesse came to City Point to spend the Christmas holidays with the general . Rawlins always called Fred the " Veteran , * for the reason that he had been with his father in the fight which took place in rear of Vicksburg the year before , when he was only thirteen years of age . One evening Rawlins said , in referring to that campaign : ( ( Fred crossed the Mississippi with his father on the gunboat Price . Early in the morning the general went ashore to direct the movement of the troops , leaving the boy coiled up on the forward deck fast asleep . When he woke up the youngster insisted on following his father , but was told by a staff-officer to stay where he was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see some troops chasing a rabbit , and jumped ashore and joined in the fun . Thinking the men were a pretty jolly set of fellows , he followed along with the regiment in its march to the front , thinking he would meet his father somewhere on the road . The troops soon encountered the enemy , and Fred found himself suddenly participating in the battle of Port Gibson . That night he recognized a mounted orderly belonging to headquarters , and hailed him . The orderly gave him a blanket , and he rolled himself up in it and managed to get several hours ' sleep . About midnight his father came across him , and his surprise may be imagined when he discovered that the boy had left the boat and turned amateur soldier . The general had crossed the river in true light marching order , for he had no incumbrances but an overcoat and a toothbrush . A couple of horses were soon captured . The general took one , and gave the other to Fred . They were ungainly , raggedhipped nags , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy cut when mounted on his raw-boned war-charger . At the battle of Black River Bridge , Fred saw Lawler 's brigade making its famous charge which broke the enemy 's line , and rode forward and joined in the pursuit of the foe ; but he had not gone far when a musket-ball struck him on the left thigh . A staff-officer rode up to him , and asked him how badly he was hurt ; and Fred , not being an expert in gunshot wounds , said he rather thought his leg was cut in two . ( Can you work your toes ? ) asked the officer . The boy tried , and said he could . Then , ) cried the officer , *you re all right * and taking him to a surgeon , it was found that the ball had only clipped out a little piece of flesh , so that he was not damaged enough to have to join the ranks of the disabled . " Speaking of the charge of Lawler 's brigade , ) ) continued Rawlins , ( ( while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up bearing a despatch from Halleck , written six days before , which had been forwarded through General Banks . It ordered General Grant to withdraw at once from where he was , march to Grand Gulf , and coUperate with Banks against Port Hudson , // and then return with the combined forces and besiege Vicksburg . The general read the communication , and just as he had finished it he saw Lawler charging through the enemy 's broken lines and heard the men 's cheers of victory . Turning to the officer who had brought the message , he said : ( I 11 have to say , in this case , what the Irishman said to the chicken that was in the egg he swallowed , and which peeped as it was going down his throat : ( ( You spake too late . ) ) ) Then , putting spurs to his horse , he galloped off to join the advancing lines . The enemy 's forces were in full retreat , hurrying on to shut themselves up in Vicksburg , and the general , under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and written without any knowledge of the circumstances . ) ) Soon after Fred 's arrival at City Point he took it into his head that he must go duckshooting . The general was no sportsman himself , and never shot or fished ; but he liked to see the youngsters enjoy the Christmas holidays , and he readily gave his consent to anything they proposed in the way of amusement . He never gave a reason for not hunting , but it was evident that he felt that certain forms of it furnished a kind of sport which was too cruel to suit his tastes . He described the only bull-fight he ever attended as presenting ( ( a most sickening sight , ) ) and never seemed to take any pleasure in sports which caused suffering on the part of either animals or human beings . As sporting guns are not found among army supplies , Fred had to content himself with an infantry rifled musket . The general 's colored servant Bill accompanied the boy . Bill was not much of a shot himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shut . But he was a good hand to take the place of the armorbearer of the ancients , and carry the weapons and ammunition . Taking a boat , they paddled down the river in search of game . They had not gone far when they were brought to by the naval pickets who had been posted on the river-bank by the commander of one of the vessels . A picket-boat was sent after them , and they were promptly arrested as rebel spies , and taken aboard a gunboat . The declaration by the white prisoner , who , it was supposed , was plotting death and destruction to the Union , that he was the son of the general-in-chief , was at first deemed too absurd to be entertained by sailors , and fit only to be told to the marines ; but after a time Fred succeeded in convincing the officers as to his identity , and was allowed to return to headquarters . When he arrived he wore a rueful expression of countenance at the thought of the ingratitude of republics to their ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account of his adventure , teased him good-naturedly , and told him how fortunate it was that he had not been hanged at the yard-arm as an enemy of the republic , and his body consigned to the waters of the Potomac.
