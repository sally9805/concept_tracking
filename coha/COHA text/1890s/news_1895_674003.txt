txt The Protective Association , which is going to rid the place of burglars and other undesirable visitors , has two New-York detectives on duty . These sleuths spent last night prowling about looking for the robaers in case they should attempt to return to the village after giving it a rest of about two weeks . Once or twice during the night the detectives saw the Chief and the Captain of Police , the only two officers in the place , patrolling their ten miles- apiece of street . The Chief and the Captain saw the detectives , and stalked them about as often as the detectives stalked the uniformed men . While the rival guardians of the peace and property of the town thus stealthily watched each other , the busy burglar plied his trade , and when he thought he had made enough for one night , he went to his home or club or somewhere else . The burglars reached town , it is supposed , early in the evening . There were several hours to pass before the ones at which they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a. hotel and register , however , nor did they walk the streets , so the Chief and the Captain and the two detectives could see them and " run them in . " In place of that , they began at once to " burgle . " They went to the Episcopal Church and forced an entrance . The soft cushions furnished them with a good bed , and they retired to rest . It is not known that they had an alarm clock along . They did not oversleep , and promptly at 2 o'clock they sauntered forth to rid Hackensack of its surplus wealth . They entered the church undetected , but they were not so fortunate in getting away . A dog at the residence of the Rev. Dr. Holly , the pastor of the church , heard them going , and set up such a. racket his master armed himself and set out to investigate . The manse was undisturbed , and the minister investigated the church . He realized in a short time that the burglars had been there , but it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed in the church except the cushions , and nothing had been taken . At about the time the rector of the church was retiring , after making the church once more secure . Mrs. J. V. B. Rapp , who lives on Union Street , near Central Avende , was awake . She was not thinking of burglars , and was paralysed with fright when the door leading from the hall to the bedroom was softly pushed open and a man 's head thrust into the room . Mrs. Rapp says she tried to scream and could not . She tried to jump up , but could not , and lay on the bed perfectly conscious of what was happening , but incapable of exertion of any kind . She says she was dead for the time , with the exception of her brain . She saw the burglar advance across the room without making a noise and lift her husband 's test from its resting place . Then he picked up the coat and felt it . There was nothing in the pockets , so he carefully replaced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung them over his arm , where the vest had preceded them . He went to the bureau and took from it a diamond stick pin and pinned it under his vest lapel . Then he looked about the room as though searching for something else , and not seeing it , slowly and quietly walked toward the door . Mrs. Rapp watched him until he reached it . She was trying to move or cry out , but she was still too frightened to succeed . When the marauder was entirely out of her sight the capabiEty for action suddenly returned , and she uttered a scream and leaped out of bed at the same moment . Mr. Rapp landed on his feet almost as soon as his wife did . She uttered the one word , " burglars , " and her husband reached for his trousers . They were gone , so he threw up a window and yelled for help . He heard the burglar go down the street on a run . The trousers and the vest were found this morning near the Union Street crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roll of bills amounting to $100 . The burglars are supposed to have entered the house of J. G. Ackerson , on Prospect Street , next . They did not get much there , as they left after securing an umbrella and a coat . Prospect Street did not prove good hunting ground , for , after the small haul at Mr. Ackerson 's and a failure to enter the residence of 0 . H. Krause , the night prowlers must have concluded the street was a bad one for them , and they called at the residence of Edward Goldschmidt , a lawyer , whose office is at 50 Broadway , New-York . Since the burglars last visited this place , Mr. Goldschmidt has been sleeping with a revolver under his pillow . For some reason he did not put it there last night , but left it in his bureau . Instead , he had a. long and heavy hickory stick so placed at the side of his bed that he could grasp it without rising , and he lay on the bed so as to command the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man entered his room . With a single movement , the lawyer brought the stick into play . The blow fell short and the burglar drew the door shut , so that the stick struck it instead of his head . Mr. Goldschmidt leaped from bed and made a dash for his revolver . Just as he reached it , the door opened again , there was a report of a. revolver , and a bullet whizzed over Mrs. Goldschmidt as she lay in bed , past Mr. Goldschmidt 's outstretched arm , and lodged in the wall within a foot of the bureau . Mr. Goldschmidt grasped his revolver , and , turning , fired . He was too late . The burglar closed the door and the bullet lodged in its edge . Mr. Goldschmidt started toward the door , and it was again thrown open and a shot fired . He replied in kind , but all bullets went astray . Before Mr. Goldsahmidt could reach the door the burglar was down stairs and out of the house , and lost . He secured $15 before entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Goldschmidt burglary was committed , and it is thought to have been the last of the night 's work . The detectives to-night are searching , and the Chief and the Captain are patrolling their lonely ten-mile beats , and Hackensack is sleeping with one eye open . Up to a late hour persistent search failed to iodate the burglars , so their plans for the night could not be ascertained .
