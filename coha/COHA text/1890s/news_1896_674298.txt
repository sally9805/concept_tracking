txt Attorney General HARM014 Lays down sound doctrine in his letter to United States Attorney LASSITER of Virginia . Mr. LASSITER has been acting as Chairman of a campaign committee and taking an active part in politics . Complaints were made , and he has resigned . In accepting his resignation , Mr. HARmoN shows that it is for the good of the service . Officers in his position should not only " be in fact fair and impartial , but also they should avoid all circumstances likely to give rise to suspicion that they are or may be otherwise . " It will be noted that this principle , which all can see is indispensable , applies to all active partisanship . It would apply just as clearly to an attorney who was in political sympathy with the Administration as to one that was opposed to the Administration . A prosecuting attorney is an officer of the court , and his duties involve large discretion . It is not right that he should expose himself to the prejudice , animosity , excitement of a campaign . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that he can . If he could , he could not ! Stake people believe that he was impartial . And it would make no difference on which side he was acting : Attorney General HAnmoN 's principle comes clearly within the one we have advocated , that officers Who neglect their duty or impair their efficiency by political activity should be disciplined , to whatever party they are devoted . As for the others  --  by far the greater number  --  so long as they render good service , politics should have no influence on their retention or discharge , as it should have none on their appointment
