txt It is reported to-day that the Republican and Democratic free ? ? coinage men of Minnesota will hold a convention this Summer . The story runs that a half dozen or more of the leaders have been in consultation , and have determined to have a convention and to make the call so broad that it will take in every Democrat and every Republican who is an avowed advocate of free silver coinage or known to be favorably disposed toward the white metal . It is understood that the Populists will be barred from participating in the convention , because of their disposition to wander from the main point and pass resolutions on subjects other than money . Lieut . Gov . Day is known to be favorable to a silver convention . Among other Republicans who are likely to take interest in the project are George Thompson of St. Paul , George W. Lamphere of The Moorhead News , and Gen. John B. Sanborn of St. Paul . Among the Democrats interested are P. P. Winston , ex-Mayor of Minneapolis ; W. F. Kelso of Kittson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in reference to the matter to-day : " If the friends of silver keep on increasing in number as they have in the past year , there will be no gold standard men left in Minnesota . nor in any other part of the West , for that matter . " As to the ratio of coinage , I am not positively decided , but the crime of 1873 must be expiated and silver must be restored to its old place as the full equal of gold in our financial system . I can name at least twenty of the best Republican newspapers in Minnesota that are openly in favor of silver . The growth of , the movement has been nothing less than phenomenal , and I confidently expect that within a shorter period than most people think the majority of the Republican Party will declare unequivocally in its favor .
