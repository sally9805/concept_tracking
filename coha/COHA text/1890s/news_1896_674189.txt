txt The Republican Rate Convention to-day was called , for the purpose of nominating a candidate for Governor , but the most of the time was given over to an attempt to bolster up Mr. Reed as a Presidential candidate . The nomination of a Governor was disposed of with neatness and dispatch . Then the work in behalf of the Speaker was attelided to with diligence and considerable show of enthusiasm . It is evident that Mr. Manley and the other Reed managers have . become convinced that the only hope for their candidate is to secure for him the united support of the sound-money people . Mr. Reed , personally , has been as silent as to the money question as himself . Wile Maine convention which chose delegates to St. Louis contented itself with pointing to Ills record . Massachusetts declared him a gold-standard man , and New-Hampshire followed by proclaiming the man from Maine a bimetallist . The managers seemed to think they had placed Mr. Reed in a position to " catch ' em comln ' or goin ' , " regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't seem to have caught ' em either way . has corralled the free-silver votes , and Reed 's friends appear to feel that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by a straightforward declaration for sound money . Harold M. Sewall was Chairman of today 's convention In his speech he started the work for Reed by saying : The Republicans of Maine join their brethren of other States in presenting* a candidate whose platform Is already written , written when Ile declared that the ' proudest part of the proud record of the Republican Party Is Its devotion to the cause of sound finance , " written in the record of his life , whose nomination means election , whose election means Republican supremacy not for four , but for twenty-four Yeats to come ; not only the leader of our party , but one whose mastery a sullen and defiant Democracy has been forced to acknowledge  --  a master of men . Master of himself as the Nation knows him today . his lips not sealed In silence when silence Is dishonor , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his lofty spirit unswerved from Its high purpose ; no , not for the price of the Presidency itself ! Conservative without compromise , brave without rashness , undaunted to-day as he has been undaunted ever , I need not name him ! lie leads In your hearts and there has been no vacancy In that leadership shoe , broken healted , you turned from the deathbed of Blaine ; and , in the full glory of Ills record and the promise of Illimitable achievements yet to come , you centred your pride of State and Party fealty upon Thomas B. Reed ! His name your chosen delegates carry to St. Louis , and to guide their action there they need only the Instructions'of their hearts . The . platform was devoted almost entirely to Reed . and the financial question . It declares : We aie , opptised to the free and unlimited coinage of silver , except by Internattomil tip cement , and until such agreement can be obtained we believe that the present gold standard should be mdintained . We believe In the , maintenance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public creditor  --  not for the creditor 's sake , but for the Nation 's sake , for the sound reason that the most valuable possession of any nation In time of war Or distress , next to the courage of its people , is an honorable reputation , Whoever pays with honor borrows with ease . Sound finance and certainty at the Treasury and protection for the producers will mean prosperity and peace . We renew our unsuetving loyalty to that great champion of protection and sound money Thomas B. Reed , in the hope that the coming National Convention will recognize  --  the urgent demand of the business Interests of the country for Ilia nomination . The Committee on Resolutions should have full credit for its discovery of the " urgent demand of the business interests of the country " for Reed 's nomination . This " urgent demand " appears not to have been heard outside of Bangor . Llewellyn Powers of Houlton was nominated by acclamation for Governor , and after he had made a speech the convention adjourned .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
