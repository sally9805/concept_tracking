Bi ' Ji ? avrnond L. n ,  --  ia*rrna , i . FOR a period of at least fifteen years , which goes back to Gen. Butler 's greenback candidacy for the governorship of Massachusetts , there has been constant discussion in Massachu setts , and more or less discussion elsewhere , of the expediency of state commissions . " Government by boards and commissions " was sharl ) lv criticised by him and has been attacked frequently since his time . Reform has been repeatedly urged . As late as 1891 the Massa.chusetts Legislature appointed a special recess committee to investigate and report upon the expediency of " changing , consolidating or abolishing the various state commissions " ; and the criticism with which that generally adverse report was received in some quarters shows that there is strong opposition to the present prominence of boards and commissions in government . But every state in the Union has commissions , or officers to do practically a commissioner 's work , and some states have many of them . In the national government the same is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any l ) OPular defence of commissions , still seems to be toward the addition of new ones , rather than toward a reduction of their number , even though there be a clamor against this class of public officials . But that this clamor against cornmissions is ill-founded and unwise seems easy to establish after a dispassionate observance of the facts upon which they have their being . The outcry against " government by commissions " goes with the demand for a strong executive . Some earnest and persuasive writers are in recent years urging with much force and persistence that the practice of government by comrriissions must cease , that the executive council be abolished , and that the powers of the governor be greatl** enlarged . It is made a matter of comI ) laint that the 442 governor has little power , and many are the longings for more authority in the hands of the chief executive . Gov . William E. Russell , of Massachusetts , in his first inaugural , said that the governor " has but little power and few duties , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his administration , had a bill sent to the Judiciary Committee greatly increasing his powers , but it was never passed . The Massachusetts Democracy has repeatedly demanded a strong executive , and it is supported in its position by some who are not allied with that * ) arty . Now the first fact to be noticed about this doctrine is that it is essentially undemocratic ; and it is a matter of astonishment that the party which asserts that it is closest to the people can have been so shortsighted as to have put this doctrine into its l ) latform . The fact is doubtless to be explained by the temporary occupancy of the governor 's chair by a popular Democrat , and the fact that what would strengthen him would apparently help the party in its play for a l ) opular majority . But it is clear , upon a little reflection , that the most undemocratic thing a party can do , in the political development of the age , is to increase the power of the executive as against the powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose combined intelligence and will are the governing force in the body politic . It should not be regarded as conclusive , taking Massachusetts as an examl ) le , that the Constitution sets forth in a certain way the relation of the executive to the Legislature . The agreement in the cabin of the " Mayflower " puts civil goveminent on the basis of a compact , - a doctrine which we now know to be essentially an error . Another hoary but highly respectable error is that government rests upon the consent of the // governed . So it is reasonable to be cautious , and not to receive the doctrines of the Constitution as necessarily correct . The people in those times were too much in the shadow of the strong executive governments in all parts of the world , and administration by democracy was not sufficiently well established to permit the recognition of the truth which is unquestionable at the end of the nineteenth century , that the highest human government is by the people themselves for the body politic as a living and growing organism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the relation of the executive to the Legislature in all the states of the Union , it is clear that the founders of its Constitution were in the right line of l ) Olitical growth . The Constitution shows that the executive department is inferior to the legislative , even in the minds of the founders . The Constitution keeps distinct forever the executive , the judicial , and the legislative departments , " to the end that this may be a government of laws and not of men " ; but the very expression proves that the department which is the origin of the laws is supreme over the departments for their interpretation and enforcement . In a democracy , government is the will of the political organism asserting itself for its own good , and such government must be by the people and for the people . Hence the legislative department in a democracy is the strongest , and it will ever increase in power and prestige at the expense of the executive and of the judiciary . The growth of government *n modern times has been by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of their nominal rulers ; and this is a right line of growth . In bar-. baric ages and , later , in semi-civilized times , it was inevitable that the executive should be the strong arm of the government . In Russia and in all despotic countries the executive has absorbed the legislative and the judicial functions , when it comes to the last resort , for the will of the executive is supreme . The governor in an American state is only an official to carry out the popular will . Being one and being human , it is not his responsibility to provide alone for the well-being of the state . He is not the special benefactor of his people , to whom they are to look for the origin of favoring laws , but they , in their intelligence and will , are the source of the laws which he is to execute . The executive is their servant . He is the man whom they have commissioned for a fixed period to carry out their will . He is the commissioner in chief , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , as that will is based upon their collective intelligence , and he is charged with the responsibility of seeing that the inferior officers who are accountable to him do their duty also in carrying out the popular will . This is the extent of his function . XVide as it seems to be in a sense , yet , compared with the source of his authority , it is a narrow and limited sphere . By the traditions which attach to the governorship from former times , by the popular ideas regarding chief executive magistrates , kings , emperors , czars , and despots of whatever name , by the prestige of being the personal representative of the will of the l ) eoPle in action , the governor seems superficially to be the most important feature of our government . But he is comparatively unimportant . It is imperative that the will of the people be enforced , and as representative of that will the governor is for the time a most important man , but he is important only as an employee is important to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be executed , and the employer is the most important person in the case . If the employee be unfaithful or incompetent , another must be obtained . The Constitution of Massachusetts , which confers upon the governor all the power he has , is singularly deficient in any definition of those powers . It says , " there shall be a supreme executive magistrate , " and that the governor , with the council , shall " from time to time hold and keep a council for the ordering and directing the affairs of the Commonwealth , agreeably to the Constitution and the laws of the land . " *l'he large proportion of his powers is comprehended in the words " executive magistrate " and in the other // words quoted above from the Constitution . The Public Statutes add nothing of moment to this definition of the governor s duties . As they are partly defined in the Constitution and partly determined by traditional practice , he can call meetings of the council , call special sessions of the Legislature , and prorogue the Legislature . No act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the governor , or unless he has had it before him for five days after enactment and before prorogation . He can veto any act of the Legislature , and can thus defeat any measure , unless two thirds of each branch , who are present and voting , pass it over the veto . He is commander-in-chief of the army and navy . He alone has the power of pardoning offences . He can not pardon unless the pardon committee of the council recommends it ; hut after the committee has recommended it , he can pardon or not , at his discretion . Every official who holds a commission from the state is appointed by the governor , with the advice and consent of the council . These officials include all judges of the supreme , superior , district , municipal , and police courts , notaries public , trial justices , justices of the peace , commissioners to qualify civil officers , trustees of all state institutions , members of all state commissions and commissioners in other states to take depositions to be used in Massachusetts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless upon a warrant approved by the governor ; and this gives the governor power to refuse to pay the salary of any state employee . Requisitions from governors of other states for criminals arrested in this state must have the approval in writing of the governor . He must make all such requisitions upon the governors of other states . Proclamations for the observance of certain days , such as Thanksgiving and Arbor days , are issued by the governor with the advice and consent of the council . The governor transmits to the Legislature matters which require legislation which are received from state officials or from other sources , and also sends special messages to the Legislature upon matters for legislative action . The governor and council are expected to visit all state institutions to see how they are managed , as all their expenses must he approved by the governor ; and officers of state institutions frequently come to the governor for advice upon questions of management . But the governor is required by law to visit the state prison only . Action by the state treasurer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the governor and council . The payment of money upon any appropriation can be prevented by the governor 's refusal to sign the warrant . The governor has the entire charge of the district police force , without the consent of the council . He appoints its members without cQnfirmation by the council , and can order them to go anywhere in the state he pleases in case of disturbance . Judicial officers can not be removed without the consent of the 1 *egislature ; but all commissioners can be removed by the governor with thc consent of the council , though the insurance commissioner , the general superintendent of prisons , the warden of the state prison and the clerk of the railroad commission can be removed by the governor without the consent of the council . In certain cases , in the failure of militia organizations to elect their officers , the governor , with the advice of the council , must appoint them . All orders of the adjutant general are issued by command of the governor as commander-in-chief . It is said on the good authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen many governors come and go , that half of the time of the governor , taking the successive administrations as they run , is occupied with hearing applications for office and in reading and answering letters relating to office . That is pertinent in determining how the time of the supreme executive magistrate is chiefly occupied . In considering the demand for a strong executive as against " government by commissions , " the above are the powers of the governor which are to be borne in mind . But when we consider the section of the Constitution which creates the Legislature , then we see the vast difference between the real source of power and the servant* of the people . It says : " Full // Power and authority are hereby given and granted to the said General Court , from time to time , to make , ordain and establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable orders , laws , statutes and ordinances , either with penalties or without , so as the same be not repugnant or contrary to this Constitution , as they shall judge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the government and ordering thereof , and of the subjects of the same and for the necessary sul ) port and defence of the government thereof . " A study of the duties of the governor will show how completely they are of a secondary and inferior nature . Nothing need originate with him . He has no responsibility for the good of the body I ) olitic beyond the enforcement of the laws , except what rests with equal weight upon every other public-spirited citizen . It is for him to improve the administration of the laws as far as they come within his sphere ; but it is as impossible for him to originate the laws as it is for him to unite in his person the intelligence of the entire people . It is the custom for the governor to make recommendations in his inaugural address that certain measures be enacted ; but the habitual , though not necessarily disiespectful disregard which the Legislature pays to them illustrates how perfunctory those recommendations are and how little they weigh with the representatives of the people . A further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the administration of the laws , in the broad and vital sense . Ample machinery is provided for the enforcement of the laws without any action by the governor at all . In civil and criminal actions the persons aggrieved , or the officers of the Commonwealth , in the name of the Commonwealth , proceed according to prescribed course to bring action against the offender against the property , reputation , liberty or life of another ; and the entire l ) rocedure , from the initiatory step to the execution of the sentence of the court , is carried out without any action , or formal concurrence even , on the part of the supreme executive magistrate . Executive officers , each in his proper sphere , carry out the civil and the criminal codes . Even in cases of capital crimes , no action is necessary by the governor to the complete execution of the sentence of justice . I'he term " executive department " does not imply that the executive officers are all subordinate to the chief executive . There is no weakness of administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from the governor . If they did , there would be an autocracy in an appreciable degree where now there is not . A pertinent fact in this connection is that there is no complaint that the laws of the Commonwealth are not vigorously and impartially enforced . In the nature of the case it is inevitable that some laws are obsolete or obsolescent ; but it can not be otherwise in the natural growth of a state , just as the lower limbs of forest trees die as the thrifty top rises higher in air and grows through the medium of the foliage of the newer and higher limbs . But these obsolete laws are lopped off at every occasional pruning when the entire code of the Commonwealth is revised , as it was when the General Statutes were enacted in 1859 and the Public Statutes in 1882 . As a broad truth , Massachusetts law is well enforced , and of many other states the same generalization is also true . The laws are held in general and sincere respect , and the fact that a certain regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is observed in the daily living of the people . The real executive of our law-andorder-loving states is strong . No wellgrounded demand exists for a stronger . If it were impossible for the peoI ) le who make the laws to procure their enforcement , if there were any failure to secure justice which could be remedied by the interference of a stronger executive arm in behalf of the people , then there would be reason in agitating for more power for the executive . But the conditions are not such that any greater liberty or more numerous privileges would be secured to the people by having more power lodged with the governor . If any advancement in popular liberty or privilege is to be made , it is to be accomplished through the Legislature , which is the representa // tive of the people . If the enactment of a law is secured which is a real step in advance , there is little trouble about its enforcement , as has been the case in Massachusetts with the civil-service law , the state board of arbitration and conciliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No better illustration of the inferior character of the supreme executive magistracy , compared with the almost omnipotent Legislature , is to be found than in the administration of Gov . Butler . Never did governor so endeavor to magnify his office . He was first of all governors of modern years to insist upon the title of " supreme executive magistrate . " He sought to assert all his prerogatives and to induce the legislators to add to them . He probably owed his election to the willingness of some voters to see what a strong executive would do , with the idea that things would have a needed shaking up if he were elected . But in spite of his bitter complaints that he could do little under the laws , in spite of his effort to have the Legislature enlarge his powers , and in spite of his noisy demonstration in the Tewksbury investigation , he could not persuade a majority of the people that the executive should have more power , nor that the state institutions were in the need of closer supervision on the l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government by commissions , and did what he could to enlarge the powers of the executive ; but beyond the change of administration at the Tewksbury almshouse , he actually accomplished little , and the statute books from that day to this owe little of political consequence to the service of this apostle of the doctrine of a strong executive magistrate . No , the governor is the commissioner in chief of the many persons who are commissioned by the sovereign people to carry out their will . He is not to be looked up to as the vicegerent of God , nor to be regarded as the subject of the expression that " the powers that he are ordained of God . " He is even now regarded with more consideration than properly attaches to his person or to his office , because of the nearness of our times to the days of a real king over our people , and because of the existence of an autocratic executive over many millions of people to-day . In the development of the Commonwealth , the importance and prestige of the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the source of the will which must be executed in the laws will be more distinct and general . We now pass on to consider the positive side of the case for boards and commissions . We have seen that when the . people want certain things done to carry on the machinery of the government and to observe certain formalities , the person to observe them in the name of the people is the head of the executive department . But they have given him only a small range of powers . His duties are very few , compared with the many interests of the body politic which must be looked after by the representatives of the people . Other great interests have been intrusted by the people , represented in the Legislature , to other hands . These other hands are the commissions of the state , boards of men or single officers charged with the duty of looking out for the public weal against the encroachments of corporate power and the fraudulent operations of unprincipled men . The duties which these commissioners discharge were never the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sphere of action by the popular will has enlarged , as the intelligence and will of the people have come closer home to the lives of a larger number of people , these commissions have been established by the Legislature to administer certain offices of trust , supervision and progress . These commissioners are really responsible to the Legislature . Their annual reports are made to the Legislature , and upon their statements of the needs of the people in the spheres which their departments severally include , the Legislature extends further the force of the popular will and provides the wherewithal , both money and machinery , for making the will effective . Criticism is heard of the " government by commissions " because of the growing number of commissions . It is true that // they are a modern feature of political development , and are opposed to the popular theory that we are governed too much . But that theory is not rational and will not bear a careful examination . Still , whether rational or not , it is set at naught utterly by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending its sphere of action into the lives of the people . Commissions are a necessity in a democratic government , just as committees are a necessity in the Legislature . Neither commissions nor committees exist because some one or some few controlling persons have a theory that they would be a good thing ; they are the answer to the needs of the times as truly as warm clothing is the reply to the needs of winter . Legislative business can be done better by having a few members examine a petition and report upon it , than by having the entire body , as a committee of the whole , hear and act upon each case . If the latter were the practice , the year would not be long enough for disposal of the urgent cases . Committees hence became a necessity , and they have grown in number with the times . It is extremely interesting to see how legislative committees have increased in comparatively modern times , proving the rapid extension of governmental action into the lives of the people and furnishing an illuminating parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legislative manual , though for two years before that one had been published for the House of Representatives only . At that time the system of town representation in the lower branch prevailed , and the membership of the Legislature , though varying from year to year , according as the towns sent or did not send representatives , was much larger than now , when the membership of the House is fixed at two hundred and forty by the Constitution . In i8o7 the membership was forty senators and three hundred and eighty-three representatives , Maine then being included with Massachusetts . Yet the differentiation of legislative business was so slight at that period compared with the present , that there were only eight joint standing com mittees , and only a small proportion of the members had any committee place at all . Specialization of function is as certain a characteristic of the evolution of a legislative body as it is of the evolution of a complex animal organism from a primitive type . Evolution of legislative forms is as sure an accompaniment of progress as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small beginning of legislative committees has been made the evolution to the present long list of thirty-one joint standing committees , besides the standing committees for each branch , and special committees almost every year for some temporary object , which is for the time of great . public interest , such as rapid transit and reservations for public parks . Not only must every member serve now on at least one committee , but many have two or more committee places to fill . in the same way state commissions are an illustration of the rapid evolution which is going on in the body politic . They satisfy a real need . They are not established to carry out some one 's pet theory , but in the growth of the political organism there has been found at this point a need which must be satisfied in order that the growth may not be checked , and that the interests of the people , pecuniary , or educational , or social , may not suffer . Certain affairs demand attention for the public good . Somebody must give them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some few , constitutes the essential thing , no matter by what name they are called . We call the persons to whom these interests are committed a commission . The name , however , does not signify . If the popular will should be so swayed by mistaken doctrine as to decree that government by commissions should cease , the essential thing would go right on as before under another name , or the development of the Commonwealth would be checked , and the interests of the people would suffer . How rapid has been the growth of commissions in Massachusetts in recent years appears by the following record of the date of their establishment - 1837 . State Board of Education . i 8* 2 . State Board of Agriculture . // i86o . Cattle Commission . 1863 . State Board of Charities . i866 . Savings Bank Commission . i866 . Commission on Inland Fisheries . i866 . Insurance Commission . 1869 . Bureau of Statistics of Labor . 1869 . Railroad Commission . 1870 . Commissioner of Corporations . 1877 . Land Commission . 1877 . Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prison Commission . 1884 . Civil Service Commission . 1885 . Board of Registration in Pharmacy. 1885 . Gas Commission . i88* . Boston Board of Police . r886 . State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation . 1887 . Board of Registration in Dentistry. 1887 . Controller of County Accounts . I 889 . Commissioner of Foreign Mortgage Corporations . 1889 . Metropolitan Sewerage Commission . 1890 . Tax Commission . 1890 . Commission on Free Public Libraries . 1890 . Ballot Law Commission . 1891 . Nautical Training School Commission . 1891 . Commission on Uniform Legislation . 1892 . Commissioner of Public Records . 1893 . State Highway Commission . 1893 . Metropolitan Park Commission . Here are thirty-one permanent commissions , only nine of which existed before 1870 , and eight of which were created in 1890 and the following years . A full half of our one hundred and fourteen years since the adoption of the Constitution passed before the first state board was created . The Land and Harbor Commissions were consolidated in 1879 ; the Commission on Inland Fisheries now includes game ; the Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others have undergone change . Besides these , there have been over a score of minor and temporary commissions . No sufficient reason can be seen for supposing that this growth will stop now . Development of the political organism is proceeding at a more rapid rate now than ever before . The closeness of the laws to the people is increasing , and it is only natural that more commissions will follow in the near future , as popular interests in certain spheres demand more attention than they now receive . All this will be for the benefit of the people as a whole , just as great good has followed the establishment of the present state commissions . It is l*ertinent to note that the commissions which have been established thus far have abundantly proved their reason for being . From time to time special commissions have done their work and ceased to exist . But it is a broad truth that the permanent commissions were never more essential and never more firmly established than to-day . Thus it has been demonstrated that the development in way of caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been on right lines , and that it would be a mistake to make a change of policy . The facts thus far brought together make it clear that commissions are not an evil , but are a necessity to the development of the state . Those who object to the existence of commissions can have no broad and reasonable ground to stand on , but must rest their objections upon narrow and temporary considerations only . Some of the objectors to our present system see this truth , partially if not perfectly , and object to " irresponsible commissions " ; apparently admitting the necessity and value of commissions as a system , but holding that they are at present inefficient , an ( l that they should be directly accountable to the governor , who , on his side , should have more lower over them than now . If this objection is valid , it must rest upon the fact that the commissioners do not discharge their duties faithfully , or that there is danger that incoixipetence or malfeasance hereafter can not be remedied as speedily as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main , there is no doubt that the commissioners of Massachusetts discharge their duties faithfully , for they have been continued in the face of severe criticism , and have been approved after investigation of their // methods and results . Of the personnel of these boards , of their capacity and character , and of the ability with which they discharge their duties , the following is said by the legislative committee of 1891 , which was appointed especially to investigate the possibility of reducing the commissions , or of abolishing the system of government by commissions . The opinion is that of all the committee , Republicans and Democrats , given unanimously , though they were divided upon the important issue of executive responsibility - " It the commission system enlists in the active services of the Commonwealth a class of men and women whose labor could not be otherwise obtained , and who , unwilling to serve in a clerical or subordinate capacity in return for such compensation as the state could reasonably award , have gladly devoted a large share of their time , influence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commonwealth they love , and in ascertaining , the needs and extending the usefulness of its great practical reformatory and charitable work . " Again , the committee deem " Massachusetts fortunate in securing the voluntary , unpaid services of such men and women as have in years gone by constituted and do now constitute the membership of her various boards and commissions . . The Commonwealth is to be congratulated upon the character and fidelity of those who serve upon its various boards . " These are the words of partisans on both sides of state politics , and hence it is to be presumed that in the main the facts are as they have set forth . It is not to be expected that all of the commissions are administered with equal ability and fidelity , nor that any one commission sustains at all times an equally high standard . Too often the membership of the commissions is a matter of politics . Their membership changes not infrequently in the cases of those which have several members . The ability upon the boards is too often not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been acquired from long occupancy of the office the people sometimes lose the benefit because a change is made for political reasons . But these faults are not of the system ; they lie deeper . They ought to be reformed ; but the system should not be condemned because they exist . As the Commonwealth develops along its many lines , it is to be expected , judging from the past , that the administration of the commissions will be at least up with the times , and probably will be in advance of them . Two distinct problems present themselves in connection with the commission system : the first is how to secure the appointment of incumbents of the highest expert skill and unquestioned character , without regard to politics ; the second is how to protect the interests of the public when a commissioner has proved himself incompetent or untrustworthy and there is need of immediate action for the public good before the expiration of his term . As to the first difficulty , the conditions to be met are the need of the people that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the trouble of getting the best men into the right place . The commissions of most importance are salaried . Many men want them . Half of the governor 's time is spent upon matters pertaining to filling the offices of the state , commissionerships and others , hearing petitioners and their friends , reading their letters , weighing the testimony , and trying to settle the cases rightly . Too often there is reason to believe that politics comes into the account . Here is a discreditable state of affairs , bad for the public , whose only concern in politics is that their interests be well served . The question is whether any better system can be devised than appointment by the governor and confirmation by the council . It is essential , first , to learn who has the best qualifications for office ; second , how to get the best qualified man into the office , always supposing that there is willingness on the part of the man to take the office . In the lower grades of governmental service , the fitness of men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-service rules . But in the case of offices as high as commissionerships , the // practical difficulties of a competitive selection under civil-service rules would seem to put such a method out of the question . Who would frame the questions to determine fitness for a railroad commissionership or for the insurance department ? XVho would conduct such an examination ? Who that would serve could judge of the practical qualities which would pass the best examination , or would make the best report upon a Bussey bridge disaster , or would decide whether the progress of invention had brought the fulness of time to compel cars to be heated by steam from the engine , or could tell whether a man was well fitted to cope with swindling endowment orders ? Perhaps the evolution of politics will lead to some better way of determining these qualities , but for the present generation there seems to be no way preferable to nomination by the governor , who must personally examine the qualities of the candidates and take the responsibility of sending in the name to the council . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the fitness of the nomination . The councillors are under oath to see , regardless of politics , that only well-qualified men are confirmed for any commissionership . They must review the governor 's judgment , not accept it as final . They must use their larger ability of inquiry to learn the facts , and they must take the responsibility of confirmation . At this point arises the argument of those who would abolish the executive council and put upon the governor the entire duty of filling commissionerships . It is not my purpose to discuss here the abolition of the council ; but remembering the unimportance of the governor compared with the Legislature , holding ever to the vital truth that the governor never governs and never was intended to , but that the government is by the people and for the people , having confidence that the true development of the state is in the line of enlarged action by the people , and considering that the council is elected by the people , it is sufficient at this point to say that the case for abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council should be continued . The council , in acting upon nominations for commissionerships , is bound to act impartially , to act in the sphere in which a civil-service examining board acts , and to select under as rigorous principles as those of such a board the successful candidates for these high offices . Evils there are in the system , but they seem to be less than in any other way , at present , of selecting the commissioners . Upon the governor is the responsibility of the nominations . The council can not take the initiative . As ample scope is given for his judgment of men as if he could appoint without confirmation by the council . A man fit to be governor will acknowledge the responsibility ; and , with a fit man , the state is as sure of proper nominations as it would be if the governor could appoint at will . It is for the governor to learn who has qualifications for office . Would that it could always be said of every incumbent that he tries his best to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that politics are apparently disregarded in some important cases , and with this approach to better things the public must ever insist upon the absolute standard of nominations with sole regard to fitness to serve them , regardless of the value of a nominee to the man who nominates him , or to his party . After a fit man has been in office long enough to learn its duties , it is for the advantage of the people that he be kept there , always supposing that the system offers opportunity for removal , if the fit man departs from the path of rectitude , or if he becomes incapacitated for duty and either will not resign or becomes incapable of resignation . Other things being equal , the longer commissioners are in office , the more valuable their services become . If a way of removal is provided in case of malfeasance or incompetence , then there should be no fixed term , as there is now . If the commissioner wishes to resign , he can do it at any time , but if he is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of the public that there be no danger of the substitution of another man . No political party has any claim upon the public offices as re*vards for the political activity // of its members . Commissionerships should be as truly free from the attacks of partisan ambition as are the offices in the classified service . Tenure of office in a commission should be for life or for good behavior , like that of a judge on the bench . Let this reform be established , and a decided step forward will have been taken in promoting the development of the state , in enlarging its facilities for securing the good of the whole by the organic action of the whole through its specially appointed agents . Now we come to the question of the method of removing a commissioner who has proved himself to be untrustworthy or incoml ) etent ; and this consideration shows at once where the real responsibility of the commission lies and what is the right reform to be urged by those who ( lemand that our boards be responsible , and that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions act for the good of the people as a whole ; but certain men are more directly cognizant of their acts and are brought more closely into connection with them than are the mass of the people . To a material degree the responsibility of the commissions is to the people in whose interest they act more directly than for the general public . Their responsibility is only nominally to the governor , for he has no policy , save to carry out the will of the people . He is not the good father of the masses , as kings and emperors have conceived themselves to be , charged with the duty of doing what they can in a fatherly way for the good of the people in their care ; but the government is by . the people and for the people . The intelligence and will of the organic state are the ruler , and the governor is the servant to discharge certain duties in a humble way , while the great body of the law is enforced without any action on his part . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they should have opportunity to demand an accounting by their servants . It is iml ) Ossible for the governor to oversee the commissions so as to be thoroughly and constantly informed whether or not they are doing their duties well . Being more familiar than he with the ( luties of their offices , they can ( leceive him , and a score of them can elude his vigilance , if need be , while he is investigating one . Responsibility to the governor only would imply , on his part , ability to know whether or not they were faithfully and ably discharging their duties ; and this he could have in only a superficial degree . It is evident , in the nature of the case , that the persons who deal with commissions , who are most likely to have detailed knowledge of their acts , will be most likely to detect wrong-doing or incompetency . If injury is done by a commissioner , the injured person will be the most likely of all men to know it and will be most energetic of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These persons , too , who have most to do with commissions are a part of the public , and they are likely to protect the public in protecting themselves . In the nature of the case , it is clear that all the records of the commissions should be open to the public . No opportunity should be given for any favoritism , or for the exertion of any undue influence by persons interested in questions pending before commissions , or for garbling records , or for concealing essential facts , or for doing anything inconsistent with an absolutely impartial and thoroughly competent administration in the interest of the public . These conditions being secured , then the remedy for corruption or incompetence in office is to provide a system of hearing charges by the people as well as by the governor , and for removal , if the charges are sustained . It would not be right to give the governor arbitrary power of removal . Any accused commissioner ought to have a full and impartial hearing . Any person aggrieved by a commissioner 's action ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we reach a method of procedure which would protect the public against malfeasance or incompetency in a commissioner , while it would give all the advantage of permanent tenure for the honest and competent . Let any person with a grievance against any commissioner have opportunity to present his case before the governor and council . Let the // governor bring forward charges , if he has reason for them , in case there is no complaint from the public . Let the commissioner have opportunity to defend himself by lawyer 's aid if he chooses . Let the council hear the matter , and then let the decision be by majority vote , the same as it is in the confirmation of nominations . In this way no substantial grievance could go without correction . A valid system of redress would be open to all who might suffer from a commissioner 's action , and the entire course of procedure would be likely to secure justice between the people and the commissioner , while the good of the people would be subserved . Here , then , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are to continue and to increase in number as the needs of the people demand . They should be responsible to the public , whose interests they serve . Tenure of office should be for life , or for good behavior . Absolute publicity should prevail in every office . Ready redress of grievances should be offered to any person who may believe that the public is not served as faithfully as it should be . In this way the progress of the people in the fields covered by the commissions would be promoted , dishonesty and incompetency in office would be open to exposure and remedy , and there would be ample encouragement to faithful service on the part of the commissioners . They would be stimulated to satisfy the needs of the people as fully as possible , and the state would continue to advance in peaceful adjustment of part to part , with constant development of the organic whole , at a faster rate than at present , when the l ) eoPle lose the benefit of experience of competent men , and no formal avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularly noble function in political development . They are the organs of the body politic which have most to do with its growth . Mere executive officers act within a fixed routine . Commissioners should be alert and alive to all that is fresh and new in their departments , should be vigilant for the people and see that the social organism enjoys all possible acquisition of property , adaptation of inventidn , soundness of idea , and freedom of action . In national matters , as well as in those of the states , there is an increasing application of the idea of commissions . Whether under the name of bureau , board , or commission , the fact of having certain persons to protect and to advance the public interests in different spheres in advance of enacted law is constantly receiving new illustrations . As in the state , so in the nation , these commissions are evidently destined to increase in number and to render enlarged service to the people . This development is natural and healthful . It is essential to the growth of the nation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not the name , but the thing , which is essential , and a commission is an organ of the body politic , supported and empowered by that body to do certain things in a certain sphere for the good of the whole , where more than a mere routine of executive duty is demanded . A commissioner , to be worthy of his place , must be an expert in his department . He must be a genius in seeing the relations of his specialty to the progress of the people as a whole . He must have the intuition which sees the ramifications of his subject , whether it be railroads , savings banks , insurance , electric lights , highways , or any other great concern of the people , into their daily living . He must be able to see not only the sphere of present relations , but he must be able to foresee the wider possibilities of the future and the good which is possible to the state by making the most out of his department . He should be a patient student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has exceptional opportunities for investigation . Generous support is always likely to be . accorded by the people , through the Legislature , to a scientific student of the good of the people in any of their vital relations . The fit commissioner will be a pioneer in his department , for there is no progress so far in any field where it is wise to retain a commission but that still further advance is possible . Here is a standard of conduct for every commissioner to attain ; and if he is not serving the public as far as is l ) Ossible in the nature // of the case , or , at least , to a satisfactory degree , then the public interest demands a change . This conception of the field and of the function of commissions shows that they have a responsible and vital part to perform in the development of the states . They should be in the vanguard of progress . In the main , the progress of the times in many lines is by the ferment of thought and the energy of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions are successful , discoveries in the useful arts are made , solutions in problems of science are reached , business methods are revolutionized , customs are changed , moral standards are elevated , activity quickens the entire community , and the sluggish life of the parts remote from the social , intellectual and financial centres is stirred to a more rapid movement . *Ihis is the natural growth of the organic whole , but the progress toward the goal of perfect organization , which we see only dimly and whose possibilities we can but faintly comprehend , but toward which we are surely advancing in the ( development of the ages , may be greatly hastened by the competent services of commissioners . As soon as a new field of public interest is defined , there a new commission should be established , to further the public interest . Commissions are the official representatives of the people in the new field . They are established organs , powerful , competent and original in their fields of action . *1*he more efficient they are , the more rapid *vil* be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their department , and the more solid will be their attainments . It is for the old kind of executive officers to carry out the will of the l ) eople in the enforcement of enacted law and to observe that routine of duty which is essential to the smooth running of the governmental machine , to the satisfying of the daily and common wants of the people , and to reducing to its lowest terms the friction caused by those who persistently violate law and wilfully injure their fellow-men . But it is for the commissioners to magnify their office , to push forward in the name of the people and for the sake of the people to higher things . We see , therefore , that , instead of abolishing commissions as useless , we should establish them as fast as practicable openings appear for them ; that we are to facilitate , not to hamper , their work ; and that we should use every endeavor to secure the selection of svecialists , of men of genius and high integrity , not of mere politicians , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit commissioner . With competent , unselfish , honest and public-spirited commissioners in every department for their activity , the l ) ublic good will be better conserved than in any Commonwealth where these organs of the body politic have not been so effectively developed , and public progress will be more rapid and stable . Commissioners are a means of good which we can not get in any other way . They may be the eyes and ears and active brain to the organic state . Their service may be far more valuable than that of any governor can possibly be . A worthy commissioner may make an undying name for himself by his service to his people ; and the worth of the people will receive illustration in their appreciation of the pioneer enterprise of noble , gifted and patriotic commissioners .
