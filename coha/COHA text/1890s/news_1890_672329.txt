txt The two orders issued since the coming in of 1890 for the increased comfort of the army in the hours for meals and in the matter of clothing have evidently given great satisfaction . The liberty accorded to enlisted men to wear straw hats . of a pattern to be prescribed by their department commanders , when off duty or when on fatigue duty or at target practice will be appreciated more keenly a few months hence , but it is enjoyed in anticipation now . So also is the permission given to officers to substitute a fatigue coat and trousers of white duck or white flannel for the blue cloth in marches or ordinary duty not ceremonial . In Texas the introduction of light cotton clothing as a substitute for woolen during the hot weather has proved a great boon , and these new concessions will be no less welcome . The meals , too , have now been better arranged for the convenience of the soldier . Reveille is henceforth not to be sounded ordinarily earlier than 5:30 o'clock A. M. in Summer and 6:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . Dinner must begin between 12.111. and 12:15 P. M. , and supper not earlier than 5:15 P. M. nor later than 6:15 P. M. The supper restriction has been called in question by some , though approved by others . Bat there is general satisfaction in having taps not sounded until 11 P. M. Improvements of this character will do much to render army life more enjoyable .
