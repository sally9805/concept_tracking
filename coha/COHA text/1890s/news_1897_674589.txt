txt - One of the most thrilling scenes ever witnessed on the Greenville shore of New York Ray occurred yesterday morning near the Greenville Yacht Club house , at the foot of Linden Avenue , Jersey City . Shortly after 0 o'clock Miss Lillian Roeder and her brother Charles left their home on Linden Avenue , near Ocean Avenue , to go crabbing in the bay . The young people are well known in the Greenville section of Jersey City , Miss Roeder is a clever skater , swimmer , and bicycle rider , and her brother Charles is an expert yachtsman , and one of the crew of the prize-winning yachts Ensign and Frank . Arrived on the bay shore , they went to the cove , a pretty , retired spot formed by an old-fashioned stone dock . It is about 200 yards south of the Greenville Yacht Club house , and is a favorite resort for fishing . They mounted to the top of the dock , which is about 6 feet above water . The tide was rising . At high tide there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived there the tide had not reached its full height . Just as they began to fish Miss Lillian slipped and went over into the water . Her brother , in trying to hold her , also went over the edge with a splash , and the two found themselves struggling in the water . By placing their feet on juts of rock that protruded from under the dock they were able to stand in about four feet of water , As both were good swimmers , they at first made light of their situation . " Stand here , Lilly , " said her brother , " while I climb to the top of the wall . Then I 'll give you a hand and pull you up . " Pinned Down by a Boulder . As he spoke he grabbed hold of a big boulder in the side of the wall and started to climb . His weight pulled the rock from its place , and it slipped from under him and crashed down directly on top of his sister . As the rock , which weighed about 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock falling on her right leg . She screamed as she went under water , and Roeder dropped to her side , expecting that she would come up again . She did not come to the surface , and he went under the water after her . There he found that the heavy boulder was pinning her down to the bottom , and he was powerless to extricate her . He had presence of mind enough , however , to lift her up by getting his arms under her neck and raising her face above the level of the water . Her knowledge of athletics taught her not to lose her presence of mind , and , as she had gone under , she had held her breath . As her head was lifted above the water she gave a faint gasp and cried : " Do n't raise me too high or you 'll snap my leg off . " Then her head drooped in half-consciousness . Roeder did not know what to do . The tide was steadily menacing the imprisoned girl . He could not get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every now and then a wave higher than usual would cover her mouth , and the only way she avoided strangulation was to cease breathing till the wave had receded . His arms were steadily growing weaker with the strain , and he realized that he must get help at once . There were some small boys on the dock , and to them he shouted : " Call for help , boys , for God 's sake . I ca n't stand this much longer . " The Work of Rescue . Members of the Greenville Yacht Club sitting on the porch of their house saw the commotion among the boys on the dock , although they could not see what was causing it . On the first cry for help Charles Johnson of the club , with his son John and Albert Lightbody , jumped into a boat and raced to the cove . They did not get there a moment to soon . Do n't waste any time , " called Roeder . " My sister is pinned fast by a. rook and the tide will cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her much longer . " Mr. Johnson went overboard , clothes and all , and dived under to get the exact locaa tion of the rock . He tried to remove the stone with his hand , but found it beyond his strength . Every slight movement of the rock caused the girl excruciating pain , but she bore it with fortitude and said : " Do n't stop for the pain , but let me get one good breath . " While Mr. Johnson was diving Mr. Light-body relieved Roeder of the strain of holding his sister , and John Johnson hurried to the shore and got a hickory shad pole to use as a lever . With this the men found that their task was still a difficult one . They were afraid a sudden shift of the rock would throw it over on the girl 's other leg . The steadily rising water made the work exceed- , ingly delicate , and Mr. Johnson had to remain almost constantly under water to get the lever into proper position . Other rnenThers of the yacht club , including Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. , had arrived meanwhile and were helping on the work of rescue . The rock was removed , and as soon as it was released Miss Roeder 's body shot to the surface like a cork . She was lifted into the boat and rowed to the rooms of the Greenville Yacht Club . Stimulants were administered and medical aid was summoned . Dr. Limeburner of Hanford Avenue was the first to arrive . He found that the crushed leg was broken and so badly mangled that he did not care to undertake the task of setting it there without further appliances . By his advice an ambulance was called and Miss Roeder was taken to the City Hospital .
