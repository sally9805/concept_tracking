txt A kidnapping ease in Long Ridge , a little hamlet on tl ) e border line between Connecticut and New-York , has aroused the neighbors and caused . much excitement for miles around . ' Little eightyear-old Ward Waterbury , the son of Charles P. Waterbury , a well-to-do farmer of Long Ridge , started for school on Monday morning as . usual . The schoolhouse Is nearly two miles distant from the Waterbury home , and the boy was accustomed to take his lunch and not return during the noonday hour . He did not return Monday night at the customary hour . His father had been taking a load of hay to Stamford and returned rather late . He immediately went to the school teacher 's house and found the boy had not been to school that day . An alarm was given at once and thirty neigh- ? bore started out on a search hunt . During the evening Charles Waterbury , a nephew of the missing boy 's father , came in and told Mrs. Waterbury that he had seen little Ward on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he was , out hunting for foxes . There were three men with the boy , and they had a wagon . As he came along one of the men had handed him a note and told , him not to read it , but to deliver it to Mr. Waterbury . The nephew took it . glanced casually at the child , and went to a friend 's house to eat his supper . Later in the evening ho read it . It was a poorly-written scrawl , stating that if Charles P. Waterbury would meet the writer at Miller 's Bridge with $6,000 he would turn over the boy to him . The hour named was midnight Tuesday , and the threat was made that if he wanted the boy alive the money must be forthcoming . Meanwhile , the party out scouring the country around had found marks of the kidnappers ? in the snow and the print of the boy 's feet They traced them from a point near the schoolhouse to Miamus Creek , two miles and a half away . There the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterbury did not keep the appointment at Miller 's Bridge , as it was not believed that the man would be there , and he was advised not to go . Suspicion as to the kidnapper rests upon Ja cob Hitchcock , who was recently liberated from Sing Sing . Four years ago he stole a horse and wagon from Mr. Waterbury , but was caught and sent to prison for the crime . He made threats at the time that on being released lie would get even with Mr. Waterbury for prosecuting him . He has been seen lately in the neighborhood , and to-day passed the house . Two other strangers have also been seen in the neighborhood . The three men who were seen with the boy by Nephew Charles Waterbury he was unable to describe . He saw , however , that they had guns with them . According to his version they were rough-looking characters . He thought it was all right that the boy should be with them . Indeed , Charles Waterbury acted strangely , and the parents of the stolen child feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . When Mrs. Waterbury asked him what she ought to do , he suggested that she get the $6,000 named as the ransom and then have the bills marked . By this means they could trace the ? kidnappers . He also told a rambling story about a. gang heImew of at Coscob who perhaps might know who the child-stealer was . Nephew Waterbury is a shiftless fellow and had not been friendly with his uncle since the day the latter had refused to lend him some money . Last New Year 's Day he called at the house and remained a little time . Mrs. Waterbury , also has a feeling , founded upon no well-defined basis , that J. N. Lockwood. a veterinary Burgeon , who lives in Brooklyn , and is a relation of the family , is mixed up in the kidnapping . She said he had been dissatisfied with the division of some property in which the family were interested and had claimed that Mr. Waterbury got too much . Under Sheriff Pugsley and Deputy Sheriff Hart of Westchester County drove over to Long Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nephew , but discovered that he lived in Connecticut and that they had no authority to apprehend him on suspicion . The Waterburys live in a plain but spacious farmhouse , set back from the road . Mr. Waterbury owns a farm of 160 acres . He says he knows of no enemies , and that the family difficulties had not been of a spiteful nature . Neighbors are inolined to believe that such difficulties have caused the kidnapping of the child with a view to getting something out of Mr. Waterbury , and that trace of the boy will soon be gained . The child is a bright little fellow and rather forward for one of his age . He has been trudging to school alone all the Fall , was a good boy at study and in deportment . The place where the boy was evidently enticed by the kidnapper and his associates was where the road passed along in a dark wood , for it was there the tracks were discovered first . Indeed , a better chosen country for the work of banditti or robbers could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bedford and Stamford . Is a most lonely one , among thick bushes and along swamp lands . Miller 's Bridge , where the writer of the unsigned and unaddressed note made the midnight appointment , is on the road to Bedlord and about four miles distant from the Waterbury home . According to the nephew , ? when he saw the men with the boy they were going toward Stamford . It is most probable that the boy is concealed somewhere in the recesses among the hills back of Long Ridge , of which there are many .
