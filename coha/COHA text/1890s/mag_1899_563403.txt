txt Co*nrEncB , and especially international commerce , plays today a larger part in the life and movements of the world than it ever did before . Not only the opening up to trade and colonization of new areas , not only that increased production of minerals and of commodities obtained by the cultivation of the soil consequent on the enormous resources which physical science now places at our command , but , even more than these , the extraordinary development of communications by sea and land , their greater swiftness and their greater cheapness-all these causes have swelled the volume of trade to an extent far in excess of the growth of the world 's population . Thus commerce occupies men 's minds more than it ever did before . Classes which in Europe treated it with indifference , or even with scorn , two centuries ago , are now almost as keenly interested as the classes directly engaged in mercantib life . The prosperity of a country , its wealth , its luxury , its power , are all deemed to depend more upon its trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever , not only between individuals but between nations as a whole , and the annual returns of the export and import trade of each country are watched with an attention as close as that which the engineer gives to the pressure of the steam and the number of revolutions of the screw on a record-breaking ocean voyage . Accordingly , commerce is now a more potent factor in international politics than in any earlier period . Wars , which in ruder ages were undertaken for the sake of plunder , which in th' sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were waged , really or nominally , on account of religious differences , which in the last century , as well as in earlier times , were often due to the ambition of mon // archs , are now frequently to be feared from the clash of commercial interests , and this source of peril , which was indeed not unknown before , seems to be quite as serious as dynastic pride or racial animosity . The two most recent grounds of quarrel which have arisen among the European Powers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China . In both of these cases it is not so much territory that has been in question as markets , for territory is now looked upon as chiefly valuable in respect of the trade which it can be made the means of developing . And though the United States has less need than any European country to look to or depend upon foreign markets , since it is itself the greatest market in the world , not only in respect of its vast population , but still more in respect of the purchasing capacity of the individual members of that population , there have been many signs that a desire for the expansion of its export trade in manufactured goods , as well as in food stuffs and other agricultural products , is steadily increasing , and has had an influence upon that policy of territorial extension beyond the seas to which the nation is now apparently comn*itted . In this state of facts , every possible mode of promoting the commercial success of each nation in the fierce competition which we witness begins to be studied and discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skill of the individual man , who is the ultimate factor in this competition . Hence that cry for technical instruction which fills our ears in Europe and which is almost as loud in America . Commercial education is a branch of technical instruction in general , and may be described as that branch of it which is concerned not so much with the methods of production as with the methods of distribution , that is to say , with the processes of sale and purchase . It is concerned with them on their practical side . Economic science investigates the general laws which govern the exchange of commodities . The art of commerce deals with the practical forms which the process of exchange takes , shows the reasons for those forms , explains how they ought to be conducted , and cultivates the various talents which are needed to conduct them with efficiency and success . That there is any such Art of Commerce is a comparatively recent notion . Thirty or forty years ago , it was not supposed , either in England or in America , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phrase " a commercial education " was in- // deed familiar . But it meant merely a non-classical education , that is to say , an education which included no Greek and very little Latin ; and in practice it was understood , in England at least , to mean something " cheap and nasty , " an illiberal education , an education below the level of the conventional gentleman . That it is now beginning to be used in a quite different sense , as denoting a special preparation for business , analagous to the special preparation given to physicians or lawyers or civil engineers , is due not to reflection on the part of Englishmen , but almost entirely to tbe example of foreign countries and , in particular , of Germany , France and Belgium . In those three countries such special preparation has been given for many years  --  the great Institute at Leipzig was founded in 1852 . Yet the example of Geriuany would not have told upon the English , who had long deemed themselves the first commercial people of Europe , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade which began to attract notice soon after the war of 1870 , and has latterly threatened the old supremacy of England . Thirty years ago the English thought the Teutons of the Continent mere theorists , and would not have taken any lessons in practical matters from them . To-day the achievements of Germany in applied science and the expansion of her export trade have set all the rest of Europe to study her methods , and to try to profit by them . Even now people in England are not prepared to go nearly as far as the Germans go in their faith in the value of education , nor in the willingness to keep young men at school preparing themselves for business when they might be actually engaged in it . We in England are really only beginning to discuss the whole subject , and though it is constantly talked of , few positive conclusions have yet been generally accepted , and still less has been done to establish systematic commercial instruction on a large scale . I gather that this is , speaking broadly , the ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better educational provision has been made than yet exists in Great Britain . Accordingly , in the remarks which follow , I shall deal with general considerations rather than with details , and endeavor to state some principles which may hold good both for America and England . There are , no doubt , important differences between America and England . What is called secondary education-that is to say , education higher than elementary-is much more a matter // of public concern in America , where every State has a system of grammar schools or high schools maintained by public funds , whereas in England it is only primary or elementary education that is everywhere provided at the public cost . In America the ancient classical languages have not formed so large a part of education as they have done in England and Scotland . In the United States , separated from Europe by a wide ocean , and with no f oreign language spoken on its borders except Spanish ( for the trifling exception of French in lower Canada may be disregarded ) , modern foreign languages are of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in the United States the conditions of economic and social life have given a keenness and versatility to the mind of young men , a quickness in adapting themselves to changes in trade and a readiness to shift from one kind of business to another , which are more rare in an old and settled country like England . Nevertheless , the main conditions of the problem remain similar for England and for America . The intellectual character of the two nations is fundamentally the same . Their social ideals do not greatly differ . The prejudices which lie hidden in their minds operate in the same way . And though America has a far larger home trade than England , she is becoming hardly less eager to develop her foreign trade . Accordingly , what I have to say will , if it is true , hold true for both peoples . The first question to be considered , for if it is answered in the negative there is an end of the whole matter , is whether a special preparation for commercial life is really of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not , holding that business is a thing which can be learned only in an office or a warehouse , all previous training being thrown away , because such training is given before the concrete facts of commerce have become familiar . This objection might perhaps be answered by an appeal to the experience of Germany , France and Belgium , where commercial opinion is almost ( though not quite ) unanimous in setting a high value on special training , and where in consequence public authorities of all kinds have been at great trouble and expense to provide it . But the objection is so deeply rooted in the minds of many business men who , though they do not say much , exert a wide influence , that it deserves to be dealt with . It seems to rest largely upon two misunderstandings . One is the notion that the advocates of commercial education expect it to turn every boy // into a competent business man . Now this is what no education will or can do in any trade or profession whatever . Many young fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money can buy , do not succeed , whether it be in business , or in law , or in medicine , or in soldiering , because a host of other things besides ability and education are elements in success . Industry , sobriety , steadiness of application , pleasant manners , social tact and knowledge of human nature , the power of inspiring confidence , be it confidence in your honesty , or confidence in your tenacity of purpose , all these things count for much in winning success in any and every walk of life . A physician , or a lawyer , or a soldier may fail for want of some of these gifts , but that is not deemed a reason for omitting to give him all the knowledge needed for his profession . So with business . No amount of teaching , or for the matter of that , no amount of cleverness , will ensure success in business . All that special preparation can possibly do is to make those who have the natural gifts that lead to success somewhat better , and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . And as the majority of young men are neither so capable as to be sure of success , however ill trained , nor so incapable as to be sure of failure , however well trained , the difference which training may make seems sufficient to determine us to give it . The other misunderstanding arises from supposing that it is claimed by the advocates of special commercial preparation that a young man so prepared will , on his first admission to an office or a warehouse , be as useful to his employer as if he had entered it two years sooner , having spent those two years in the office instead of at school or college . But this is not what is claimed . Suppose A and B , two boys of equal diligence and talent , finish their general secondary education at the age of fifteen . A is put forthwith into an office . B goes through a course of special commercial instruction , and enters the same office when both boys are seventeen . B will for some months know less of the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far will be less useful . But two years later , when both boys are nineteen , it may well be that B having acquired the requisite familiarity with practice , will be able to bring his special knowledge and trained aptitude into play , and be more useful to his employer , more likely to achieve ultimate sn ccess than A , whose knowledge and skill will remain permanently inferior . Accordingly , that which is claimed for special prepara // tion is , that though its results can not bear full fruit till after some time , they make so great a difference to a man 's capacity for ultimate success that the time spent on receiving special instruction , during a period of some months or years before he enters business , is better spent than it would be in the office or the warehouse during the same period . Assuming for the moment-since this is a matter to which I will return presently-that there are aptitudes which can be trained and facts which can be imparted specially useful for a business life , this argument would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parallel cases of some other employments and professions . We are now able to approach what is really the chief practical difficulty of the subject , viz. : the extreme variety of the kinds of work which are summed up and covered by the general term of Business or Commerce . Business is not an occupation like medicine or law , with a definite scope , and requiring a well-understood body of special knowledge . It covers all sorts of avocations . There is wholesale trading and retail trading in the home market . There is export trade and all that pertains to shipping goods abroad . There is banking and finance . There is stock broking and the dealing in all sorts of securities . There is the work of accountants and actuaries . There is railroad management and the whole field of transportation . There is insurance business in its various forms . And this list might be indefinitely extended by enumerating minor varieties of business , not to speak of the diversities of goods dealt in , a knowledge of one class of which will be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another class . How is it possible to frame any scheme of commercial education which shall cover these diverse kinds of work , yet how is it possible for a youth to know beforehand-that is to say , in his school years-what kind of work it is that circumstances will lead him to enter ? Few young men have the pleasant knowledge that positions in an office or warehouse are waiting for them . They must take the first , or the most promising , opening they can get . This seems a formidable objection , but there is a twofold answer to it . In the first place , one must distinguish between the aptitudes that are needed for business , and the knowledge which will be serviceable in business . Now the aptitudes wanted , the mental qualities which make for commercial success , are pretty much the same in every form of business . I will inquire presently // what those qualities are ; meantime it is sufficient to say that whatever can be done to train and develop them may be done equally well whatever the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondly , though it is true that some kinds of knowledge are needed for one sort of business , other kinds for other sorts , still there are branches of study a proficiency in which will be valuable whatever be the special form of trade wherein a man may be occupied . A knowledge of foreign languages , for instance , though more helpful to a youth entering an export house than to one who is to serve a railway company , can be turned to some account in a good many different kinds of commercial life . The power of rapid calculation , and especially of calculating without the aid of paper , is always profitable . A knowledge of the elements of finance , or of the terms of book-keeping , or of the ordinary operations of trade and the documents used therein , invoices , bills of exchange , and so forth , is a kind of knowledge all business men ought to have . Accordingly , it seems a fair conclusion that there are certain elements common to commercial education which can be taught with advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore be made the regular and normal foundation of a commercial course . More special topics , a mastery of which will be valuable only in some special line , such as banking or stock-broking , or railway work , may be taught in a large city , where the number of persons wishing for instruction in such topics is large enough to make it worth while to supply the teaching . In London , for instance , or in New York or Chicago , there is hardly any particular branch of business in which a public institution might not be expected to provide instruction , because there would be a demand sufficient to fill the class room . But in cities of the size of Nottingham or Newcastle in England , of Buffalo or Pittsburgh in the United States , this would hardly be the case . In them it would be enough to teach the subjects of confessedly general utility . This brings us to the question of what commercial education really is , what it ought to include and cover . And here let us revert to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a proper course of special perparation is to deal with both of these . It ought to aim at forming and training the mental faculties most needed in business , and it ought to impart the kinds of knowledge most serviceable in business . // Beginning with the Aptitudes  --  and I am speaking of intellectual aptitudes only , for those of a moral nature , important as they are , do not come into our present inquiry-there are two which seem to be specially conducive to commercial success . One of them is the habit of observing , that is to say , of observing quickly , keenly and accurately . It is a habit precious in all walks of life , invaluable to the physician , the traveler and the novelist , valuable to the lawyer , the farmer and the politician . To some classes of business men , as for instance to the selling agent or the commercial traveler , it is just as valuable , and in fact makes all the difference between success and failure . Though no doubt largely a natural gift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , one which may be trained from very early years . The sciences , commonly called by the name of Natural History , such as botany , entomology and geology , afford an excellent means of teacbing boys and girls how to observe , and this can also be done in the practical parts of elementary chemistry and physics . In a somewhat different way it can be done also in the teaching of language , i. e. , the pupils may be stimulated to notice and try to explain differences of phrase , or differences in the way in which two languages express a similar idea . However , it is chiefly of observation through the senses that I am thinking , and for training in this nothing is so good as natural history . The other mental habit is that of reflecting on facts observed , of putting facts together and asking the reason for them . This again , as everybody knows , is a faculty and habit of the utmost utility to men in every walk of practical life , and I mention it in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the professional man or the in n concerned with applied science , are apt to forget that it is quite as useful in modern commerce . Commerce has become a far more complex affair in our time than it ever was before , and can , less than ever before , be successfully prosecuted upon any routine or rule of thumb system . The conditions of trade change from day to day . New scientific discoveries , new financial complications , new political sitnations , enter more and more as factors into many branches of commerce . A man 's mind needs now to have not only a watchful alertness in noting such changes , but a capacity for appreciating the consequences which a change may have upon matters which seem to lie out of the immediate sphere of its influence . In short , // since the problems a business man has to deal with are now more intricate and delicate than in older and simpler days , the business man needs always more and more to accustom himself to think about those problems , approaching them from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his friends or in the newspapers . He has to beware of trusting to fixed ideas and positive rules . He must watch the commercial and political sky as the captain of a sailing ship watches the carry of the clouds and the movement of the barometer , and the freshening of the wind , and the direction of the swell . And his observation must be a reflective observation , leading him on to a forecast . All this is obvious when one comes to think of it ; and I dwell upon it only because the old idea that business was an easier sort of occupation than the learned profession , needing a less active intellect , still half survives in many quarters , and disposes men to underestimate the worth for commercial life of *i stimulative intellectual training . As to the means by which education can form such mental capacities as I have described , this is a matter much more of the skill of the teacher than of the particular subjects taught . A first rate teacher will handle any subject in a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate his success much less by the quantity of information wherewith he has furnished the pupil 's memory than by the habits of acute , independent , consecutive and concentrated thinking which he has enabled the pupils to form . We may now come to consider the branches of instruction which a commercial education ought to include . And here it is first of all necessary to distinguish between the classes of persons for whom provision is to be made . Three such classes may be distinguished . There are those who finish their general education , so far as it is given in school , at fourteen years of age ; those whose parents ' means enable them to continue their general education till sixteen ; and those , the sons of the comparatively rich , who can afford to stay at school and go on completing what is called a liberal education till eighteeii . Evidently a different commercial curriculum must be instituted for each of these three classes , that for the second being wider and higher than that which can be taken by the first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suited for the second . For boys leaving school at thirteen or fourteen , and desiring to enter an office or a warehouse at the earliest possible moment , // no very extended course is possible . They have not time for it , their minds are not sufficiently mature to be fit to tackle abstract topics , and their knowledge of life is too small to make the teaching of things which presuppose some knowledge of life profitable . Accordingly , the most that can be done for them seems to be to provide instruction in one or more of the following branches : ( 1 . ) A practical mastery of commercial arithmetic , and especially a training in the habit of quick and accurate mental calculation , without the aid of the slate or paper . ( 2 . ) The elements of commercial geography , based on the elements of physical geography . ( 3 . ) A modern language , French , German or Spanish , whichever may in the particular locality be most desired . ( 4 . ) Shorthand and book-keeping . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some high authorities doubt whether book-keeping can be profitably taught before the boy has entered an office and seen what books are for . The point is one for practical men to settle . ( 5 . ) English composition , not with the view of forming what is called style , but in order to accustom the boy to state what he knows in the clearest and fewest words , and especially to show him how to arrange his ideas . Composition is seldom well taught , at least in English schools ; and the teaching of what is called English grammar has in reality less to do with it than is commonly supposed . If more pains were spent on making a boy think of the precise meaning of what he has to say and the order in which it ought to be said , and less trouble taken about mere giammatical terminology , better results might perhaps be attained . For young people who leave a secondary school at sixteen , it is both possible and desirable to provide a wider range of instruction directed to commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all these would be taken by all learners . ( 1 . ) Modern languages . ( 2 . ) English composition , including practice in the art of analyzing and summarizing the contents of documents or reports . ( 3 . ) Shorthand and book-keeping ( but consider remark made above ) . ( 4 . ) Commercial geography and the movements of the exchange of commodities in the world at large . // ( 5 . ) A general view of the industry and trade of the country . ( 6 . ) The elements of business practice , i. e. , a knowledge of the chief operations which belong to commerce in general , including the nature of the documents most commonly used , and a comprehension , which though elementary need not be superficial , of the nature of incorporated companies and partnerships , and the use and functions of banks . ( 7 . ) The elements of political economy , especially those branches of it which relate to exchange and finance . Finally , we come to those who pursue their general education up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom will wish then to enter on a special preparation for commerce , while others will first take a university course and then , if they have time left before they enter commercial life , will desire to learn something calculated to be specially serviceable to them in it . The number of such persons will be comparatively small , for few indeed are those whose pecuniary means permit them to postpone the beginning of their active business life to so late a point . But the class , if small , is important , because it will chiefly consist of the sons of men who are already at the head of established manufacturing or trading firms or corporations . Such young people will step at once into positions of responsibility , in which it is desirable that they should have as wide and intelligent a view of business as education can give them . Besides modern languages and the subjects numbered ( 5. ) , ( 6. ) and ( 7. ) in the last foregoing list , the teaching of which , and especially of ( 7. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be encouraged to study recent economic history and the elements of commercial law , and might be taught how to deal *Tit.h statistics , and the art of intelligently watching markets , and understanding the conditions which govern the price of securities . The highest commercial schools of Germany , France and Belgium teach all these things as well as some others which to our English eye appear , if not superfluous , yet so far from being essential that it is not likely that an English or American public would set a high value on them . They also attempt to teach a knowledge of products and goods generally , a subject which seems to belong rather to a special course suited for a particular locality than to a general curriculum . Nor do I mention chemistry , physics , or the other branches of natural science , because universities and technical institutions already exist for teaching them . // The question in what way provision should be made for enabling persons belonging to each of the three foregoing classes to obtain the instruction suited to their needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much on the locality and on the habits of the people . As the boys whose general education stops at f ourteen can very seldom afford to forego the chance of beginning to earn somthing at once , very few of them can be expected to attend day classes giving special commercial preparation . It is by evening classes that they will usually be served . Of those on the other hand who leave a secondary school at sixteen , a certain proportion might give a year to the special commercial course . Yet existing habits , both in the United States and in England , make it probable that the majority will content themselves with getting taught in the evening after their day 's work is done . Instruction given to those already tired is , however , much less efficient and in Continental Europe this is so strongly felt that day classes are warmly recommended . As young men of the third and wealthier class occupy a freer position , it may be hoped that a larger proportion among them will devote their whole time and energy for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of two years  --  to systematic commercial preparation . And in the United States , where the number of universities is much larger , relatively to the population , than in England , so that few large towns lack a fairly equipped university , it seems desirable that the subject should be taken up by the universities , and that classes for the scientific study of commercial economics should be brought into a university curriculum . There is nothing lowering to the conception of a university in its undertaking such a function . The true conception of a great seat of learning requires it to provide for the teaching of all the main branches of human knowledge and skill , of the practical arts as well as of what are called the pure sciences , in a philosophic spirit and upon scientific methods . This view has , I believe , already commended itself to some American universities , and it is beginning to make way in England . In Liverpool , for example , the professors of University College ( one of the three colleges of the Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes recently established in that great mercantile centre . Nor should it be forgotten how much those who are to be the heads of great industrial and commercial firnis may gain by being led , at the outset of their career , to look // upon business as a fit matter for science , as a subject which may engage the higher faculties of thought instead of being regarded solely from the side of pecuniary profit . Nothing would do more to secure sound legislation in all questions of currency and of taxation ( and especially in tariff questions ) than the possession by a considerable number of leading business men of a mastery of the scientific theory of these subjects . This is true of all countries , but most true of a country which , like the United States , is in the long run governed by public opinion . The main conclusions to which this rapid and necessarily imperfect survey of a large subject are intended to bear may be summarized as follows : ( 1 . ) The provision of special instruction in commercial matters is desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence as compared with natural intelligence or with the gifts of character which lead to success , but because the stress of competition is now so keen that no nation can afford to neglect any expedient which may help to give its citizens the best chance . ( 2 . ) The term " commercial instruction " includes some branches of study and training which will be useful to all men engaged in business , and other branches useful only to those who are engaged in particular kinds of work . Provisions for the teaching of the former ought to be made in all considerable cities ; provision for the teaching of the latter only in larger centers of population , where a supply of young men desiring instruction in special subjects may be expected . ( 3 . ) The age at which special commercial instruction should begin must depend on the pecuniary means and prospects of the youths for whom it is provided . Three classes may be distinguished according to age , and three types of courses of instruction ought therefore to be provided for these three classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which youths complete their general education the fuller and the higher in character should be the special commercial course provided for them . ( 5 . ) The most complete course , and that suited to the more mature minds of older persons , ought if possible to be connected with the university ( if any ) of the city in which it is to be provided , while of course retaining a distinctly practical character . It may not be amiss to wind up with two warnings which seem needed to prevent a misconception of what has been said . // First. - This paper is not designed to argue on behalf of what is called a modern or non-classical education . I am not one of those who think that either th e ancient languages , or what are called " literary " or " humanistic " subjects , play too large a part in our schools , either in England or in the United States . Oii the contrary I believe ( basing myself on such observations as I have been able to make ) that Latin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education to any modern language , and that " literary " subjects , such as history , are on the whole more efficient stimulants to the mind ( taking an average of minds ) than mathematics or natural science . Secondly. - Still less do I suggest that the time allotted to general education , whether elementary or secondary , should be shortened in order to make room for the teaching of commercial subjects . The further he can carry his general education , the better will it be in the long run for the boy or young man , and more would be lost by curtailing the time spent on the subjects which everybody should learn than would be gained by any special preparation for a particular euployment . This is a point on which the enlightened and experienced opinion of German educationists particularly insists . They declare that the success of their people in manufactures and commerce is due far more to the thorough and wide training given in their secondary schools than to the provision , ample as it is , which they have made for technical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education succeeds in proportion to the soundness of the general education of the pupils who receive it , and to the extent to which it is conducted upon proper educational principles by highly qualified teachers . This is a matter fit to be remembered in England and the United States , for the demand for commercial education might do more harm than good were it to lead either to a shortening or to a commercializing of general school education , or were it to dispose us to ignore the supreme importance of securing that the teaching of the commercial subjects themselves shall be so directed as to arouse and stimulate the faculties no less than inform the memory of the learner.
