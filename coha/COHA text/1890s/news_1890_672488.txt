Phelps , the General Manager of the National Life Insurance Company , 159 Devonshire Street . Mr. Evans of the firm of Irving , Evans &; CO. said that , to the best of his knowledge , while the embarrassed firm were engaged in note brokerage fifteen years ago , for the past ten years they had.neither bought nor sold a piece of paper . They had no connection with Potter , Lovell &; Co . He had absolutely no idea as to the cause of the failure . The members of the firm are R. Gardner Chase and Charles E. Legg of Chelsea . It is stated that lately they have been doing a lasgebusiness in Western railroad stock , and on the street the general cause given for the failure is that they were caught short of the market . The " Street " feels a deep sympathy with the unfortunate house , and expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement of the suspensibn was made at the board . The news was a surprise to almost everybody , although quiet rumors of trouble have been floating about for a day or two . Both members of the house have a most en , cellent standing on the Street , and both have a host of friends . They have been struggling against the inevitable for wale time , but were forced to give it up to-day , sending the letter to President Spencer of the Stock Exchange announcing their assignment . Assignee Phelps immediately wok charge of their affairs and will make a thorough Investigation . He says that the liabilities are likely to amount to $2,000,000. and may go over that . What there is in the way of assets can only be determined by examination . He declines to make any further statement at the present time , but will have something more to say as soon as he can get matters straightened out . Mr. George R. Chase , son of tho senior member of the house and the chief clerk , said this afternoon : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The calls upon us have been greater than we could withstand . Our collaterals have shrunk in value beyond all expectation , and , much as we endeavored to avert a suspension , we have been forced to it . No outside transactions or speculations have led to this trouble . It is tight money and nothing else . We have done no business of a speculative character as a house , and such as we have done for our customers has been done on a conservative basis . I do not feel warranted now in giving the circumstances that were the immediate cause of the failure . Mr. Chase ( my father ) and Mr. Legg , his partner , have both gone home for the day , but both will be here to-morrow morning and they will be able to make further explanations . We are unable at present to tell how we shall come out , but we propose to do all that we can and to deal honorably by all our creditors . " S. V. White of S. V. White &; Co. , who were formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the assignment of the latter tirm , said last night : " My house has not been in correspondence with them for about two years . Their correspondents in New-York are Holiston , Baas &; Co. and Peters &; Schenck . I am most surprised and pained to hear of the assignment , and so soon as I heard of the trouble I telegraphed my regrets and sympathy to the firm . Both members of the firm impressed me after a business intercourse of two or three years as being thoroughly upright and conscientious business men , and I had so much confidence in their integrity and experience in business that I had no fear of a failure . " At the othee of Rollston &; Bass last night it was announced that the firm would not lose a cent by the assignment . Both members of the firm of Peters &; Schenck were out of town last night , but it is understood that they will not be losers by the assignment , as It . Gardner . Chase &; Co. ' s margins were satisfactory so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought that the assignment of the Boston firm has been magnified in importance , $250,000 to $300,000 being the figures mentioned here in place of the $2,000,000 telegraphed from Boston .
