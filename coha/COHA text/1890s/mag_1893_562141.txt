txt THE House of Lords is the champion anomaly of the British constitution . Now , I do not by any means propose to make myself responsible for the dogma that an anomalous institution can never render good service to a state . It is quite conceivable that some institution which had long outlived its original and habitual use might nevertheless at various periods of public crisis come to play an important and even a saving part in the affairs of the nation . But the peculiarity of the English House of Lords is that it could not now by any possibility play such a part . The day of its destiny is over ; the star of its fate has declined . In former times there was indeed a grandiose and high-sounding lory doctrine about the mission of the House of Lords . The theory was that the House of Lords was an institution of something very like heavenly origin , the function of which was to step in between a blinded and maddened nation and that nation 's selfdestruction . The nation , let ns assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperbolical rhetoric of home wicked and self-seeking Liberal-some Fox , or Grey , or Bright , or Gladstone  --  the maddened nation is rushing on its own doom . It is clamoring for some insane project of law  --  a reduced franchise , for instance , a system of taking vote by ballot , a throwing-open of the national universities to all persons without distinction of creed , or any of those wild revolutionary schemes , the acconiplishmnent of which , as is well known , brings states to their instant downfall . Very well . Now here , according to the ancient theory , comes in the mission of the House of Lords . The House of Commons has failed in its duty and has passed a measure to admit workingmen to the franchise , or to protect the voting citizen by the ballot , or to allow Roman Catholics and Dissenters to win all the university honors they can . The House of Commons has done this , and the nation is lost if the House of Lords // does not step in to save it . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular measure which the House of Commons had passed  --  and behold a rescued state This was undoubtedly the ancient Conservative theory concerning the business of the House of Lords . But the theory has fallen into sad disrepute of late years even among the Tories . The House of Lords interfered to save the state from Lord Grey 's Reform Bill , and it had to pass the bill all the same . The only difference was that the bill might have been passed quietly but for the House of Lords , whereas it was passed because the storm of popular indignation rose so high as to frighten the poor peers into abject submission . It will never , perhaps , be known with any precision how near , how very near , England may have come to a terrible revolution while the House of Lords was trying to resist the passing of the Reform Bill . Well , but if the House of Lords has to give way whenever the people loudly and firmly demand anything , what is the particular use of the House of Lords ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very responsible and a very noble part ; but of what possible advantage is a constituted savior of society who can not save ? Nobody believes any more that the Lords can prevent the passing of any popular measure . The House of Commons is slow enough , in all conscience , about measures of reform . Its natural inclination is to postpone everything , if not , indeed , to oppose everything , in the way of reform . The majority of the House of Commons is composed of steady-going , respectable men without two ideas in their heads . They are inclined to think every man a fanatic or a bore who has ideas of his own on public questions , or , most often , a fanatic and a bore combined . But the majority of the House of Commons are practical men and are responsible to their constituents , and they very soon find it borne in upon them*that their constituents are really in earnest about some particular measure , and are determined to have it passed into law . The familiar idea that the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its own purpose is quite a mistake . The House of Commons is not naturally disposed to disturb itself much about measures of reform . What could the American public think of an institution that has resisted and delayed every great reform proposed by English statesmanship ? For that is not an exaggerated description of // the career of the House of Lords . Every measure carried by the Commons to extend the franchise , to protect the humble voter in his discharge of his electoral duty , to make education national , to make the transfer of land free , to release the tenant from actual servitude to his landlord , to introduce peace into Ireland by any process less stupid and brutal than that of a new coercion bill ,  - -  every such measure has been resisted in the first instance by the House of Lords . The House of Lords is a chamber composed almost exclusively of one class  --  the landlord class . Writing in the ordinary way , and expecting to be understood by reasonable human beings , one would be fairly warranted in describing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord class . But , to anticipate small criticism on my own side of the water , I shall describe it as almost thus composed . Then , being a house of landlords , they are naturally a house interested in the maintenance of an Established Church with its system of presentation to livings as part of a landlord 's personal property . Now , land reforms , franchise reforms , educational reforms , and reforms abolishing class privileges of any kind , are the main objects of English Liberal legislation . Therefore we have a House of Lords , a permanent institution of the state , with a very large majority of Tories in it , and a majority of landlords so great as to be absolutely overwhelming and to leave the tiny non-land* lord minority of no account at all ,  --  we have that House of Lords set up as a permanent tribunal to revise and reject the measures of the representative chamber , the House of Commons . I have already admitted that the Lords always have to give in to the House of Commons in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument to show the absurdity of such an institution . If the House of Lords must knuckle down at last to the House of Commons , what becomes of the theory of a saving upper chamber . But , although the House of Lords can not finally resist or reject , it can delay , it can obstruct , it can annoy and even exasperate , it can tamper with and mutilate and spoil good measures , and so make necessary the introduction of supplementary measures to repair the harm the Lords have done . Let us take some illustrations of this faculty which it undoubtedly possesses . I begin with the action of the House of Lords in regard to Mr. Gladstone 's measure for the repeal of the paper duty . The paper duty was simply a tax upon education . The paper // duty made it practically impossible for a cheap and popular newspaper to exist in Great Britain and Ireland . The working classes and the poor were by its operation cut off from the sight of a daily paper , for the regular price of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started at a penny each shortly before 1860 , but it did not appear possible that , under the conditions , they could be maintained . Mr. Gladstone was Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1860 , and he brought in a bill for the abolition of the duty on paper . The House of Lords threw out the bill . The country was iruruersed in some months of confusion , agitation , vexation . Lord Palmerston endeavored to make it easy for the House of Lords . Mr. Gladstone denounced their conduct with outspoken eloquence . Lord Palmerston had it quietly conveyed to the Lords that they must pass the bill next session . The story used to go  --  and even if it be not true , it is characteristic of public opinion concerning the man-that Palmerston seat a message to the leading peers to the effect that what they had done was a very good joke for once , but that it must not be repeated . It was not repeated . The Lords passed the measure quietly and tacitly in the very next session . Yet those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of 1860 , when the bill was rejected , who listened as I did to the impassioned rhetoric of the late Lord Derby and to the lofty argument of the venerable Lord Lyndhurst , would have thought that the whole fate of England as a state depended on her maintaining the duty on paper . What had happened between that time and the next session  --  a few months  --  to revolutionize the opinion of the House of Lords ? Nothing ; but they saw the country was not with them , and that even their best friend , Lord Palmerston , was not prepared to back them up . They delayed for a few months a measure of vast national importance ; they exasperated many persons and classes in the country-and that was all . What a part for a savior of society to play Let us come down a few years later . In 1869 Mr. Gladstone , being then Prime Minister , at the head of a powerful majority , carried his measure for the disendowment and disestablishment of the Irish State Church . The House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the measure came before them in committee , they so handled it and hacked it that they were enabled to secure a great portion of the plunder for the benefit of the disestablished church and to dodge the nation out of a large // part of its national property . The Irish Church-that is to say , the ecclesiastical staff-was disestablished altogether , but not by any means disendowed . The measure failed for this very reason to give full satisfaction in Ireland . But Mr. Gladstone naturally thought that it was better for the moment to be content with having secured the principle of disestablishment , and so let the Lords give away at their own sweet will a good many handfuls of the national property of Ireland . Again , when Mr. Gladstone 's government introduced the bill for the abolition of the purchase of commissions in the army-a system for which the wit of man could invent no reasonable excuse-the House of Lords passed a resolution which would have practically defeated the measure of reform . Mr. Gladstone met this resistance by what I can not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the army was founded in old days by royal regulation . Mr. Gladstone advised the Queen to cancel the royal warrant which made the purchase of commissions legal . The Queen did so and the purchase system came to an end , and the House of Lords was left hopelessly in the lurch . T*e measure introduced by Mr. Gladstone 's government to establish the system of vote by ballot was rejected by the House of Lords on its first presentation , but it had to be accepted or swallowed by the peers in the very next session . It should be said that even in this second session the peers tried to spoil the measure and render it absolutely worthless as a protection to the voter . The House of Commons stood firm and the House of Lords had to give in . The measure to admit all lay students of whatever faith to the national universities on equal terms was carried by Mr. Gladstone in 1871 , after a similar measure had been twice over carried by the House of Commons and twice over rejected by the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any better word to express what I mean-in the habitual policy of the House of Lords . It will pass anything the moment the country gets angry and makes a row . It will oppose or postpone , or mutilate or emasculate , any measure of genuine reform if it seems at all likely that such a course can be taken with impunity . Therefore one can not even have the respect for the House of Lords which he might have for implacable and fearless fanaticism , or even implacable and fearless selfishness . The House of Lords will not // fight . It surrenders , but does not die . One session the peers through their majority give forth their non possumus . They can not hear of the proposed change . Personal conscience and national honor alike forbid them . To pass such a bill would make them accomplices in the destruction of England 's safety and England 's glory . The voices of the past , the present , and the future alike forbid the House of Lords to sanction such legislation . The dead would arise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a sacrifice of all that English tradition holds most dear . So the heroic attitude is maintained for one session . Then the next session comes and the House of Lords will pass the very same bill without a murmur of serious dissent or objection  --  and will leave the illustrious dead to sleep beneath their marble tombs and their monumental brasses . I firmly believe that the House of Lords is responsible directly for the worst disturbances that prevailed in Ireland during the years from 1881 to 1885 . I think I can make my conviction clear and show that its reasons are good . Mr. Gladstone came back to power in the early part of 1880 . He had been in opposition for six years . Every one on both sides of the House of Commons assumed that the first great and difficult subject he would attempt to deal with would be the Irish land system . He had begun to deal with this subject in 1870 , but he had not made his measure of reform strong enough , or nearly strong enough , to cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his behalf that the government were determined to bring in a measure of a strong and comprehensive nature to deal with the landtenure system of Ireland . But it was not possible to undertake the carrying of such a measure in an already shortened and overloaded session . The Irish National party admitted the difficulty , but asked the government to take in the meantime some steps to prevent the ruthless evictions . The question of eviction was at the heart of the whole land controversy in Ireland . Shall the landlord , or shall he not , have the absolute right to turn the tenant out of the land which the tenant alone , utterly unhelped by the landlord , has converted from a worthless bog into a property ? Shall the landlord have the absolute right to exact a regularly increasing rent from the tenant because of the increasing value of the land , when that increase of value is due altogether to the tenant 's own energy and // patience ? If the tenant can not pay the increased rent , shall the landlord have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another man ? That was , in simple substance , the Irish land question . A bill was about to be introduced to give the Irish tenant for the first time the right to profit by his own industry . We *asked the government not to allow the tenant to be swept off the land before the measure for his protection could be passed . The government consented to our demand and brought in what was known as the **28;332;TOOLONG Bill . The measure simply enacted that if a landlord chose to turn out a tenant he must at least repay him the value of any genuine improvements the tenant might have made in the land . This would be , in fact , to stop unjust eviction , for the landlords would not care to pay a money compensation however fairly earned . The government brought in their bill and succeeded in carrying it through the House of Commons . The House of Lords rejected it . A cry of despair went up from the Irish tenants . Even those who were well disposed to trust to Mr. Gladstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard many of them ask ; " even if he really wishes to help us and to save us , the House of Lords wo n't let him . " Then came violence and outrage , born of despair . I have never yet heard of any country in which despair did not lead to violence and to outrage . In the House of Commons , two years or more after that time , I myself described the action of the House of Lords in rejecting the **28;362;TOOLONG Bill as the fountain and origin of all the troubles and the evils that followed ; and I was glad to observe that Mr. Gladstone gave by voice and by gesture his most energetic assent to my declaration . Of course Mr. Gladstone 's Land Bill had to be passed in the end  --  and of course the end was not far off . It was passed in 1881 . The Lords , as usual , had delayed wholesome legislation by one session only . Bu t in this particular instance , as in some other instances , too , the delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and despair , violence and the shedding of blood . My short sketch of the manner in which the House of Lords dealt with the Irish land question at that time would be sadly incomplete if I did not udd that the peers so mutib*ted some of // the clauses of Mr. Gladstone 's Land Bill of 1881 as to make them utterly inoperative for the very objects to which they were intended to apply . The famous " Healy clause , " for example , they cut and carved until it became a mere subject for vexatious legislation to prevent the tenant from obtaining his rights . It was a clause introduced for the tenant 's protection . The House of Lords converted it into a mechanism for his further vexation . I can imagine an American reader asking why any Liberal government allows the House of Lords to mutilate its good measures in this reckless and wholesale fashion ? Why do not Liberal governments stand out and insist that measures which have been carried through the Commons shall not be mangled and spoiled in the House of Lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think the justification can be quite so easily found . Our over-incumbered system of legislation in our centralized Parliament at Westminster forces us to do everything in a hurry . We are always in a race against time . If a bill gets thrown out this session , it may be very hard , unless it is a measure of the most immediate importance , to find a place for it in the next session . Even if it is a measure of great importance , still there are various other measures of great importance waiting and pressing for their turn . Therefore the government will do almost anything for the sake of carrying the principle of a bill within the session during which it has been introduced . The government , let us say , have brought in some measure to which they attach great importance and which has a distinct and a novel principle . Let it , for the sake of argument , be an Irish land bill . The measure , after much struggle , is carried intact through the House of Commons . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the Lords , and the Lords , not daring to reject it , make such alterations in certain clauses as to render these clauses of no practical value . The bill comes down to the Commons again , and the Commons refuse to agree to the Lords ' amendments . Then there are conferences between the two houses  --  and the time is running on . If an agreement can not be found , the bill will have to stand over to another session . The government , therefore , feel driven to accept a compromise for the sake of affirming the principle of the measure ; as was done in the case of the Irish Land Bill . The bill becomes law in its mutilated form and fails to give satisfaction , and his in oor*rse of time to // be restored to its original purpose by other acts of legislation . Time is lost , much difficulty is created , and great harm is done by the action of the House of Lords . I think if I were a Liberal Prime Minister I would put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important measures to be tinkered and spoiled by the House of Lords . I think I would let the bill be postponed for once , and give the country clearly to understand why it was postponed . I would throw on the House of Lords the full responsibility for its postponemeut . A lesson of that kind would cure the House of Lords very soon of its passion for spoiling good measures . Ireland has , of course , been always a happy huntilig-ground for the House of Lords . It has been so much safer to spoil , or even altogether reject , a good bill for Ireland than to spoil or reject a good bill for England . Until within the last few years Ireland had hardly any strong friends in Parliament . The House of Lords might cut any capers it liked where merely Irish legislation was concerned . No outcry loud enough to reach the ears of the big British public could well be made over a rejected measure to improve the condition of the Irish laborers , or to establish in Ireland a satisfactory method for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects and anomalies of the Irish grand-jury system . Therefore , the history of legislation records an unbroken succession of annual instances to show what the Lords have ( lone with any and all attempts made by Irish members of Parliament to introduce domestic reforms into their own country . There are reforms still unaccomplished for the Irish governing system which have been the subject of legislation during all the sessions of Parliament that I can remember . These measures were orought in every year as a matter of course-as a matter of duty . At first they were rejected by the majority in the House of Commons . Then , by iteration of fact and argument , they justified themselves and commended themselves , as every measure of genuine reform always does in the end , to the House of Commons-the representative assembly , which is compelled to be in touch with the nation . Then came another and a familiar stage in the movement . The measures accepted by the House of Coinmons were invariably rejected , year after year , by the House of Lords . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // They were not important enough , in the imperial sense , to arouse a national enthusiasm and to provoke by their rejection a national clamor , and the peers did not care three straws for any outcry made by the Irish people . But the Irish people have gained what Wordsworth calls " great allies " in England . They have carried the best English statesmanship with them , and , better even than that , they have won to their side the whole liberalism and radicalism and democracy of Great Britain-their allies are the people of England and Scotland and Wales . And Ireland will soon be free to settle her domestic legislation for herself . It may be asked whether , then , I see no conutervailing advantage to the country in the existence of the House of Lords . Admitting all the defects , are there actually no advantages ? I only give my own opinion , and I say , No-none whatever . I am not now discussing the wider question as to the value of a second chamber in the legislation of a state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its present form , or in any form like to that ; and I can only say that I see in its existence much evil to the national interests and no good : no-none whatever.
