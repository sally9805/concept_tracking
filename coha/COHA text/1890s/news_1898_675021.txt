txt It is very like Gen. JOE WHEELER to have been the member of Congress to introduce , on the first day of the session , a resolution offering the thanks of Congress to Miss HELEN GOULD , and providing that durable expression be given to the National gratitude in the form of a medal of honor . Everybody knows how valuable Miss GOULD 'S services have been during the war . Nobody knows it better than Gen. WHEELER , and nobody else in Congress knows it so well . It is fit and right that services so exceptional should be recognized in an exceptional manner . The precedent will be a good one . It is true that Miss GOULD , having no vote , does not much more appeal to the sympathies of politicians as such than if she were a regular army officer .

And public opinion is as distinct upon the point that Miss GOULD was , if we may say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HA.WKINS and CHAFFED and other soldiers of no political influence or account were its heroes . They won victories in spite of the dreadful incapacity of the War Department , which embraces the politics of the army . She did her utmost to mitigate Algerism when it was exhibited in the neglect of sick and wounded soldiers . We must not forget that Miss GOULD owed the opportunity which she so eagerly embraced and so judiciously employed of doing good to an exceptionally great private fortune . This fortune , moreover , was accumulated , and by its founder administered , in an entirely and frankly selfish spirit . But what an immense public advantage this great private fortune has been found to be when it has been administered in a public spirit . Multi-millionaires are reported to be exercised upon the question how to diminish the popular envy of great riches . Let them learn from the example of Miss GOULD what may be the public use of private fortunes when they are under the direction of a warm heart and a cool head . If all great fortunes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! a graduated income tax
