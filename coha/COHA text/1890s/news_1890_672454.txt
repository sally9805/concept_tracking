txt Secretary J. B. Kremer of the State Relief Commission to-day told how the number of the dead at Johnstown was computed . A dispute between him and the Johnstown newspapers regarding the number prompted an interview , during which Mr. Kremer said : " Two thousand one hundred and forty-two was given , not as the correct number , but the number reached after the fullest and most careful investigation . Almost immediately after the flood , and long before I had any connection with the work in Johnstown , a committee bad been appointed to get this information , and its work continued for some two months . The amount of work done by this committee was very large and the data collected were placed on Me . A registration was had of all the citizens in the valley . and in doing this infer/nation was gained as to those lost . " By private enterprise a directory was published , in obtaining the data for which much was learned of the drowned , and a list thus prepared was published . The Tribune and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be obtained by them , and letters received from all parts of the world were the means of receiving knowledge of many , who in no other way could have been reached . " Official information was received from pastors , in some cases , and from those in authority in others , as to the persons buried in various cemeteries . Much of interest was learned in removing the bodies to the burial ground purchased by the commission from the temporary cemeteries , in which they had been placed , and the records of the several morgues , in the main carefully kept , had been placed in the hands of the commission . " The date being at hand , In the late Fall a young man of intelligence , who had been in the employ of the local committee in Johnstown from the first , and who was recommended as one whose knowledge of the previous - work would greatly assist him , was employed to sift this material and give the result , and In doing so he was required to compare his lists with the six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to the commission , which were supposed to give correctly a list of those in the families who had been lost , and by correspondence clear up any doubtful points that might arise .
