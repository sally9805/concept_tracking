txt Living in the wilds or Northern Minnesota , fifty miles from a Post Office , with only a boy for a companion , Dr. George W. Fraker , v'ho planned one of the most gigantic and successful insurance swindles of modern times , Was to-day captured by officers who have been on his track for the last two years . Up to Aug. 12 last there was a standing reward of 820,000 for his arrest , offered by the insurance companies . In the latter part of 1803 Dr. George W. Fraker was physician to the St. Elmo Hotel , the leading hotel in Excelsior Springs , a famous health resort near Kansas City . With seven or eight companions the doctor went fishing on the Missouri River one day , and after dark , while in the company of George Harry , James Triplet . and Jake Crowley , a negro , he disappeared and was seen no more . These three parties afterward swore positively that they witnessed his drowning while rowing in a ealty boat , but after a strict search , his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous to this he began loading up with life insurance , taking $10,000 in the Kansas Mutual Life of Topeka. $15,000 in the Hartford Life and Annuity . $15,000 in the Providence Savings Life of New-York , and $8,000 in the Benevolent Societies of that place , a total of $45,000 . Immediately after his disappearance the insurance companies held a conference and discovered that while 1 he doctor 's income was only about $1 , S00 a year , his premiums amounted to $1,000 annually . Besides this , George Harry and James Triplet , who swore to having witnessed Fraker 's death , were men of bad character , Harry being arrested only the sther day in Eastern Missouri on a charge of having committeed burglary in NewMexico . Triplet was a well-known character in Indian Territory . and is said to have peen drowned a short time ago . Before going on his fishing excursion Fraker had drawn all his money from the bank , saying he was about to leave for California to bring home the orphan children of his deceased uncle . Forty thousand dollars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children . Dr. Fraker , who practiced medicine for eight years , was an active leader in Sunday-school work , but held rather peculiar views on religious subjects . After thorough investigation all the companies except the Equitable refused to pay the claims , whereupon James E. Lincoln , the executor of the will , brought suit in the District Court at Liberty , Mo. , which was afterward transferred to the United States Circuit Court at Kansas City . Robert T. Herrick was appointed jointly to conduct the case for the companies , and was assisted by eminent legal talent In the latter part of 1894 , after an intensely BensiLtional trial lasting two weeks , the jury , ' acting under orders from the Court , declared for the defense . A new trial was granted on technical points , and in February , 1895 , judgment was given for the full amount , and a stay of execution granted for six months , until Aug. 12 , 1895 . On that date the full amount was paid to the executor , and the companies withdrew their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank with the best detectives of modern times , obtained a clue in the latter part of 1894 , which he has patiently followed ever since , until about a week ago , when he learned the Whereabouts and assumed name of the doctor . Thursday night he arrived in Tower , Minn. , with John Wilkinson , Chief of Police of Topeka , to assist in taking Fraker back . Herrick and Wilkinson learned that Dr. Fraker went by the name of Schnell , and lived with a young man in a woodsman 's hut fifty miles from Tower , on the Itasca County Road . A warrant was secured in Tower , and Sunday morning , accompanied by Deputy Sheriff Archie Philip , they started for the place . About twelve miles from Tower , Deputy Philip , who was acquainted with Fraker Under his alias as Schnell , saw Fraker 's companion in a shanty near the wood , and on inquiring where the doctor was , learned that he had just moved to this place and was out hunting . The young man was handcuffed and guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gun o a his shoulder , was found . Herrick engaged him in conversation , when suddenly Philip seized his arms and Wilput on the handcuffs . Fraker thought he had been arrested for killing game out of season , as Philip was also Game Warden . When the warrant was read to him , he was thunderstruck , but admitted his identity at once . He was brought to town , together with his companion . Fraker readily agreed to accompany the officers to Missouri without waiting for extradition papers . In conversation , he stated that he had expected his relatives to get a. portion of the insurance money , and himself some also . He had been greatly benefited , he said , by the waters of a spring where he stopped , and had about made arrangements to buy the place . He would bave spent $20,000 , he said , in improving it When he left for his fishing trip to Missouri , he stated he had no intention of pretending to be dead , but a landslide of the riverbank had carried him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he decided to go to Chicago . While there he heard of so many ill stories circulated about him in Excelsior Springs after nis disappearance that he concluded not to go back , and the temptation to swindle the insurance companies overcame him . On his person was found a charm of some kind . Only two weeks ago a telegram was received at Kansas City from Moberly saying Fraker was under arrest there , but it proved a false alarm . Fraker 's hiding place was only a day 's travel from the Canadian boundary . He had - :been there about six months , coming into : : town occasionally only for mail and pro .. ? Visions .
