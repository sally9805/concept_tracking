TWO YEARS WITH A COLORED REGIMENT . A WOMAN 'S EXPERIENCE . By Frances Beecher Perkins . REMINISCENCES of our civil war hgve been given to the public again and again , and our most able men have recited the details of the great battles and stirring events . But there are few records of the experiences of women in that war . This narrative , therefore , may perhaps claim the one merit of novelty . My wish to preserve the memory of a gallant regiment and its beloved colonel forms another plea for my writing . The present , too , seems an opportune time for me to write , as public interest in the colored troops has been newly awakened by the unveiling in Boston of the beautiful memorial to Colonel Shaw and by Colonel Higginson 's testimony , so widely read , to the value of the colored soldiers . In contrast , the regiment of which I write , though associated with the 54th Massachusetts , Colonel Shaw 's regiment , throughout its 533 // whole career , and specially distinguished in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had no one to sound its praise . It belonged to no state , and therefore called forth no state pride ; while the colonel who recruited it landed in New York at the beginning of the war after years of absence as seaman 's chaplain in China , and therefore was also without state ties . It was in July , 1864 , that I succeeded in getting a pass to enable me to join my affianced husband , Colonel James C. Beecher , in Jacksonville , Florida , which was then a fortified city and held by United States troops . An order had just been issued excluding women in general from the department of the South , lest their presence should interfere with the stern duties of war . I had therefore to go to Washington and present myself in person before our distinguished Secretary of War , Edwin M. Stanton , to show reasons why an exception might be made in my favor . Colonel Beecher had twice failed in his attempt to come North to have our marriage celebrated in our own village church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking he couldat least meetme at Hilton Head , S.C . After months of planning to go with certain friends who would act as escort , and then hesitating to do a thing so utterly opposed to conventional ideas , the fortunes of war prevailed , and the steamer Fulton took me from New York to Hilton Head in five days ' time . I was there met by friends with the news that Colonel Beecher had been sent into the interior , and could not meet me at that point . After a few days ' delay , the morning of July i8th found me steaming up the lovely St. John 's river to Jacksonvile , through the enemy 's country , with officers , soldiers and other more material supplies of war . Colonel Beecher was out on a raid near the month of the river , but sighted the expected boat with his spyglass , and hastened to meet me at the army headquarters , in the largest hous* in the city , then occupied by General William Birney . I will here copy part of a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preserved by my mother . " Ah , dear friends , if YOU could all have been present at that little military wedding at seven o'clock last evening , my happiness would have been complete . I have never read in fact or fiction of a wedding more unique and romantic , and yet so touching and so solemn . Imagine two large parlors thrown into one , with long windows and moonlit verandas at either end ; in place of the usual elegant furnishings , see tables and desks strewn with despatches and writing materials ; behold the glowing western sky without , and the picturesque groups of colored people looking in from the piazzas at the unusual sight . Within are four young men in the full dress uniform of a general 's staff ; a handsome colonel also waits , and a minister in clerical dress . A few moments - and then a fine looking , gray-haired general with sash and star brings in upon his arm a little woman in half bridal attire , and gives this woman to be married to this colonel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined together let no man put asunder . ' Then they salute the bride , and she receives the kisses with the feeling that they represent the good wishes and blessings of all her dearest friends . Then came the wedding supper , also unlike any other ; and then while we sat in the moonlight on the broad upper piazza , the welltrained band of the 7th U. S. gave us a serenade that might well make us believe sorrow and sin had left the earth forever : In a few days a house which had been occupied not long before by my cousin , General J. R. Hawley , was assigned to us as a regimental headquarters . This we called " home " for the next four months ; and before it , by night and by day , a colored sentinel constantly paced , with his gun on his shoulder . And thus it continued during my two years ' stay in the South - a soldier was ever on guard before our door , presenting arms as we passed in and out ; keys were unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only woman in the city , and having gained a little reputation for bravery , it may be imagined that I did not suffer for lack of courteous attention . I was pleased to find that our occasional receptions for the // officers of our own and other regiments were regarded as an alleviation to the homesickness so natural under the circumstances . Housekeeping claimed my attention at once , as our staff officers " messed " with my husband ; and I found it pleasant to vary the army rations by my New England culinary skill , aided by the colored satellites whom it was a mercy to employ . During the middle of the day I could do little but submit to the heat and remain indoors ; but at night , when my colonel was not away on duty in the vicinity , I rode on . horseback with him on his various rounds . The proudest day of my life was when I first donned my new habit , with its military buttons of eagle stamp , and rode by the side of the Colonel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. I may truly say that during my whole time in the South I saw no regiment more manly in appearance , none with straighter line or better drill , nor any more worthy of their uniform , than that which was then called " The First North Carolina Colored Volunteers . " This was one of the first colored regiments , raised at a time when the nation 's prejudice against employing the negroes as soldiers had yet to be overcome . It was recruited in Newbern , S. C. , about a year before by Colonel Beecher himself , from the slave population of that region . On June 13 , 1863 , he wrote me : " I am amazed at the promptitude of these men to learn military drill . In spite of my hard work , I am becoming somewhat of an enthusiast . I wish doubtful people at home could see my three weeks ' regiment . There is an amount of muscle in it of which few in the service can boast . In three more weeks we shall make a creditable show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment enlisted , organized , uniformed , armed and handsomely encamped in six weeks . " Their battle flag , which can now be seen with its many marks of service in the nation 's storehouse at Washington , was largely the gift of the colored women of Newbern , assisted by our beloved sister , Harriet Beecher Stowe . It was made of dark blue silk , fringed with gold , with the rising Sun of Liberty on one side and " God is our Sun and Shield " on the other , and was presented to the regiment on the 4th of July , 1863 . Having no chaplain , and being , like his father and his six brothers , a Congregational minister , the Colonel undertook the spiritual care of his men after the Puritanical fashion . He wrote me as follows : " Sunday eve . Had service at 6 P. M. , before dress parade . I formed the battalion into close column by division and gave out , My country , t is of thee . ' Six or seven hundred good , pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psalm , This poor man cried , and the Lord heard him , ' etc . Then I prayed with them . I had given no directions , but the men knelt down and bowed their heads . It affected me beyond measure , and I prayed for them in faith . When I spoke of their past lives , of their being bought and sold like brutes , of their wives and children not their own , of their sorrow and degradation , many wept like children . " When the regiment left Newbern , they joined the siege of Charleston , and were there kept digging in the trenches until December . They did , however , have an occasional drill , but it was on the beach by moonlight . " Those who saw it , " wrote an officer , " will not forget the romantic sight . The hard , white beach , with the ocean waves foaming and tumbling over it , the long line of black soldiers , with their guns shining in the moonlight , the low words of command , the prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lately come out of captivity , drilling there at midnight in sight of the great land of slavery ! " Who would then have said that in less than two years ' time their drills would be in the very centre of Charleston and their home in its citadel ? Just before its departure for // Florida , this regiment appeared in review before General Terry . He turned to a companion with admiration glowing on his face and said : " That is the best regiment that has appeared on the ground , " and spoke further of the wonderful precision of their movements . After only nine months of training , the First N. C. C. Volunteers came to their first battle , that of Olustee , Fla . A letter from one of its officers , which appeared in the Boston Journal , said : " Our men were brave beyond description ; and as their comrades fell around them , they stood nobly without once shrinking . Overpowered by numbers , our retreat was steady and cool . After falling back a few paces , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which all the time had been waving , while the enemy 's had been twice shot down . When the right arm of our color-sergeant was broken , he knelt down and with his left hand held up the dear old flag until relieved . " The Herald correspondent wrote of this engagement : " The First North Carolina and the 54th Massachusetts of the colored troops did admirably . the former held the various positions in which it was placed with the greatest tenacity , and inflicted heavy loss on the enemy . It was cool and steady and never flinched for a moment . The 54th sustained the reputation gained at Wagner , and bore themselves like soldiers throughout the battle . The two colored regiments had stood in the gap and saved the army . " The First N. C. C. Volunteers was said to have suffered more than any other regiment that went into action . The lieutenant colonel was killed , the major taken prisoner and sent to Andersonville , and of the eighty-six men composing the color company only thirty-four were left . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , until the time of my joining the regiment , were spent in dislodging the enemy from various small points in the state and holding them until there was no fear of their being retaken . An entire company was taken captive on the steamer Columbine , and sent with their captain and lieutenant to Andersonville , Georgia . Those who survived until the close of the war were then released . Jacksonville has changed wonderfully in the thirty-three years which have elapsed since that date . At a little distance it then looked like a New England town , with its white houses and heaven-pointed spires . There was no carriage but an ambulance , and the sand was too deep for walking . Service was held every Sunday in the largest church in the place , which was mled to overflowing with the colored regiments and their white officers . I used to wish my friends at home could see with me that novel gathermg , and hear with me our grand old hymns sung with that indescribable pathos and power that only the many voices of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of our regiment to read and write , and it became my pleasing duty and habit , wherever our moving tents were pitched , there to set up our school . Sometimes the chaplain assisted , and sometimes the officers ; and the result was that when the men came to be mustered out each one of them could proudly sign his name to the pay-roll in a good legible hand . When enlisted , all but two or three of them were obliged to put a mark to their names as written by the paymaster , thus : his John x Jones mark while their eagerness to learn and the difficulty that many found in learning were very touching . One bright mulatto man particularly worked at his letters for two years , and then could only write his own name ; while others learned atonce . Whenever they had a spare moment , out would come a spelling-book or a primer or Testament , and you would often see a group of heads around one book . // A few days after my arrival , Colonel Beecher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a junction of the railroad at Baldwin ; and there he x*emained for a month . We exchanged letters daily by means of a little railway train , and I was twice invited to go and spend a few hours at Baldwin . I shall never forget that first ride in a camp chair on a platform car , escorted by the assistant adjutant general , the provost marshal , and others . The officers and enlisted men were constantly spying right and left for the enemy , and stopping the train to hear the reports of the scouts . We found Colonel Beecher with his headquarters established in a railroad water tank , and his men sickening at the rate of twenty a day from exposure day and night on swampy ground . How we rejoiced when they were recalled to garrison duty at Jacksonville ! Later on , I went up the river on a steamer to Magnolia and Green Cove Springs , both now famous winter resorts . The latter was of great interest from the wonderful green color of its many pools and miniature lakes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard while our surgeon and others were indulging in a bath , and their wild scrambling into uniform again was the subject of much merriment . Later still , on more than one Saturday afternoon , the Colonel and his staff detailed a boat 's crew from the regiment , and we went , like children released from school , rowing within bounds on the beautiful river , where the sunsets equal or surpass those of Italy . Being deprived of the luxury of ice , we were glad to land and refresh ourselves with buttermilk from a farm on the opposite shore , or with a sour and bitter orange from the wild native stock , a kind never exported . At length came Thanksgiving day , which we kept in New England fashion , feasting on wild turkey shot by one of our men . It was the largest and handsomest bird I ever saw , the opalescent plumage being entirely different from that of the tame turkey . But that very night came marching orders for active duty , and at two o clock in the morning our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my husband , sailed down the river , leaving behind the chaplain , the sick , the lieutenant colonel 's wife ( lately arrived ) , myself and other impedimenta , with a small garrison force . Oh , then , the weary , weary waiting for tidings day after day , without boat or mail ! The tenth morning brought news that our troops had been in a hard fight , and that my husband had been three times wounded and his horse shot from under him , and that he wished me to come to him at the officers ' hospital at Beaufort , S. C. He wrote a few lines himself , to spare me unnecessary alarm . A returning steamer took me at once to Hilton Head , but there was some difficulty in finding transportation to Beaufort , - and the most touching sympathy and help were given me . A New York City pilot boat was at length placed at my disposal , and a few hours more of sailing brought me to the ward where my husband lay upon a cot , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can better be imagined than described . My brother-in-law , Henry Ward Beecl-ier , sent me a letter written to him by the father of our lieutenant colonel , which is now before me as I write . It says : " All colored troops behaved nobly , and especially your brother 's regiment then known as the 35th United States Colored Troopsi , never breaking or flinching under the severest fire . Your brother is reported to have distinguished himself for his bravery , and to have been dangerously wounded . He is said to be idolized by his men , so much so that there is not one in the regiment who would not sacrifice his life for him . " After the war was over Colonel Beecher met one of the colonels of the opposing force in the Honey Hill battle , who said it was no wonder he // and his great gray horse were hit so many times during that disastrous half-hour at noon , for the word was passed to the Confederate soldiers to aim at the officer on the light gray . He headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after the bullet entered his thigh at noon , he stood in front until night , before he would allow his surgeon to help him off the field . His men brought off his saddle as a trophy , which is now an heirloom in the family . In Beaufort for four weeks I found board near the hospital , and was more than thankful for my privileges as nurse . Nor were there wanting , even there , kind-hearted women to send their nourishing soups and jellies to the sick and to offer creature comforts to the wounded , irrespective of politics or creed . At Christmas , Colonel Beecher was sufficiently recovered to be removed to the house of General Saxton ; and I am sure the spicy evergreens , with which his house was filled , could never be associated with a livelier joy than mine . We accepted his hospitality until it was deemed safe to travel , and then took a steamer North on furlough . The following 8th of February found us again at Hilton Head , where Colonel Beecher rejoined the army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Coast Division . He found his command at Combahee Ferry , and was received with cheers and every demonstration of joy . He was kept busy for some days in clearing the vicinity of Charleston , and wrote of being in the saddle from 6 A. M. until 6 P. M. I went with General Gilmore 's party to Charleston about two weeks after its evacuation , and found board with a family of Governor Aiken 's former slaves , who were living in one of the lar*-e deserted houses . It would be difficult to describe the emotions with which I traversed the abandoned city and saw the churches and houses riddled with our shells , wondering that so few people were killed by them , and listening to the stories told by those who stood the siege , of how quickly they became accustomed to the terrific explosions . The various fires had laid waste a third of the city , and the ruined chimneys and walls still stood , block after block , - while the grass grew in some of the finest streets . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrecks of time , so here I could enjoy to the full the luxuriance of the high-walled gardens , whose owners had disap* peared and left me to wander at will among them . The perfume of those roses still lingers with me , and I know my husband was justified later in saying he could not find a tumbler to drink from nor a bowl in which to wash his hands , everything in our house was so filled with roses . One curious trait of the Northerners in the city met you on every hand . Each person was eagerly seeking some bit of shattered stone or wood or tree or things even more valuable , to send home as mementos of the ill-starred city , until it seemed as if it might be entirely carried away by these relic hunters . For myself . I must always say to Charleston , " With all thy faults I love thee still , " so very beautiful are its situation and climate , its flowers and fruits , and so thoroughly did I become at home there during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance of Mr. James Rednath , the correspondent of the New York Tribune , who had been appointed superintendent of schools in that city , and was by him made principal , pro tern. , of one of the public schools , with thirty teachers and six hundred children under my charge . One floor was occupied by the white children and their teachers . and the remaining three by the colored ones , so great was their eagerness to learn . Colonel Beecher reached Charleston March v* , and encamped with his men for two days . One of them being Sunday , he preached in Zion Church on Calhoun street , the largest church in // 539 the city . His beloved friend and surgeon , Dr. Marcy , to-day a resident of Boston , high in the medical profession , thus wrote of the chaplaincolonel : " He entered the pulpit in full uniform , through a crowd that filled every standing place , followed by members of his staff . Unbuckling his sword and laying it tenderly on the desk , he took for his text , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His impassioned oratory at times swayed the vast audience , as a mighty wind the tree-tops ; again , recounting God 's care for his children , it fell as the soft dews from heaven , and there was not a dry eye in the house ; and when at the close all bent in prayer , broken sobs and utterances of , Thanks to God we 's free ' attested his power . " The next day we were ordered to Mount Pleasant , a village about three miles across the bay , on the other side of the Ashley , where I had the opportunity of visiting all the famous forts in and about the harbor . My first work was , of course , to set up our household gods from the mess chests and packs of baggage , so that in half a day 's time our headquarters had as civilized and peaceful a look as if we were truly at home . Our troops were still in active raiding service for the protection of Charleston , and about the first of April we were recalled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the northern half , with the rank of brevet brigadier general , his men occupying the citadel on the central square . Here we remained for three months , and here " I dwelt in marble halls , " for our headquarters were in the house on the corner of Charlotte and Meeting streets , opposite the citadel , with a white marble front sufficiently imposing for the representatives of the restored United States government . With the incoming of peace , on the 9th of April , came also the party of northern civilians for the re-raising of the flag of Fort Sumter , attending our *rood brother , Henry Ward Beecher , the orator of the day . I had the pleasure of entertaining him and his wife and several others of the party in our newly occupied but thoroughly dismantled house . We had only two rooms even partly furnished , so we gave our friends a taste of our army picnic life , putting them to sleep on the floor on mattresses borrowed from our surgeon 's hospital stores . But every one was so jubilant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that we would not have murmured at any kind of hardship . Fortunately we had secured the services of one of the best of the famous South Carolina cooks , and our first breakfast of deviled crabs and corn bread , cooked over the open fire in the usual far-away kitchen , was voted worthy of the occasion . The 14th of April was to us , as to all the nation , a day to be remembered . I have a photograph of the scene in the fort just before the flag went up , and with the aid of a magnifying-glass can show our family party . But , alas ! our joy was turned to sorrow the next day by the news of the assassination of our good President , and the northern party returned at once to their homes . I shall always remember our view of the retreating steamer and the group of sad-faced people waving their good byes and catching the shower of flowers tossed to them by the grateful colored people on the dock . Then came the reconstruction time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , because everything still proceeded according to military routine ; drills , dress parade and general orders were unceasing . The army at once reversed its occupation and set about establishing the arts of peace . The planters and freedmen were induced to make contracts by which the ground should be tilled and the produce divided equitably when gathered ; and these agreements were to last until the 1st of January , i866 . Many a little detail of my half Bohemian life at this time comes to my mind ; for I was sufficiently at rest about my husband to thoroughly enjoy it . Tn the early morning I drove // out with an orderly in a confiscated buggy lent me by General Hatch , to the various markets . These were made interesting by the quaint headdresses of the good-natured colored women , the flowers and vegetables , and the grave , ugly buzzards . Teaching and domestic cares occupied the day until evening , when I rode on horseback with a larger or smaller party , or visited some of the northern women called to the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the nation 's wards . " These , with the white officers , formed our only society while in the South ; but a very pleasant society it was , the women coming from our best and most cultured families . Our next move was in July to Summerville , about twenty miles from Charleston , the headquarters of the second sub-district of the military district of Charleston , called also the Collection district . Here my husband was in command of a territory about ninety miles square , in which were 6oo plantations , two quite large towns , and the sea islands so famous for their cotton . Summerville is to-day advertised in our northern papers as being a peculiarly healthful and attractive resort , and was then so considered by all the rice planters , who were unable to remain on their plantations during the heat and malaria of summer . Our regiment has not yet lost its connection with this pleasant spot , for one of its captains is now the postmaster . I found it one immense pine grove , miles in extent , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees ; for there were no fences or gardens to speak of , and the roads wound in and out among the trees without law or order . The spicy smell of the pines filled the air , and the clouds and sky seen through their tops were enchanting . We had the largest house in the place as headquarters , and at one end of the room extending across the whole front of the house my General had his desk , and gave audience in the morning when at home , while I had mine at the other extremity ; and a very busy life we led , - for our fatherly Government , after chastising its children for misconduct , sought to restore them to their former place by feeding the hungry , clothing the needy , distributing seed and implements to the laborers , and protecting all until the civil courts could resume their functions . People came to our headquarters from twenty miles around to receive the ration tickets for meat , corn meal , coffee , sugar and beans , as required by the necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only the old , the sickly , and young children were thus fed . The examination of these pensioners was at first conducted by our quartermaster ; but it proved to be more truly a woman 's work , and was therefore given to me . The tickets were issued without regard to color , and I had on my list some most touching cases of ladies born and reared in luxury , whose pride had to suffer agonies in receiving the necessities of life from our restored Government at the hands of its Yankee representatives . I remember also some very demonstrative and pretty mulatto women , who with prayers and tears would throw themselves at my feet and embrace my dress . The saddest cases to look on were those of the " poor white trash " with their bloodless faces and mournful eyes . As winter came on , boxes of clothing were sent me from England and elsewhere for distribution . I recall one box in particular , from the Quakers , with fifty dresses in it of pretty new plaid homespun stuff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special pleasures to receive some ragged , perhaps halforphan child , lead her or him first to the bathroom maid and then to the clothing room , where I would select appropriate apparel , have it put on , and then give the happy little person a good dinner , after which the child went out of the house so transformed as to be almost beyond recognition . Another pleasure that autumn I re // call with special vividness . A certain bridge over the Ashley , on an important road about five miles from Summerville , had been destroyed by our troops in the necessities of war , and was again needed . My husband , being a man of versatile talent , detailed a sufficient force of his men for the work , and in three weeks had thrown a very pretty and graceful structure over the river . Toward the middle of each day , while he was at work on the bridge , I mounted my horse and , taking two orderlies with provisions , cantered down to the lovely spot . Here under the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our repast , and roasted oysters in the shell , broiled our chicken or venison , and made our coffee . Life with the army did not seem an unpleasant thing in those days ! Nor did it while we had command of the railroad from Summerville to Charleston and rode like the uresent millionaire magnates of the North . The train of several cars would be made up and ready to start , when the proper officer would step forward and , touching his cap , say , " General , the train is ready . " Our Christmas of i86* deserves mention , as Peace on Earth was specially illustrated in home decorations of holly and mistletoe mingled with drapings of our beloved banner , and at the schoolhouse by the largest evergreen tree that could be procured . This was brilliant with gifts for our two hundred colored children , who , wreathed in smiles and new clothing , delighted us in our turn with their singing and good manners . After the usual elaborate dinner , which seemed strange enough with the weather as warm as summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General performing the ceremony in a very impressive manner . One of our enlisted men was united to the girl of his choice , with some fifty of their friends as onlookers ; then a big bridal cake was distributed , and we had fireworks on the lawn . These weddings were a very common occurrence at our headquarters , being 54 ' in accordance with the instruction of the Rev. General . He was very particular that there should be no " cause why the two persons present should not be joined together " ; and therefore , while he examined the groom in one room , I took the female candidate into another and questioned her . Many a dusky bride I helped to adorn with white robes for her bridegroom , for they thought they could be married in nothing else . My husband always invited me to go with him when it was possible , on what to me were pleasure excursions , to different parts of his district . I should otherwise have seen little of him , as he was always taking a few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another where he was needed . Once we took the cars from Charleston to Branchville , sixtytwo miles , and then a horse and buggy , twenty-one miles , to Bamberg , on the Augusta railroad , where a business meeting of planters had been called . We had to ford a deep stream where the water came over the sides of the buggy and lifted it from the ground with every prospect of overturning it . A letter which I wrote my mother that winter lies on my desk , dated January 7 , i866 , at Lowndes ' plantation , Coinbahee Ferry , S. C. It says : " Here I am unexpectedly in a large , old , empty house on an immense rice plantation - the only house left standing for miles around , for we are on the line of Sherman 's march . The first floor is occupied by a detachment of our troops , and the second by a surgeon and two young men who came for a week of duck shooting , the General . two orderlies , my maid and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour when I rode up in a mule cart from the landing , but being urged to stay , Tam glad to have so entirely new an experience . Imagine me walking on the narrow paths where the rice is sown , and feasting on the most delicious , delicately fed ducks in the world . We have them broiled for breakfast , and roasted for dinner on a bayonet thrust through a pine box , open towards a roaring wood fire , and then we have them again cold for supper . Pine boxes supply our only furniture ; but the garden still has blossoming jessamine and japonicas . The people are different from any I have met // hitherto . The blacks are more ignorant , and are obstinate and repulsive in appearance , - indeed , they are unable to talk so that we can understand them ; while the white planters are the most cultured and gentlemanly possible . I met on the boat a member of the Heyward family , so lately the owner of seven hundred negroes , and nothing could exceed his courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work here , organizing labor on a plan hitherto unattempted . " When the order was issued forbidding the further use of the mutilated prayer for the President and commanding the return to the old words , " Behold and bless thy servant , the President of the United States and all others in authority , " there were found some who did not at once obey , and General Beecher had to notify them by letter orpersonally . One of these cases was that of the rector of the Summerville church where he attended worship , and theresult of theacquaintance , begun in so unpromising a manner was a most enjoyable and lifelong friendship . Mr. W. was ill at one time , and fainted in the pulpit , and the first to spring forward and carry him into the vestry was my husband . Afterwards , when an organist was not forthcoming , the singular anomaly was presented of a Confederate clergyman officiating at one end of the lovely old church while the general commanding the United States forces presided in the organ gallery at the other extremity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groves , which were God 's first temples . The General found that the freed people , being religiously inclined , could be taught their new duties in no way so well as by his plain sermons and speeches , combined with singing and prayer . Therefore many a romantic and beautiful spot , where country roads intersected , saw a quiet Sunday crowd , sitting on fallen trees , fence rails , stones , and even on horseback and in wagons , listening to the eloquent teacher with eager attention . Men , white and black , with women and little children were there ; and at the close what hand-shakings and blessings there were ! My memory pictures of those scenes I value most of all . I must say a word of the army work which came under my own eyes . Our district had , in consequence of its vicinity to Charleston , suffered more than any other . It was first stripped of supplies for the Charleston army , then by that army on its retreat , again by the Coast Division of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a difficult task to bring order out of all this confusion , and to convince men that the reign of peace had begun . The change from slave to freed labor was a most radical one , and affected all classes . No one knew exactly what ought to be done , and in the absence of any general law regulating labor and payment for labor each officer was left to rely mainly on his own judgment . Some trouble came also through the agents of the Freedmen 's Bureau , who were not always wise . They seemed to consider it their duty to pet the freed people , to promise them land for their own , to excuse them from labor , and to foster a spirit of distrust of their late owners . My husband thought the Bureau should be used only as an agency to help those people to take care of themselves . He did not believe that a forty-acre lot was a necessary adjunct to freedom , nor that a man was degraded by working for wages . Between the planters and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lasted until the first of January , i866 . They provided that the negroes should remain on the plantations where they were , and go to work . A certain share of the crop was to be theirs - a fourth , a third , or a half , as agreed ; and in spite of all obstacles , sufficient crops were thus harvested to provide food for another year . In a letter to his sister that winter , General Beecher says : " A perfect chaos was anticipated , so I started in December and addressied public meetings of whites and freed people in various parts of my district . My motto // was Fair work for fair wages . ' In consequence , by the middle of February 300 contracts were made , and before the end of the month the whole mainland of my command was in complete order . No loafers , white or black , were allowed , and only ninety whites and eighty colored persons were receiving rations , and these were entirely women and children . Then I inspected thoroughly the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the Bureau . Affairs there had become so demoralized that I was obliged to move a force upon the island and disband the so-called local police , and thus preserve order . This was done to the entire satisfaction of the Major-General Commanding ( Sickles ) . Then the Government began to restore plantations to the original owners , and the question of contract came up . I found here an entirely different class of people from those I had instructed on the mainland . Their worst feelings of bitterness and laziness had been encouraged , carpet baggers had speculated among them , and the Government had been swindled by improper issue of ration tickets , until no white man could go upon the island except at the risk of his life . I quietly sent a guard with orders to arrest any officer of less rank than myself , who should issue a ration on the islands of my command . These were Edisto , Wardmelaw , Johns and James . I set the people at wOrk on all the plantations where the owners were not on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation should first offer to his own people a fair contract , which they should accept , or leave the place to give room for others to come in . This so pleased General Sickles that he made the order general throughout his department . This has been a labor requiring intense study , hard riding , and no small amount of patience . But it has paid . ' " General Beecher was very successful in this new and difficult task of the re-organization of industry and restoring of civil government . He restrained all excesses , and tried to develop a spirit of harmony between the planters and laborers , so that his district , from being the worst in the state , gained an enviable reputation . He merited that which a paper of the time said of him : " Honest , bold , uncompromising and consistent , with his 543 whole heart in the work of securing equal rights to all men without regard to color , he brought order out of confusion , and obtained the confidence of both the freedmen and their late owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been guided for a sufficient time by our best military leaders , who had won the respect of the best men in the South , and had had their hearty cooperation , no such time of misrule would have been known as followed the withdrawal of our troops . The three years for which General Beecher 's regiment was enlisted came to a close the first of June , i866 , and the whole regiment was then brought to Charlestown and bivouacked near the city . They were paid off and discharged the next day ; and then most of the men went quietly back to Newbern . It was recorded in their favor that no regiment ever went out of service more quietly and handsomely . Many a letter have I had since that day from those stalwart colored men , some of them written in a hand laughably like my own , telling me of the education they had gained while in the regiment and of their devoted love to their Colonel , so that the memory of his words and teaching had been ever with them . 1'Iany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for my own part I am grateful that I was counted worthy to have a hand in the uplifting of such a race . Some years ago the men of the 35th U. S. C. T. sent to me for a life-size portrait of their loved Colonel . When it reached them draped in a large silk flag , they hung it on the walls of Post No. i i of the Grand Army of the Republic . This they had organized and named the James C. Beecher Post ; and there to-day the name and the picture together form a touching memorial in the very heart of Charleston , of a faithful Northern general .
