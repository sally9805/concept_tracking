By WHIer Blackl'urn Earle . LD MOTHER RIGBY was so well pleased with her scarecrow that she decided to let him take a pull or two at her pipe and send him into the world with a mouthful of " sentiments , " to seek his fortune " among the other men of straw . " And so out into the world went Feathertop , and for a time he prospered ( as those who enjoy the confidence of the devil are apt to do ) ; and he would doubtless have continued to prosper but for the sudden awakening of a spark of divine sympathy in his breast : a fact which , at the first glance , remembering the implication of the title of this paper , scarcely makes my point . But this is one of those subtle legal concessions that are made in court to show a catholic spirit , and surprise the Bench with the force and lucidity of one 's argument in contrast .

But the Elizabethan writers had the advantage of writing for an age that was coarse-grained enough to enjoy grown up men and women , and the common emotions of grown up men and women , in its literature : possibly because science had not then taken complete charge of men 's passions , and so they found their natural presentation in poetry and the drama . The plea that is oftenest set up for the maintenance of the Watteau style of literature is , that this age is not robust enough in taste to endure the truth ; to which the answer should be that art is not formed upon the taste of the multitude , but the taste of the multitude is to be formed upon art , or left to wallow in its congenital miriness . This is an utterly specious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not born with a knowledge of the alphabet , he can never read literature . A long course of sensational novels ( the mastery of the alphabet having been accomplished ) will not assist in the appreciation of Shakespeare . But a long course of Shakespeare will assist in the illumination of all literature and life . Every book that does not help in some measure to illuminate life , is in the exact proportion of obscuration a pernicious influence ; and to illuminate life , a writer can not despise the materials of the great drama which the Creator has put to his hand . The man has lost his soul , not found it , who despises and withdraws from his fellows and the examination of the mystery of life . Feathertop was finally exiled to the turnip field to act in the capacity for which he was originally intended ; and there have been many writers who simply robbed the turnip patch for their human nature . Feathertops have often flourished abundantly in works which have secured remembrance through the possession of qualities foreign to the Feathertop tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . But one can willingly forgive an author the perpetration of a dozen dull narrative poems , or novels , for a few good lyrics , a little good philosophy , some pages of witty paradoxes , or some pictures of the times that make us forget the Feathertops of the fiction , as well as those around us , in a world that is new to us because it is that of yesterday . In th' essay that mixes up reminiscences with fiction , and fiction with literature and gossip , for instance , one is willing to forgive almost everything for the setting , and the personal revelations .

I think this gives a suggestion both of the fictitious population which I have in mind and of that class in the community which it entertains  --  a class which sometimes , in one 's choleric moments , when one 's memory for compensations is short , seems to be almost equally as preposterous in this world of wonder and mystery . It is that class which can not conceive of literature having higher purpose than that of affording mere amusement , although , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ministerial office , which , as a moral agency , can never be compared with literature . Whose sermons , except Christ 's , will live as long and reach as many minds as Shakespeare 's plays have lived and won already ? If the art of Shakespeare is only to be regarded as an amusement , what is one to think of the office of the mere bishop ? The written word outlasts temples and pyramids , and cities and peoples , and we do not want the amusements of inferior natures cast in such an imperishable mould , even though , by the law of compensations , the rank luxuriance of each year 's growth of bastard literature usually relegates the crop immediately preceding it to obscurity and the trunk-maker . Its very prevalence insures its destruction , Just as the multitude of newspapers is the reason that in most houses you can not find a newspaper twenty-four hours old in a whole state of preservation . The air on mountain tops is not changed to suit the lungs of those who adventure there , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of the greatest good of the greatest number , may be advanced , indeed often is advanced , for the dilution of thought , but one might as well try to hold the lightning in check as to ask thinkers to conform to the standard of the thoughtless . The writer is but the clerk of a higher power , and the same law which governs the lightning governs thought . And to secure due performance in the agent , Nature deprives him of the power of facile adaptation to existing demands and conditions , and supplements necessity with the tenacity of despair . If every poet and philosopher , who has lived in semi-starvation all his life , could at fifty ( when penury begins to oppress the body as it does not in the enthusiasm of early manhood ) , have obtained a comfortable livelihood at some other employment , in most cases we should not now possess their completed poetry or philosophy . For the most practical of all employments , Nature selects those whom the world considers unpractical , and so that she may not after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a measure of moral vision , that so-called practical things seem to them either insignificant or portentously impossible - for in the making of man , Nature is lavish of paradox . Thus , a genius clinging to his narrow plank , tempest-tossed in the sea of life , rising and falling under the lowering sky of fortune , finds himself surrounded by men floating by in what seem golden argosies in a sunlit calm , and he would change places with them ; but the deep sea is between them and they do not heed him , and so he clings to his plank , and tossed again to the crest of the wave , he looks down upon a black and troubled sea upon which no argosies ride , but from which come the cries that have rung in his ears since boyhood . This does not mean that all the joy and color should be abolished from literature , and blackboard sociology or photography // substituted for them , but that the affording of amusement should be subservient to the affording of the higher pleasures , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire for mere amusement is disease , and is in compatible with any real appreciation of literature , and its gratification is impossible to the writer of literature . It is this public itch which has robbed genius only too often of the sun in the heavens , and made the invention of printing one of the greatest obstacles to real education . The only satisfying pleasures involve a moral element , and that pleasure only is communicable which is felt . As some one has well said , " There are no real pleasures without real needs . " Amusement is the dissolute half-sister of Pleasure ; but the discerning know that to assiduously court the one leads but to the troughs of the lost , and to seek the other means to come into one 's inheritance and go through life with seeing eyes . The literature intended simply to amuse is a spiritual incongruity ; it is the murdering of thought . And if it is a capital offence to murder a man , how infinitely more heinous is it to stifle thought which might lead a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is sometimes more criminal to suppress a book than to murder a single individual , whose characteristics may actually lend some color to the hideous theory of " total depravity . " A great thinker had better leave his family unprovided for , and be true to himself ; than listen to the cry of the market-place that bids him worship its gods instead of giving ten isolated thinkers his true and spontaneous thought . The eternal music of the sea and the woods is not the music to jig by , and the man who has ears for it and takes heed of the mob and jigs , murders his soul for bed and board . Literature need not be either doleful or impossible to be healthy ; and mere crude health is not sufficient to make thought literature . But one of the most dreary things in the world , to people of healthy imaginations , is the so-called literature which does not touch their imaginations and sympathies , because it is wholly detached from the natural . It is a healthy instinct which impels men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper is essentially moral in its inferential teaching ; and we can only enjoy the grotesque through its play upon the normal . These do not falsify ; they but throw the true and the beautiful into strong contrast . The introduction of truth in literature abolishes nothing that is beautiful , helpful and vital . But the exclusion of truth is a movement wholly adventitious in its character , is born of extrinsic necessities foreign to the artist 's real impulses , and it involves the exclusion of all that is beautiful and vital , and reduces literature to the artificiality of confectionery . The wedding-cake is not the symbol of marriage and home , and a literature that travesties the moral integrity that underlies all conventional life , is a politicftl instrument , but it is not literature . This is the leprosy that has entered the very vitals of the greater part of contemporary English literature , and has even tainted the work of some of the best minds in England . With eyes to see , the English writers have not dealt with life with the imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their individual impressions , but have allowed the conventional governmental opinions to color their pictures . They have thrown philosophy overboard , and have produced literature that would receive a majority vote of commendation in the House of Lords . Thackeray startled the English world by robbing the nobility of its traditionary virtues of inherited principle , courage , pride , etc. ; but he could not quite bring himself to believe that there was not some divine potency in a rentroll which was entirely lacking about an income derived from the selling of wine or bread or clothes . The Titanic babes of literature - infantile and Titanic at once in their strange discomfiture in the face of troubles so clearly illusory , contrasted with their superhuman welding of apparently overwhelming circumstances - are intended to be broadly complimentary to the admirable qualities of dulness . As a matter of fact , in spite of the instinctive hypocrisy and self-flattery of the ra&amp;e , only the weakest minds are contented with such crude coloring ; and hence , in a degree , the // widespread contempt of , or condescension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " practical " is accounted for by an unfortunate acquaintance with such vaporous literature , in the intervals of a constant and intimate acquaintance with all sorts and conditions of men , revealing life in the quick . The generality of men , although not much given to reflection upon life , in the school of experience acquire by a sort of divination a surer test of literature than that afforded either by comparative criticism or the study of systematized philosophy , and they know that the books are few that afford a glimpse of the mystery in the world . Hence the distrust which finds a crude expression among the ignorant in one of their congenital beliefs , that " books are made up of lies , " while the theatre , which appeals more directly to the senses , has only got to adopt real horses and locomotives to be " true . " Literate and illiterate do not realize it often , and when they do , only vaguely in the crises of life , but in the whirl of the world they are dimly conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but rarely even suggested in literature . But withal , one must admit the extraordinary potency of bad portraits ( that seem to flatter through the elimination of the human ) , over the minds of men , who look upon life without that imagination , which alone reveals man as well as nature truly . It is indeed ludicrous , and somewhat pathetic too , that so many thousands of good honest folk accept the libels made upon them with such cheerfulness , and with such an entire ignorance of the complexity of their own being , as to actually endeavor sometimes to imitate in conduct and character the poor pasteboard silhouettes of themselves - the miserable changelings of fancy , that have perhaps already almost broken the hearts of their creators , whose vision exceeded the cunning of their pens . Emerson says : " The soul is superior to its knowledge ; wiser than any of its works . The great poet makes us feel our own wealth , and then we think less of his compositions . Shakespeare carries us to such a lofty strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . " Thus the great writers teach us to turn our curiosity into self-knowledge , and to discover that beauty in life which we have sought , mistrusting our imaginations , and failed to find , elsewhere , whilst they have carried discovery in our common lives to the point where perception passed beyond expression . We have not got a tithe of the beauty that has thrilled the hearts and minds of the poets , for there are no true equivalents in language for heart throbs . The inadequacy of words has been the exquisite torture of the greatest imaginations . The greatest writers have not made men wonder at their skill in creating a fictitious world , or even in depicting life , but they have made men suddenly awake , lay down the book and say , " How wonderful is life ; what a mysterious being I am ! " There is no surprise , no strangeness ; all is in complete relevance with every life , bare of extrinsic circumstances , and every man in a flash naturally redeems his inheritance . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men say : " How extraordinary ! What next ? " Thus the Bible and Shakespeare are found in most homes where other books are regarded as an extravagance or a sin . One of the most original and suggestive thinkers I have ever had the good fortune to know was so straitened in circumstances that his whole library consisted of a Bible and a Shakespeare . But then he was not contained in his library . It is perfectly true that some of the mechanical monstrosities to which I have referred under the generic term of Feathertops , are introduced to us in a setting of consummate literary art ; but in the sister arts we do not so much consider the marble or the frame , or the fineness of the colors , as the complete work - the harmony of details in true proportion . One can magnify like Michael Angelo , and still keep within the limits of truth , indeed lend emphasis to truth ; but art is only art through its power of suggestion , of awakening certain emotions and instincts , and so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Japanese doll in her arms is incongruous , and leaves untouched the sentiment of reverence for womanhood and the love // of motherhood , however beautiful the Madonna or perfect the doll . This is a violent parallel perhaps , but caricature is sometimes the only medium which properly reveals caricature . A setting of human conditions about lay figures , or the investing of human creatures with unrecognizable emotions , is just as incongruous , and no excellence in the literary treatment of the background can entirely redeem the whole from the charge of caricature . The figures in the foreground must satisfy before one can consider the atmosphere . The latter is necessary , of course , but in the whole picture is merely accessory . For instance , we grant the realism of Byron s Manfred without thinking of the impossible background . To set up certain literary lay figures as the standards of comparison for the delineation of men and women in art , because the treatment of the subordinate details shows the touch of genius is as ridiculous as to believe in the mental and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on account of the splendor of the appointments in his house : which , by the way , is precisely the procedure of one half the world . Christianity never abolished idolatry in any corner of the world . In the criticism of literature , and in literature itself idolatry has been almost as rampant as in politics and society and religion , and the cause is that literature by a logical necessity must go to life for its material , but it has been so often perverted from its true purpose as not to be a reflection of life , but a reflection of reigning social and political prejudices . This element once established makes literature not a light for the future but a bundle of reminiscences and retrospections . Entertaining literature may be retrospective ; great literature must be introspective , and true to the atmosphere of its time , independent of all fashions and polities . The English veneration for the trappings of wealth , has compelled all but the very greatest English writers , to look out upon life through a well-filled butler 's pantry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idealism and romanticism , we can find little but political tracts setting forth the divinity of precedents . Its teachings are , mainly , that those who eat off silver plate are the elect of God , and to these only is the grandeur of life revealed . And yet there is the strongest temptation for every man to tell the truth when alone with ink and paper , for in the exaltation of thought the gospel of expediency loses its force - a fact which shows to what an extent tradition in England has supplanted instinct . In England men are content to remain " in that station of life in which it has pleased God to call them " - that is the British formula , imbibed with the mother 's milk ; and this is not so dreadful , for ambition is a cheat , and Fate has always a card up her sleeve ; but they are also content with the ideals of life supplied for their station by those whom " God has pleased to call " to a higher . Predestination is in the unwritten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English church thanks God for health and wealth , and little else . Everything has its genesis , and it may be supposed that smugness as a distinct literary virtue and excellence in Great Britain is traceable in some way to the accession to the throne of His Royal Highness Prince William of Orange , who was the personification of this virtue - an invention of the devil . Smugness was certainly not a trait of the Elizabethan age ; and with all the narrowness of the Puritan spirit , the Puritan literature was too sincere to be characterized as smug ; and after the Restoration the poets and dramatists , abandoned as they may have been , could not stomach this one horyible , nasty virtue . It came in with the smuggest royal personage in English history , in a time of national discontent , insecurity and reaction , and it quickly permeated English society , - since society in England naturally takes its hue from the court ; and English literature , as a whole , has always been a reflection of aristocratic and plutocratic power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but scant courtesies either from St. James 's or Lombard street . Smugness gained ascendancy in English literature in the days of Queen Anne , and it has persisted unto this day . Of course there have been those who were recalcitrant to the dominant power , but there is // in the bulk of the English literature of the x8th and i9th centuries this brutal element , forbidding our entire sympathy , and forcing us to qualify our admiration with a considerable admixture of moral alloy , even in the reading of works of genius . To define this corrupting quality by a careful analysis would be too tedious , for it would involve a consideration of the entire political and social system of Great Britain ; but it is sufficiently indicated by contrasting the art of Shakespeare with that of a writer of dramas in narrative form , who is usually esteemed in England the master of his class . Shakespeare 's kings and queens , nobles , merchants and servants are always men and women , and their rank is shown to be a purely adventitious circumstance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mean clothes always will dominate the imaginations of the masses in the most democratic of communities , but incapable of magnifying or lessening their souls . And this , too , although Shakespeare lived in an age before the people had obtained enough political significance to give any color to literature , and although Shakespeare 's mind was naturally attracted to the depicting of the class which represented the highest intellectual and moral power : a fact evidenced by his rule of taking nobles for his central figures in all his dramas . But he was too great a poet and philosopher ever to degrade men because their social station forbade them to wear ruffles . His princes are men and no more , and his Dorters and clowns are men also . He never made his human nature fit the cut of men 's garments . Walter Scott , on the other hand , rarely saw little more than the badges men wore . He tailored not only for men 's social conditions , but he tailored for their souls . He was a skilled tailor . He sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social conditions , scenery etc. ; but he seldom forgot his dinner engagements with Lord This and Lord That so completely as to give us men and throw his badges overboard , or even to mix them up and take them out of his chest without consulting the Peerage List and other such literature . He was afraid to trust Nature without documentary evidence . To have done this would have been to merge the Tory gentleman in the novelist , and Walter Scott never took the novelist so seriously as that . He painted large canvasses and he showed genius in his handling of them , but his art is spectacular the art of the costumier and not that of the poet ; an art , which , of necessity , demands philosophy . The majority of the figures in the long Walter Scott gallery are seldom more than well preserved specimens of stuffed armor and court clothes of different periods , not men of any period or station in life . The Waverley novels , as a whole , show more than anything else the extreme danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper constitution of human society . These novels give us as much true insight into the inner human life of this aristocracy ( which inner life can alone make the study of aristocracy more interesting than the show room of a theatrical costumier ) as does Debrett 's list of names and dates . We can never get these dolls into a corner and make them confess that their stars and garters can be bought by the gross , and that their cooks and scullions may possibly be nobler than they . They live and die by clockwork . No , although it is inviting the stake and fagots , Walter Scott was not the compeer of Fielding , George Eliot , Thackeray , Balzac , Dickens , George Meredith or Zola . He was inventive , and had a quick apprehension of the melodramatic , but he lacked the true imagination , and he was too good a Tory to be a philosopher ; and a novelist without philosophy paints life in the dark . He may produce compositions that are not without interest , but he can not picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of English novelists , and it is an attitude that almost wholly invalidates their work . There is a condescension , not always formally expressed , but insistent nevertheless , to all those who do not belong to the divinely dowered class , which spends life in amusing itself . The men of affairs , the lawyers , the merchants , the sailors and fishermen , the woodsmen and builders , the weavers and tillers may be // good creatures in their way , but they are only sent into the world to serve as a background to those who do God 's work of amusing themselves - dining , wining , dressing , gaming , hunting game and hunting women ; - their lives are wholly devoid of grandeur , of tragedy , comedy , mystery . Only the ennobled can be noble ; the lowly are ale facto ignoble . Labels suffice to describe them . These English writers have learned but little from Shakespeare : it is part of their religion , their loyalty to everything British , to learn nothing from the literature of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth century it is not from England we expect any new and significant literature , but from France , Russia , Spain , Italy , and the Scandinavian countries ; and occasionally from English exiles , who , in other lands , have managed to absorb some foreign ideas , and with a finer perception , added to their latent rectitude of mind , have contrived to rid themselves of their native smugness . James Russell Lowell , referring to the Transcendental movement in New England , and the return to Nature by the socalled apostles of the Newness ( who still get pretty freely condemned in many quarters ) , says : " It was simply a struggle for fresh air , in which , if the windows could not be opened , there was danger that panes would be broken , though painted with images of saints and martyrs . Light , colored by these reverend effigies , was none the more respirable for being picturesque . There is only one thing better than tradition , and that is the original and elemental life out of which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition , and yet keep hold of the good it has conserved . But few who steep their minds in tradition ever realize that those who do not live vitally in the present rob posterity and subtract from the dignity of the traditions of mankind . Many , in their impatience to clamber to the mountain-top to see the sun rise for themselves , are apt to declare that it never rose in the ages agone ; and in this they are as ridiculous as those admirably orthodox persons who scale no heights , but keep their shutters closed , and declared that the sun ceased to shine two thousand years since . It perhaps never occurs to these purblind folk that they are not so much expressing their contempt of their kind as of their Creator . Only too many catch the wind of tradition , but having no spiritual sight for the old , old and ever new mystery of to-day , they bring unspiritual eyes to the argosies and their cargoes which it has brought down from the dim past . Tradition is but a trade wind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will sell their " good*s . " All great geniuses are experimenters . Every conserving force in the world seems to have been exaggerated in order to effect its purpose . Men are apt to try to find their way to Heaven with the aid of chance linkboys , unless the stars are big enough . The appetites and passions are out of all proportion to physical needs ; spiritual fear is out of all proportion to spiritual restraint and grace ; but excess alone insures perpetuity and enforces growth . There is little economy in Nature , but then there is no waste , for it is only through waste that Nature secures the economy of properly distributed growth , and continual renovation . The violets and the lilies do not blush and refuse to unclose because there were violets and lilies as beautiful eons upon eons ago ; and why should men 's minds refuse to freely open to the wonders around them because about two thousand years ago other men wrapt in the same mystery wondered and died wondering ? The poet must worship , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet who needs some other man 's description of the sea , the mountains and the woods , when he is in their very presence . Every great poetic mind locks and bars the door against all the song and culture of the past when entertaining one of those rare visitants from the eternal intelligence . The sun shines to ripen blackberries ; and so tradition glares in an exaggerated way , trying to put out the light of to-day , to vitalize for us the thought of yesterday ; and it is well , for thought breeds thought ; although it must be said , that the thought of yesterday will surely be repeated in some form or other to-morrow . It is unfortunate that men should allow tradition to blow them off their intellectual legs out of the present , which alone is theirs // for verifications . I am a poor sceptic if I am content to read of the loves of gods and men and do not seek to love . But there is this compensating thought , that , since Nature works in cycles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because from the past they really get much of the stimulus they could get by actually living in their own time and neighborhood ; although the man who merely has another 's word for it , that the lark is soaring with its song in the heavens can scarcely be expected to thrill as did the man who listened to the song . On the other hand , the men who are caught and held in the rapid vortex of their own day if they look upon life with seeing eyes , really lose little of the thought and knowledge of the past , for the human intellect is like a clock - it keeps telling the time In the fields , in the woods , at the seashore , and in the streets , with their music , the epitome of all philosophy and all poetry , we can all escape tradition , and with chastened spirits listen and become poets ; for here is the mystic key that picks the lock of all knowledge , and with hearts and minds in attune , we can steep ourselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education will admit . " All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens . " The complaint of mediocrity is that there is nothing left to write about , and yet the English novelists who have dealt with life can almost be counted on the fingers of one hand . The artist who discards all the " properties " of fiction , and gives us an incident or series of incidents in the lives of two or three people in one of the ordinary walks of life , without setting forth with any problem to be solved , or theorem to be demonstrated , at once produces the truest art in the most dramatic form . He is immediately hailed as the one original and imaginative mind among the thousands of plastic imitative minds . He catches life in the quick , while others simply combine old materials in a vain attempt to surprise with the bizarre . But the really great artist writes as if no art ever existed before his own , and if his work seems fantastic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nature , but because his imagination receives impressions to which we are blind and deaf . After him come a thousand writers who admire , but see nothing in life for themselves , and then they set to work making dolls out of the small clothes of the giant , form a " school , " and declare that all who refuse to conform are leagued to degrade art . The fact is , in art , that when twelve men are agreed upon a certain point of view , one is a creator , whose imaginatlon is colored by multiplex forces that even he can not wholly comprehend , since men 's minds are often at war with the spirit ; and the other eleven are leagued together in awful authority because they are merely imitators and lack imagination . Leagues in art disseminate more error than truth , for those who see life truly can proclaim no verdicts . Great artists may start schools of art , and they may sometimes be betrayed into the making of formulas , but they can never belong to any school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flesh is weak , and great artists have availed themselves of the many opportunities provided by those who love to gape in accord , to strut up and down , and declare the true tenets , but they are not to be found among their own disciples . As John Wilkes said to his sovereign , when the latter rallied him upon his former radical professions , " Ah , but I was never a Wilkeite " All " schools " of art formed upon certain views and tendencies of particular writers are false to the whole of reality , for they reduce certain angles of vision to formulas , and so make the part greater than the whole . They sometimes perform the service of attracting attention to certain aspects of life , which otherwise would receive scant notice ; but the good they may effect is largely overbalanced by the fact that they more frequently develop intellectual and moral squints . The " schools " usually prey upon each other , but the true lover of art would not see any one of them gobble up the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The complete domination of any one of them would be fatally stifling to great creative minds . As a veteran of the sister art of // painting once remarked in answer to an inquiry as to whether the more meretricious features of the Pre-Raphaelite School would have an injurious effect upon the art students who were crowding a certain art gallery , " Oh , no ; the more schools ' they see the better . When we get an art student hopelessly muddled , then we begin to have some hope for him ! " One can not make a plea for the admission of the common and human in literature , and at the same time deny the legitimacy of the fantastic , for that would be tantamount to interdicting the treatment of life in literature . We can not in our sober senses declare war against fancy , for fancy is fact robbed of its specious trappings . The highest flights of imagination are rooted in the divine in human life - in a word , fact . The " Ancient Mariner** with its gruesomeness is this side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell are in strict relation to the physical and mental miseries and bankruptcies and moral squalor of the world . " The Scarlet Letter " is the work of a man who was intimately acquainted with the realities of life . The burning letter in Arthur Dimmesdale 's bosom was a poetic symbol of a reality . It is the basis of reality alone , subjective truth , we contend for , not the facts of inventories and costume . But we must not make the fantastic the standard of all art , because that would impugn the beauty of simplicity , and deny the legitimacy of another large side of life . The highest beauty and truth is only attained by the art that is subjective , and thus the greatest poets and seers have always been more or less misunderstood by the masses , who demand an art of mere sensation : for by this standard every great poet is a realist . Hence , too , the misconceptions of critics , who lay down strict lines of demarcation between what they are pleased to call the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce paper battles to extend their boundaries - and so incidentally provide themselves with a means of livelihood . The confusion usually arises from a lack of comprehension of the true nature and eiements of reality . Every enduring work of art , every romance and allegory , possesses this element of illuminated fact . It is not that which is outside of human experience , but that which is rarely detected in life , which constitutes the rare charm of all imaginative literature . As Lowell has put it in one of his essays : " The divine faculty is to see what everybody can look at . " There is apparently something like a concensus of opinion upon this particular generalization . Emerson has expfessed the same thought in more than one place in his works , and it has received confirmation in the writings of Augustus William Schlegel , Longfellow , Carlyle , George Eliot , Herbert Spencer , Walt Whitman and others . In his " Moosehead Journal " Lowell has a paragraph which I select , because it ought to reconcile all the " schools " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it expresses the prime requirement of the true artist , let him call himself " realist , " " romanticist , " or anything else he chooses : " It has passed into a scornful proverb that it needs good optics to see what is not to be seen ; and yet I should be inclined to say that the first essential of a good traveller and of a good writer was to be gifted with eyesight of precisely that kind . All his senses should be as delicate as eyes ; and above all , he should be able to see with the fine eye of imagination , compared with which all the other organs with which the mind grasps and the memory holds are as clumsy as thumbs .

" The man who can not see clear through rags or broadcloth , and find the Man contained within , ought to be kept away from pens and ink and paper ; otherwise , he is a mischievous force in the 4 // world . It is no more the office of literature to add to our social fog , than it is the office of chemistry to create violent stenches for the sake of the stench and for no other purpose . The rarely beautiful in art is the common life transfused in the alchemy of beautiful thought ; and this is only possible to writers whose intellects are true to their imaginations , and whose hearts are good . No man without illusions has ever done anything great in art - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world in every age . It is the living of life in the quick which compels expression , and makes that expression the work of genius . The great artist is merciless in his observation , and merciless to his own responsive emotional life in consequence . As Emerson says , " In love , in art , in avarice , in politics , in labor , in games , we study to utter our painful secret . The man is only half himself ; the other half is expression . " The writer who has lost his illusions has lost his sight , and he lies most when he thinks he is telling the brutal truth . A creator must have Faith , Hope , and Charity , and especially Charity , which in the last analysis means a strong perception of Justice . The great poet sees the world with his own eyes , and he sees it rightly . He sees men in all walks of life pursuing shadows they call facts , and he strips them with merciless charity , and when there is health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new compacts with themselves . When they are confirmed in spiritual valetudinarism they scoff and laugh , and , in trying to conceal it , proclaim the hopelessness of their disease . The poet discovers in the common life realities , which the circles of thoughtless Philistinism - the comfortable beings who severely divide the whole of humanity into polite persons and ragamuffins - declare to be mere illusions . Emerson , Wordsworth , Longfellow , Whittier , Whitman , saw the world thus . It is only by throwing aside the illusions of the conventional world , the world of outward seeming and masks , that a poet can win what other men often call illusions , and enter upon his heritage of real life in a world of realities . It is a great day for any man when he gets to know a Man . It is only because so few of us ever live long enough . to know ourselves that we so seldom know each other . If we actually knew men better , we should more often find ourselves strangers to hatred . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , criticism , and the drama , and so one of the gates of Paradise is seldom more than just ajar . The majority of good Philistines , readers and critics alike , seek the phenomena they can only find in themselves in what they are possibly pleased to call " the realm of pure imagination , " or in the old cloudwrapt days of the gods . The true poet , struggling and striving in this actual world , instead of going through the subtle mental and emotional process ordinarily called " losing one 's illusions , " finds his spiritual horizon broaden with his more intimate knowledge of real life , and in finding his natural utterance in poetry he does not discover any necessity to cut his acquaintances of the fields and highways , for an unsatisfactory acquaintance with the wooden gods of the mythologies . " To know That which before us lies in daily life Is the prime wisdom . " If only some of our writers , who are ' ever in search of novelty in " local color " and startling supersensual conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable beings who in the transplanting from this world lose their humanness without obtaining a new semblance , and also without obtaining any equivalent qualities for those of which they are bereft , and deal with what , . unfortunately , they regard as commonplace , we should undoubtedly suffer less from the commonplace in our literature . The literature of the pantomime never ' excites any higher or deeper feeling than that of surprise , and is therefore not very satisfying ; and its lease of life is subject to the caprices of fashion . The poets who open the world to us and thrill us were not able to deliver their message in the murky , sawdusty arena of Arcadia .. Some poets have been constrained by the ' literary fashion of their time to try to falsify the world with a rushlight ; but the greatest have always become so by open // contempt of both fashion and traditionor through their lapses from the prevailing standard rather than through their successes . Shakespeare shifts his scene to Arcadia , and immediately God 's sun , that had scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray mist is dissolved , and lo I the scene is familiar - we have always moved and lived in Arcadia , and wonder why we were stifled in it before . Shakespeare has made us forget it is Arcadia - he himself has forgotten it . This is not the Arcadia of Spenser and others . It is the everyday world in an unfamiliar guise . The usual inhabitants of Arcadia are wheeled off the scene the moment Shakespeare peoples it . These fantastic knights and ladies are sensible to human emotions , passions , love , and pity - they are men and women , wits and philosophers in motley . " The Faerie Queene " on the other hand , as a protracted study or entertainment , becomes very hard reading . True poetry does not make the real living present a suburb of some Arcadia , whose life is not derived from oxygen , but from the faint odor of old and respectable tomes . If it is not the poet 's mission to touch human hearts with the woes and joys of other hearts , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectly legitimate factor in literature , for life is filled with mystery - it is the mystery of mysteries . The inner life , ( and this is the real life ) of the veriest clown can not be explained by any philosophy . And since no writer has ever solved the problem of his own personality - who feels certain of his conduct for a whole day , much less a period of years ? - surely the study of mankind will not easily be exhausted . It savors of something more than supererogation when an artist feels impelled to put colors into God 's rainbow ; and we may rest assured that men 's purposes and motives are sufficiently fantastic and complex to save our art from vulgarization . We are in no danger of being cramped through the paucity of our materials . There have been no heroic ages , but there have been heroes in every age , and not less in this age than in others . It has usually required considerably more heroism to bear the burdens of ordinary civic life , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fighting men . It demands more courage to live in misery than to die at the sword 's point . It is indeed possible to die more than once . One 's spiritual self may precede one s body in death ten , twenty , thirty years , and one can thus live with one 's dead self , and in death hope and pray for dissolution . It is often nobler to live for others than to die for them . The soldier who falls fighting at the head of a column is not nearly so brave as the laborer , who , . working from dawn to sunset for a bare pittance , starves in a garret in a dark alley7 while in the street at the end of the court there are shop windows filled with plenty , and perhaps with fripperies , whose purchasing power , by some strange and universally diffused illusion , is such that it can compass souls - and yet he starves , . mentally , morally , physically , and consents to live , because , perchance , God has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more high moral courage to be a poet or philosopher than a general . And as for physical courage , which has usually been regarded as the badge of heroism , no race has ever been discovered that lacked it in desperate moments ; and in the so-called " heroic " days the social conditions were such that more men were confronted with situations which demanded physical desperatiofi than is usual nowadays . If gas and electric lighting and the police system were abolished , we should have more rowdyism and fisticuffs in our streets , and so , I suppose , logically , more heroes . Physical courage is usually not the highest form of courage , if it deserves the name of courage at all ; and it has usually been more of a mischief than a benefit in the world . It certainly possesses any value only when allied to moral courage . Cowardice - of the physical sort - as a matter of fact , is one of the greatest factors in civilization ; it is a wonderful lever of justice and progress , and is distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one decided drawback ; it contributes largely to the bolstering up of the iniquity of philanthropy , and so insures continual surety to the oppressor. // We are to ourselves what we tAink ourselves to be ; and this in reality we are but seldom . To others we are either mere shadows , or what their hasty impression is from some one angle of our character , or from some circumstance about which they build our character in conformity with their own prejudice - and this we are even less often . Therefore we constantly live a dual existence , and have multiform appearances . We credit ourselves with more virtues than we possess - sometimes exaggerating our shortcomings into virtues , and sometimes clinging with pertinacious fondness in imagination to vices we are not blessed or cursed with : and others credit us with vices , and virtues , too , with which we have no acquaintance . And then as our virtues themselves are indeterminate qualities , matters often of temperamental indifference or moderation , or excess , we rarely recognize the true essence of health in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our virtues elude us . We are too apt to label ourselves with certain positive qualities , or with certain qualities positively , regardless of the fact that if these are not sometimes elastic , they are habits of constitution , and are not only not virtues positively , but are active agencies the opposites of virtues , and detrimental to the whole moral atmosphere . Every man is a thousand men as he comes into contact with others ; and the student of men , seeing himself in so many mirrors , is wise if he knows something of himself , much less penetrates the mystery of the chameleon humanity about him . As a matter of fact all knowledge of men begins , and largely consists in , a large measure , of real self-knowledge . " Know thyself " means more than mere self culture , for men 's feelings and emotions are similar in character , if they dd differ largely in degree . This makes portraiture in fiction and poetry the most difficult , the most fascinating and the most satisfying , when well done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facts as elusive as the mystery of dawn and darkness , of love and hate , of birth and death . It may be said I have arrived at no conclusion , I have not proved realism to be right or romance wrong , or vice versa . I hope I have not , for this is the great folly of the different " schools . " I admit the truth of every school , and the importance of their contributions to literature ; but I contend that every school is wrong because it distrusts the eyes of the individual , and would put experience and observation through a formula that changes its complexion and character . I have tried to make clear that the poets and novelists who deal with the common are more likely to escape the thralldom of any particular point of view , and are limited in their materials only by their own power of perception and observation .
