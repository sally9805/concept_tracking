Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : EPITHALAMIUM. from Poems , in Personal recollections of John G. Whittier 1893 We give to grace another home The fairest of our flowers , For love itself must yield to love With stronger claim than ours . Go , with our best hopes and our prayers , A sweet and happy bride : No path of life can lead astray Where love alone is guide . Go , rest thy heart upon a heart And life with life ally : That joy unshared is scarcely joy Who better knows than I ? With thanks for all that thou hast been , And trust for what shall be , We fling our blessings , with our shoes , For good luck after thee . May health and plenty , love and friends , With God 's peace , make alway For thee and thine the happiest home By fair Sandusky 's Bay ! Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : Not for the doubtful rhyme within from Poems , in Personal recollections of John G. Whittier 1893 Not for the doubtful rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn thee well , Should this be sold ; But freely for the sake of such As homeless be , Give thrice its worth and it shall prove Cheap unto thee . Amesbury , 12th Mo. , 1873.
