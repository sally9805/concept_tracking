YOUNG AMERICA IN FEATHERS . " How like are birds and men ! " said Emerson , and if he had known Nature 's loveliest creatures as well as he did his own race , he might have affirmed it more emphatically ; for to know birds well is to be astonished at the " human nature " they display . In our latitude , July is distinctly the babies ' month . When wild roses give place to sun-kissed meadow lilies , when daisies drop their petals and meadowsweet whitens the pastures , when blueberries peep out from their glossy coyerts and raspberries begin to redden on the hill , then from every side come the baby cries of younglings just out of the nest , and everywhere are anxious parents hurrying about , seeking food to stuff hungry little mouths , or trying to keep too venturesome young folk out of danger . For Young Americans in feathers are wonderfully like Young Americans in lawn in self-confidence and recklessness . One evening in a certain July , up on the coast of Maine , I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny creatures in brown and gold - to coax their self-willed offspring to a more retired position than he chose to occupy . With genuine " Young America " spirit he scorned the conservatism of his elders . Though both parents hovered about him , coaxing , warning , perhaps threatening , not a feather stirred ; stolid and wide-eyed he stood , while the father flitted about the bush in great excitement , jerking his body this way and that , flirting his wings , now perking his tail up like that of a wren , again opening and closing it like a fan in the hands of an embarrassed girl , and the mother added her entreaties to his , darting hither and thither , calling most anxiously , - both , in their distress , rashly exposing themselves to what might , for all they knew , be one of the death-dealing macbines we so often turn against them . Nothing had the slightest effect upon the yellow-throated youngster until his own sensations interested him , and his parents suddenly acquired new importance in his horizon . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he spied his provider on the next bush with a beak full of tempting ( and wriggling ) dainties , and when lie found his wily parent deaf to his cries , and understood that not until he flew behind the leafy screen could he receive the food he craved , then he yielded , and joined his relieved relatives out of my sight . Many times after that morning did the vagaries of that young yellow-throat give me opportunity to stu ( ly the ways of his family . Having newly escaped from the nursery , in a thorny bush behind thick-growing alders , his strongest desire apparently was to see the world , and those outlying dead twigs , convenient for the grasp of baby feet , were particularly attractive to him . Every day for nearly . a week , as I passed into the quiet old pasture , I stopped to interview the youngster , and always found him inquisitive , and evidently , in his own estimation , far wiser than his elders , who were nearly wild over his conduct . This pasture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the joy of my heart , being delightfully neglected and fast relapsing into the enchanting wildness of nature . In a deep bed fringed with a charming confusion of trees and bushes ran a tiny stream , which in the spring justified its right to the title of river . Scattering clumps of alders and young trees of many kinds made it a birds ' paradise , while wild cherries and berries of all sorts , with abundant insect life , offered a spread table the whole summer long . // Of flowers it was the chosen home . From the first anemone to the last goldenrod standing above the snow , there was a bewildering profusion : fragrant with roses in June , gorgeous with meadow lilies in July , and rank upon rank of budded goldenrod promising glory enough for August , with all the florid hosts that accompany them . Great patches of sweet bayberry , yielding perfume if only one 's garments swept it , and rich " cushions of juniper " frosted over with new tips , were everywhere , and acres were carpeted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank as into the richest product of the loom . Here and there was a close grove of young pines , whose cool , dim depths were most alluring on hot days ; and indeed in every spot in Maine not fully occupied Nature is sure to set a pine-tree . Every morning , on entering this garden of delights , I hastened across an open space by the gate , and plunged into a thicket of alders sprinkled with young trees , birch , elm , and wild cherry . Through this ran a path , and in a sheltered nook under a low pine I found a seat , where for many days I spent the forenoon , making acquaintance with the pretty little yellow-throats . From the first the head of the family adopted me as his particular charge , and I am positive he never lost sight of me for one minute . His was a charming surveillance . He did not , like the robin on similar duty , stand on some conspicuous perch like a statue of horror or dismay , uttering his loudest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathered world ; nor did he , after the fashion of the song sparrow , fill the air with distressed " pips " that seemed to hint of mischief dire ; neither did he , as does the red squirrel , resent an intrusion into preserves that he considered his own with a maddening series of choking cries , coughs , and " snickers , " till one was almost ready to turn a gun upon him ; still less did he , in veery style , utter wails so despairing that one felt herself a monster for remaining . The yellow-throat 's guardianship was a pleasure . He remained in sight , not fifteen feet away from me , and did not flinch from the terrible field-glass . Sometimes he stood quite still , uttering his soft and inoffensive " chic ; " again he scrambled about in the bushes , collected a mouthful , and disappeared for a moment , - a constant baby call from the bushes reminding him of his duty as provider . Evidently he had succeeded in impressing upon that obstinate offspring of his that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of a bugaboo he made me out to be ? Much of the time the tiny custodian passed away in calling and singing , throwing his head up or holding it still according as he sang loud or low . To all varieties of his pretty little melody he treated me . Never once did he utter the notes given in the books as the family song . From his beak I never heard either " wichita , " " witches here , " " o-wee-chee , " or " I beseech you , " all of which , excepting the last , I have heard at different times from other members of the family ; which , by the way , confirms my oft-repeated assertion that no two birds of a species sing alike . His ordinary notes resembled " pe-o-we , " delivered in lively manner , with strong accent on the first syllable . Sometimes he gave them the regulation three times ; again , he added the fourth repetition , and changed this by ending on the first syllable of the fifth utterance . On one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third " pe-o-we " into a continuous little carol , varied and bewitching . Later in the season , after I had finished my studies in the alder bushes , I heard several times from a yellow-throat in the pasture a similar continuous song , usually delivered on the wing . After some days my little watcher became so accustomed to my silent presence under the pine that he did not // mind me in the least , though he never forgot me , and if I stirred he was on the alert in an instant . So long as I was motionless he ignored me entirely , and conducted himself as if he were alone ; often taking a sunning by crouching on the top twig of a bush , spreading wings and tail and fluffing out his plumage till he looked like a ragged bunch of feathers . It was very droll to see him , while in this attitude , suddenly pull himself together , stand upright , utter his song , and instantly relapse into the spread-eagle position to go on with his sun-bath . To my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and movements always seem to indicate a constant flitting and scrambling about in warbler fashion , is capable of repose . He frequently stood perfectly still , the black patch which covers his eyes like an oldfashioned face-mask turned towards me , singing his little aria with as much composure as ever thrush sang his . My pleasing acquaintance with the yellow-throat ended as soon as the young became expert on the wing and could leave their native alder patch . After that the nook was deserted , and unless I heard the song I could not distinguish my little friend among the dozens of his species who lived in the neighborhood . Toward the north end of my delectable hunting-ground was another favorite spot , especially attractive on warm , sunny mornings . When I turned my steps that way , I came first upon the feedingground of another party of Young Americans , - thrashers . They were a family group , a pair with their two full-grown but still babyish young . Approaching cautiously , I usually found the parents on the ground busily hunting insects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered . They were , however , very well bred , with none of the vulgar manners of those who scream and shout and demand their rations . Later in the day I often found the thrasher singing , a little beyond the alders , on the breezy heights of Raspberry Hill . His chosen place was an almost leafless birch-tree , a favorite perch with all the birds of the pasture , and there he sang for hours . was a song that rippled and reveled and ran Ever back to the note whence it began , Rising and falling , and never did stay , Like a fountain that feeds on itself all day . Sometimes the singing was interrupted , for those canny Young Americans knew their father 's song , and though he had doubtless stolen away and left them foraging on the grass by the path , they heard his voice and came after . While he was pouring out his soul in ecstasy , and I was listening with equal joy , those youngsters came by easy stages nearer and nearer , till one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , hopping upward from branch to branch , suddenly presented themselves before him , begging in pretty baby fashion for something to eat . The singer , embarrassed by their demands , would sometimes dive into the nearest bushes , followed instantly by the persistent beggars , and in a moment fly off , the infants still in his wake . But he always managed in some way to elude them . Perhaps he fed them or conducted them back to their mother , for in a few minutes he appeared again on the birch and resumed his music . On one occasion I met one of these spruce young thrushes , evidently out on his travels alone for the first time . He was in a state of great excitement , - jerked himself about , " huffed " at me , then flew with some difficulty into a tree , where he stood and watched me in a charmingly naif and childlike manner , utterly forgetting that part of his education which bade him beware of a human being . After passing the home of the thrashers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my next temptation to linger came from a fern-lined path to the spring , // abode of other Young Americans . The path itself was extremely seductive , narrow , zigzagging through a small forest of the greenest and freshest of ferns , so luxuriant that they were brushed aside in passing , and closed behind as if to conceal one 's footsteps . Shrubs and trees met overhead ; here and there a blooming dogbane or an elder , " foamed o'er with blossoms white as snow , " and tall wild roses wherever they could find space to grow . Nearly down to the spring , I seated myself under the bushes and waited . At first , until the bustle of my coming was hushed , all was silent ; but soon bird notes began , - soft little " pips " and " chur-r-r 's , " and other sounds I could not trace to their authors , but plainly expressing disapproval of a spy among them . Catbirds complained with a soft liquid " chuck " or their more decided " mew ; " kingbirds peeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in the bushes in plain sight , at leisure now since their decorous little folk were educated and taking care of themselves ; and other birds came whispering about behind my back , while I dared not turn to see , lest I send everybody off in a panic . An oriole , " Like an orange tulip flaked with black , " dropped in as he passed , but left in haste , as if averse to company , with his customary shyness while training the young ; for this brilliant bird , during nesting so fearless everywhere , manages to disappear completely after the young leave the nest . Now and then he may be seen going about near the ground , silent , and absorbed in his arduous task of teaching those clamorous urchins to get their own living ; or in the early morning , engaged in picking open the hideous nests of the tent caterpillars and quietly taking his breakfast therefrom . Later , when bantlings are off his mind , he reappears in his favorite haunts , and sings a little before bidding us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dismal failure , and the oriole discovers , as have other singers before him , that one can not neglect his music , even for the best of reasons , and take it up again where he left off . As I passed under an apple-tree , one morning , on my way to the ferny path , I heard the domestic cry of the oriole , uttered , I think , only when rearing the young , a tender " yeap . " I paused instantly , and soon heard a very low baby cry , a soft " chur-r-r " exactly like the first note of the young oriole when he comes up to the edge of the nest , only subdued almost to a whisper , showing that education had progressed , and this little one had learned to control his infantile eagerness . All at once there arose a great commotion over my head ; an oriole fled precipitately to another tree and stood there watching me , scolding his harshest , flirting his wings and jerking his body in great excitement . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , though she held a worm in her beak . This not seeming to effect their purpose , the singer suddenly uttered a loud , clear whistle of two notes , startlingly like a man 's whistle to a dog , when instantly a young oriole flew out of the apple-tree and joined his parents . Then the low parental note began again , and the family departed . The infant who receives such devoted care is a pretty little creature in dull yellow , and the most persistent cry-baby I know in the bird world , though several are not far behind him in this accomplishment . His plaint begins when he mounts the edge of the nest preparatory to his debut , and ceases hardly a minute for days , a long-drawn shuddering wail , that suggests nothing less than great suffering , starvation , or some other affliction hard to he borne . What makes the case still worse , the nursery is high , and each nestling chooses for himself the direction in which he will depart . East // and west , north and south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will stay for hours , if not days , drawn down into a little heap , looking lonely and miserable , and apparently impressed with the sole idea that he must keep himself before the world by his voice , or he will be lost and forgotten . It is no wonder that , between the labor of collecting food and following up the family to administer it , the mother becomes faded and draggled , and the father abandons his music , and goes about near the ground , grabbing like any ditch-digger . The young oriole , however , does not lack intelligence . A correspondent tells me of one who , starting out too ambitiously in his first flight , landed on the ground instead of on the tree he had selected , and , looking about for a place of safety , saw a single leaf growing a few feet up on the trunk of a tree . That so inexperienced an infant should notice it was surprising , but that he should at once start for it showed remarkable " mother wit . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - trunk a few inches , half flying and half climbing , clinging with his claws to the bark to rest , then scrambling upward a few inches farther , and so on till he reached the leaf , when he perched on its tiny stem , and remained there as long as he was watched . But to return to my place among the ferns . When I had been there some time , silent and motionless , a catbird at my back , too happy to be long still , would take courage and charm me with his wonderful whisper song , an ecstatic performance which should disarm the most prejudiced of his detractors . Occasionally , his mate , as I suppose , uttered warning cries , and in deference to her feelings , as it appeared , his notes dropped lower and lower , till I could scarcely hear them , though he was not ten feet away . The song of the catbird is rarely appreciated ; probably because he seldom gives a " stage performance , " but sings as he goes about his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; on his way for food , a convenient fence-post is a temptation to stop a moment and utter a snatch of song . His manner is of itself a charm , but there is really a wonderful variety . in his strains . He has not perhaps so fine an organ as his more celebrated relative , the thrasher ; he can not , or at least he does not , usually produce so clear and ringing a tone . Nor is his method the same ; he does not so often repeat himself , but varies as he sings , so that his aria is full of surprises and unexpected turns . Doubtless , persons expert at finding imitations of other birds ' notes would discover some in his . But I am a little skeptical on the subject of conscious " mocking . " When the catbird sings I hear only the catbird , and in the same way I take pleasure in the song of thrasher or mocking-bird , nor care whether any other may have hit upon his exact combinations . After the catbird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are at the same time the delight and the despair of the bird student . Some birds , upon entering this solitary retreat , announced themselves by a single note , or call , as effectually as if they had sent in a card , while others stole in , took quick and close observation , and departed as quietly as they had come , unseen and unheard by clumsy human senses . Often , indeed , have I wished for eyes to look behind me , where it sometimes seems that everything most interesting takes place . This secluded corner of the pasture proved to be a very popular nursery with the feathered world . Catbirds came about bearing food , and all sorts of catbird talk went on within hearing : the soft liquid " chuck " and " mew " ( so called , though it is more like " ma  --  a " ) in all tones and inflections , complaining , admonishing , warning , and caressii*g . There was evidently a whole family among the bushes . A vireo baby , plainly // just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed me with a sort of husky squawk , an indescribable sound , which , until I became familiar with it , brought me out in hot haste to see what terrible tragedy was going on . For it is really a distressful cry , although it often proclaims nothing more serious than that the young vireo wants his dinner ; as some infants of the human family scream at the top of their voices under similar circumstances . Beyond the close-growing bushes I heard the crow baby 's quavering cry ; and these seemed indeed anxious days in crowland . All the little folk were crying at once , in their loudest and most urgent tones , enough to distract the hardworking parents who hurried back and forth overhead , at their best speed , trying to stop the mouths of their ill-bred brood . On one occasion I saw an old crow flying over , calling in a decided , " stern parent " style , followed by a youngster not yet expert on the wing , who answered with his droll baby " ma-a-a " in a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the salt marsh , where much crow-baby food came from in those days , and he was doing his best to keep up with her stronger flight . Sometimes another sound from the nursery came to my ears , - the caw of an adult , drawn out into a long , earnest " aw-w-w , " like admonishing or instructing the now silent olive branches . It was many times repeated , and occasionally interrupted by a baby voice , showing that the little ones were not asleep . I suspect , from what I have seen of crow ways , that the sable mamma is a strict disciplinarian who will tolerate no liberties and no delinquencies on the part of her dusky brood , and although this particular Young American may complain , he dare not rebel . Poor crowling ! he needs perhaps a Spartan training to fit him for his hard life in the world . With every man 's hand against him and danger lurking on all sides , he must be wary and sharp and have all his wits about him to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pasture , I passed on to the riverside nook I have mentioned . Here my seat was on the edge of the bank , high above the stream , shaded by a group of black and battered old spruces that looked as if they had faced the storms of a hundred stern Maine winters , as probably they had . Pine-trees at my back filled the air with odors ; a thicket beloved of small birds stretched away at one side . Across the river spread a sunny knoll , on which stood a huge old apple-tree , contemporary perhaps with the spruces , having one attractive dead branch , and surrounded at a little distance with a semicircle of shrubs and low trees . It was a tempting theatre for bird dramas , which the solitary student , half hidden on the bank above , could overlook and bring to clear vision with a glass , while not herself conspicuous enough to startle the actors . In this lovely spot many mornings of that happy July passed delightfully away . In the leafy background to the appletree dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning calls , and on rare and blessed occasions his heavenly song ; for it was July , and it is only in June that " New England woods at close of day With that clear chant are ringing . " For , with all the rhapsody in his soul , this thrush is a devoted parent , and notwithstanding the fact that he is one of the kings of song , he comes down like the humblest sparrow of the fields to help feed and train his lovely tawny brood . Without exception that I know , he is the most utterly heartbroken of birds when the nest is discovered . So pathetic are the wails of both parents that I never could bear to study a nest , and I had to harden my heart against the bleating , despairing cries of the mother before I could secure even a look at a youngster just out of the nest . This scion of // the charming thrush family is a patient little soul , with all the dignity and reserve , as well as the gentleness , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this corner , one morning , I saw a catbird gathering blueberries for dinner . She came down on a fence-post as light as a feather , looked over to where I sat motionless under my tree , hesitated , flirted her tail expressively as who should say , " Can I trust her ? " then glanced down to the berry-loaded bushes on the ground , and turned again her soft dark eyes on me . I hardly breathed , and she flew lightly to the first wire of the fence , paused , then to the second , still keeping an eye my way . At that point she bent an earnest gaze on the blueberry patch , turning this way and that , and I believe selecting the very berry she desired ; for she suddenly dropped like a shot , seized the berry , and was back on the post , as if the ground were hot . There she rested long enough for me to see what she held in her beak , and then disappeared in the silent way she had come . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself she was berrying , but for some speckled-breasted beauty shyly biding in the alder thicket below . As the babies ' month drew near its close , and August stood threateningly on the threshold , sometimes I heard young folk at their lessons . Most charming was a scion of the chewink family learning to ring his silver bell . I could not see him , - he was hidden behind the leafy screen across the river ; but happily sounds are not so easily concealed as sights , and the little performance explained itself as clearly ns if I had had the added testimony of my eyes ( though I longed to see it , too ) . The instructor was a superior singer , such as I have heard but few times , and the song at its best is one of our most choice , consisting of two short notes followed by a tremolo perhaps an octave higher , in a loud clear ring like a silver-toned bell . " Was never voice of ours could say Our inmost in the sweetest way Like yonder voice aloft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang out from the bushes , to my great delight , when suddenly it ceased , and a weak voice piped up . It was neither so loud nor so clear ; the introductory notes were given with uncertainty and hesitation , and the tremolo was a slow and very poor imitation . Still it was plain that the towhee baby was practicing for his entrance into the ranks of our most bewitching singers . The next day , a chewink , I think the same whose music and whose teaching I had admired , honored me with a song and a sight together . He was as spruce as if he had just donned a new suit , his black hood like velvet , his chestnut of the richest and his white of the whitest , and he sang from the top of a small pine-tree ; sometimes , in the restless way of his family , scrambling over the branches , and again shifting his position to a small birch-tree . Many other songs and singers I enjoyed in those pleasant mornings beside the river , till the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner " drew near , and then , unmindful of the philosopher 's advice , I started slowly homeward , collecting as I went materials to fill the vases in my room . The bird-baby world was not bounded by any pasture , however enchanting , and I have not told all the charms of this one . The house where I found bed and board , in the intervals of bird study , - once a farmhouse , now an " inn of rest " for a country - loving family , - was happily possessed of two attractions : the pasture toward which I turned with the morning sun , and a meadow which drew me when shadows grew long in the afternoon . This meadow began at the road passing in front of the house , and extended to the salt marsh which separated us from the sea . The marsh was always a beautiful picture , // " Stretching off in a pleasant plain To the terminal blne of the main . " It was never twice the same , for it changed with every passing cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide ; one never tired of it . And it was full of winged life : not only the beautiful gulls , " Whose twinkling wings half lost amid the hlne , " in a white cloud over the far-off beach , but small birds of several kinds , who never came near enough to dry land to be identified . Sharp-tailed sparrows appeared on the meadow after grass was cut , and their exquisite ringing trill could always be heard from the bank ; crows fed upon it every day ; blackbirds ' wings were always over it ; and above all , sandpipers were there , " Calling clear and sweet from cove to cove . " At the edge of the meadow , where it sloped sharply down to the marsh , lived one whose days were full of trouble , which he took care to make known to the world , - a " Fire-winged blackbird , wearing on his shoul-ders Red , gold-edged epanlets . " His little family , not yet out of the nest , was settled safely enough behind a clump of bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of protector , had taken possession of two trees on the high land , where he could overlook the whole neighborhood , and see all the dangers , real and fancied , that might , could , would , or should threaten them , and " borrow trouble " to his heart 's content . The trees , this bird 's headquarters , were an aged and half-dead cherry and a scraggy and wind-battered elm , standing perhaps a hundred feet apart . On the top twig of one of these , or flying across between them , he was most of the time to be seen , and his various cries of distress , as well as his wild , woodsy song , came plainly up to me in my window . The troubles of this Martha-like character began when mowers brought their clattering machine , and with rasping noise and confusion dire laid low the grass which had isolated him from the rest of the world , and that impertinent world poured in . First came crows , from their homes in the woods beyond the pasture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mowers , and to procure food for their hungry young , and alighted in the stubble , two or three or half a dozen at a time . By this the soul of the redwing was fired , and with savage war-cries he descended upon them . His manner was to fly laboriously to a great height , and then swoop down at a crow as if to annihilate him . The bird on the ground turned from his insect hunt long enough to snap at his threatening enemy , and then returned to his serious business . So long as the crows stayed the redwing was frantic , his cries filled the air ; and as they were almost constantly there , he was kept on the borders of frenzy most of the time . After the crows came the bird students , with opera - glasses and spying ways . These also the irascible redwing decided to be foes , flying about their heads threateningly , and never ceasing his doleful cries so long as they were in sight . I hoped his brown-streaked mate down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , and would not be made anxious by his extravagances ; but she too distrusted the bird gazers , adding her protests to his , and such an outpouring of " chacks " and other blackbird maThdictions one - happily - is not often called upon to encounter . After the bird students the haymakers ; and every time a man or a horse appeared in that field , the blackbird was thrown into utter despair , and the air rang with his lamentations . He was evidently a character , a bird of individuality , and I was anxious to // know him better ; so , although I hated to grieve him , I resolved to go somewhat nearer , hoping that he would appreciate my harmlessness and soon see that he had nothing to fear from me . Not he ! Having taken it into his obstinate little head that all who approached the sacred spot he guarded were on mischief bent , he refused to discriminate . The moment I approached the gate , the whole width of the meadow from him , he greeted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant , though I stayed two hours or more . I always went as modestly and inoffensively as possible through the meadow , far from his two trees , seated myself on the edge of the slope at some distance from him , and remained quiet . But he was never reconciled . His first act , as I started down the field , was to fly out to meet me , as if to drive me away . When he reached me , he would hold himself ten or fifteen feet above my head , perfectly motionless excepting a slight movement of the wings , looking as if he meditated an attack ; and indeed I did sometimes fear that he would treat me as he did the crows . As I came nearer , his mate flew up out of the bushes , and added her demonstrations to his . Their movements in the air were beautiful . One would beat himself up quite high , and then hover , or apparently rest at that altitude , as if too light to come down , at last floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely could not return to our level . Occasionally my presence caused a domestic scene not easy to interpret . Madam , no doubt fully aware of the prying ways of the human family , sometimes hesitated to return to her little ones in the bushes . She flew around uneasily , alighting here and there , anxious and worried , but plainly afraid of exposing her precious secret . Then her " lord and master " took her in hand , flying at her , and following wherever she fled before him , till he almost overtook her , when she dropped into the marsh , and with a low , satisfied chuckle he took a wide circle around and returned to his tree . Scolding all the time , she remained some minutes in the deep grass , then flew up high , and floated down to the alder clump where the nest was placed . Upon this , her observant lord , whose sharp eyes nothing escaped , instantly flew down again , dashed impetuously through the alders , and without pausing returned to his post . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the young were out of the nest and quite expert on wing , the redwing 's relations with them puzzled me , also . I often saw the two who appeared to compose the family flying about with their mother , and I knew they were his because he frequently joined the party . But their conduct seemed unnatural , and a doubt stole over me whether this bird - this individual , I mean - could be a domestic tyrant . I knew from previous studies that the love-making manners of the redwing are a little on the " knock-downand-drag-out " order of some savage tribes of our own species . To chase the beloved until she drops with fatigue seems to be the blackbird idea of a tender attention , and possibly the pursuit of his spouse already spoken of may have been of this sort , merely a loverly demonstration . But with the babies it was a different thing . Heretofore I had seen blackbird fathers devoted attendants on their young , working as hard as the mothers in seeking supplies , and following up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I obscrved , was avoided by the little folk . When he showed inclination to join the family party on one of its excursions , they shied away from him , and if he came too near they uttered a sort of husky " huff , " like the familiar protest of a cat . With the same sound they greeted him and moved away when he approached a bush where they sat . Perhaps this crustiness of de // meanor was the natural result of his long weeks of anxiety and trouble as protector during their helpless infancy ; perhaps he was tired out and exhausted , and it was not irritability , but nervous prostration that made him appear so unamiable . Indeed , I do not see how it could be otherwise , after his exciting life . And may that not explain the fact that when the young are grown , the singer shakes off all family ties and joins a flock of his comrades , while mother and young remain together ? Since he insists on taking his family responsibilities so hard , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . Now that the nest was deserted and the young were always going about with their mother , I wondered that the head of the family did not relax his vigilance over the meadow and abandon his two watch-towers ; but save that his enticing song came up to me oftener than his cries of distress , his habits were not materially altered . One day , when I thought his summer troubles ought surely to be over , a fresh anxiety came to him . Several women and girls , with a dog , appeared on the marsh , which at low tide was in some parts explorable . The human members of the party amused themselves with bathing and wading in the now shallow stream ; but the dog acted like one gone mad , dashing about on those peaceful flats where so many birds were enjoying themselves quietly , rushing full gallop from one group to another , wading or swimming the winding stream every time he came to it , and barking at the top of his voice every instant . Birds rose before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swallows swooped down over him in anxious clouds , sharptailed sparrows and all other winged creatures fled wildly before this " agitator " who seemed to have no aim except to disturb , and reminded me irresistibly of his human prototype . Somewhere in that " league upon league of marsh grass , " I suppose , were the blackbird 's little folk ; for the watcher on the bank was in deepest tribulation , and his outcries quickly brought me down to see what had happened . The Young Americans of the redwing family are as vivacious and uneasy as might be expected of the scions of that house . No sooner do they get the use of their sturdy legs than they scramble out of the nest and start upon their bustling pilgrimage through life , first climbing over the bushes in their neighborhood , and as they learn the use of their wings becoming more venturesome , till at last , every time a hard-working mother brings a morsel of food , she has to hunt up her straggling offspring before she can dispose of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether too busy investigating this new and interesting world to stay two mmutes in one place . So far from waiting , like Mr. Micawber , for something to turn up , they proceed , the moment they can use their limbs , to attack the problem of delay for themselves ; to wait is not a blackbird possibility . It is needless to say that such preternaturally sharp and wide-awake Young Americans very soon graduate from the nursery . The last trial that came to the blackbird , and the one , perhaps , that induced him finally to abandon his watch-towers and join his friends on the bank farther down , was the appearance one day in the meadow of a new importation from the city , a boy marked out for notice by a striking yellow - and - black cap . The instant he entered the inclosure afar off the redwing uttered a shriek of hopeless despair , as who should say , " What horrible yellow-headed monster have we here ? " and as long as he remained the bird cried and bewailed his fate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death were the sure fate of them all . It was the last act in the blackbird drama on the meadow .
