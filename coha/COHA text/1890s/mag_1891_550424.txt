UPWARDS of a century has passed since the new birth of English poetry . Into the deadly routine and dreary formalism of the eighteenth century , with its worship of the " little wasp of Twickenham , " there projected itself a new enthusiasm for nature and for man . The note first struck by Thomson was deepened by Cowper , and merged into the magnificent symphonies of Wordsworth and Coleridge . The theme was nature , but nature blended with human reason and imagination . With the love for nature came the deeper love for man . This mirrored itself in the writings of Goldsmith , in the poetry of Cowper and William Morris . FROM A LATE PHOTO BY ELLIOTT &amp; FEY , LONOON . WILLIAM MORRIS . By Wiliam Clarke , LiLA. // Burns , in the greater poetry of the Lake School , and in the revolutionary poetry of Byron and Shelley ; while the lives of the poor were invested with a new interest through the realism of Crabbe . The French Revolution fanned the flame of human sympathy , and furnished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott alone turned to the past for romance and beauty . But Burns , Wordsworth , Shelley , Byron , Coleridge and Southey were all inspired by the wonderful outburst of human force which the Revolution awakened . We all know how the revolutionary fires blazed up , abated , and died away , leaving the cold , dead ashes of a past social order . Still more quickly died the enthusiasm for the Revolution in the breasts of the Lake poets . Its hasty , shallow methods ; its utter ignorance of history , leading to the most absurd perversion of truth ; its poor , inadequate ideals , could not satisfy them ; - and Southey , Coleridge , and Wordsworth became reactionists . Yet the two latter certainly could never rid themselves of the new passion for man which the Revolution had helped to awaken in them . Even in the most conservative and apparently reactionary poems of Wordsworth , we find those deeper elements which are of the essence of a far profounder revolution than the enthusiasts of 89 ever imagined . Byron and Shelley retained their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but when they passed away , the spiritual force of the Revolution passed away with them . The prolonged shocks of social earthquake were over ; agitated Europe had a brief respite , and the thoughts of men were turned back once more to history and romance . The poet of this period was Keats , whose nature , poetry , and sensuous beauty bear absolutely no trace of the new spirit awakened in Wordsworth , as truly as in Byron . Struggle and tumult have ceased , and we are lapped in delicious dreamland . With 1830 came the new reforming spirit , manifesting itself alike in Liberalism , on the one hand , and in the new church movement on the other . Although the Tractarian movement appears on the surface thoroughly reactionary , and although it led its greatest spirit into the bosom of the Catholic Church , vet , looked at more deeply , it made for reform and change . It revived in England the study of history , and indirectly gave us the writings of Stubbs , Freeman , and Bryce . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange and unexpected fruit in the essays called Lux Mundi . It inspires such men as Cardinal Manning to stretch out a right hand to labor agitators , and is making Christian Socialists of many of the younger men among the High Church clergy . It gave birth to the preRaphaelite revival of art , and endowed England with whatever is worth looking at in her modern architecture . It has reconstituted the whole political framework of England , and has given her , under the old monarchical forms , a constitution essentially as democratic , if not more so , as that of the United States . The poets of this new era of energy and inquiry , of hope and improvement , were Tennyson and Browning , whose early manhood was synchronous with the dawn of the period . What buoyancy and sympathy , what unswerving faith and courage do we find in the early works of both poets and , indeed , in the whole work of Browning ! Many political reformers and thinkers shared the same feeling . It illumines the earlier writings of John Stuart Mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sage of Chelsea . By the middle of the century , the fires of 1830 had begun to pale , and the disappointment and foreboding of the time are evident in the later writings of Carlyle . The poets of this period are Matthew Arnold and Arthur Hugh Clough , on both of which precious spirits rested " the weary weight of all this unintelligible world . " Both , it is true , sound* the note of courage ; but Arnold became more and more the stoic of modern poetry , brave and patient , but expecting little . Both poets symbolize for us the breaking wave , on the crest of which Tennyson and Browning had climbed to glory and renown . A new criticism of life had already overcast the native hue of resolution with the pale cast of thought . Then followed the period of quietism // analogous to that of Keats ; and it found its poets in Rossetti and William Morris . With the exception of one sonnet , there is not a single poem of Rossetti 's which gives any indication that the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faintest interest in human affairs . Rossetti 's art is the same ; it is the art of one quite withdrawn from contemporary business and strife . Of the same school is the poetry of William Morris . This delightful poet goes back to ancient Greek and old Norse themes for his inspiration , abjures modern life , and describes himself in those oft-quoted lines , as " the idle singer of an empty day . " Such is . William Morris , the poet who wrote 7/ike Defence of Guinevere , and The Earthly Paradise , and Love is Enough . This is the side of Morris 's nature known to the lovers of poetry the world over . But of late years Morris may be said to have undergone a new birth , which has not destroyed his old sell ; but which has given him new and different interests in life . And it is of the new William Morris , as some of us know him to-day , that I am to say something . Morris 's figure is the most picturesque in prosaic England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , who looks frankly out upon the world with bright blue eyes . His grand , massive head is covered with a shock of gray hair , tumbled about in wild disorder , while upper lip ( which is short ) and chin are covered with gray moustache and beard . He is always clad in the same fashion when I see him : a black slouch hat , black sack coat , and a most picturesque blue shirt with a collar to match . In winter time he envelops himself in a thick , dark Inver-. ness cape . A lady informed me that the poet had , taken her in to dinner at a party in irreproachable evening dress ; but I have never seen him in that conventional garb , and have no wish to . Many years ago he sat accidentally upon his silk hat and crushed it ; he has never worn one since . His subsequent career may be said to have consisted , metaphorically speaking , in the crushing of silk hats generally , as well as all other symbols of our artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconventional figure than is Morris . His very aspect is a perpetual challenge to all that is smug and respectable and genteel . Morris is a born rebel , an anarchist by nature . His protests against convention have in them absolutely nothing of the artificial : they are the genuine expression of his character . I was once talking with him about a forthcoming election to the London School Board , and was expressing a hope that the progressive party would win . " Well , " said the poet , striding up and down the room , " I am not sure that a clerical victory would not be a good thing . I was educated at Marlborough , under clerical masters , and I naturally rebelled against them . Had they been advanced men , my spirit of rebellion would have probably led me to conservatism merely as a protest . One naturally defies authority , and it may be well that the London School Board should be controlled by Anglican parsons , in order that the young rebels in the schools may grow up to defy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express my doubt whether the average London boy or girl could be trusted to grow up a good rebel like Morris ; but his enthusiastic conviction would not allow of a doubt on the point . Rebel and heretic Morris is and ever will be . It is singular that Morris , anarchist as he is , owes his new birth to one who is the great apostle of obedience and lawful rule ; viz. , to his friend , John Ruskin , who , still partly bound himself , has yet liberated so many bright and eager souls . Morris was at Oxford along with Burne Jones ( who was at that time , curiously enough , meditating Holy Orders in the Anglican Church ) , and he was of the same generation with Dante Gabriel Rossetti . All were brought under Ruskin 's influence , and none more so than Morris . From Ruskin , Morris imbibed the idea that our present politico-commercial civilization is absolutely hostile to art . Ruskin saw beauty and the love and passion for making beautiful things dying out of modern life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasted , and hillsides denuded of their trees and flowers , ancient and venerable objects torn down ,  --  and all for the purpose of produ // cing things neither beautiful nor desirable in themselves , not because they were needed , but in order that profit might be made out of their sale . I do not know any more terrible satire on certain aspects of our modern civilization than is revealed by a walk through some of England 's manufacturing districts . Here nature is absolutely degraded and ruined . Green hillsides are scarred and blackened , huge heaps of cinder and slag replace the flowers which nature gave , hideous black pits yawn before and behind , even the sky is blotted out with a dense pall of black , poisonous smoke . Not one single object of beauty is visible ; *fnd amid such natural surroundings , millions of English people are condemned to live . It is conceivable that we might tolerate this defacement of nature , did it lead to any beautiful artistic result . No doubt the marble hills of Carrara were less beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compensation , we have the palaces and churches of Italy . Under modern industrialism there is no such compensation . In England 's manufacturing districts , everything that is built is hideous . The rows of little brick houses of the square box order of architecture are hideous ; the churches and chapels and town halls were , until Ruskin 's ideas had in some measure penetrated the thick ugly hide of the British Philistine , still more hideous ; the slated roofs , the corrugated-iron mission-halls , the dingy , monotonous streets , the huge , square factories , the iron bridges , the dirty railway stations - all are utterly , irredeemably vile ; and if Morris had his way they would probably all be burned to the ground . The system does not even promote universal or general material comfort . The great mass of laborers are miserably poor , and many of them as degraded as barbarians . Work and drink , drink and work - such is , as personal observation has taught me only too well , the daily life of millions among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the local capitalist who has made his pile by blasting every object of natural beauty in his neighborhood sets up as a patron of art , frequents Mr. Agnew 's gallery , hangs English landscapes in his drawing room , and orders a two-thousand-guinea portrait of his own dull face from Millais or Ouless , which is duly exhibited in the Academy ! Ruskin and his disciples saw the lovely world of nature and art gradually being swamped by the incursions of this sea of ugliness ; and to make it worse they heard it all justified by what they conceived to be a false and shallow political economy . This political economy , self-styled a science , which is already happily being fast discarded and despised in the very land of its birth , ' ignored alike ethics and beauty , and taught or implied that the one end of man was the acquisition of riches , and that everything in society or State which stood in the way of that supreme object was to be thrust aside or abolished . To a Shakspeare a man was a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty , in form and moving express and admirable , in action like an angel , in apprehension like a god . But to the economist , with his shallow and degraded eighteenth century philosophy ( ? ) ( save the mark ) , a man was a riches-producing animal , and his form , movement , reason , action and apprehension so much useful labor force to be expended in turning out pots and pans , steam pumps and iron boilers , not for his own use , but that another man might make a big fortune , have a town and country house , a moor in Scotland , a yacht in the Mediterranean , and a seat in that paradise of wealthy snobs , the House of Lords . I do not think the above is any caricature or exaggeration of the state of things which the apostles of art found themselves compelled to face . Ruskin himself produced what he called a " political economy of art , " and has followed it by some of the noblest ethical works of our time , culminating in Unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruskin 's teaching which tend to positive reaction and which can not be accepted . It is impossible to conceive of small individual handicraft completely replacing the vast system of collective production through machine industry . Just in so far as Ruskin I Compare , e. g. , the new treatise by Professor Marshall of Cambridge with the dismal sophisms of Ricardo , Senior and Fawcett . // has been reactionary and impracticable , his influence will die out ; but there is a vivifying residual essence which is immortal , and it is this which seized and pervaded Morris 's mind . The younger artist fastened on the idea that ordinary commercialism , with its theory that labor is a mere commodity , and its political economy , with its philosophy of accumulation as the prime end of man 's being , was for ever absolutely hostile to art , and that either it or art must perish from the world . This idea which has made of Ruskin a reactionist , longing in vain for the renewal of a past which is gone forever , germinated in Morris 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been his creed for the last seven or eight years . Morris sees that there is no going back , that medieval life based on certain conceptions of the world and of man that are no longer entertained can not be revived . Yet , in certain elements of that medkeval life , adapted and modified , he sees the only conditions under which art can flourish . The worker must be his own master , must have free access to the instruments of labor , must have leisure , education , above all freedom . These , conditions Morris finds best fulfilled in the medieval communes , which were , in effect , industrial republics , little islands of freedom in an ocean of despotism and barbarism which finally overwhelmed them . The reader may ask whether great art has not been produced under all manner of social conditions . He may recall the great works of art produced in Rome under the unspeakable corruption of the Borgias , or in Florence under the Medici , or even the less worthy art of corrupt and enslaved periods in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to greatness after the life of the republic of Venice had begun to decline , and he may remind us that Millet and Corot painted French landscape under the contemptible regime of Napoleon le Petit . All this is true ; but when Morris speaks of art , he is not thinking of great individual painters or sculptors , of Raphaels , Titians , Turners and Millets . For Morris , art is built up from handicraft ; and the decay of art means to him the decay of the power of the average man to make something beautiful with his own hands , not as an isolated event to be talked about for years , but as an everyday occurrence , part of the normal expression of his daily life . When Morris , therefore , sings the dirge of art , it is popular art that he thinks dead or dying . He admits as fully as any one the excellence in technique displayed by many English painters , the admirable drawing , the coloring and so forth . He laments rather the passing away of the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he could both design and produce objects of beauty . It was such men as these who built and beautified many of the great cathedrals and churches of Europe ; who sculptured the portals of Chartres and the glorious facade of Amiens , and who have left in a thousand European cities and towns moldings and traceries and foliated capitals , portraits and quaint fancies , quips and jests , as well as dreams of beauty in wood , metal , stone and marble , to be the wonder and admiration of our time . According to Morris this beautiful work was the result of really free associated human labor , where the worker was his own master , had received a careful training in apprenticeship to his guild , and worked in fraternal equality with others . To-day the average worker is a machine-minder , the all but soulless agent of an anonymous joint-stock company or syndicate ; performing day after day , and year after year , the same piece of monotonous mechanical drudgery ; liable any day to be elbowed out of the field by new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make for themselves a profit out of his work ; and living amid noisome , sordid and hideous surroundings , as a general rule . People accustomed to the old superficial talk about the great medieval period , when Gothic art manifested its glory , as " the dark ages , " will wonder when they hear from Morris that the nineteenth century workman is less " free " than the artist - workman of the medieval city . " What , " they will say . " with a free press , popular suffrage , railways and telegraphs , // decadence of kingly rule , liberty to walk and travel to and fro , and to live how and where you like ; with all these advantages , are we to be told . that the working classes are less free than their ancestors in those old , dark , fortified cities of eight centuries ago ? The idea is absurd I " And yet this " absurd " idea is seriously entertained by many of the best thinkers in Europe , and is corroborated by the researches made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of English labor was at the end of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries ; and those who have most earnestly studied the subject believe that the European working classes were never so really " free , " in the sense of commanding opportunity for expansion and free scope for energy , as they were in the later medieval period , and in the communal organization of the free European cities . Just in so far as the working classes of our time have improved their lot , it has been by adopting the spirit and method of the mediieval craft-guilds through the modern trade-union . The above will perhaps help to elucidate the position taken up by Morris , and I can now recur to his individuality and opinions , which will be more intelligible in the light of his social creed . In considering Morris 's opinions , we must always remember that he is essentially and always an artist , and that he approaches all questions from the artist 's point of view . These opinions he always gives quite freely , generally striding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a torrent , every muscle of his body in active agitation , his face animated , his bright blue eyes dancing merriment or flashing scorn . I have heard him deal pretty freely with many of our celebrities whom he has known personally , but I shall not of course repeat what I have heard him say about noted people still living . He never minces his words , but speaks straight out . Living himself in the most open daylight , free as the wind and frank as a young child , Morris knows Thorold Rogers 's great History of Prices naturally suggests itself as containing a mass of evidence on this point . See too , a recent account in the For/nz*oIit4 ' Review of the 13th century Parisian workman , by 1ladame Darmestetes. nothing about concealment or double enlendres or convenient evasions . He will attack the most renowned giants of fame , will cover with ridicule the most fashionable contemporary opinions , will lash and sting right and left without the slightest hesitation ; and yet in all will be thoroughly good-natured and human . Morris 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is amusing to hear him hold forth on two great English poets whom he dislikes , Milton and Browning . He can not abide either Milton 's puritanism or what he regards as his false classicism ; and he stamps his critical foot down unmercifully on Paradise Regained and Ilfenseroso . In truth , Morris , spite of his large acquaintance with Greek poetry , is not classic in the least : he is Norse and Gothic and romantic . And just as he places Gothic architecture far above any of the Greek achievements in stone or marble , so does he value Northern poetry with its rushing tide of life , its adventure , its passion , even its grotesque and terrible elements , more than the placidity and calm dignity of the Greeks . Even in Greek literature he prefers the very earliest , the youthful , to the more mature . He has translated and he loves the Odyssey , whereas the great puritan poet admired most the drama of Euripides , produced in the social decadence of Athens . Browning 's poetry he dislikes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its abruptness , obscurity , theology , introspection , its constant dwelling on sin and probing of the secrets of hearts are all utterly distasteful to the author of The Ear//dy Paradise . In truth , there is much of the passionate , unrestrained , beauty - loving child about Morris . He instinctively dislikes over - intellectuality , subtle metaphysical distinctions , products of a highly-wrought or excessively superficial society . He is eternally young , and he loVes the youthful in literature and art . A Norse rune or saga , an Italian peasant-song , an early English ballad , is more to him than a highly finished poem or drama ; and he would give more for the wild sculpture of a Romanesque porch than for all the sybils and prophets of Michael Angelo . He loves an almost unconscious spontaneity ; // and when this has given place to severe intellectual effort in a work of art , its charm for Morris has passed away . I was once in Morris 's company when a French anarchist sang the Carmagnole , and I plainly said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because it was adapted from some old French peasant song and seemed to him to retain a certain flavor of rural wildness , memory of fields or vineyards where peasants danced their own dances and sang their own songs . It is a question how far this childelement which so fascinates Morris can be retained in modern life . I incline to think that in our exceedingly complex society , with its vaster conceptions of the world and its ever-increasing command of knowledge , it will be all but impossible to retain this element . Literature and art will inevitably express more and more a mature and intellectual life , and it is even possible that the taste for certain old forms of art may die out altogether . If this view be true , it must be inferred that Morris 's influence is partly reactionary , as indeed some among his socialist friends think it is . Like his friend Ruskin , William Morris does not love America , though his reasons are not altogether , perhaps , the same as those of Ruskin , who once declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no castles . To Morris , America is the apotheosis of commercialism and the " cash nexus " between man and man . It is the awful example among nations , and he predicts for its present political and social system a violent overthrow . Morris has never been in America , and says he has no wish to go , though his business connections with America are extensive . Mere republicanism is to him an empty form , apart from real social equality ; and he thinks the United States , with its conservative constitution , its huge monopolies , its millionnaire senators , no more " free " than Germany or Spain . In short , he regards America as exhibiting on a great scale all the evil traits of modern Europe , while destitute of those great historical monuments and traditions which do something to redeem the Europe f to-day from the charge of vulgarity and *:ommonplace . Europe however is , for him , moving along the same plane towards the same abyss . He was talking to me recently of a visit he had paid last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years , and which he found vulgarized and made as gaudy and Parisian as possible , and he compared commercial Rouen with the lovely Gothic dream which he knew forty years ago when he visited the city , before the era of modern " improvement " had set in . Morris dislikes exceedingly two of the ideas on which the American Republic , so to speak , is based : the puritan idea of the seventeenth century , and the individualism and " common sense " of the eighteenth . His dislike of puritanism he shares with all artists , but it is a feeling running deeper than a mere aesthetic prejudice against men who smashed beautiful monuments and ravaged cathedral aisles and windows . Morris shares the naturalism of so many contemporary European thinkers , and he has the child 's hatred of gloom , austerity and introspection . He regards puritanism as false and unhealthy in sentiment , and , like Matthew Arnold , considers it to have been deeply prejudicial to the growth of intelligence in England and America . Based on a conception of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed strength without beauty , and in its decadence has become a fruitful source of hypocrisy and cant , - an aspect of its decline in which it received the merciless lash of satire from Thackeray and Dickens . I am now , be it understood , merely giving Morris 's view , without criticising it ; but it is unquestionably a view shared by a majority of the chief English writers of our time . As Morris dislikes puritanism , so does he dislike its eighteenth century offspring , the theory of " individual rights . " To him , as to Carlyle and the modern scientific school , a man has no natural rights at all . They are mere pigments , a priori conceptions , born of that unreal and sentimental century which gave birth to so many strange things . The individual could not indeed be an individual but for the social environment which has helped to make him what he is ; and to suppose that he can isolate himself from that and make claims for himself as having an " in // alienable right " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the old theory of early liberalism with its free trade , Protestantism and laissez faire goes by the board , and the new collectivist theory takes its place . Morris shares these views with all the socialist school , which entirely repudiates natural rights and tends always to subordinate the individual too much to the social whole . In holding this view , Morris 's conduct squares with his creed . He is , as is well known , a member of a socialist body called the Socialist League . Although by far the most distinguished member of this little organization , and although it is kept going largely by his generosity , he takes his place in the ranks with the poorest or humblest member on a footing of democratic fraternity , and allows himself to be ordered about just as the majority chooses . The secretary of Morris 's branch of the League has told me that it has sometimes pained him somewhat to see ignorant men at the committee meetings assign to Morris his particular task , a judgment with which the poet instantly complied . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Waltham Green opposite the District Railway Station ; and in ' that open space , on the following Sunday morning , you may see the author of the Ear//dy Paradise haranguing a crowd of poor men on their grievances and on the revolution which one day is to set them right . Morris will never be an orator , but as a public speaker he is greatly improved since I first heard him . He is more fluent , less embarrassed , and better informed . When he was a member of Mr. Hyndman 's body , the Social Democratic Federation , he used to leave the economic part of his subject to Mr. Hyndman . When asked at the close of a lecture some puzzling economic question , he would reply that he did not understand economics , and that his questioner must ask Hyndman about that next Sunday . Morris 's revolt was an artistic revolt , and he had all the artist 's dislike for those whom Burke calls sophisters , economists and calculators . But Morris , to his credit be it said , bent himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sociology , specially influenced thereto by his friend , Mr. Ernest Belfort Bax , author of The E/hics of Socialism and several other books calculated to startle the simple-minded reader who opens them for the first time . Those therefore , who , knowing Morris 's revolutionary creed , expect to hear nothing from him but wild , picturesque abuse of everything that exists , would be considerably surprised by his clear , wellinformed argument ; though every now and then he would give them a gentle shock by some piece of satire or humor or invective . When Morris and his friends seceded from the Social Democratic Federation , many were the surmises as to the reason for this course being taken , and many were the jokes about the tendency in Socialist bodies to quarrel and split into sections . The secession was due partly to personal , partly to what may be called political causes . On the first it is not necessary to dwell . As to the second , if I were to define in a word the differences between the two bodies , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme authoritarian ideas of Marx , while the League was always verging on anarchism . Under Morris 's guidance , the League has steadily refused to work on parliamentary lines by legal and constitutional means , but has contented itself with instilling generally revolutionary sentiments into the minds of its members . Not to trouble oneself about external forms and public institutions , but to prepare the mind for wholly new ideas - that seems to be Morris 's method of going to work . Mr. Hyndman 's organization , on the other hand , while always talking vaguely about a violent revolution , has a distinct political programme of reforms intended to alleviate the existing conditions of society , and to prepare the way for the socialist state of the future . The Federation also puts forth candidates for Parliament and for the London School Board and County Council . This " stepping-stone " policy , as it is called , is satirized and denounced by Morris , who suspects that it may fasten the old slavery under new forms . It is not easy to understand how Morris proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to . No parliamentary or municipal methods , no reliance upon law-making machinery , an abhorrence of everything that smacks of " politics " : it all seems very irupracticable to the average man , and certainly suggests the poet rather than the man of affairs . What Morris thinks will really happen is , I should say , judging from numerous conversations I have had with him , something like this : Existing society is , he thinks , gradually , but with increasing momentum , disintegrating through its own rottenness . The capitalist system of production is breaking down fast and is compelled to exploit new regions in Africa and other parts where , he thinks , its term will be short . Economically , socially , morally , politically , , religiously , civilization is becoming bankrupt . Meanwhile it is for the socialist to take advantage of this disintegration by spreading discontent , by preaching economic truths and by any kind of demonstration which may harass the authorities and develop among the people an esy5ri/ de corps . By these means the people will , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry of the world when the capitalist class is no longer able to direct or control it . Morris believes less in a violent revolution than he did , and thinks that workmen s associations and labor unions form a kind of means between brute force on the one hand and a parliamentary policy on the other . He does not however share the sanguine views of John Burns as to the wonders to be accomplished by the " new " trades unionism . It must not be supposed that Morris is a mere vague dreamer and nothing more ; on the contrary , he is in many ways a man of great practical energy and experience . At the head of a large business ; with factory in Surrey , store in London and a branch in New York , Morris has customers all over the globe and knows all about these capitalist methods which he believes will shortly be destroyed . He is minutely acquainted with every process in his business , and has for years worked with his own hands . He is especially skilled in designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and criticisms passed on his lectures , he generally has a pencil in his hand and a little piece of paper before him , on which he traces out most charming designs , rapidly done , but sometimes exquisite in symmetry and grace . He is greatly esteemed by those in his employ . The eight-hour working day is in practice in the Merton factory , and the wages paid are the highest known in the trade . Morris has to some extent carried out ( as far as the existing commercial system permits ) the method of the mediieval guilds in educating apprentices . At the last Arts and Crafts Exhibition I saw a beautiful piece of work from the Merton factory , which Mr. Morris 's daughter assured me was done by an average boy taken from the village and properly trained in the works . Morris holds that no artistic work is really worth anything , in which the design is not executed by intelligent workmen who recognize the idea of the designer . Some friends were talking to him a while ago , in my hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular about the works of Boston 's lamented architect , Richardson . He fully admitted Richardson s genius , but said that he did not believe any really beautiful design could be properly executed in America by men who were working for wages in the employ of a capitalist . The workmen themselves must be artists or their product will fall far short of the design . Will Morris produce any more poetry of the old type ? One can not say , for Morris is an inexplicable genius , whose erratic movements in the firmament of literature it is exceedingly difficult to calculate ; but I do not think it is likely . His few socialist poems will not , with the exception of the chant , The Day zs ' Cornzn* , add greatly to his fame ; and he now seems to have given himself entirely to prose work . He may possibly one day retire from active agitation , and then startle and inspire the world with a new kind of poetry , breathing the spirit and hope of the great socialist movement . But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Andrew Lang , I think , termed it , " Wardour-Street English . " It is perhaps unfortunate that Mr. Morris seems unable to clothe his ideas // respecting the strength and beauty of communal life ( as in The Rools of Ike Moun/ains ) in modern , contemporary style , for it seriously deters readers from attending to what he has to say , and it gives occasion for the profane to ridicule and make merry . By a curious coincidence it happened that on one and the same day amusing skits on this book , written in mock archaic style , appeared in the Pall Mall Gazelle , and the Daily News , the latter from the pen of Mr. Andrew Lang , - who , spite of his extraordinary versatility , must now , after his function with Mr. Rider Haggard , be numbered among the Philistines . " The idea of a clever whipper-snapper like Lang attacking a great man like Morris said a friend of the latter to me . Morris read the attack , but as he cares nothing for critical articles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby . His latest serial , The Gli//ering Plain , I candidly confess I can make nothing of . I thought at first that this was due to some defect in myself , and I was therefore much relieved when a distinguished man , himself a friend and admirer of Morris , told me he could make nothing of it either . Beyond all question , Morris 's finest prose work is his Dream of Jokn Ball , an imaginative attempt to realize the condition of the English peasant in the time of the great Peasant Revolt ( in Morris 's opinion by far the most important fact in English history ) and to body forth the.aspirations of those who tried to win a great victory at that time for the cause of labor . Other writers can picture the outer forms of life in the past , but who can seize on the essential spirit of a past order of civilization as Morris can ! Morris 's influence on his friends and on many of the younger artists is great . He has led Mr. Burne-Jones to a deep sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the other designers and workers in wood and metal , who have organized the annual Arts and Crafts Exhibition . I do not know any young man of ability and promise in the literary or Socialist circles of London who has not been influenced , more or less , by William Morris . There is no doubt that Morris has devoted too much energy to work'that might safely be left to inferior men . Goldsmith 's criticism of Burke , that he had spent much of his time in " cutting blocks with a razor , " may be applied to Morris . One can admire strongly his courage and his scorn of the conventional , and yet at the same time one can doubt whether an exquisite artist-poet should give up whole mornings and evenings in addressing meetings and in distributing Socialist literature in Hyde Park .
