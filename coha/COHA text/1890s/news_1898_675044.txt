txt Mr. SIMON STERNE has done Governorelect ROOSEVELT a valuable service by addressing to him an enlightening communication on the subject of reform in legislative methods . As a member of the commission appointed by Gov . MORTON to study the subject and suggest better methods of legislation , Mr. STERNE is well equipped to advise the Governorelect in this branch of his public duties . We print his letter to Col. ROOSEVELT this morning as a competent discussion of a subject of wide general interest . in this city and in this State we are notably slow to adopt new and better methods of transacting the public business . The flood of private and local bills that pours into and out of the Legislature of every session is a recognized evil . The remedy of a Constitutional amendment in 1895 afforded no substantial relief , and the evil grows instead of diminishing . Yet a perfectly simple and adequate method of dealing with this class of bills has long been in use in the English Parliament . It is a public abuse to take up the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , and the tendency is for the Legislature , in haste and weariness , to pass many unworthy or bad measures . The system of having all such bills rigidly examined and passed upon , after hearings , by a small committee which conducts its examination at the expense of the promoter of the bill , is a method so manifestly wiser and safer that it is a cause of surprise that it has never been adopted at Albany . It is the system in use in the English Parliament , and its working is commended by every one familiar with English parliamentary practice . It is the general expectation that Gov . ROOSEVELT 'S administration will be memorable for its reforms . Legislative reform along the lines laid down in Mr. STERNE 'S letter may well be included in those recommended and undertaken .
