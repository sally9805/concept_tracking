The Moss ( her humble mother ) saw with fear The ardent glances of the princely stranger ; With many an anxious thought and dewy tear She sought to hide her darling from this danger . The gardener-guardian of this noble bud A cruel trellis interposed between them . No common Pink should mate with royal blood , He said , and sought in every way to wean them . The poor Pink pined and faded day by day : Her restless lover from his prison bower Called in a priestly bee who passed that way , And sent a message to the sorrowing flower . The fainting Pink wept as the bee drew near , Droning his prayers , and begged him to confess her . Her weary mother , over-taxed by fear , Slept , while the priest leaned low to shrive and bless her . But lo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnation and the Pink were married ! The cunning bee had brought the thing about While Mamma Moss in Slumber 's arms had tarried . And proud descendants of that loving pair , The offspring of that true and ardent passion , Are famous for their beauty everywhere , And leaders in the floral world of fashion . NEVER MIND Whatever your work and whatever its worth , No matter how strong or clever , Some one will sneer if you pause to hear , And scoff at your best endeavour . For the target art has a broad expanse , And wherever you chance to hit it , Though close be your aim to the bull's-eye fame , There are those who will never admit it . Though the house applauds while the artist plays , And a smiling world adores him , Somebody is there with an ennuied air To say that the acting bores him . For the tower of art has a lofty spire , With many a stair and landing , And those who climb seem small oft-time To one at the bottom standing . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nerve you ; Let nothing men say who pass your way Relax your courage or swerve you . The idle will flock by the Temple of Art For just the pleasure of gazing ; But climb to the top and do not stop , Though they may not all be praising . TWO WOMEN I know two women , and one is chaste And cold as the snows on a winter waste , Stainless ever in act and thought ( As a man , born dumb , in speech errs not ) . But she has malice toward her kind , A cruel tongue and a jealous mind . Void of pity and full of greed , She judges the world by her narrow creed ; A brewer of quarrels , a breeder of hate , Yet she holds the key to " Society 's " Gate . The other woman , with heart of flame , Went mad for a love that marred her name : And out of the grave of her murdered faith She rose like a soul that has passed through death . Her aims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world like the mercy of God . A soother of discord , a healer of woes , Peace follows her footsteps wherever she goes . The worthier life of the two , no doubt , And yet " Society " locks her out . IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT Whatever is a cruel wrong , Whatever is unjust , The honest years that speed along Will trample in the dust . In restless youth I railed at fate With all my puny might , But now I know if I but wait It all will come out right . Though Vice may don the judge 's gown And play the censor 's part , And Fact be cowed by Falsehood 's frown And Nature ruled by art ; Though Labour toils through blinding tears And idle Wealth is might , I know the honest , earnest years Will bring it all out right . Though poor and loveless creeds may pass For pure religion 's gold ; Though ignorance may rule the mass While truth meets glances cold , I know a law complete , sublime , Controls us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all will come out right . A WARNING There was a flame , oh ! such a tiny flame - One fleeting hour had spanned its birth and death , But for a silly child with playful breath Who fanned it into fury . It became A mighty conflagration . Ah , the cost ! House , home , and thoughtless child alike were lost . Lady beware . Fan not the harmless glow Of admiration into ardent love , Lean not with red curled smiling lips above The flickering spark of sinless flame , and blow , Lest in the sudden waking of desire Thou , like the child , shalt perish in the fire . SHRINES About a holy shrine or sacred place , Where many hearts have bowed in earnest prayer , The loveliest spirits congregate from space , And bring their sweet , uplifting influence there . If in your chamber you pray oft and well , Soon will these angel-messengers arrive And make their home with you , and where they dwell All worthy toil and purposes shall thrive . I know a humble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , The heaviest heart therein forgets its gloom As in some gorgeous temple filled with light . Those heavenly spirits , beauteous and divine , Live only in an atmosphere of prayer ; Make for yourself a sacred , fervent shrine , And you will find them swiftly flocking there . THE WATCHER She gave her soul and body for a carriage , And livened lackey with a vacant grin , And all the rest  --  house , lands  --  and called it marriage : The bargain made , a husband was thrown in . And now , despite her luxury , she 's faded , Gone is the bloom that was so fresh and bright ; She has the dark-rimmed eye , the countenance jaded , Of one who watches with the sick at night . Ah , heaven , she does ! her sick heart , sick and dying , Beyond the aid of human skill to save , In that cold room her breast is hourly lying , And her grim thoughts crowd near to dig its grave . And yet it lingers , suffering and wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that lone watcher , unrelieved , is paling With vigils that no pitying soul can share . Ah , lady ! it is hardly what you thought it , This life of luxury and social power ; You gave yourself as principal , and bought it , But God extracts the interest hour by hour . SWIMMING SONG I am coming , coming to thee , My strong-armed lover , the Sea ! On thy great broad breast I will lie and rest , And thou shalt talk to me . I have come to thee , all unsought , I have stolen an hour from thought , And peace and power thou canst give in that hour , Which thy rival Earth gives not . Alone here , under the sky , And the whole world drifting by ! Thy breast of brine thrills close to mine , While the cloudless sun sails high . I fly , but thou givest chase - Thy kisses are on my face ! Be bold and free as thou wilt , O Sea , There is life in thy close embrace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips press ! There is strength and bliss in thy daring kiss , And joy in thy bold caress . And what is the Earth to me ! I have left it all , O Sea ! With its dust and soil and strife and toil , For one glad hour with thee . THE LAW The sun may be clouded , yet ever the sun Will sweep on its course till the cycle is run . And when into chaos the systems are hurled , Again shall the Builder reshape a new world . Your path may be clouded , uncertain your goal ; Move on , for the orbit is fixed for your soul . And though it may lead into darkness of night , The torch of the Builder shall give it new light . You were , and you will be : know this while you are . Your spirit has travelled both long and afar . It came from the Source , to the Source it returns ; The spark that was lighted , eternally burns . It slept in the jewel , it leaped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in the grave , It took on strange garbs for long aeons of years , And now in the soul of yourself it appears . From body to body your spirit speeds on ; It seeks a new form when the old one is gone ; And the form that it finds is the fabric you wrought On the loom of the mind , with the fibre of thought . As dew is drawn upward , in rain to descend , Your thoughts drift away and in destiny blend . You can not escape them ; or petty , or great , Or evil , or noble , they fashion your fate . Somewhere on some planet , sometime and somehow , Your life will reflect all the thoughts of your now . The law is unerring ; no blood can atone ; The structure you rear you must live in alone . From cycle to cycle , through time and through space , Your lives with your longings will ever keep pace . And all that you ask for , and all you desire , Must come at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that voice and all tumult is done , Your life is the life of the Infinite One ; In the hurrying race you are conscious of pause , With love for the purpose and love for the cause . You are your own devil , you are your own God , You fashioned the paths that your footsteps have trod , And no one can save you from error or sin , Until you shall hark to the Spirit within . LOVE , TIME , AND WILL A soul immortal , Time , God everywhere , Without , within  --  how can a heart despair , Or talk of failure , obstacles , and doubt ? ( What proofs of God ? The little seeds that sprout , Life , and the solar system , and their laws . Nature ? Ah , yes ; but what was Nature 's cause ? ) All mighty words are short : God , life , and death , War , peace , and truth , are uttered in a breath . And briefly said are love , and will , and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the vast constructive power of space ; Time is the hour which calls it into place ; Will is the means of using time and love , And bringing forth the heart 's desires thereof . The way is love , the time is now , and will The patient method . Let this knowledge fill Thy consciousness , and fate and circumstance , Environment , and all the ills of chance Must yield before the concentrated might Of those three words , as shadows yield to light . Go , charge thyself with love ; be infinite And opulent with thy large use of it : ' T is from free sowing that full harvest springs ; Love God and life and all created things . Learn time 's great value ; to this mandate bow , The hour of opportunity is Now , And from thy will , as from a well-strung bow , Let the swift arrows of thy wishes go . Though sent into the distance and the dark , The dawn shall prove thy arrows hit the mark . THE TWO AGES On great cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , Lost in the splendours of immortal art . Angels and saints and all the heavenly hosts , With smiles undimmed by half a thousand years , From wall and niche have met my lifted gaze . Sculpture and carving and illumined page , And the fair , lofty dreams of architects , That speak of beauty to the centuries - All these have fed me with divine repasts . Yet in my mouth is left a bitter taste , The taste of blood that stained that age of art . Those glorious windows shine upon the black And hideous structure of the guillotine ; Beside the haloed countenance of saints There hangs the multiple and knotted lash . The Christ of love , benign and beautiful , Looks at the torture-rack , by hate conceived And bigotry sustained . The prison cell , With blood-stained walls , where starving men went mad , Lies under turrets matchless in their grace . God , what an age ! How was it that You let Colossal genius and colossal crime Walk for a hundred years across the earth , Like giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such vast beauty for the world , And such large hopes of heaven , could entertain Such hellish projects for their fellow-men ? How could the hand that , with consummate skill And loving patience , limned the luminous page , Drop pen and brush , and seize the branding-rod , To scourge a brother for his differing faith ? Not great this age in beauty or in art ; Nothing is wrought to-day that shall endure , For earth 's adornment , through long centuries Not ours the fervid worship of a God That wastes its splendid opulence on glass , Leaving but hate , to give it mortal kin . Yet great this age : its mighty work is man Knowing himself , the universal life . And great our faith , which shows itself in works For human freedom and for racial good . The true religion lies in being kind . No age is greater than its faith is broad . Through liberty and love men climb to God . COULEUR DE ROSE I want more lives in which to love This world so full of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of doing duty ; I ask no greater joy than this ( So much I am life 's lover ) , When I reach age to turn the page And read the story over . ( O love , stay near ! ) O rapturous promise of the Spring ! O June fulfilling after ! If Autumns sigh , when Summers die , ' T is drowned in Winter 's laughter . O maiden dawns , O wifely noons , O siren sweet , sweet nights , I 'd want no heaven could earth be given Again with its delights ( If love stayed near ) . There are such glories for the eye , Such pleasures for the ear , The senses reel with all they feel And see and taste and hear ; There are such ways of doing good , Such ways of being kind , And bread that 's cast on waters fast Comes home again , I find . ( O love , stay near . ) There are such royal souls to know , There is so much to learn , While secrets rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God toiled six days to make this earth , I think the good folks say - Six lives we need to give full meed Of praise  --  one for each day ( If love stay near ) . But oh ! if love fled far away , Or veiled his face from me , One life too much , why then were such A life as this would be . With sullen May and blighted June , Blurred dawn and haggard night , This dear old world in space were hurled If love lent not his light . ( O love , stay near ! ) LAST LOVE The first flower of the spring is not so fair Or bright as one the ripe midsummer brings . The first faint note the forest warbler sings Is not as rich with feeling , or so rare As when , full master of his art , the air Drowns in the liquid sea of song he flings Like silver spray from beak , and breast , and wings . The artist 's earliest effort , wrought with care , The bard 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later toil , seems poor and tame , And into nothing dwindles at the test . So with the passions of maturer years . Let those who will demand the first fond flame , Give me the heart 's LAST LOVE , for that is best . LIFE 'S TRACK This game of life is a dangerous play , Each human soul must watch alway , From the first to the very last . I care not however strong and pure - Let no man say he is perfectly sure The dangerous reefs are past . For many a rock may lurk near by , That never is seen when the tide is high - Let no man dare to boast , When the hand is full of trumps  --  beware , For that is the time when thought and care And nerve are needed most . As the oldest jockey knows to his cost , Full many a well-run race is lost A brief half length from the wire . And many a soul that has fought with sin , And gained each battle , at last gives in To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spur and whip , Or the hoarse , hot cry of the pallid lip , When once we have fallen back . It is better to keep on stirrup and rein , The steady poise and the careful strain , In speeding along Life 's track . A watchful eye and a strong , true hand Will carry us under the Judge 's stand , If prayer , too , does its part ; And little by little the struggling soul Will grow and strengthen and gain control Over the passionate heart . AN ODE TO TIME Ho ! sportsman Time , whose chargers fleet The moments , madly driven , Beat in the dust beneath their feet Sweet hopes that years have given ; Turn , turn aside those reckless steeds , Oh ! do not urge them my way ; There 's nothing that Time wants or needs In this contented by-way . You have down-trodden , in your race , So much that proves your power , Why not avoid my humble place ? Why rob me of my dower ? With your vast cellars , cavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not miss them should I KEEP My little store of pleasures . As one who , frightened , flying , flings Her riches down at random , Your course is paved with precious things Life casts before your tandem : The warrior 's fame , the conqueror 's crown , Great creeds for ages cherished , Beneath your chariot-wheels were thrown , And , crushed to earth , they perished . Although to just and generous deeds Your heart is not a stranger , I have the feeling that one needs To guard his wealth from danger . And though a most heroic light Oft on your pathway lingers , I 'd hide my treasures , if I might , From contact with your fingers . You are the loyal friend of Truth , Go seek her , make her stronger , And leave the remnant of my youth To me a little longer . There 's work enough for you before Eternity shall wed you : Why stoop to steal my simple store ? Why make me shun and dread you ? You do not need my joys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I beg you turn and go the way Where wrong waits to be righted ; Or pause , and let us chat a while : I 'll listen  --  not too near you , For oh ! no matter how you smile , I fear you , Time , I fear you ! REGRET AND REMORSE Regret with streaming eyes doth seem alway A maiden widowed on her wedding day . While dark Remorse , with eyes too sad for tears , A crushed , desponding Magdalene appears . One , with a hungering heart unsatisfied , Mourns for imagined joys that were denied . The other , pierced by recollected sin , Broods o'er the scars of pleasures that have been . EASTER MORN A truth that has long lain buried At Superstition 's door , I see , in the dawn uprising In all its strength once more . Hidden away in the darkness , By Ignorance crucified , Crushed under stones of dogmas - Yet lo ! it has not died . It stands in the light transfigured , It speaks from the heights above , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAW BUT LOVE . " And the spirits of men are gladdened As they welcome this Truth re-born With its feet on the grave of Error And its eyes to the Easter Morn . BLIND Whatever a man may think or feel He can tell to the world and it hears aright ; But it bids the woman conceal , conceal , And woe to the thoughts that at last ignite . She may serve up gossip or dwell on fashion , Or play the critic with speech unkind , But alas for the woman who speaks with passion ! For the world is blind  --  for the world is blind . It is woman who sits with her starved desire , And drinks to sorrow in cups of tears ; She reads by the light of her soul on fire The secrets of love through lonely years : But out of all she has felt or heard Or read by the glow of her soul 's white flame , If she dare but utter aloud one word - How the world cries shame !  --  how the world cries shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming star , in the sky of gold , Or a spent cigar in the dust below - ' Twixt unclad Eve or a wanton bold ; And ever if woman speaks what she feels ( And feels consistent with God 's great plan ) It has cast her under its juggernaut wheels , Since the world began  --  since the world began . THE YELLOW-COVERED ALMANAC I left the farm when mother died and changed my place of dwelling To daughter Susie 's stylish house right on the city street : And there was them before I came that sort of scared me , telling How I would find the town folks ' ways so difficult to meet ; They said I 'd have no comfort in the rustling , fixed-up throng , And I 'd have to wear stiff collars every week-day , right along . I find I take to city ways just like a duck to water ; I like the racket and the noise and never tire of shows ; And there 's no end of comfort in the mansion of my daughter , And everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired help is all about , just listenin ' to my call - But I miss the yellow almanac off my old kitchen wall . The house is full of calendars from attic to the cellar , They 're painted in all colours and are fancy like to see , But in this one particular I 'm not a modern feller , And the yellow-coloured almanac is good enough for me . I 'm used to it , I 've seen it round from boyhood to old age , And I rather like the jokin ' at the bottom of the cage . I like the way its " S " stood out to show the week 's beginning , ( In these new-fangled calendars the days seem sort of mixed ) , And the man upon the cover , though he wa' n't exactly winnin ' , With lungs and liver all exposed , still showed how we are fixed ; And the letters and credentials that was writ to Mr. Ayer I 've often on a rainy day found readin ' pretty fair . I tried to buy one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They toted out great calendars , in every shape and style . I looked at ' em in cold disdain , and answered ' em in pity - " I 'd rather have my almanac than all that costly pile . " And though I take to city life , I 'm lonesome after all For that old yellow almanac upon my kitchen wall . THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE Somebody 's baby was buried to-day - The empty white hearse from the grave rumbled back , And the morning somehow seemed less smiling and gay As I paused on the walk while it crossed on its way , And a shadow seemed drawn o'er the sun 's golden tract . Somebody 's baby was laid out to rest , White as a snowdrop , and fair to behold , And the soft little hands were crossed over the breast , And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were pressed With kisses as hot as the eyelids were cold . Somebody saw it go out of her sight , Under the coffin lid  --  out through the door ; Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer-sun light ; Somebody 's baby will waken no more . Somebody 's sorrow is making me weep : I know not her name , hut I echo her cry , For the dearly bought baby she longed so to keep , The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep In the little white hearse that went rumbling by . I know not her name , but her sorrow I know ; While I paused on the crossing I lived it once more , And back to my heart surged that river of woe That but in the breast of a mother can flow ; For the little white hearse has been , too , at MY door . REALISATION ( At the Old Homestead ) I tread the paths of earlier times Where all my steps were set to rhymes . I gaze on scenes I used to see When dreaming of a vague To be . I walk in ways made bright of old By hopes youth-limned in hues of gold . But lo ! those hopes of future bliss Seem dull beside the joy that IS . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in morning 's light , And life gives me more joys to hold Than all it promised me of old . SUCCESS As we gaze up life 's slope , as we gaze In the morn , ere the dewdrops are dry , What splendour hangs over the ways , What glory gleams there in the sky , What pleasures seem waiting us , high On the peak of that beauteous slope , What rainbow-hued colours of hope , As we gaze ! As we climb up the hill , as we climb , Our hearts , our illusions , are rent : For Fate , who is spouse of old Time , Is jealous of youth and content . With brows that are brooding and bent She shadows our sunlight of gold , And the way grows lonely and cold As we climb . As we toil on , through trouble and pain , There are hands that will shelter and feed ; But once let us dare to ATTAIN - They will bruise our bare hearts till they bleed . ' T is the worst of all crimes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Know this in the darkness and dust , Ye who climb . As we stand on the heights of success , Lo ! success seems as sad as defeat ! Through the lives we may succour and bless Alone may its litter turn sweet ! And the world lying there at our feet , With its cavilling praise and its sneer , We must pity , condone , but not hear , Where we stand . As we live on those heights , we must live With the courage and pride of a god ; For the world , it has nothing to give But the scourge of the lash and the rod . Our thoughts must be noble and broad , Our purpose must challenge men 's gaze , While we seek not their blame or their praise As we live . THE LADY AND THE DAME So , thou hast the art , good dame , thou swearest , To keep Time 's perishing touch at bay From the roseate splendour of the cheek so tender , And the silver threads from the gold away . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , with kind good-will , They shall take the traces from off our faces , If we will trust to thy magic skill . Thou speakest fairly ; but if I listen And buy thy secret , and prove its truth , Hast thou the potion and magic lotion To give me also the HEART of youth ? With the cheek of rose and the eye of beauty , And the lustrous looks of life 's lost prime , Wilt thou bring thronging each hope and longing That made the glory of that dead Time ? When the sap in the trees sets young buds bursting , And the song of the birds fills the air like spray , Will rivers of feeling come once more stealing From the beautiful hills of the far-away ? Wilt thou demolish the tower of reason , And fling for ever down into the dust The caution time brought me , the lessons life taught me , And put in their places my old sweet trust ? If Time 's foot-print from my brow is driven , Canst thou , too , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me go drinking The careless pleasures of youth 's bright hours ? If silver threads from my tresses vanish , If a glow once more in my pale cheek gleams , Wilt thou slay duty and give back the beauty Of days untroubled by aught but dreams ? When the soft fair arms of the siren Summer Encircle the earth in their languorous fold , Will vast , deep oceans of sweet emotions Surge through my veins as they surged of old ? Canst thou bring back from a day long-vanished The leaping pulse and the boundless aim ? I will pay thee double , for all thy trouble , If thou wilt restore all these , good dame . HEAVEN AND HELL While forced to dwell apart from thy dear face , Love , robed like sorrow , led me by the hand And taught my doubting heart to understand That which has puzzled all the human race . Full many a sage has questioned where in space Those counter worlds were ? where the mystic strand That separates them ? I have found each land , And Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small compass of thy clasping arms , In reach and sight of thy dear lips and eyes , There , there for me the joy of Heaven lies . Outside , lo ! chaos , terrors ' wild alarms , And all the desolation fierce and fell Of void and aching nothingness , makes Hell . LOVE 'S SUPREMACY As yon great Sun in his supreme condition Absorbs small worlds and makes them all his own , So does my love absorb each vain ambition , Each outside purpose which my life has known . Stars can not shine so near that vast orb 'd splendour ; They are content to feed his flames of fire : And so my heart is satisfied to render Its strength , its all , to meet thy strong desire . As in a forest when dead leaves are falling From all save some perennial green tree , So one by one I find all pleasures palling That are not linked with or enjoyed by thee . And all the homage that the world may proffer , I take as perfumed oils or incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer , And sacrifice to Love , at thy dear feet . I love myself because thou art my lover , My name seems dear since uttered by thy voice ; Yet , argus-eyed , I watch and would discover Each blemish in the object of thy choice . I coldly sit in judgment on each error , To my soul 's gaze I hold each fault of me , Until my pride is lost in abject terror , Lest I become inadequate to thee . Like some swift-rushing and sea-seeking river , Which gathers force the farther on it goes , So does the current of my love forever Find added strength and beauty as it flows . The more I give , the more remains for giving , The more receive , the more remains to win . Ah ! only in eternities of living Will life be long enough to love thee in . THE ETERNAL WILL There is no thing we can not overcome Say not thy evil instinct is inherited , Or that some trait inborn makes thy whole life forlorn , And calls down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grandparents lies The Great Eternal Will . That , too , is thine Inheritance ; strong , beautiful , divine , Sure lever of success for one who tries . Pry up thy faults with this great lever , Will . However deeply bedded in propensity , However firmly set , I tell thee firmer yet Is that vast power that comes from Truth 's immensity . Thou art a part of that strange world , I say . Its forces lie within thee , stronger far Than all thy mortal sins and frailties are , Believe thyself divine , and watch , and pray . There is no noble height thou canst not climb . All triumphs may be thine in Time 's futurity , If whatso'er thy fault , thou dost not faint or halt , But lean upon the staff of God 's security . Earth has no claim the soul can not contest . Know thyself part of that Eternal Source , And naught can stand before thy spirit 's force . The soul 's divine inheritance is best . INSIGHT On the river of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit 's sight That many a nauseous weed of wrong Has root in a seed of right . For evil is good that has gone astray , And sorrow is only blindness , And the world is always under the sway Of a changeless law of kindness . The commonest error a truth can make Is shouting its sweet voice hoarse , And sin is only the soul 's mistake In misdirecting its force . And love , the fairest of all fair things That ever to man descended , Grows rank with nettles and poisonous things Unless it is watched and tended . There could not be anything better than this Old world in the way it began ; And though some matters have gone amiss From the great original plan , And however dark the skies may appear , And however souls may blunder , I tell you it all will work out clear , For good lies over and under . A WOMAN 'S LOVE So vast the tide of love within me surging , It overflows like some stupendous sea , The confines of the Present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel it urging , As it would cry , " Thou , too , shalt yield to me ! " All other loves my supreme love embodies ; I would be she on whose soft bosom nursed Thy clinging infant lips to quench their thirst ; She who trod close to hidden worlds where God is , That she might have , and hold , and see thee first . I would be she who stirred the vague , fond fancies Of thy still childish heart ; who through bright days Went sporting with thee in the old-time plays , And caught the sunlight of thy boyish glances In half-forgotten and long-buried Mays . Forth to the end , and back to the beginning , My love would send its inundating tide , Wherein all landmarks of thy past should hide . If thy life 's lesson MUST be learned through sinning , My grieving virtue would become thy guide . For I would share the burden of thy errors , So when the sun of our brief life had set , If thou didst walk in darkness and regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My soul and thine should be companions yet . And I would cross with thee those troubled oceans Of dark remorse whose waters are despair : All things my jealous , reckless love would dare , So that thou mightst not recollect emotions In which it did not have a part and share . There is no limit to my love 's full measure , It 's spirit-gold is shaped by earth 's alloy ; I would be friend and mother , mate and toy , I 'd have thee look to me for every pleasure , And in me find all memories of joy . Yet though I love thee in such selfish fashion , I would wait on thee , sitting at thy feet , And serving thee , if thou didst deem it meet . And couldst thou give me one fond hour of passion , I 'd take that hour and call my life complete . THE PAEAN OF PEACE With ever some wrong to be righting , With self ever seeking for place , The world has been striving and fighting Since man was evolved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fearlessly cast , He shows us tribes warring in legions , In jungles of ages long passed . Religion , forgetting her station , Forgetting her birthright from God , Set nation to warring with nation And scattered dissension abroad . Dear creeds have made men kill each other , Fair faith has bred hate and despair , And brother has battled with brother Because of a difference in prayer . But earth has grown wiser and kinder , For man is evolving a soul : From wars of an age that was blinder , We rise to a peace-girdled goal . Where once men would murder in treason And slaughter each other in hordes , They now meet together and reason , With thoughts for their weapons , not swords . The brute in humanity dwindles And lessens as time speeds along , And the spark of Divinity kindles And blazes up brightly and strong . The seer can behold in the distance The race that shall people the world - Strong men of a godlike existence Unarmed , and with war banners furled . No longer the bloodthirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales of red warfare and ravage Shall seem like ghost stories of old . For the booming of guns and the rattle Of carnage and conflict shall cease , And the bugle-call , leading to battle , Shall change to a paean of peace . " HAS BEEN " That melancholy phrase " It might have been , " However sad , doth in its heart enfold A hidden germ of promise ! for I hold WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHALL BE . Though in Some other realm and life , the soul must win The goal that erst was possible . But cold And cruel as the sound of frozen mould Dropped on a coffin , are the words " Has been . " " She has been beautiful "  --  " he has been great , " " Rome has been powerful , " we sigh and say . It is the pitying crust we toss decay , The dirge we breathe o'er some degenerate state , An epitaph for fame 's unburied dead . God pity those who live to hear it said ! DUTY 'S PATH Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of pleasure ; With eager steps we walk that way To brim joy 's largest measure . But when with morn 's departing beam Goes youth 's last precious minute , We sigh " ' T was but a fevered dream - There 's nothing in it . " Then on our vision dawns afar The goal of glory , gleaming Like some great radiant solar star , And sets us longing , dreaming . Forgetting all things left behind , We strain each nerve to win it , But when ' t is ours  --  alas ! we find There 's nothing in it . We turn our sad , reluctant gaze Upon the path of duty ; Its barren , uninviting ways Are void of bloom and beauty . Yet in that road , though dark and cold , It seems as we begin it , As we press on  --  lo ! we behold There 's Heaven in it . MARCH Like some reformer , who with mien austere , Neglected dress , and loud insistent tones , More rasping than the wrongs which she bemoans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While yet we know the need of such reform ; So comes unlovely March , with wind and storm , To break the spell of winter , and set free The poisoned brooks and crocus beds oppressed . Severe of face , gaunt-armed , and wildly dressed , She is not fair nor beautiful to see . But merry April and sweet smiling May Come not till March has first prepared the way . THE END OF THE SUMMER The birds laugh loud and long together When Fashion 's followers speed away At the first cool breath of autumn weather . Why , this is the time , cry the birds , to stay ! When the deep calm sea and the deep sky over Both look their passion through sun-kissed space , As a blue-eyed maid and her blue-eyed lover Might each gaze into the other 's face . Oh ! this is the time when careful spying Discovers the secrets Nature knows . You find when the butterflies plan for flying ( Before the thrush or the blackbird goes ) , You see some day by the water 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then off over the hills and hedges It flutters away on the summer 's track . The shy little sumacs , in lonely places , Bowed all summer with dust and heat , Like clean-clad children with rain-washed faces , Are dressed in scarlet from head to feet . And never a flower had the boastful summer , In all the blossoms that decked her sod , So royal hued as that later comer The purple chum of the goldenrod . Some chill grey dawn you note with grieving That the King of Autumn is on his way . You see , with a sorrowful , slow believing , How the wanton woods have gone astray . They wear the stain of bold caresses , Of riotous revels with old King Frost ; They dazzle all eyes with their gorgeous dresses , Nor care that their green young leaves are lost . A wet wind blows from the East one morning , The wood 's gay garments looked draggled out . You hear a sound , and your heart takes warning - The birds are planning their winter route . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ruffled , their voices loud ; Then whirr  --  and away in a feathered tangle , To fade in the south like a passing cloud . Envoi A songless wood stripped bare of glory - A sodden moor that is black and brown ; The year has finished its last love-story : Oh ! let us away to the gay bright town . SUN SHADOWS There never was success so nobly gained , Or victory so free from selfish dross , But in the winning some one had been pained Or some one suffered loss . There never was so nobly planned a fete , Or festal throng with hearts on pleasure bent , But some neglected one outside the gate Wept tears of discontent . There never was a bridal morning fair With hope 's blue skies and love 's unclouded sun For two fond hearts , that did not bring despair To some sad other one . " HE THAT LOOKETH " Yea , she and I have broken God 's command , And in His sight are branded with our shame . And yet I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have touched her hand Or brushed her garments . But I chanced to stand Beside her in the throng ! A sweet , swift flame Shot from her flesh to mine  --  and hers the blame Of willing looks that fed it ; aye , that fanned The glow within me to a hungry fire . There was an invitation in her eyes . Had she met mine with coldness or surprise , I had not plunged on headlong in the mire Of amorous thought . The flame leaped high and higher ; Her breath and mine pulsated into sighs , And soft glance melted into glance kiss-wise , And in God 's sight both yielded to desire . AN ERRING WOMAN 'S LOVE PART I She was a light and wanton maid : Not one whom fickle Love betrayed , For indolence was her undoer . Fair , frivolous , and very poor , She scorned the thought of toil , in youth , And chose the path that leads from truth . More women fall from want of gold Than love leads wrong , if truth were told ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blinding fire . Her god was gold : and gold she saw Prove mightier than the sternest law With judge and jury , priest and king ; So , made herself an offering At Mammon 's shrine ; and lived for power , And ease , and pleasures of the hour . Who looks beneath life 's outer crust Is satisfied that God is just ; Who looks not under , but about , Finds much to make him sad with doubt . For Virtue walks with feet worn bare , While Sin rides by with coach and pair : Men praise the modest heart and chaste , And yet they let it go to waste , And follow , fierce to have and hold , Some creature , wanton , selfish , bold . She saw but this , life 's outer side , No higher faith was hers to guide ; She worshipped gold , and hated toil , And hence her youth with all its soil , With all its sins too dark to name , Of secret crimes and public shame , With all its trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And weeping mothers . Proud and gay She went her devastating way With untouched brow and fadeless grace . Not time , but feeling , marks the face . Sin on the outer being tells Not till the startled soul rebels : And she felt nothing but content . She was too light and indolent To worry over days to come . This little earth held all life 's sum , She thought , and to be young and fair , Well clothed , well fed , was all her care . With pitying eyes and lifted head She gazed on those who toiled for bread , And laughed to scorn the talk she heard Of punishment for those who erred , And virtue 's certain recompense . She seemed devoid of moral sense , An ignorant thing whose appetites Bound her horizon of delights . Men were her puppets to control ; Unconscious of a heart or soul She lived , and gloried in the ease She purchased by her power to please The eye and senses . Life 's one woe Which caused her pitying tears to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined for her sake , She showed no mercy . But when need Of gold she saw , her heart would bleed . The lack of clothing , fire , and food Was earth 's one pain , she understood . The suffering poor oft blest her name , Nor questioned whence the ducats came , She gave so freely . Once she found A fainting woman on the ground , A wailing child clasped to her breast . With her own hands she bathed and dressed The weary waifs ! gave food and gold And clothed them warmly from the cold , Nor guessed that one she lured from home Had caused that suffering pair to roam Unhoused , neglected . Then one day , Unheralded across her way , The conqueror came . She knew not why , But with the first glance of his eye A feeling , new and unexplained , Woke in her what she oft had feigned . And when his arm stole near her waist , As startled maidens blush with chaste Sweet fear at love 's advances , so She blushed from brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraught with joy And pain commingled , made her coy ; But when he would have clasped her neck With gems that might a queen bedeck And offered gold , her lips grew white With sudden anger at the sight Of what had been her god for years . She flung them from her . Then such tears As only spring from love 's despair Welled from her eyes . " So , lady fair , My gifts are scorned ? " quoth he , and laughed . " Like Cleopatra , you have quaffed Such lordly pearls in draughts of wine , You spurn poor simple gems like mine . Well , well , fair queen , I 'll bring to you A richer gift next time . Adieu . " His light words stung like lash of whip ; With gasping breath and ashen lip She strove to speak , but he was gone She kneeled and pressed her mouth upon The latch his hand had touched , the floor His foot had trod , and o'er and o'er She sobbed his name , as children moan A mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roseate gloom And subtle odours of her room Accusing memories rose . She felt A loneliness that seemed to belt The universe in its embrace . It was as if from some high place A giant hand had reached and hurled To nothingness her petty world , And left her staring , awed , alone , Up into regions vast , unknown . There is no other loneliness That can so sadden and oppress As when beside the burned-out fire Of sated passion and desire The wakening spirit , in a glance , Beholds its lost inheritance . She rose and turned the dim lights higher , Brought forth rich gems and grand attire , And robed herself in feverish haste ; Before the mirror posed and paced , With jewels on her breast and wrists ; Then sudden clenched her little fists And beat her face until it bled , And tore her garments shred from shred , Gazed in the mirror , spoke her name And hissed a word that told her shame , Then on her knees fell sobbing there . There are sweet messengers of prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer aid to all who kneel . Her lips , unused to pious phrase , Recalled some words of bygone days , And " Now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord my soul to keep , " She whispered timidly , and then , " Lord , let me be a child again And grow up good . " The strange prayer said , Like some o'er-weary child , her head She pillowed on her arm , and wept Low , shuddering sobs , until she slept And dreamed ; and in that dream she thought She sat within a vine-wreathed cot ; An infant slumbered on her breast , She crooned a lullaby , and pressed Its waxen hand against her cheek , While one , too proud and fond to speak , The happy father of the child , Stood near , and gazing on them , smiled . She woke while still the lullaby Was on her lips  --  then such a cry , As souls in fabled realms below Might utter , voiced her awful woe . The mighty moral labour-pain Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She understood The meaning now of womanhood , And chastity , and o'er her came The full , dark sense of all her shame . As some poor drunken wretch , at night , Wakes up to know his piteous plight , And sees , while sinking in the mire , Afar , his waiting hearth-light 's fire ; So now she saw from depths of sin The hearth-light of the might-have-been . How beautiful , how like a star That lost light shone , but ah , how far ! She reached her longing arms toward space , And lifted up her tear-wet face . " O God , " she wailed , " I have been bad ! I see it all , and I am sad , And long to be a good girl now . Lord , Lord , will some one show me how ? Why , men have trod the burning track Of sin for years , and then gone back ! And can not I for sin atone , Or did Christ die for men alone ? I want to lead an honest life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold upon my breast his child . " Then suddenly her voice grew wild , " No , no , " she cried , " it could not be - Those infant eyes would torture me : Though God condoned my sinful ways , I could not meet my child 's pure gaze . " She hid her face upon her knees , And swayed as reeds sway in a breeze . " O Christ , " she moaned , " could I forget , There might be something for me yet : But though both God and man forgave , And I should win the love I crave , Why , memory would drive me mad . " When woman drifts from good to bad , To make her final fall complete , She puts her soul beneath her feet . Man 's dual selves seem separate ; He leaves his soul outside sin 's gate , And finds it waiting when he tires Of carnal pleasures and desires , Depleted , sickened , and depressed , As souls must be with such a test , Yet strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , far more complicate , Can take no chances with her fate ; A subtle creature , finely spun , Her body and her soul are one . And now this erring woman wept The soul she murdered while it slept . She felt too stunned with pain to think . She seemed to stand upon a brink ; Behind her loomed the sinful past , Below her , rocks , beyond her , vast And awful darkness . Not one ray Of sun or star to show the way ! She drew a long and shuddering breath ; " There is no other path but death For me to tread , " she sighed , " and so I will prepare my house and go . " As housewives move with willing feet And skilful hands to make things neat And ready for some welcome one , She toiled until her tasks were done . Then , seated at her desk , she wrote , With painful care , a tear-wet note . The childish penmanship was rude , Ill spelled the words , the phrasing crude ; Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great despair . " Dear heart , " it ran , " you did not know How , from the first , I loved you so , That sin grew hateful in my sight ; And so I leave it all to-night . The kiss I gave , dear heart , to you Was love 's first kiss , as pure and true As ever lips of maiden gave . I think ' twill warm my lonely grave , And light the pathway I must tread Among the hapless , homeless dead . " When God formed worlds , He failed to make A path for erring feet to take Back into light and peace again , Unless they were the feet of men . When woman errs , and then regrets , Her sun of hope for ever sets , And life is hung with deepest gloom . In all the world there is no room For such as she ; and so I hold That death itself is not so cold As life has seemed , since by love 's light I saw there was a wrong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By my own hands , for tarnished gold . I hated labour , hence I fell ; But now I love you , dear , so well , No greater boon my soul could crave Than just to toil , a galley-slave , Through burdened years and years of life , If at the last you called me wife For one supreme and honoured hour . Alas ! too late I learn love 's power , Too late I realise my loss , And have no strength to bear my cross Of loneliness and dark disgrace . There can not be another place So desolate , so full of fear , As earth to me , without you , dear . " You will not understand , I know , How one like me can love you so . It was a strange , strange thing . Love came So like a swift , devouring flame And burned my frail , fair-weather boat And left me on the waves afloat , With nothing but a broken spar . The distant shores seem very far ; I can not reach them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , Because I die for love , like One The good Book tells about , His Son . " For erring woman death can bring No pain so keen as memory 's sting . Good-night , good-bye . God bless you , dear , And give you love , and joy , and cheer ! But sometimes , in the dark night , say A prayer for one who went astray , And found no pathway back , and died For love of you  --  a suicide . " When morn his glorious pinions spread , They found the erring woman , dead . PART II She woke as one wakes from a deep And dreamless , yet exhausting , sleep . A strange confusion filled her mind , And sorrows vague and undefined , Like half-remembered faces pressed To memory 's window , in her breast , Gazed at her with reproachful eyes . She felt a sudden , dazed surprise , Commingled with a sense of dread , " I did but sleep  --  I am not dead , " The potion and the purpose failed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nay , thou art dead , rash suicide , " A sad voice spake : and at her side She saw a weird and shadowy crowd With anguished lips , and shoulders bowed , And orbs that seemed the wells of woe . She shrieked and veiled her eyes . " No , no ! " I am not dead ! I ache with life . An earthly passion 's hopeless strife " Still tortures me . " " Yet thou art dead , " The voice with sad insistence said . " But love and sorrow and regret All die with death . I feel them yet . " " God bade thee live , and only He Can say when thou shalt cease to be . " " But I was sin-sick , sad , alone - I thought by death I could atone , " And died that Christ might show me how . " " Christ bore His burden , why not thou ? " " Oh ! lead me to His holy feet And let my penance be complete . " " What ! thinkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven 's wrath " By thy rash deed ? Nay , nay , not so , ' T is but perfected spirits go " To that supreme and final goal . A self-sought death delays the soul . " With yonder shuddering , woeful throng Of suicides thy ways belong . " Close to the earth a shadowy band , Unseen , but seeing all , they stand " Until their natural time to die , As God intended , shall draw nigh . " On earth , repentant , sick of sin , A ministering angel thou hadst been " Whose patient toil and deeds divine Had rescued souls as sad as thine , " Each deed a firm ascending stair To lead beyond thy great despair . " But now it is thy mournful fate To linger here and meditate " On thy dark past  --  to stand so near The earthly plane that thou canst hear " Thy lover 's voice , while old desire Shall burn within thee like a fire , " And grief shall root thee to the spot To find how soon thou art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That only fragile woman knows , " And loved as only woman can , Thou shalt not suffer all that man " Must suffer when he interferes With God 's great law . In death 's dim spheres " That justice waits , which men refuse . Thy sex shall in some part excuse " Thy desperate deed . When God shall send A second death to be thy friend , " Thou need'st not fear a darker fate - Go forth with yonder throng , and wait . " A SONG OF REPUBLICS Fair Freedom 's ship , too long adrift - Of every wind the sport - Now rigged and manned , her course well planned , Sails proudly out of port ; And fluttering gaily from the mast This motto is unfurled , Let all men heed its truth who read : " Republics rule the World ! " The universe is high as God ! Good is the final goal ; The world revolves and man evolves A purpose and a soul . No church can bind , no crown forbid Thought 's mighty upward course - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspires its force . The hero of a vanished age Was one who bathed in gore ; Who best could fight was noblest knight In savage days of yore ; Now warrior chiefs are out of date , The times have changed . To-day We call men great who arbitrate And keep war 's hounds at bay . The world no longer looks to priest Or prince to know its needs ; Earth 's human throng has grown too strong To rule with courts and creeds . We want no kings but kings of toil - No crowns but crowns of deeds ; Not royal birth but sterling worth Must mark the man who leads . Proud monarchies are out of step With modern thought to-day , For Brotherhood is understood , And thrones may pass away . Men dare to think . Concerted thought Contains more power than swords : The force that binds united minds Defeats mere savage hordes . Man needs no arbitrary hand To keep him in control ; He feels the power grow hour by hour Of his expanding soul : In God 's stupendous scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no slave to cringe , and crave Some worthless monarch 's grace . As ocean billows undermine The haughty shores each hour , Time 's sea has brought its waves of thought To crumble thrones of power ; And one by one shall kingdoms fall Like leaves before the blast , As man with man combines to plan Republics formed to last . Columbia baulked a tyrant king , And built upon a rock , In Freedom 's name , a shrine whose fame Outlived the century 's shock . Now France within our port has set Her symbol of re-birth ; Her lifted hand tells sea and land Republics light the earth . One mighty church for all the world Would make men far more kind ; One government would bring content To many a restless mind . Sail on , fair ship of Freedom , sail The wide sea 's breadth and length . ' Till worlds unite to make the might Of " One Republic 's " strength . MEMORIAL DAY  --  1892 The quiet graves of our country 's braves Through thirty Junes and Decembers Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation remembers . The marching of feet and the flags on the street Told once again this morning , In the voice of the drum how the day had come For those lowly beds ' adorning . Then swiftly back on Time 's worn track His three decades seemed driven , And with startled eyes I saw arise , From graves by fancy riven , The Gray and Blue in a grand review . Oh ! vast were the hosts they numbered , As they wheeled and swayed in a dress parade O'er the graves where they long had slumbered . The colours were not , as when they fought , Ranked one against the other , But a mingled hue of gray and blue , As brother marching with brother . And a blue flower lay on each coat of gray , Like forget-me-nots on a boulder ; And the gray moss lace in its Southern grace Was knotted on each blue shoulder . The vision fled ; but I think our dead , If they could come back with the living , Would clasp warm hands o'er hostile lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossoms of Spring that you gather and bring To graves that though lowly are royal , Let the blue flower prevail , though modest and pale , Since it speaks of the hue that was loyal . But tie each bouquet with a ribbon of gray And lay it on memory 's altar , For the dead who fought for the cause they thought Was right , and who did not falter . WHEN BABY SOULS SAIL OUT When from our mortal vision Grown men and women go To sail strange fields Elysian And know what spirits know , I think of them as tourists , In some sun-gilded clime , ' Mong happy sights and dear delights We all shall find , in time . But when a child goes yonder And leaves its mother here , Its little feet must wander , It seems to me , in fear . What paths of Eden beauty , What scenes of peace and rest , Can bring content to one who went Forth from a mother 's breast ? In palace gardens , lonely , A little child will roam And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not won by splendour , Nor bought by costly toys ; To hide from harm on mother 's arm Makes all its sum of joys . It must be when the baby Goes journeying off alone , Some angel ( Mary , may be ) Adopts it for her own . Yet when a child is taken Whose mother stays below , With weeping eyes , through Paradise , I seem to see it go . With troops of angels trying To drive away its fear , I seem to hear it crying , " I want my mamma here . " I do not court the fancy , It is not based on doubt , It is a thought that comes unsought When baby souls sail out . TO ANOTHER WOMAN 'S BABY I list your prattle , baby boy , And hear your pattering feet With feelings more of pain than joy And thoughts of bitter-sweet . While touching your soft hands in play Such passionate longings rise For my wee boy who strayed away So soon to Paradise . You win me with your infant art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradle in my heart Seems lonelier than before . Sweet baby boy , you do not guess How oft mine eyes are dim , Or that my lingering caress Is sometimes meant for HIM . DIAMONDS The tears of fallen women turned to ice By man 's cold pity for repentant vice . RUBIES The crimson life-drops from a virgin heart Pierced to the core by Cupid 's fatal dart . SAPPHIRES Lost rays of light that wandered off alone And down through space were hurled From that great sapphire sun beyond our own Pale , puny little world . TURQUOISE A baby went to heaven while it slept , And , waking , missed its mother 's arms , and wept . Those angel tear-drops , falling earthward through God 's azure skies , into the turquoise grew . REFORM The time has come when men with hearts and brains Must rise and take the misdirected reins Of government ; too long left in the hands Of aliens and of lackeys . He who stands And sees the mighty vehicle of State Hauled through the mire to some ignoble fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is no American , A MINOR CHORD I heard a strain of music in the street - A wandering waif of sound . And then straightway A nameless desolation filled the day . The great green earth that had been fair and sweet , Seemed but a tomb ; the life I thought replete With joy , grew lonely for a vanished May . Forgotten sorrows resurrected lay Like bleaching skeletons about my feet . Above me stretched the silent , suffering sky , Dumb with vast anguish for departed suns That brutal Time to nothingness has hurled . The daylight was as sad as smiles that lie Upon the wistful , unkissed mouths of nuns , And I stood prisoned in an awful world . DEATH 'S PROTEST Why dost thou shrink from my approach , O Man ? Why dost thou ever flee in fear , and cling To my false rival , Life ? I do but bring Thee rest and calm . Then wherefore dost thou ban And curse me ? Since the forming of God 's plan I have not hurt or harmed a mortal thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And peace eternal for earth 's stormy span . The wild mad prayers for comfort sent in vain To knock at the indifferent heart of Life , I , Death , have answered . Knowest thou not ' t is he , My cruel rival , who sends all thy pain And wears the soul out in unending strife ? Why dost thou hold to him , then , spurning me ? SEPTEMBER My life 's long radiant Summer halts at last , And lo ! beside my path way I behold Pursuing Autumn glide : nor frost nor cold Has heralded her presence ; but a vast Sweet calm that comes not till the year has passed Its fevered solstice , and a tinge of gold Subdues the vivid colouring of bold And passion-hued emotions . I will cast My August days behind me with my May , Nor strive to drag them into Autumn 's place , Nor swear I hope when I do but remember . Now violet and rose have had their day , I 'll pluck the soberer asters with good grace And call September nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubles our worries an ' our troubles , These scientific fellows are spoilin ' of our land ; With motor , wire , an ' cable , now ' - days we 're scarcely able To walk or ride in peace o ' mind , an ' ' tis n't safe to stand . It fairly makes me crazy to see how tarnal lazy The risin ' generation grows  --  an ' science is to blame . With telephones for talkin ' , an ' messengers for walkin ' , Our young men sit an ' loaf an ' smoke , without a blush o ' shame . An ' then they wer' n't contented until some one invented A sort o ' jerky tape-line clock , to help on wasteful ways . An ' that infernal ticker spends money fur ' em quicker Than any neighbourhood o ' men in good old bygone days . The risin ' generation is bent so on creation , Folks have n't time to talk or sing or cry or even laugh . But if you take the notion to want some such emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the phonograph . But now a crazy creature has introduced the feature Of artificial weather , I think we 're nearly through . For when we once go strainin ' to keep it dry or rainin ' To suit the general public , ' twill bust the world in two , WAS , IS , AND YET-TO-BE Was , Is , and Yet-to-Be Were chatting over a cup of tea . In tarnished finery smelling of must , Was talked of people long turned to dust ; Of titles and honours and high estate , All forgotten or out of date ; Of wonderful feasts in the long ago , Of pride that perished with nothing to show . " I loathe the present , " said Was , with a groan ; " I live in pleasures that I HAVE known . " The Yet-to-be , in a gown of gauze , Looked over the head of musty Was , And gazed far off into misty space With a wrapt expression upon her face . " Such wonderful pleasures are coming to me , Such glory , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the vast Has-Been , Of such successes as I shall win . " The past , the present  --  why , what are they ? I live for the joy of a future day . " Then practical Is , in a fresh print dress , Spoke up with a laugh , " I must confess " I find to-day so pleasant , " she said , " I never look back , and seldom ahead . " Whatever has been , is a finished sum ; Whatever will be  --  why , let it come . " To-day is mine . And so , you see , I have the past and the yet-to-be ; " For to-day is the future of yesterday , And the past of to-morrow . I live while I may , " And I think the secret of pleasure is this . And this alone , " said practical Is . MISTAKES God sent us here to make mistakes , To strive , to fail , to re-begin , To taste the tempting fruit of sin , And find what bitter food it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To wander blindly in the night ; But , searching , praying for the light , Until at last we find the way . And looking back along the past , We know we needed all the strain Of fear and doubt and strife and pain To make us value peace , at last . Who fails , finds later triumph sweet ; Who stumbles once , walks then with care , And knows the place to cry " Beware " To other unaccustomed feet . Through strife the slumbering soul awakes , We learn on error 's troubled route The truths we could not prize without The sorrow of our sad mistakes . DUAL You say that your nature is double ; that life Seems more and more intricate , complex , and dual , Because in your bosom there wages the strife ' Twixt an angel of light and a beast that is cruel - An angel who whispers your spirit has wings , And a beast who would chain you to temporal things . I listen with interest to all you have told , And now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be envied , not pitied ; I hold THAT EVERY STRONG NATURE IS ALWAYS MADE DOUBLE . The beast has his purpose ; he need not be slain : He should serve the good angel in harness and chain . The body that never knows carnal desires , The heart that to passion is always a stranger , Is merely a furnace with unlighted fires ; It sends forth no warmth while it threatens no danger . But who wants to shiver in cold safety there ? TOUCH FLAME TO THE FUEL ! then watch it with care . Those wild , fierce emotions that trouble your soul Are sparks from the great source of passion and power ; Throne reason above them , and give it control , And turn into blessing this dangerous dower . By lightnings unguided destruction is hurled , But chained and directed they gladden the world . THE ALL-CREATIVE SPARK Pain can go guised as joy , dross pass for gold , Vulgarity can masquerade as wit , Or spite wear friendship 's garments ; but I hold That passionate feeling has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent men , lent For inspiration and for sacrament . Jove never could have made the Universe Had he not glowed with passion 's sacred fire ; Though man oft turns the blessing to a curse , And burns himself on his own funeral pyre , Though scarred the soul be where its light burns bright , Yet where it is not , neither is there might . Yea , it was set in Jove 's resplendent crown When he created worlds ; that done , why , hence , He cast the priceless , awful jewel down To be man 's punishment and recompense . And that is how he sees and hears our tears Unmoved and calm from the eternal spheres . But sometimes , since he parted with all passion , In trifling mood , to pass the time away , He has created men in that same fashion , And many women ( jesting as gods may ) , Who have no souls to be inspired or fired , Mere sport of idle gods who have grown tired . And these poor puppets , gazing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no higher ; And when they see the all-creative spark In other souls , they straightway cry out , " Fire ! " And shriek , and rave , till their dissent is spent , While listening gods laugh loud in merriment . BE NOT CONTENT Be not content  --  contentment means inaction ; The growing soul aches on its upward quest ; Satiety is twin to satisfaction ; All great achievements spring from life 's unrest . The tiny roots , deep in the dark mould hiding , Would never bless the earth with leaf and flower Were not an inborn restlessness abiding In seed and germ , to stir them with its power . Were man contented with his lot forever , He had not sought strange seas with sails unfurled , And the vast wonder of our shores had never Dawned on the gaze of an admiring world . Prize what is yours , but be not quite contented . There is a healthful restlessness of soul By which a mighty purpose is augmented In urging men to reach a higher goal . So when the restless impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not grieve ; It is the upward reaching of the spirit Of the God in you to achieve  --  achieve . ACTION For ever stars are winging Their swift and endless race ; For ever suns are swinging Their mighty globes through space . Since by his law required To join God 's spheres inspired , The earth has never tired , But whirled and whirled and whirled . For ever streams are flowing , For ever seeds are growing , Alway is Nature showing That Action rules the world . And since by God requested To BE , the glorious light Has never paused or rested , But travelled day and night . Yet pigmy man , unseeing The purpose of his being , Demands escape and freeing From universal force . But law is law for ever , And like a mighty lever It thrusts him tow'rd endeavour , And speeds him on his course . TWO ROSES A humble wild-rose , pink and slender , Was plucked and placed in a bright bouquet , Beside a Jacqueminot 's royal splendour , And both in my lady 's boudoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scorning , " I wonder why you are called a rose ? Your leaves will fade in a single morning ; No blood of mine in your pale cheek glows . " Your coarse green stalk shows dust of the highway , You have no depths of fragrant bloom ; And what could you learn in a rustic byway To fit you to lie in my lady 's room ? " If called to adorn her warm , white bosom , What have you to offer for such a place , Beside my fragrant and splendid blossom , Ripe with colour and rich with grace ? " Said the sweet wild-rose , " Despite your dower Of finer breeding and deeper hue , Despite your beauty , fair , high-bred flower , It is I who should lie on her breast , not you . " For small account is your hot-house glory Beside the knowledge that came to me When I heard by the wayside love 's old story And felt the kiss of the amorous bee . " SATIETY To yearn for what we have not had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate , Why , that is heaven compared to having it With all the power gone to appreciate . Better to wait and yearn , and still to wait , And die at last with unappeased desire , Than live to be the jest of such a fate , For that is my conception of hell-fire . A SOLAR ECLIPSE In that great journey of the stars through space About the mighty , all-directing Sun , The pallid , faithful Moon has been the one Companion of the Earth . Her tender face , Pale with the swift , keen purpose of that race Which at Time 's natal hour was first begun , Shines ever on her lover as they run And lights his orbit with her silvery smile . Sometimes such passionate love doth in her rise , Down from her beaten path she softly slips , And with her mantle veils the Sun 's bold eyes , Then in the gloaming finds her lover 's lips . While far and near the men our world call wise See only that the Sun is in eclipse . A SUGGESTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though not to thee So delicately perfect as the white And unwed lily drooping in the light , Though she has known the kisses of the bee And tells her amorous tale to passers-by In perfumed whispers and with untaught grace , Still let the red-rose bloom in her own place ; She could not be the lily should she try . Why to the wondrous nightingale cry hush Or bid her cease her wild heart-breaking lay , And tune her voice to imitate the way The whip-poor-will makes music , or the thrush ? All airs of sorrow to one theme belong , And passion is not copyrighted yet . Each heart writes its own music . Why not let The nightingale unchided sing her song ? THE DEPTHS Not only sun-kissed heights are fair . Below The cold , dark billows of the frowning deep Do lovely blossoms of the ocean sleep , Rocked gently by the waters to and fro . The coral beds with magic colours glow , And priceless pearl-encrusted molluscs heap The glittering rocks where shining atoms leap Like living broken rainbows . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sullen surface meets our frightened gaze , As down we sink to darkness and despair . But at the depths  --  such beauty ! such delight ! Such flowers as never grew in pleasure 's ways ! Ah ! not alone are sun-kissed summits fair . LIFE 'S OPERA Like an opera-house is the world , I ween , Where the passionate lover of music is seen In the balcony near the roof : While the very best seat in the first stage-box Is filled by the person who laughs and talks Through the harmony 's warp and woof . THE SALT SEA-WIND When Venus , mother and maker of blisses , Rose out of the billows , large-limbed , and fair , She stood on the sands and blew sweet kisses To the salt sea-wind as she dried her hair . And the salt sea-wind was the first to caress her To praise her beauty and call her sweet , The first of the whole wide world to possess her , She , that creature of light and heat . Though the sea is old with its sorrows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , Yet the salt sea-wind is full of the languors That Venus taught on her natal morn . And now whoever dwells there by the ocean , And feels the wind on his hair and face , Is stirred by a subtle and keen emotion , The lingering spell of that first embrace . NEW YEAR New Year , I look straight in your eyes - Our ways and our interests blend ; You may be a foe in disguise , But I shall believe you a friend . We get what we give in our measure , We can not give pain and get pleasure ; I give you good will and good cheer , And you must return it , New Year . We get what we give in this life , Though often the giver indeed Waits long upon doubting and strife Ere proving the truth of my creed . But somewhere , some way , and for ever Reward is the meed of endeavour ; And if I am really worth while , New Year , you will give me your smile . You hide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not control , If I trust my own courage and stand On the Infinite strength of my soul . Man holds in his brain and his spirit A power that is God-like , or near it , And he who has measured his force Can govern events and their course . You come with a crown on your brow , New Year , without blemish or spot ; Yet you , and not I , sir , must bow , For time is the servant of thought Whatever you bring me of trouble Shall turn into good , and then double , If my spirit looks up without fear To the Source that you came from , New Year . CONCENTRATION The age is too diffusive . Time and Force Are frittered out and bring no satisfaction . The way seems lost to straight determined action . Like shooting stars that zig-zag from their course We wander from our orbit 's pathway ; spoil The role we 're fitted for , to fail in twenty . Bring empty measures , that were shaped for plenty , At last as guerdon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this generation Because no more man centres on one thought . We know this truth , and yet we heed it not : The secret of success is Concentration . THOUGHTS Thoughts do not need the wings of words To fly to any goal . Like subtle lightnings , not like birds , They speed from soul to soul . Hide in your heart a bitter thought - Still it has power to blight ; Think Love  --  although you speak it not It gives the world more light . LUCK Luck is the tuning of our inmost thought To chord with God 's great plan . That done , ah ! know , Thy silent wishes to results shall grow , And day by day shall miracles be wrought . Once let thy being selflessly be brought To chime with universal good , and lo ! What music from the spheres shall through thee flow ! What benefits shall come to thee unsought ! Shut out the noise of traffic ! Rise above The body 's clamour ! With the soul 's fine ear Attune thyself to harmonies divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love . Keep to the score , and thou hast naught to fear ; Achievements yet undreamed of shall be thine . ***
