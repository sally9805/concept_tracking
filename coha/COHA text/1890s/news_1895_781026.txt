txt The Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst preached yesterday morning on " How to Realize the Sinfulness of Sin , " and in the course of his sermon charged a number of clergymen with lack of honor in having misapplied a fund which was raised for a specific purpose and intrusted to their care . In this connection he said : " Instead of feeling our personal tele " . tion to our own particular sin , we merge ourselves in the crowd and form our moral estimate as one of the crowd . " Now , a crowd has no conscience . It le customary to say that a corporation has no conscience , and it is likewise true that a crowd has no conscience . Society has no conscience . " There is no quick and clear movement of the moral faculty , except when there is a distinct sense of individuality . That is an unquestionable fact , and goes far toward accounting for what may be called the dee cline in the associate character of a come community . I will give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were to put a certain amount money in the hands of a Christian man to be applied by him to a specific object ? which you yourself designated , he would feel himself morally bound to apply that money according to that designation , and if he were one man he could be trusted V ; stand by his obligation . " Now , a few weeks ago there was all amount of money received for a specific object , and it was put in the hands , not of one man , but of a ? body of men , and a good many of these men , I am told , were clergy men , and they voted to apply that money , in a way that was not intended nor speci. fled by the donors , and not only that , they applied it in a way that was particularly distasteful and offensive to a good many A the donors . " If it had been one man that misappropriated funds in that way it would have been rascally , and he would have felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of men was every whit as rascally , but perhaps not one individual of that body sol voting felt the indefensible iniquity of the proceeding , for the reason that he voted as one of a crowd , and a crowd has no con. ' science . " It is a considerable part of the art of strong living to be able to preserve one 's individuality in the midst of the multitudes and to do conscientiously even that whicbi one does in his corporate capacity . But there is the root of a great deal of current backsliding . In matters that men have all associate interest in , each inclines to let the associate conscience decide , and the assoe elate conscience is no conscience . Other people do it , and why should n't I ? That crowd sees nothing wrong in doing it , and therefore I will do it . ' That is the precess . We are all familiar with it , and all have suffered from it , probably . " When we farm out questions of right and wrong to the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular judgment than we have in mai own , but it is because we want moral quest flans passed upon by somebody , and because we know that a collective moral opinion will involve a maxireium of opinion ) with a minimum of morals . " Dr. Parkhurst 's charge against the clergy .. men and others created a sensation , and Dr. Parkhurst was besieged with inqufrers who wanted to know to whom he referred .. But Dr. Parkhurst was reticent . To a , re ' porter for The New-York Times he said : " Ministers are very apt to accuse Wale Street brokers and business men generally of doing that of which conscience could not approve , and when I was made cognizant of similar conduct on the part of clergymert I could not refrain from speaking my mind about it . " I may not be as strict a Calvinist ae some , but I have a very clear idea of rights and wrong , and I know that nalsapplicatioti of funds is quite as grave an offense for clergymen as for bank Directors or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergymen who are referred to in my sermon . I am not aui thorized to do so , but the facts wilt+ probae bly come out in a few days . " They were members of a committee tot whom was intrusted a small sum of money which was given for a particular purpose . Instead of applying it as directed , they dee liberately voted to apply it for another pure pose and one to which some of the donors objected . Had it been known that the money was to be so spent , it would not have been contributed . " It is a church matter , and as yet nothing has been published about it , but there will be an inquiry as to the reason for the olergymen 's action , and the matter will then come to light . " Dr. Parkhurst declined to be more specific in his explanation Several Presbyterian clergymen were questioned about the matter . They all expressed surprise and said they were at a loss to understand the meaning of Dr. Park . hurst 's words . The Rev. Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it would be difficult to fix it upon any particular in. dividuals . " If what Dr. Parkhurst says is true , " he ! continued , " the clergymen involved in the matter are desegving of the gravest censure . Their conduct is very much worse than similar action on the part of business men , for they are ministers of the Gospel and are supposed to act from even higher motives of honor .
