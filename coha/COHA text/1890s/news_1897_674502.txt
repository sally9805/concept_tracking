txt The mere philologist insists that the word " caddie , " sometimes written " caddy " and " cady , " when applied to a boy , and not to a utensil to hold tea , is a corruption of the French word " cadet , " meaning , primarily , a younger son , and , speaking generally , a youth of no great importance ; and he argues , further , that the objectionable " cad " is another form of this word , that curt substantive meaning , originally , only an insignificant person , and not necessarily one who disagreed with your opinions , or who was inclined to wear a high-crowned hat with a sack coat , as it does nowadays . But a philologist is often a bore . Since golf became a really popular game in this neighborhood , we have come to know something about the caddie , and we know perfectly well that he is nothing like a cadet , and that , with all his faults , he is no cad . Yet the caddie is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak , exotic ; for that variant of the very old Scotch or Dutch game which we call golf is not yet acclimated here . It is popular and it is growing in vogue , and will grow and , we trust , flourish for many years . But the best players have done nothing wonderful with it , as yet . There have been no " plays " in golf , for instance , like some of LARNED 's in tennis . So there is hope that as golf grows the caddie will develop . In Scotland , they say , the caddie is alert arid useful , but in Scotland every unidentified youngster lie a caddie , by common consent , and when he is employed on a links he watches the ball and takes what he can get , thankfully , with the sagacity of his race . The novice at golf in this country is led to believe at first that every unidentified youngster is a caddie , but he soon learns his mistake . The American boys , of whatever descent , are bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now restlessness is the last quality the golf novice desires in his caddie . As for the good players , the fellows who can make a score of 100 or less with 18 holes , they , too , find their caddies troublesome . The native caddie appreciates good play and is a shrewd and harsh critic of poor strokes after a week 's experience on a links . But then the caddie does not play golf ; the game is so much more expensive than craps and quite beyond his means ; and the golf player 's harshest critics are always persons who do not play . Naturally the caddie prefers to attach himself to a good player , but when he does he soon loses interest in the game , the fine points of which are as Greek , or , to say better , as Gaelic , to him . He knows a long drive , but between the tee and the putting green he is apt to let his elemental mind wander . Wherefore the ball is lost . On the other hand , the caddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of the novice and follows that perspiring wretch in his preposterous efforts to cut sods with the cleek , with quivering attention , so closely that the ball , when it does move , frequently goes no one knows whither . As a. matter of fact , we have some fair golf , but we have as yet no caddies to speak of , none with the patience and the alertness of the real caddie . The occupation here is not a trade or a profession ; it is merely day 's labor . A new caddie will develop in time . Meanwhile let us all learn to play golf so well that when he comes his natural sense of humor will not compel him to neglect his duties . Crude as the caddies of this hour are , though , they are not without vanity and effrontery . Those fitfully employed on a links in New Jersey introduced a new kind of strike in the game recently  --  a labor strike . Their plea was that as they had to travel to and from Paterson on the trolley cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling rate of 15 cents for nine hales and have anything left over for craps . Hidden in this complaint there seems to be some sort of reflection on the kind of golf generally played on that links
