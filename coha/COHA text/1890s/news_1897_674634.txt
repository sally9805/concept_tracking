txt In response to an appeal from the colored citizens of this place , Gen. John M. Palmer has accepted a. call to assist the City Attorney in the fight with the local School Board for equal school privileges with white pupils . There has been trouble growing here for SOME time over an attempt to separate the school children , and to have a separate school and building for the colored pupils . To this the colored people objected . A school building has just been completed for the colored children , but suit has been brought to compel the board to allow colored children to attend school with white pupils . The Chief of kolice was instructed yesterday to take his entire night and day force and keep the colored children and their parents out of the white schools . The negroes congregated back of the Washington Schoolhouse and held a consultation . They decided to attempt to put the children into the school in spite of the officers , and marched over to the school yard . For a time it seemed that trouble could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the police held their ground and expelled all those children who managed to slip into the building unobserved . At two other schools the same scenes were repeated . A committee of three colored men , accompanied by their attorney , then called upon President Kink of the School Board and asked him if it was the intention of the board to persist in the policy of excluding the colored children from the schools attended by the whites . Mr. Fink assured them that such was the intention . The negroes insist that the law is on their side and flatly refuse to send their children to the schools built for them . The Supreme Court decisions in similar cases at Galesburg . Quincy. and Upper Alton encourage them in the belief that they will triumph in the courts .
