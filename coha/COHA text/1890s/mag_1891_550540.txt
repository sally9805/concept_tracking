ways understand correctly the significance and relative value of all the phenomena he perceives , but he brings , ordinarily , a mind so differently trained from that of the native inhabitants , white and black , that he can scarcely fail to see some things better than they can possibly see them . Communities , like individuals . often need to be interpreted to themselves and to the outside world . It is in this belief : , I venture to present this study , not claiming that it embodies the whole truth as to the subjects of which it treats . I do claim , however , that it is full of truth , and that it has been written according to the spirit in which Othello wished his story to be told , - with a purpose to extenuate nothing , " nor set down aught in malice . " To attain my object of simple faithfulness , I have thought it best to describe the conditions existing in a single district in the far South , and to accompany this description by references to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make clear the impressions made on my mind by the habits and institutions , and by the personal characteristics of the inhabitants . For obvious reasons I do not think it wise to name this district ; I shall endeavor to disguise its identity so far as is consistent with the essential accuracy of my report , since the sensitiveness of the southern people as to what northern people say about them is great , and contrasts strongly with the indifference of the northern public to the tone in which their actions and opinions are constantly commented upon by southern newspapers . The town of V is situated in a county where the pine woods which stretch around on every side , if not the " forest primeval , " are still sufficiently ancient and extended to impress the traveller 's imagination . They are traversed by roads , and their solitudes are broken by occasional farms . The agricultural habits are primitive . It is customary to leave roots in the stoneless ground and tall stumps and tree trunks standing in the cotton fields . There are more blacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No battles were fought there during the Civil War , and the United States troops were first seen when they came as victors . The slaves received their liberty after the event which they still call the " s'renduh , " in that memorable month of May , 1865 , when on various days the Union soldiers in the interior portions of the South proclaimed at once the tidings of victory and of freedom . The negroes date all things as having happened either before or after " s'renduh . " They are very ready to talk of that period . A vivid recollection remains with me of a sunny December afternoon in that pine-covered land . The sky was like the heaven of Italy , and I lingered in front of a little hut , to listen to the chatter of an old man and woman . He told about his young wife who had been sold away from him several years before the " s'renduh . " When he learned that he was free , he started at once and walked all night to the town where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We looked ' at each other , en looked , en looked , " he said , " en we didn ' know what tuh say , we was dat jahfk . " The negroes do not know much of other dates , and some of them seem too ignorant to compute the passage of time with any accuracy , even as it relates to the occurrences in their own lives . On this occasion the old negress had her tale also to tell , and her bleared eyes // grew misty as she tried to recall a time when she was a girl , and had heard that the slaves were to be freed . She could not remember particulars very distinctly , and the man suggested that it might have been in " Linkurn 's time . " No , she said it was before then , and there was something about it different from that epoch , for it was a " votin ' time , not a fightin ' time . " As I listened I began to realize the dumb way in which these ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint that reached them of a possible deliverance from their bondage . All the negroes whom I have questioned on the point say that they knew during the war that their freedom was an issue at stake . Those who could read got hold of the papers , and those who waited on their owners heard scraps of talk , and every bit of knowledge acquired in these ways was communicated to the others in the slave quarters . After the war closed , many of the colored people in this county , as in other parts of the South , tried to get land for themselves . Some failed , probably through incapacity . Some still maintain that in their ignorance they were cheated . The custom prevails to this day of making payments by instalments and in cotton . " Truck " wages are not wholly unknown , and wages when paid in money are low . An adult male farm hand gets not more than fifty or sixty cents a day , and some food , and the same sum represents the wages for work on the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , the country negroes seldom have ready money when they wish to purchase land . If they borrow , they are obliged to pay large rates of interest . If they undertake to pay for their farms out of their crops , years of effort await them , with failure frequently at the end . They knew in the beginning so little of legal forms and of the mysteries lurking in written documents , that they were necessarily easy victims to fraud . Hard as has been the lot of the Russian peasantry , it contrasts favorably in some respects with that of the negroes in the United States . The Russians when emancipated were secured certain rights and privileges in the soil , but these American peasants were set adrift among a population inimical to their advancement , and were not allowed one inch of ground on which to stand while they began to work . They have been accounted an inferior race , and yet , undowered by a single advantage , they have made such progress that in one single southern state they are said by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property valued at twehty million dollars . I remember being struck by a comparison made by a negro preacher . He insisted that it was as hard , to make certain of a place in the kingdom of heaven as to get a sure title to land on earth . He used this illustration as if he were quite confident that his hearers would fully appreciate its force . It seemed to me that in these words he hinted of a great deal of disappointment in humble hearts , and of the ruin of many humble hopes . The chain gang is a permanent institution in the town of Y . White culprits are legally liable to service on the gang , and report says that one was sentenced to it some years ago , but I have never seen a white face among these chained laborers . One or two white keepers always accompany the band , and one of these is armed with a gun . It seems impossible that such a sight , continually before the eyes of growing youth , should not be a lesson in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern people do not appear at present to need that sort of instruction . The outdoor work performed by the convicts must in some respects be better for them , physically and morally , than indoor imprisonment ; but this daily exhibition of them upon the streets in fetters is a degradation which can hardly fail to reduce them to the rank of permanent criminals . There are no reformatories for boys in the state , and I have seen little lads , twelve to sixteen years old , dragging their ankle chains along beside their adult comrades in public disgrace . On Saturdays , the black peasantry pour into the town . Some come from such a distance that they have to start on Friday // and camp by the roadsides all night to make sure of an early arrival next day at the end of their journey . The street life of Y becomes on these occasions nearly as unique as that of Naples . The whites abandon , by general consent , an entire sidewalk on the principal thoroughfare to the darker pedestrians , but the dusky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The negroes cluster in groups , and it is easy to catch fragments of their conversation . The talk of the men frequently turns on bargains and other business matters . The women greet each other with hearty cordiality . Queer sunbonnets and ragged hats abound , chickens and small game are offered for sale . A not unhealthy tendency to rude flirtation is often apparent , when some boy approaches a group of girls . At noon time , men and women lean freely against the walls of buildings and eat their luncheons with unabashed frankness and in a manner suggestive of primitive customs as to the use of fingers and teeth . Once I was walking behind a couple and saw that the woman was about to help herself to some bit of food , which I fancied belonged to the man , for he cried out earnestly , " Bre'k off a piece . " I heard no more , but was left a prey to the wonder whether he really had such fine fee&gt; ings as to object to her biting instead of breaking a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entreaty : The circus attracts crowds of the rustic negroes to the town . They come driving in . Sometimes , the children are asleep under quilts in the wagons , long after the ox or mule belonging to each has been unharnessed , and when each dusky little mortal awakes , he makes small volcano in the cart , as he upheaves his coverings , and thrusts forth his limbs and his round woolly head . Occasionally , chairs are placed in the wagon and the women sit there behind the driver as they enter the town . At other times they all squat comfortably on the boards or sticks which extend between the wheels , the legs of some dangling below , or otherwise disposed of at the best convenience of their owners . The chairs they bring frequently have the seats made of skins , tied to the frames with leather thongs . The harnesses for mules and oxen are mostly made of cords , and the oxen are driven by strings passed around their horns . Collars for both horses and mules are sometimes woven of braided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peasant negroes who flock into town on circus days are too poor to pay the entrance fee to the tents . Their joy is found in watching the procession of the sorry little shows through the streets , and in mingling with the crowd outside the canvas walls . By such association they share the general excitement , and doubtless feel that they are seeing life in* its larger aspects . The thrifty ones bring wood with them , hoping to sell it during the day , and either pay for their pleasures or return home richer than they came . One negro woman of the plantation type I once saw standing near the tent on circus day , accompanied by two very stupid-looking little girls . I asked if they were going in to the exhibition , but could get no response from the children , so at last the old negress answered , " No , they c'u'd n't . " They had come in from the country , she said , seven miles , walking beside their ox cart , which was loaded with wood . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in the empty wagon . She grinned cheerfully , and willingly accepted tickets of admission for the children , but declared she did not want one herself . Her scruple as to taking a ticket was so unexpected , and it masked itself so pclitely as indifference , that it deceived me , and not until it was too late did I realize that she had been more sensitive to the delicacy of the situation than I , for of course she had really wanted to see the wonderful sights behind those woven portals . As night draws on , after one of these holidays , the country folk turn their faces away from the town , and seek their little cabins in the solitary depths of the outlying pine forests . The city negroes still linger at the corners , while darkness settles on their narrow world , and if it is very cold they light a fire in the middle of the street and cluster around it . The // " fat wood " or " larder " burns brightly , and throws strange gleams upon their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this wood for a torch , and goes with it along the otherwise dark streets , himself the centre of a flaring , moving yellow glow . Many of the colored people are apathetic in their ways , but sometimes they have a striking manner . I have seen two negro men railing sarcastically at each other on the street with a mocking courtesy of bows and gestures that was inimitable , and occasionally I have observed attitudes and movements so free and dramatic that they would have been fit to represent heroic passions on the stage . The speech of the negroes in this part of the South , at its best , is an exaggeration of the peculiarities of accent and pronunciation observable among the whites . From this point it degenerates into a sort of dialect , in which the tendency to sound tA like d and z ' like b is confirmed ; ing is rendered simply as n after some vowels , and after consonants is occasionally turned into un or en , and a general habit prevails of reducing words to monosyllables . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sale in slavery , and their voluntary migrations since they were free , together with widely different experiences as to association with more or less educated white persons , have caused their speech to become so modified that its manner in any given case is largely a question of individual fortunes , and not merely one of local dialect . They speak by ear , and not by rule or according to confirmed customs . I have , for instance , heard " gwine " used in a neighborhood where " go'n ' " is the habitual contraction made of going by both whites and blacks . Negro voices are generally softer than those of the white people , and they have a persuasive tone . The white people have had a library in Y for several years , supported and patronized by a library association . No colored people are members , and the understanding is that they would not be allowed to become such , and to take out books , because , as the librarian said , when questioned on the subject , " the southern people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an opera house in the town , and at ordinary entertainments the negroes are permitted to sit in one portion of the gallery . When the foremost colored man in the country came to lecture in the place , there was much discussion how to arrange the audience , which it was expected would be a mixed one . I do not know whether the mind of the white manager was enlightened to perceive the incongruity there would be in permitting a colored man to stand on the platform while his hearers of kindred blood were confined to half the gallery , or whether motives solely of a business nature were operative , but it was finally decided that the floor of the house must be opened to the colored people . Society was guarded from the peril of such a step by excluding the whites from the floor and sending them up into the gallery to sit on narrow wooden benches . From this place of hardship they could overlook the lower room , . which was not filled , and behold the empty cushioned seats , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has power to affright the American imagination . My acquaintance with the negroes was not of a kind to lead them to unfold to me their superstitious ideas very freely , yet I easily discovered traces of a belief in ghosts and witchcraft . Servant girls will tell the Br er Rabbit stories , usually imparting less vigor to their narratives than is to be found in the selected versions which have been published , and sometimes the dusky story-tellers will add a tale about cats and pots of blood , quite suggestive of uncanny practices in magic . One girl once told me the story of Red Riding Hood , with some variations , being apparently entirely unconscious that this legend had a different genesis from the Br er Rabbit myth . A mulatto gave as a reason for believing in ghosts , the statement that he had seen them , and he shuddered perceptibly in my presence at a mysterious sound , with a muttered explanation of his terror , which did not refer the noise to any human agency . Negroes generally declare that the blue // jays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade one to tell me what became of the birds , but their reticence on the subject inclined me to think they believed , as writers say they do , that the birds visit hell on that day . One man said thoughtfully , that he had never taken particular notice on Friday , so he could not be sure blue jays were never visible then , but he did feel certain that these birds were seldom to be seen the latter part of the week . There were always more of them about , he said , on Monday and Tuesday than on other days . Finally , I interrogated a small black girl , who rejoiced in the name of Hosanna Sylvester Ella Baxter Bush . To my surprise , she looked up from the log where she sat busy with some crochet work , and calmly said , " Yes , I'se seen blue jays on Friday . " - " Why , how did it happen ? " I asked . - " I 've heard , " she replied , " folks say da ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked , an ' saw em . " Overcome with admiration for this young person 5 investigating spirit , I went on talking with her , and discovered that she thought heaven to be a place where people would do better things than they did on earth , where they would be " safe " and I also learned that if she could do what she most liked to do on earth , she would not go to dances , she would spend most of her time at church , fdr among all mundane pleasures that which she most loved was " Tuh yeah de word of Gawd . " The log cabin of a very primitive class is to be found in the country and in the suburbs of southern towns . In the regions with whIch the writer is most familiar , a dwelling containing one room , with an outside chimney at one gable end , is called a " single pen house . " If there are two rooms , and a chimney between them piercing the roof , the building is called a " double pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the log structures while in process of erection , to cattle pens . Many of the cabins have no glass in the windows , which are closed by rude shutters . In the country towns the frame houses occupied by the negroes usually contain two or more rooms , but each room fre quently constitutes a tenement , and shelters a family . Rents average about two dollars a month for each room . Sometimes the little huts have small verandas attached to them , and when they lack these porches , the doorsteps serve as a family sitting-room . Chimneys are built of a rough , light-colored brick , but are also frequently constructed of sticks and clay , and often are not tall enough to reach the roof . In these cases the gable usually extends over the top of the flue and the ridge is cut out to form a hole , through which the smoke is drawn upward . When one has learned to regard things from the purely aesthetic point of view and to be indifferent to sanitary or moral considerations , it becomes possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered over the southern states . It is interesting to fancy how the women and children huddle together in the darkness , with door and shutters closed , when the rain beats outside and the wind drives the water in through large chinks in the walls , which serve in brighter hours to let in the sunshine . The lightning 's flash may sometimes penetrate the same openings , *nd display the terror on dusky faces when the tempest grows ominous . One alleviation to the situation remains , - the housewives need not in the mildest weather fear a day of reckoning as to drenched carpets , and no shadow of a plumber 's possible bill ever deepens the gloom of a December storm . Notwithstanding all desire , however , to find it otherwise , the element of beauty is frequently small in the landscape , and its modifications by human endeavor . The country has its fascination , but it chiefly lies in the appeal which the scene makes to the historical imagination , when after following some road that seems to lead quite away from the haunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , one comes suddenly upon a cluster of negro huts , and a little , unpainted wooden church surrounded by tall - stemmed , green-tufted pine trees . If the time be early spring , violets very large and very dark blue , and small , bright yellow flowers strew the ground ; white lilies // grow among the pine needles , and the wild azalea flaunts its pink loveliness . The sky above is brilliant , and the air is soft . A negro girl comes in sight , carrying a black baby . Her hair may be twisted in exceedingly tight braids , bound throughout their whole length with dirty white twine , and fastened to her head , or it may stand out loose and woolly about her face . Her garments are scanty . Her countenance is that of an amiable savage , and suddenly the strange story of her people rushes across the beholder 's mind . The full significance is for an instant apprehended of her presence in this lari 'd chosen for the stage on which to try republican principles . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of a destiny which has laid upon the American people the weightiest task* and given it the noblest opportunity ever granted to a nation to incarnate a great ideal as to mercy , justice , and love into the solid substance of national existence . Gazing at this barbarian as she passes , the wonder comes whether she may not , through her frailty , be all unconsciously dowered by God with more power than Browning 's Pippa exercised as she passed on her innocent way to bring to the test the subtle qualities of good and evil in human nature , and thus to demonstrate the truth of the old assertion that harm done to the least of the little ones of earth , is harm done to the world 's best life . The infusion of white blood among the negroes is large , even in the Black Belt . There are many mulattoes and quadroons in the parts of country , whose conditions the writer has most studied . In a large proportion of cases , however , there is only white blood enough to lengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complexion . A person not very familiar with the characteristics of the mixed race would often be unable to tell which ones , in a given group of colored people , were partially of white origin . There is much difference in the color of negroes . Many in this particular vicinity are jet black ; others , who are apparently of unadulterated African blood , are dark brown in color . Most of them have the full lips and prominent jaws of the familiar negro type , and many of them are so ugly that the first impression made by the aspect of the people is somewhat unfavorable . A closer survey of them , however , greatly modifies the results on the mind of this first view . When one has become accustomed to the type and color , and has , therefore , ceased to estimate all features and tints by the rather pallid and attenuated ideals of beauty prevailing in northern lands , it becomes readily evident that an artist would love to mix the pigments that should represent on canvas the warm brown and rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people . He might even find delight in the attempt to reproduce the faint red flush which modifies the complexion , that to the careless eye seems merely jet black . Some of the outlines of chin , cheek , nostrils and lips have , moreover , a generous sweep of curve that is not without beauty . The eyes are nearly always fine , and the negro hand is apt to be well shaped . Among the children , the line from ear to chin is frequently very delicate and pretty . I was once very much struck by the appearance of a girl in one of the schools , whose woolly hair fitted low on her forehead like a cap , and whose head was shaped and poised like that of the Clytie . In a little country church deep in the woods , where I one day attended a temperance meeting arranged by some northern ladies , I saw a young woman , black as night , so lame that she could scarcely walk , and possessed of great gaunt hands , whose face was ideally beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unintellectual being , and she seemed to find only a sort of stupid amusement in the occurrences of the meeting , but I talked with her as long as it was possible to think of anything to say , merely to have the opportunity to gaze on her wonderful features . Her hair was covered by , her turban , but her brows was fine , and her perfect eyes were shaped like large almonds . The bridge of her nose was straight , but the nostrils were a trifle fuller and more curved than the Caucasian variety . They differed from // that type only to surpass it in beauty of form . This was true also of the mouth . The Cupid 's bow of the upper lip was faultless , and the lines of the lower one were encnanting . The ear was extremely small and round . The whole face had but one defect ; it was a little haggard , and the flesh sank in below the cheek bone so as to mar the outline when her countenance was slightly turned . Her beauty would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , the absence from her ebony skin of any rose tints , of flushing lights and warm shadows , imparted a severe and noble character to the features , that compelled me to pause when about to say that hers was the strangely appealing loveliness that some animals have . This pathetic animal beauty is , however , a quality often discernible in the comelier faces of the negroes . It is like that of a cow or a deer . A very great difference exists among the blacks as to the amount of intellect expressed in their faces , and this amount is not necessarily coincident with the greater or less conformity of their features to the Anglo-Saxon model , although the tendency of increased intelligence seems to be producing a modification of the savage African type . The boys of this generation look as if they would develop in manhood more mobile and brighter faces than those which distinguish most of the older men whose youth was passed in slavery . Few human creatures can bestow a more sadly , unintelligent stare than that which an old " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person met on a road that leads from outer districts in the forest and agricultural region of the southern " black belt . " Its contrast with the pleasant and thoughtful look of boys and girls of the same race in town schools intimates the different effect upon the growth of the mind of life in slavery and in freedom . In this part of the country all the negroes , old and young , stupid and bright , slave and free born , have generally a docile and amiable appearance . The lads and girls are , however , acquiring the free and easy manners which invariably mark the passage froni subjection.to re sponsible independence . Self-assertion is always the first step in the evolution of self-respect in a rising people . It should not be too much detested because it is not very agreeable to outsiders . Its most objectionable manifestations often constitute a tonic exercise which conduces to the growth of a worthy independence in those who exhibit it , and to the development of wisdom , toleration , and spiritual faith in those who first suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessary stage in social and individual progress . Old negro men and women duck their heads the moment they become conscious that a white person 's glance is turned upon them . The movement is too suggestive of ancient terrors to be wholly pleasant to behold . These terrors can easily be imagined , if even a cursory study is made of the laws relating to slaves and free people of color which prevailed in several of the southern states for many years , and during the lives of several generations of whites and blacks . However ungracious any reference may seem to these past laws , and to the customs they upheld , it is necessary to make such reference in any sincere investigation of the present characteristics of the two races , and of the mixed race in the South . The institution of slavery was too drastic in its nature not to affect thoroughly the mental habits of all persons concerned , and that effect continues in greater or less operation to-day . If the stories told by the colored people of the treatment they have received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they indicate an intellectual ability so great that it is certain to be a dominant factor in determining the future of that part of the country . Hence it is important to inquire whit is the character of these stories , and to see what light they throw upon the relations of the races . I can simply say , for myself , that no incident in " Uncle Tom 's Cabin , " or in The Autobiography of a Female Slave , " which was written by a Kentucky woman , but finds its parallel in horror , in tragedy and wretchedness in the narratives in which numbers of freedmen and women have , to my knowledge , claimed // to relate their own experiences in slavery and those of their friends and kinsfolk . In town and country , in the city streets , and in the recesses of the forest , the same tales are told ; no , not the same , that is the horror of it , for the persons differ in each story , - it is only the cruelty and the misery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of duplicated and reduplicated suffering and moral insensibility and degradation . It has not happened to me to hear quite so much in this way of the unwritten history of the days when the Ku-Klux flourished , but still I have been told of occurrences in that period which would have served very well to add flavor to Tourgee 's story of " A Fool 's Errand . " In telling these things , the colored people do not manifest as deep a sense of injury as it seems probable most races would show in similar circumstances . This softness of mood may be due to some temperamental peculiarity , or it may be that the poignancy of their resentment is reduced by the action of their great joy in bare freedom . Still , they do think of these things . The memory of their past wrongs is in their minds . It is idle to suppose that this memory does . not to-day influence their characters , their purposes , their hopes and fears . It is worse than idle to imagine that any right solution to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take into account the fact that , stimulated by such memories , some of the most thoughtful of the freedmen now believe that the white people of the South do not desire to arrange such customs and institutions as affect both races according to the principles of impartial justice . The race problem does not involve merely the question how far the white man will admit the negro into the body politic , civil , and social ; it has begun to involve a serious question as to the negro 's patience , forbearance , and fortitude , and also the old historic question which no earthly forces of government have yet been able to set aside , as to the relative merits of submission and resistance . The negro appeared to me ready to take alarm , and various events that occurred in the South in the winter of 89 - 90 were of a nature to justify him in this uneasy attitude of mind . Passing along the street one day in the town I have described , which is situated many miles from the locality which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theatre for race oppression , I saw two colored men standing in a doorway . One of them was a tall , portly negro , very well dressed and very black . He was evidently a stranger visiting the place , and probably he was a travelling elder of the church . As I passed , I heard him say , " I am always afraid when I am in Jessop . " The remark did not seem to me the sort of one that it ought to be natural to make in the Republic of the United States . I came across various indications that the negroes are sometimes so far under the influence of fear , that they dare not even now relate their experience when slaves . The most marked instance was when an ignorant old woman gave to a friend of hers the explanation that she hesitated to tell me , whom she did not know well , her story , lest " they " - the mysterious indefinite " they " which represented to her the human authority that had controlled her life - " lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The most serious difficulty in modern times is the difficulty of determining how those people who are in a superior position shall deal with free people who are on a less fortunate footing , because of either mental , moral , or pecuniary inferiority . The world at large has had a training in this exercise which the southern people have not had , and the experience they have had renders most of them especially unfitted to model a large portion of a great republic where the social conditions are such as to necessitate the careful consideration of the principles which should govern the relations of free but alien classes and individuals . The institution of slavery kept the South for many years out of the line of the world 's pr6gress , and made unfamiliar to its inhabitants the thoughts that were moulding character and shaping institutions in the north and in // western Europe . Events and ideas lost their significance when contemplated from within the shadow of this anomalous system . Interpretations of social life failed to be understood . Hence it happens that the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social methods . He does not realize the danger that lies in keeping masses of free people in a situation that must sooner or later waken sentiments of animosity . This mental attitude towards certain problems of society is almost that which a western European might have still maintained had the French Revolution never occurred . The morals of the negroes in the extreme South are not very good . The marriage tie , which had practically no force thirty years ago , is still very lightly esteemed among the lower blacks . Men desert both wives and children , and women often prove false to their conjugal obligations , even if according to their abilities they observe their maternal duties . The huddling together of all ages and both sexes in cabins containing only one or two rooms can not fail to have a deleterious effect . The tenement house question , in spite of all the ameliorations of the soft climate , demands in the South much the same consideration as in the north , from all persons who would promote the well-being of society . It would indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the moral condition of the colored people is intimately connected with the morality of the whites . It seems to be a historic fact that a separation of two classes , either because of race or of other aristocratic prejudice so absolute as to render marriage a social or legal impossibility , never leads the men of the upper class to respect the virtue of the women of the lower , and does not tend to create such a sentiment among these women as would cause them to consider irregular unions as disgraceful as they might hold them to be were regular ones practicable . Those persons who speculate upon the undesirability of having this country occupied by a mixed race overlook the fact that a mixed race already occupies a large portion of it . The alleged tendency to sterility in such a people does not afford reasonable ground for the expectation that the mixed race will pass out of existence . 1f indeed , there be such a tendency , it must operate most strongly among mulattoes , and would prove fatal finally only if mulattoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they constantly marry persons in whom the white or black blood predominates , and who therefore by their nearer approach to either pure stock may naturally be supposed to be in a measure relieved from any inheritance of weakness which depends on the amalgamation . Mixed unions abound in the United States . Those of one class are considered disgraceful , and are seldom openly maintained or legally consecrated . The propriety of the other class is never questioned , and they are always held to be honorable when , as is generally the case , they are lawfully consummated . Indeed , society does not appear to think of them as mixed in character ; yet it is impossible to deny that there is as much amalgamation of race when a mulatto , that is a person who belongs half to one and half to the other race , marries a pureblooded negro , as when a mulatto marries a full-blooded white . A greater diversity of blood exists in the marriage of a quadroon or an octoroon with a negro , than in the marriage of such a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is approved on social grounds , while the latter is held to be objectionable . Young colored girls in the South are exposed to great dangers , owing to various features in their ordinary home and industrial life . Their parents , having been generally bi*ed in slavery and ignorance , are often unfit to guide the daughters through the perils which beset them , and if evil befall them no remedy is possible , unless the wrong has been suffered within the lines of their own race . In spite , however , of drawbacks , the better class of the colored people in different regions are trying to elevate themselves morally , and to establish a higher standard in ethics . In V there is a club of young women who meet under // the direction of an educated married colored woman , to consider the customs which best promote personal virtue and the principles upon which family and social life should be established . These girls seem to be as pure and earnest in their desires and purposes as any maidens in the land . The Knights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large society of men was formed some time since , but it did not prove to be a very efficient organization . The negro women united in a similar association , which was more prosperous than the male branch , because the women administered their affairs more wisely than the men had managed theirs . In this same town a society of another sort was inaugurated within a few years , at the suggestion and with the help of a northern lady . The membership was large , but the management was unsuccessful , and after a career of several months the association collapsed . It aimed to develop its members intellectually , and also to provide , care in cases of illness or distress resulting from death . I attended one meeting of this society . It was held in a church , and was very interesting to any student of human , not to say African , nature . The proceedings were marked by that indifference to punctuality and order which characterizes most attempts made by the southern negro to conduct evening entertainments . After the church was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but move around or speak a few inconsequentive words . Finally , in came one of the leaders , a " bell boy , " from a hotel . He was gorgeously attired in a long , light overcoat , and from the moment of his entrance he snapped his intellectual whip over the audience in a manner diverting and admirable . He walked up and down before the crowd , told people what to do , and saw that they did it . He used very big words , but he tumbled them off easily from his tongue , and though our northern wits were sometimes unable to follow his ideas when they became very much tangled up in his sentences , it was quite evident that his own brain drove a steady team of intention right through every thicket in his language . His manner was always perfectly comprehensible . It expressed conscious rectitude and righteous authority . He ordered the people to keep still before he would call on " the ladies " who were to read papers ; and after he had effectually hushed the house into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk and began to attend to some other business , leaving the crowd agape for the promised entertainment . A little restless movement at last aroused his attention , and wheeling about he reiterated his orders for absolute silence . " The great part of the moriel , " he said , " is obed'ence . Whut yuh all want is to be moriel . Yuh ca n't be moriel widout bein ' obed'ent . So mind me en be still . " As a reward for the obedience which the awed audience finally manifested , three colored girls were called upon to read original compositions . The first was entitled " People will Talk . " Its sentences would not have parsed and analyzed to advantage . Their construction showed the unconsciousness of the untrained mind whether a thing has really been stated or only referred to in ambiguous phrases which have not been supplied with subjects and predicates in due proportion . Notwithstanding these drawbacks , there was noticeable in this paper an independent tone of mind which gave it almost the effect of original thinking . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer had known it among her compeers , and it was impossible to one in whose veins ran the blood of another race and whose experience of life had been wholly unlike hers , not to wonder just what phases of human weakness had come under her untutored observation , and had inspired the defiant words which fell so aptly from her lips . She spoke boldly in behalf of girls whose reputation had been carelessly gossiped away . Another paper was an earnest though not very well-expressed plea to the colored people to educate themselves , and the writer urged the grown men and women who were ignorant not to be ashamed to go to school like ' children , She availed herself- poor girl - of the immemorial privilege of the American citi // zen as to titles , and when she urged her hearers to study , she said , " People are growing more and more particular about education , and the time is coming when a young gentleman that can read wo n't marry a young lady who ca n't . And , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you all want to do , to get married . " It would have been easy to laugh as she went on with her rambling plea for education , if it had not been almost as easy to cry , for there was something exceedingly melancholy in her gentle acceptance of the fact that her people stood at a disadvantage in this country , and that they could only hope to escape contempt by great and persistent effort . The same pathetic feeling pervaded an address made by a young minister , a quadroon from Louisiana . My companion and I were the only whites present , and it seemed probable that we had surprised the tone these people took among themselves when they seriously regarded their situation . The third paper treated of the theme beloved by young essayists , the question which is greater , man 's influence or woman 's . It gave the preference to woman 's power to affect the destiny of the race . The girl . read this composition in a quiet , low voice . Her sentences generally began , proceeded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phraseology* The audience greeted her sallies with much appreciative laughter . She closed by declaring that if women could vote , they would not sell their votes " for a drink of whiskey or a loaf of white bread . " This remark was received with loud applause , as it is a common saying in this part of the South , that for the things she had mentioned a colored man will sell his vote . On the way home , two colored girls went by us , and I caught snatches of their talk . One of them repeated the assertion made at the meeting , that women would not sell their ballots if they had any at their disposal , and the other responded heartily , " That 's so . " As they spoke , they passed on into the shadowy night , but they left behind them in the mind of one listener the conviction that unknown possibilities lurked in the future , if negro girls had already begun to discuss political purity and woman suffrage on the streets of a southern town , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strolled from their huts without danger of arrest and flogging by the patrol .
