EDITORIAL PREFACE . WTITH the exception of Abraham Lin*Vcol n , no leader in the Civil War has been so much written about as the man who emerged from the struggle wearing tbe laurels of chief hero . Prom his first engagement at Belmont to the dawn of peace at Appomattox , no officer on the Union side was more completely in the public view than General Grant . Ris simple , direct personality was in no way concealed by the vapors of notoriety ; his momentous official duties were pursued without ostentation ; his acts were always so important that they overshadowed curiosity as to what he was ; he had a way of doing his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as a personage . For these reasons , creditable to him , the ratio of personal flavor to important statement in the literature relating to his deeds was small until , at the last , he wrote his immortal ( ( Memoirs , ) ) which nevertheless are perhaps more modest as cast in the mold of the personal pronoun than C*esar 's ( ( Commentaries ) ) veiled in the third person . So it has come to pass that , while little or nothing remains to be said of the acts of Grant the general , only broad outlines have been given to the public of the man within the armor . As a civilian , Grant the President and first citizen became better known ; but what manner of man was he while shouldering the responsibility of carnage , and standing in the deadly breach ? In this respect he is fully revealed in the papers begun with this number of THE CENTURY , and there is reason to doubt that any very substantial addition will be Inade to the world 's knowledge of Grant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Records ) ) have little more to say , and it is not known that any other member of his military family kept notes of incidents and conversations relating to the daily activity of the commanding general during the crucial last year and a half of the war . General Porter 's talents and training , no less than his opportunities , fitted him for the added service of personal historian to his chief . As the son of a governor of Pennsylvania , he inclined in youth to a public career , and , securing an appointment to West Point , was graduated number three in the class of 1860 . With a special taste for mechanics , shown by several useful inventions while still a boy , he chose the ordnance branch of the miii- // tary service , and won his first brevet for " gallant and meritorious SCtVice* * in the field as chief of ordnance and artillery in the reduction of Fort Pulaski ; he served as chief of ordnance in the transfer of the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to the West , and served in that important capacity with Rosecrans at Chickamauga and Chattanooga . It was during the investment of Chattanooga by Bragg that Captain Porter was brought into close relations with General Grant , who , on the transfer of the Captain to special duty in the Ordnance Bureau at Washington , sought in the following letter to have him attached permanently to his own staff : CHATTANOOGA , TENN. , Nov. 5 , 1863 . MAJ. - GEN . H. W. HALLECK , General-in-Chief of the Army . Capt . Horace Porter , who is now being relieved as chief ordnance officer in the Department of the Cumberland , is represented by all officers who know him as one of the most meritorious and valuable young officers in the service . So far as I have heard from general officers there is a universal desire to see him promoted to the rank of brigadier-general and retained here . I feel no hesitation in joining in the recommendation , and ask that he may be assigned for duty with me . I feel the necessity for just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at headquarters , and , if permitted , will retain him with me if assigned here for duty . I am , &amp;c. , U. S. GRANT , Major-general . Six months later , when Grant went to Washington as general-in-chief , Colonel Porter was transferred to his personal staff as aide-de-camp . From that day until the end of Grant 's first term as President , he was the companion as well as the faithful aide of his chief , and was charged with more than one important special mission , like the visit to Sherman preparatory to the march to the sea . A literary taste , which was developed chiefly on the side of public speaking , enabled the staff-officer , when public ovations succeeded the toil of the camp , to respond on behalf of the victorious general , who had not yet accustomed himself to the brief and pithy speeches for which he afterward became celebrated . While a cadet in the National Military Academy , General Porter wrote a humorous book in verse descriptive of ( ( West Point Life . ) ) His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began with the inauguration of President Grant in the spring of 1869 . From that time to the present General Porter has been in great demand at army reunions and festivals for after-dinner speeches and serious addresses , and has gained increasing fame by his eloquence and ready wit . After General Grant 's death , General Porter delivered a notable memorial address before the Union League Club , of which he is now president ; he is also Commander of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion , and of the George Washington Post of the.Grand Army of the Republic , Past Commander of the Society of the Army of the Potomac , President-general of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution , President of the Grant monument association , and a member of several historical and other societies . It was at a sluggish period in the progress of the movement to erect the Grant monument and tomb in Riverside Park that General Porter was placed at the head of the association , and largely through his effective appeals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars was made up , and the work energetically carried on , so that the inauguration will take place next spring on General Grant 's birthday . In recognition of his contributions to literature Union College conferred upon him the degree of LL.D . During the progress of THE CENTURY war series , General Porter contributed to this magazine two articles which evinced the historical value and anecdotal quality of the notes industriously jotted down by him during the whole time of his association with General Grant . The first article dealt with the relations of " Lincoln and Grant , ) ) and the second was the remarkable paper on the battle of Five Forks and the surrender at Appomattox . Since then , in moments of leisure , General Porter has arranged his unique stores of anecdotes and memoranda ; and THE CENTURY , which was the means of inciting General Grant to the writing of the four articles which became the structural part of his ( ( Memoirs , ) ) takes pleasure in offering to its readers the accurate personal portrait of the great commander that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the series of papers begun in the following pages . EDITOR OF THE CENTURY . VOL . LIIJ. - 3. // 2 0 w 0 z 0 r*4 C Co H H H z 0 z 0 // MY FIRST MEETING WITH GRANT . A ATHILE sitting *in my quarters in the little town of Chattanooga , Tennessee , about an hour after nightfall on the evening of Friday , October 23 , 1863 , an orderly brought meamessage from General Georgell.Thomas , Commander of the Army of the Cumberland , on whose staff I was serving , summoning me to headquarters . A storm had been raging for two days , and a chilling rain was still falling . A few minutes ' walk brought me to the plain wooden , one-story dwelling occupied by the commander , which was situated on Walnut street , near Fourth , and upon my arrival I found him in the front room on the left side of the hall , with three members of his staff and several strange officers . In an ann-chair facing the fireplace was seated a general officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hore an expression of weariness . He was carelessly dressed , and his uniform coat was unbuttoned and thrown back from his chest . He held a lighted cigar in his mouth , and sat in a stooping posture , with his head bent slightly forward . His clothes were wet , and his trousers and top-boots were spattered with mud . General Thomas approached this officer , and , turning to me and mentioning me by name , said , *I want to present you to General Grant . ) ) Thereupon the officer seated in the chair , without changing his position , glanced up , extended his arm to its full length , shook hands , and said in a low voice , and speaking slowly , " How do you do ? ) ) This was my first meeting with the man with whom I was destined afterward to spend so many of the most interesting years of my life . The strange officers present were members of General Grant 's staff . Charles A. Dana , Assistant Secretary of War , who had been for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the room . The next morning he sent a despatch to the War Department , beginning with the words , ( ( Grant arrived last night , wet , dirty , and well. * On the 19th of October General Grant 's command had been enlarged so as to cover the newly created military ( livision of the Mississippi , embracing nearly the entire field of operations between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi River , and the Army of the Cumberland had thus been placed under his control . About a month before , that army , after having fought at Chickamauga one of the m&amp;st gallantly contested and sanguinary battles in the annals of warfare , had fallen back and taken up a defensive position on the south side of the Tennessee River , inclosing within its lines the village of Chattanooga . The opposing forces , under General Bragg , had invested this position , and established such a close siege that the lines of supply had been virtually cut off , rations and forage were about exhausted , and almost the last tree-stump had been used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some without shoes ; ten thousand animals had died of starvation , and the gloom and despondency had been increased by the approach of cold weather and the appearance of the autumn storms . General Grant , upon assuming the responsibilities of his new command , had fully realized the critical condition of the Army of the Cumberland , and had set out at once for its headquarters to take charge in person of its future operations . On his way to the front he had telegraphed General Thomas , from Louisville , to hold Chattanooga at all hazards , to which that intrepid soldier made the famous reply , " I will hold the town till we starve . ) ) General Grant had started , the day before the incident I have described , from Bridgeport , a place thirty miles below Chattanooga , where the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad crosses the Tennessee River , and had ridden by way of Walden 's Ridge , the only route left open by which communication could be had with the beleaguered town . We had been advised that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach Chattanooga that night , considering the state of the weather , the wretched condition of the roads , or rather bridle-paths , over the mountain , and the severe injury to his leg which had been caused by a fall of his horse several weeks before , and from which he was still suffering . When he arrived he had to be lifted from his saddle , and was evidently experiencing much pain , as his horse had slipped in coming down the mountain , and had further injured the lame leg ; but the general showed less signs of fatigue than might have been supposed after his hard ride of two days under such trying circumstances . // CONFERENCE AT THOMAS 'S HEADQUARTERS . As soon as General Grant had partaken of a light supper immediately after his arrival , General Thomas had sent for several general officers and most of the members of his staff to come to headquarters , and the room soon contained an exceedingly interesting group . A member of General Thomas 's staff quietly called that officer 's attention to the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thoroughly soaked with rain after his long ride through the storm , and intimated that colds were usually no respecters of persons . General Thomas 's mind had been so intent upon receiving the commander , and arranging for a conference of officers , that he had entirely overlooked his guest 's travelstained condition ; but as soon as his attention was called to it , all of his old-time Virginia hospitality was aroused , and he at once begged his newly arrived chief to step into a bedroom and change his clothes . His urgings , however , were in vain . The general thanked him politely , but positively declined to make any additions to his personal comfort , except to light a fresh cigar . Afterward , however , he consented to draw his chair nearer to the wood fire which was burning in the chimney place , and to thrust his feet forward to give his top-hoots a chance to dry . The extent of his indulgence in personal comfort in the field did not seem to be much greater than that of bluff old Marshal Suvaroff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an excess of luxury , used to go so far as to take off one spur before going to bed . At General Grant 's request , General Thomas , General William F. Smith , his chief engineer , commonly known in the army as ( ( Baldy ) ) Smith , and others , pointed out on a large map the various positions of the troops , and described the general situation . General Grant sat for some time as immovable as a rock and as silent as the sphinx , but listened attentively to all that was said . After a while he straightened himself up in his chair , his features assumed an air of animation , and in a tone of voice which manifested a deep interest in the discussion , he hegan to fire whole volleys of questions at the officers present . So intelligent were his inquiries , and so pertinent his suggestions , that he made a profound impression upon every one by the quickness of his perception and the knowledge which lie had already acquired regarding important details of the army 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was dwelling not only UI ) Ofl the prompt opening of a line of supplies , but upon taking the offensive against the enemy . In this lie was only manifesting one of his chief military characteristics-an inborn dislike to be thrown upon the defensive . Even when he had to defend a position , his method of warfare was always that of the ( ( offensive-defensive . ) ) After talking over a plan for communicating with our base of supplies , or , as he called it in his conversation , * opening up the cracker line , ) ) an operation which already had been projected and for which preliminarysteps had been taken , he turned to me as chief of ordnance of the Army of the Cumberland , and asked , ( ( How much ammunition is there on hand ? ) ) I replied , ( ( There is barely enough here to fight one day 's battle , but an ample supply has been accumulated at Bridgeport to await the opening of communications . ) ) At about half-past nine o'clock he appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turning to a table , began to write telegrams . Communication by wire had been kept open during all the siege . His first despatch was to General Halleck , the general-in-chief at Washington , and read : ( ( Have just arrived ; I will write to-morrow . Please approve order placingSherman in command of Department of the Tennessee , with headquarters in the field . ) ) He had scarcely begun to exercise the authority conferred upon him by his new promotion when his mind turned to securing advancement for Sherman , who had been his second in command in the Army of the Tennessee . It was more than an hour later when lie retired to bed in an adjoining room to get a much-needed rest . As he arose and walked across the floor his lameness was very perceptible . Before the company departed he had made an appointment with Generals Thomas and Smith and several staff officers to acconipany him the next day to make a personal inspection of the lines . Early on the morning of the 24th the party set out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining our lines and obtaining a view of the enemy 's position . At Brown 's Ferry General Grant dismounted and went to the river 's edge on foot , and made his reconnaissance of that important part of the line in full view of the enemy 's pickets on the opposite bank , but , singularly enough , he was not fired upon . GRANT 'S MANNER OF WRITING DESPATCHES . BEING informed that the general wished to see me that evening , I went into the room he // PHOtOGRAPH OAKEN IN THE FIELD AT CITY PRINT , CA. , HO 10 . F.

THE ORIGINAL PRRTRG PH IS IN CRC PRSHLGNIRN RF TRC 8RSTRNIAN GOCICYT , AN H HANGS IN THE MEMRRIAL HALL , CLA STATE HOOSE , 8RSTON , H. // was occupying at headquarters , and found two of his staff-officers seated near him . As I entered he gave a slight nod of the head by way of recognition , and pointing to a chair , said rather bluntly , but politely , ( ( Sit down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave him some information he desired in regard to the character and location of certain heavy guns which I had recently assisted in putting in position on the advanced portion of our lines , and the kind and amount of artillery ammunition . He soon after began to write despatches , and I arose to go , but resumed my seat as he said , ( ( Sit still . ) ) My attention was soon attracted to the manner in which he went to work at his correspondence . At this time , as throughout his later career , he wrote nearly all his documents with his own hand , and seldom dictated to any one even the most unimportant despatch . His work was performed swiftly and uninterruptedly , but without any marked display of nervous energy . His thoughts flowed as freely from his mind as the ink from his pen ; he was never at a loss for an expression , and seldom interlined a word or made a material correction . He sat with his head bent low over the table , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a paper he wanted , he would glide rapidly across the room without straightening himself , and return to his seat with his body still bent over at about the same angle at which he had been sitting when he left his chair . Upon this occasion he tossed the sheets of paper across the table as he finished them , leaving them in the wildest disorder . When he had completed the despatch , he gathered up the scattered sheets , read them over rapidly , and arranged them in their proper order . Turning to me after a time , he said , ( ( Perhaps you might like to read whab I am sending . I thanked him , and in looking over the despatches I found that he was ordering up Sherman 's entire force from Corinth to within supporting distance , and was informing Halleck of the dispositions decided upon for the opening of a line of supplies , and assuring him that everything possible would be done for the relief of Burnside in east Tennessee . Directions were also given for the taking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extensive command . At a late hour , after having given further directions in regard to the contemplated movement for the opening of the route from Bridgeport to Chattanooga , and in the mean time sending back to be foraged all the animals that could be spared , he bid those present a pleasant goo ( l night , and limped off to his bedroom . I can not dwell too forcibly on the deep impression made upon those who had come in contact for the first time with the new commander , by the exhibition they witnessed of his singular mental powers and his rare military qualities . Coming to us crowned with the laurels he had gained in the brilliant campaign of Vicksburg , we naturally expected to meet a *vell-equipped soldier , but hardly anybody was prepared to find one who bad the grasp , the promptness of decision , and the general administrative capacity which he displayed at the very start as commander of an extensive military division , in w'hich many complicated problems were presented for immediate solution . I had fallen into the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my own observation , and these reminiscences are simply a transcript of memoranda of events jotted down at the time they occurred . OPENING ( ( THE CRACKER LINE . ) ) AFTER remaining three days as General Thomas 's guest , General Grant established his headquarters in a modest-looking twostory frame-house on the bluff near the river , situated on what is now known as First street . In the evening of the 26th I spent some time in the front room on the left side of the hall , which he used as his office , and in which several members of his staff were seated with him . It was a memorable night in the history of the siege , for the troops were being put in motion for the hazardous attempt to open the river route to our base of supplies at Bridgeport . The general sat at a table , smoking , and writing despatches . After finishing several telegrams and giving some directions to his staff , he began to describe the probabilities of the chances of the expedition down the river , expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , who had been so closely identified with the project , was oiven command of the movement . At b midnight he began his march down the north l ) ank of the river with 2800 men . At three o'clock on the morning of the 27th , Hazen started silently down the stream , with his pontoons carrying 1800 men ; at five he made a landing at Brown 's Ferry , completely surprising the guard at that point , and taking most of them prisoners ; at seven o'clock Smith 's force had been ferried across , and began to fortify a strong position ; and at ten a bridge // had been completed . Hooker 's advance , coming up from Bridgeport , arrived the next afternoon , the 28th , at Brown 's Ferry . The river was now open from Bridgeportto Kelley 's Ferry , and the wagon road from that point to Chattanooga by way of Brown 's Ferry , about eigbt miles in length , was in our possession . The success of the movement had been prompt and complete , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . This changed condition of affairs had been accomplished within five days after General Grant 's arrival at the front . As soon as the enemy recovered from his surprise , he woke up to the importance of the achievement ; Longstreet was despatched to retrieve , if possible , the lost ground . His troops reached Wauhatchie in the night of the 28th , and made an attack upon Geary 's division of Hooker 's forces . The fight raged for about three hours , but Geary succeeded in holding his ground against greatly superior numbers . During the fight Geary 's teamsters had become scared , and had deserted their teams , and the mules , stampeded by the sound of battle raging about them , had broken loose from theirwagonsand runaway . Fortunately for their reputation and the safety of the command , they started toward the enemy , and with heads down and tails up , with trace-chains rattling and whiffietrees snapping over the stumpsoftreestheyrushed pell-mell upon Longstreet 's bewildered men . Believing it to be an impetuous charge of cavalry , his line broke and fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to see such distinguished services go unrewarded , sent in the following communication : " I respectfully request that the mules , for their gallantry in this action , may have conferred upon them the brevet rank of horses . ) ) Brevets in the army were being bestowed pretty freely at the time , and when this recommendation was reported to General Grant he laughed heartily at the humor of the suggestion . Our loss in the battle , including killed , wounded , and missing , was only 422 men . The enemy never made a further attempt to interrupt our communications . The much-needed supplies , which had been hurried forward to Bridgeport in anticipation of this movement , soon reached the army , and the rejoicing among the troops manifested itself in lively demonstrations of delight . Every man now felt that he was no 1 HEADQUARTERS , DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND , CHATTANOOGA , TENN. , November 5 , 1863 . General Orders , No. 261. 1 . Capt*fin Thomas G.

GRANT SALUTED BY THE ENEMY . As soon as communication had been opened with our base of supplies , General Grant manifested an eagerness to acquaint himself minutely with the position of the enemy , with a view to taking the offensive . One morning he started toward our right , with several staff-officers , to make a personal examination of that portion of the line . When he came in sight of Chattanooga Creek , which separated our pickets from those of the enemy , he directed those who had accompanied him to halt and remain out of sight while he advanced alone , which he supposed he could do without attracting much attention . The pickets were within hailing distance of one another on opposite banks of the creek . They had established a temporary truce on their own responsibility , and the men of each army were allowed to get water from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . A sentinel of our picket-guard recognized General Grant as he approached , and gave the customary cry , ( ( Turn out the guard-commanding general ! ) ) The enemy on the opposite side of the creek evidently heard the words , and one of his sentinels cried out , eTurn out the guard-General Grant ! ) ) The confederate guard took up the joke , and promptly formed , facing our line , and presented arms . The general returned the salute by lifting his hat , the guard was then dismissed , and he continued his ride toward our left . We knew that we were engaged in a civil war , but such civility largely exceeded our expectations . In company with General Thomas and other members of his staff , I was brought into almost daily contact with General Grant , and became intensely interested in the progress of the plans he was maturing for dealing with the enemy at all points of the theater of war lying within his command . Early in November instructions came from the Secretary of War calling me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order relieving me from duty with his army .

His thorough knowledge of the duties of his position , his good judgment and untiring industry , have increased the efficiency of the army , and entitle him to the thanks headquarters . On my arrival , he requested me to be seated at the opposite side of the table at which he sat smoking , offered me a cigar , and said : " I was sorry to see the order of the Secretary of War calling you to Washington .

GRANT 'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE . A DESCRIPTION of General Grant 's personal appearance at this important period of his career may not be out of place here , particularly as up to that time the public had received such erroneous impressions of him . There were then few correct portraits of him in circulation . Some of the earliest pictures purporting to be photographs of him had been manufactured when he was at the distant front , never stopping in one place long enough to be ( ( focused . ) ) Nothing daunted , the practisers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had photographed a burly beefcontractor , and spread the pictures broadcast as representing the determined , but rather robust , features . of the coming hero , and it was some time before the real photographs which followed were believed to be genuine . False impressions of him were derived , too , from the fact that he had come forth from a country leather store , and was famous chiefly for striking sledge-hammer blows in the field , and conducting relentless pursuits of his foes through the swamps of the Southwest . He was pictured in the popular mind as striding about in the most approved swashbuckler style of melodrama . Many of us were not a little surprised to find 1 For the letter , see page 17. - EurroR . VOL . LIII. - 4. in him a man of slim figure , slightly stooped , five feet eight inches in height , weighing only a hundred and thirty-five pounds , and of a modesty of mien and gentleness of manner which seemed to fit him more for the court than for the camp . His eyes were dark-gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all men who speak little , he was a good listener ; but his face gave little indication of his thoughts , and it was the expression of his eyes which furnished about the only response to the speaker who conversed with him . When he was about to say anything amusing , there was always a perceptible twinkle in his eyes before he began to speak , and he often laughed heartily at a witty remark or a humorous incident . His mouth , like Washington 's , was of the letterbox shape , the contact of the lips forming a nearly horizontal line . This feature was of a pattern in striking contrast with that of Napoleon , who hada bow mouth , which looked as if it had been modeled after a front view of his cocked hat . The firmness with which the general 's square-shaped jaws were set when his features were in repose was highly expressive of his force of character and the strength of his will-power . His hairand beard were of a chestnut-brown color . The beard was worn full , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair , was always kept closely and neatly trimmed . Like Cromwell , Lincoln , and several other great men in history , he had a wart on his cheek . In his case it was small , and located on the right side just above the line of the beard . His face was not perfectly symmetrical , the left eye being a very little lower than the fight . His brow was high , broad , and rather square , and was creased with several horizontal wrinkles , which helped to emphasize the serious and somewhat careworn look which was never absent from his countenance . This . expression , however , was in no wise an indication of his nature , which was always buoyant , cheerful , and hopeful . His voice was exceedinglymusical , and one of the clearest in sound and most distinct in utterance that I have ever heard . It had a singular power of  |p1*netration  , and sentences spoken by him in an ordinary tone in camp could be heard at a distance which was surprising . His gait in walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body erect , and having no ear for music or rhythm , he never kept step to the airs played by the bands , no matter how vigorously the bass drums emphasized the accent . When walking in company there was no attempt to keep // step with others . In conversing he usually employed only two gestures ; one was the stroking of his chin beard with his left hand ; the other was the raising and lowering of his right hand , and resting it at intervals upon his knee or a table , the hand being held with the fingers close together and the knuckles bent , so that the hack of the hand and fingers formed a right angle . When not pressed by any matter of importance he was often slow in his movements , but when roused to activity he was quick in every motion , and worked with marvelous rapidity . He was civil to all who came in contact with him , and never attempted to snub any one , or treat anybody with less consideration on account of his inferiority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often bred by power , and none of the dogmatism which Samuel Johnson characterized as puppyism grown to maturity . A HIGHER GRADE CREATED FOR GRANT . WHEN I reached Washington I went at once to headquarters , and endeavored to see the commander-in-chief for the purpose of presenting General Grant 's letter , but found , after two or three attempts , that it would be impossible to secure an interview . I therefore gave the letter to Colonel Kelton , his adju-tant*general , **29;187;TOOLONG hands . Not only was there no action taken in regard to the request which the letter contained , but its receipt was not even acknowledged . This circumstance , with others of its kind , made it plain that General Grant would never be free to make his selection of officers , and organize his forces as he desired , until he should be made general-in-chief . Elihu 13 . Washburne , the member of Congress from the Galena district in Illinois , General Grant 's old home , soon introduced a bill creating the grade of lieutenant-general , and it was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that General Grant was to fill the position . The highest grade in the army theretofore created during the war had been that of major-generaL The act became a law on February 26 , 1864 , and the nomination of General Grant was sent to the Senate by Mr. Lincoln on the 1st of March , and confirmed on the 2d . On the 3d the general was ordered to Washington . I had set to work upon my duties in the Ordnance Bureau , and in the mean time had received several very kind messages from the general regarding the chances of my returning to the field . GRANT 'S FIRST MEETING WITH LINCOLN . ON the evening of March 8 the President and Mrs. Lincoln gave a public reception at the White House , which I attended . The President stood in the usual reception-room , known as the ( ( Blue Room , * with several cabinet officers near him , and shook hands cordially with everybody , as thevast procession of men and women passed in front of him . He was in evening dress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necktie was rather broad and awkwardly tied . He was more of a Hercules than an Adonis . His height of six feet four inches enabled him to look over the heads of most of his visitors . His form was ungainly , and the movements of his long , angular arms and legsbordered at times upon the grotesque . His eyes were grayand disproportionately smalL His face wore a general expression of sadness , the deep lines indicating the sense of responsibility which weighed upon him ; but at times his features lighted up with a broad smile , and there was a merry twinkle in his eyes as he greeted an old acquaintance and exchanged a few words with him in a tone of familiarity . He had sprung from the common people to become one of the most uncommon of men . Mrs. Lincoln occupied ' a position on his right . For a time she stood on a line with him and took part in the reception , but afterward stepped back and conversed with some of the wives of the cabinet officers and other personal acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock a sudden commotion near the entrance to the room attracted general attention , and , upon looking in that direction , I was surprised to see General Grant walking along modestly with the rest of the crowd toward Mr. Lincoln . He had arrived from the West that evening , and had come to the White House to pay his respects to the President . He had been in Washington but once before , when he visited it for a day soon after he had left West Point . Although these two historical characters had never met before , Mr. Lincoln recognized the general at once from the pictures he had seen of him* With a face radiant with delight , he advanced rapidly two or three steps toward his distinguished visitor , and cried out : " Why , here is General Grant ! Well , this is a great pleasure , I assure you , ) ) at the same time seizing him by the hand , and shaking it for several minutes with a vigor which showed the extreme cordiality of the welcome . The scene now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first // time were the two illustrious men whose names will always be inseparably associated in connection with the war of the rebellion . Grant 's right hand grasped the lapel of his coat ; his head was bent slightly forward , and his eyes upturned toward Lincoln 's face . The President , who was eight inches taller , looked down with beaming countenance upon his guest . Although their appearance , their training , and their characteristics , were in striking contrast , yet the two men had many traits in common , and there were numerous points of resemblance in their remarkable careers . Each was of humble origin , and had been compelled to learn the first lessons of life in the severe school of adversity . Each had risen from the people , possessed an abiding confidence in them , and always retained a deep hold upon theiraffections . Each might have said to those who were inclined to sneer at his plain origin what a marshal of Prance , who had risen from the ranks to a dukedom , said to the hereditary nobles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am an ancestor ; you are only descendants . ) ) In a great crisis of their country 's history both had entered the public service from the same State . Both were conspicuous for the possession of that most uncommon of all virtues , common sense . Both despised the arts of the demagogue , and shrank from posing for effect , or indulging in mock heroics . Even when their characteristics differed , they only served to supplement each other , and to add a still greater strength to the cause for which they strove . With hearts too great for rivalry , with souls untouched by jealousy , they lived to teach the world that it is time to abandon the path of ambition when it becomes so narrow that two can not walk it abreast . The statesman and the soldier conversed for a few minutes , and then the President presented his distinguished guest to Mr. Seward . The Secretary of State was very demonstrative in his welcome , and after exchanging a few words , led the general to where Mrs. Lincoln was standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise and pleasure at the meeting , and she and the general chatted together very pleasantly for some minutes . The visitors had by this time become so curious to catch a sight of the general that their eagerness knew no bounds , and they became altogether unmanageable . Mr. Seward 's consummate knowledge of the wiles of diplomacy now came to the rescue and saved the situation . He succeeded in struggling through the crowd with the general until they reached the large East Room where the people could circulate more freely . This , however , was only a temporary relief . The people by this time had worked themselves up to a state of uncontrollable excitement . The vast throng surged and swayed and crowded until alarm was felt for the safety of the ladies . Cries now arose of " Grant ! Grant ! Grant ! ) ) Then came cheer after cheer . Seward , after some persuasion , induced the general to stand upon a sofa , thinking the visitors would be satisfied with a view of him , and retire ; but as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a rush was made to shake his hand . The President sent word that he and the Secretary of War would await the general 's return in one of the small drawingrooms , but it was fully an hour before he was able to make his way there , and then only with the aid of several officers and ushers . The story has been circulated that at the conference which then took place , or at the interview the next day , the President and the Secretary of War urged General Grant to make his campaigu toward Richmond by the overland route , and finally persuaded him to do so , although he had set forth the superior advantages of the water route . There is not the slightest foundation for this rumor . General Grant some time after repeated to members of his staff just what had taken place , and no reference whatever was made to the choice of these two routes . IN COMMAND OF ALL THE ARMIES . THE next day , March 9 , the general went to the White House , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his commission from the hands of the President . Upon his return to Willard 's Hotel , I called to pay my respects . Curiosity led me to look at the hotel register , and the modesty of the entry upon the book , in the general 's handwriting , made an impression upon me . It read simply , ( ( U. S. Grant and son , Galena , Ill. * His eldest boy , Fred , accompanied him . The act which created the grade of lieutenant-general authorized a personal staff , to consist of a chief of staff with the rank of brigadier-general , four aides-de-camp , and two military secretaries , each with the rank of lieutenant-colonel . In our conversation the general referred to this circumstance , and offered me one of the positions of aide-decamp , which I said I would accept very gladly . The next day , the 10th , he paid a visit by rail to the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac , near Brandy Station , in Virginia , about // seventy miles from Washington . He returned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to meet Sherman and turn over to him the command of the Military Division of the Mississippi . While in Washington General Grant had been so much an object of curiosity , and had been so continually surrounded by admiring crowds when he appeared in the streets , and even in his hotel , that it had become very irksome to him . With his simplicity and total lack of personal vanity , he did not seem able to understand why he should attract so much attention . The President had given him a cordial invitation to dine that evening at the White House , but he begged to be excused for the reason that he would lose a whole day , which he could not afford at that critical period . ( ( Besides , ) ) he added , *I have become very tired of this show business . ) ) On the 12th the official order was issued placing General Grant in command of all the armies of the United States . INTERVIEW WITH STANTON . I SOON learned that the Secretary of War , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his staff , wanted to insist upon my continuing my duties in the department at Washington , and I resolved to have an interview with him , and to protest against such action . The Secretary had a wide reputation for extreme brusqueness in his intercourse even with his friends , and seemed determined , as an officer once expressed it , to administer discipline totally regardless of previous acquaintance . A Frenchman once said that during the Revolution , while the guillotine was at work , he never heard the name of Robespierre that he did not take off his hat to see whether his head was still on his shoulders ; some of our officers were similarly inclined when they heard the name of Stanton . However , I found the Secretary quite civil , and even patient , and , to all appearances , disposed to allow my head to continue to occupy the place where I was in the habit of wearing it . Nevertheless , the interview ended without his having yielded . I certainly received a very cold bath at his hands , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features upon a one-dollar treasury note without feeling a chill run down my back . General Grant returned to the capital on March 23 . I went to Willard 's to call upon him that evening , and encountered him on the stairs leading up to the first floor . He stopped , shook hands , and greeted me with the words , " How do you do , colonel ? ) ) I replied : 4 had hoped to be colonel by this time , owing to your interposition , but what I feared has been realized . Much against my wishes , the Secretary of War seems to have made up his mind to keep me here . ) ) " I will see him to-morrow , and urge the matter in person , ) ) answered the general . He then invited me to accompany him to his room , and in the course of a conversation which followed said that he had had Sheridan ordered east to take command of the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac . Sheridan arrived in Washington on April 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work and exposure in the field ; he weighed only a hundred and fifteen pounds , and as his height was but five feet six inches , he looked anything but formidable as a candidate for a cavalry leader . He had met the President and the officials at the War Department that day for the first time , and it was his appearance on this occasion which gave rise to a remark made to General Grant the next time he visited the department : ( ( The officer you brought on from the West is rather a little fellow to handle your cavalry . ) ) To which Grant replied , * You will find him big enough for the purpose before we get through with him . ) ) General Grant had started for the field on the 26th of March , and established his headquarters in the little town of CulpeperCourthouse in Virginia , twelve miles north of the Rapidan . He visited Washington about once a week to confer with the President and the Secretary of War . I continued my duties in the department at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 27th of April I found that the request of the general-in-chief had prevailed , and my appointment was officially announced as an aide-de-camp on his personal staff . The afternoon of April 29 I arrived at Culpeper , and reported to him for duty . A plain brick house near the railway station had been taken for headquarters , and a number of tents had been pitched in the yard to furnish additional accommodations . GRANT IN A COMMUNICATIVE MOOD . THE next morning the general called for his horse , to ride over to General Meade 's headquarters , near Brandy Station , about six miles distant . He selected me as the officer who was to accompany him , and we set out together on the trip , followed by two orderlies . // He was mounted upon his large bay horse , Cincinnati , which afterward became so well known throughout the army . The animal was not called after the family of the ancient warrior who beat his sword into a plowshare , but after our modern city of that name . He was a half-brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was consequently of excellent blood . Noticing the agility with which the general flung himself into the saddle , I remarked , " I am very glad to see that your injured leg no longer disables you. * * No , ) ) he replied ; " it gives me scarcely any trouble now , although sometimes it feels a little numb . ) ) As we rode along he began to speak of his new command , and said : *I have watched the progress of the Army of the Potomac ever since it was organized , and have been greatly interested in reading the accounts of the splendid fighting it has done . I always thought the territory covered by its operations would be the principal battleground of the war . When I was at Cairo , in 1861 , the height of my ambition was tocommand a brigade of cavalry in this army . I suppose it was my fondness for horses that made me feel that I should be more at home in command of cavalry , and I thought that the Army of the Potomac would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that arm of the service . ) ) He then changed the subject to Chattanooga , and in speaking of that battle interjected into his descriptions brief criticisms upon the services and characteristics of several of the officers who had taken part in the engagement . He continued by saying : " The difficulty is in finding commanding officers possessed of sufficient breadth of view and administrative ability to confine their attention to perfecting their organizations , and giving a general supervision to their commands , instead of wasting their time upon details . For instance , there is General G He is a very gallant officer , but at a critical period of the battle of Chattanooga he neglected to give the necessary directions to his troops , and concentrated all his efforts upon aiming and firing some heavy guns , a service which could have been better performed by any lieutenant of artillery . I had to order him peremptorily to leave the battery and give his attention to his troops . ) ) He then spoke of his experiences with Mr* Lincoln , and the very favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( ( In the first interview I had with the President , when no others were present , and he could talk freely , he told me that he did not pretend to know anything about the handling of troops , and it was with the greatest reluctance that he ever interfered with the movements of army commanders : but he had common sense enough to know that celerity was absolutely necessary ; that while armies were sitting down waiting for opportunities to turn up which might , perhaps , be more favorable from a strictly military point of view , the government was spending millions of dollars every day ; that there was a limit to the sinews of war , and a time might be reached when the spirits and resources of the people would become exhausted . He had always contended that these considerations should be taken into account , as well as purely military questions , and that he adopted the plan of issuing his ( executive orders ) principally for the purpose of hurrying the movements of commanding generals ; but that he believed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to interfere with my operations . He said , further , that he did not want to know my plans ; that it was , perhaps , better that he should not know them , for everybody he met was trying to find out from him something about the contemplated movements , and there was always a temptation ( to leak . I have not communicated my plans to him or to the Secretary of War . The only suggestion the President made  --  and it was merely a suggestion , not a definite plan - was entirely impracticable , and it was not again referred to in our conversations , He told me in our first private interview a most amusing anecdote regarding a delegation of ( cross-roads wiseacres , ) as he called them , who came to see him one day to criticize my conduct in paroling Pemberton 's army after the surrender atV*cksburg , who insisted that the men would violate their paroles , and in less than a month confront me anew in the field , and have to be whipped all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of them was to tell them the story of Sykes 's dog . ( ( Have you ever heard about Sykes 's yellow dog ? ) ) said I to the spokesman of the delegation . He said he had n't . ( ( Well , I must tell you about him , ) ) said I. ( ( Sykes had a yellow dog he set great store by , but there were a lot of small boys around the village , and that s always a bad thing for dogs , you know . These boys did n't share Sykes 's views , and they were not disposed to let the dog have a fair show . Even Sykes had to admit that the dog was getting unpopular ; in fact , it was soon seen that a prejudice was growing up against that dog that threatened to wreck all his future prospects in life . The // boys , after meditating how they could get the best of him , finally fixed up a cartridge with a long fuse , put the cartridge in a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of Sykes 's door , and then perched themselves on a fence a good distance off , holding the end of the fuse in their hands . Then they whistled for the dog . When he came out he scented the bait , and bolted the meat , cartridge and all . The boys touched off the fuse with a cigar , and in about a second a report came from that dog that sounded like a clap of thunder . Sykes came bouncing out of the house , and yelled , ( What s up ! Anything busted ? ) There was no reply , except a snicker from the small boys roosting on the fence ; but as Sykes looked up he saw the whole air filled with pieces of yellow dog . He picked up the biggest piece he could find , a portion of the back with a part of the tail still hanging to it , and after turning it round and looking it all over , he said , ( Well , I guess he 11 never be much account again-as a dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much account again-as an army. * The delegation began looking around for their hats before I had quite got to the end of the story , and I was never bothered any more after that about superseding the commander of the Army of the Tennessee . ) ) ) The general related this anecdote with more animation than he usually displayed , and with the manifestation of a keen sense of the humorous , and remarked afterward , * But no one who does not possess the President 's unequaled powers of mimicry can pretend to convey an idea of the amusing manner in which he told the story . ) ) This characteristic illustration employed by the President was used afterward in a garbled form by writers , in an attempt to apply it to other events . I give the original version . AT GENERAL MEADFS HEADQUARTE1*S . WHEN we reached General Meade 's camp , that officer , who was sitting in his quarters , came out and greeted the general-in -- chief warmly , shaking hands with him before he dismounted . General Meade was then fortynine years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his movements . He had a full beard , which , like his hair , was brown , slightly tinged with gray . He wore a slouched felt hat with a conical crown and a turneddown rim , which gave him a sort of Tyrolese appearance . The two commanders entered Meade 's quarters , sat down , lighted their cigars , and held a long interview regarding the approaching campaign . I now learned that , two days before , the time had been definitely named at which the opening campaign was to begin , and that on the next Wednesday , May 4 , the armies were to move . Meade , in speaking of his troops , always referred to them as **my people . ) ) During this visit I had an opportunity to meet a number of old acquaintances whom I had not seen since I served with the Army of the Potomac on General McClellan 's staff two years before . After the interview had ended I returned with the general to headquarters , riding at a brisk trot . His conversation now turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of which he remarked : " I had never met General Meade since the Mexican war until I visited his headquarters when I came East last month . In my first interview with him he talked in a manner which led me to form a very high opinion of him . He referred to the changes which were taking place , and said it had occurred to him that I might want to make a change in the commander of the Army of the Potomac , and to put in his place Sherman or some other officer who had served with me in the West , and urged me not to hesitate on his account if I desired to make such an assignment . lie added that the success of the cause was much more important than any consideration for the feelings of an individual . He spoke so patriotically and unselfishly that even if I had had any intention of relieving him , I should have been inclined to change my mind after the manly attitude he assumed in this frank interview. * This was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our intercourse heretofore had been only of an official character , and the exhibition of the remarkable power he possessed as a conversationalist was a revelation . I began to learn that his reputed reticence did not extend to his private intercourse , and that he had the ability to impart a peculiar charm to almost any topic . That evening a large correspondence was conducted in relation to the final preparations for the coming movements . GRANT 'S NARROW ESCAPE FROM CAPTURE . A FEW days before , an occurrence had happened which came very near depriving the armies of the services of General Grant in the Virginia campaign . On his return to headquarters after his last visit to the President in Washington , when his special train // reached Warrenton Junction he saw a large cloud of dust to the east of the road . Upon making inquiries of the station master as to its cause , he learned that Colonel Mosby , who commanded a partizan Confederate force , called by his own people Mosby 's * conglomerates , ) ) and who had become famous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detachment of our cavalry before him . If the train had been a few minutes earlier , Mosby , like Christopher Columbus upon his voyage to this country , would have discovered something which he was not looking for . As the train carried no guard , it would not have been possible to make any defense . In such case the Union commander would have reached Richmond a year sooner than he finallyarrived there , but not at the head of an army . HIS ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY . GENERAL GRANT now held a command the magnitude of which has seldom been equaled in history . His troops consisted of twentyone army-corps , and the territory covered by the field of operations embraced eighteen military departments , besides the region held by the Army of the Potomac , which had never been organized into a department . The total number of troops under his command , " present for duty , equipped , ) ) was 533,000 . In all purely military questions his will was at this time almost supreme , and his authority was usually unquestioned . He occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the President himself , and the eyes of all the loyal people hi the land were turned to him appealingly as the one man upon whom their hopes were centered and in whom their chief faith reposed . The responsibilities imposed were commensurate with the magnitude of the undertaking which had been confided to him . While commanding all the armies of the nation , he had wisely decided to establish his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac , and give his immediate supervision to the operations of that force and the troops which were intended to coöperate with it in the State of Virginia . Telegraphic communication was then open with nearly all the armies . GRANT 'S PERSONAL STAPF . THE staff consisted of twelve officers only , and was not larger than that of some division commanders . The chief of staff was Brigadier-general John A. Rawlins . When the war broke out he was a practising lawyer in Galena , Illinois , and had gained some prominence in politics as a Democrat . After the firing upon Fort Sumter a public meeting was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was called upon to preside . Rawlins attended the meeting , and made * stirring and effective speech , declaring it to be the duty of all good citizens to sink their political predilections , and urging them to pledge themselves to the support of the Union and the enforcement of the laws . General Grant was much impressed with the vigor and logic of the address , and when he was afterward assigned to the command of a brigade , he appointed Rawlins on his staff . He was at first aidede-camp , afterward assistant adjutant-general , and finally chief of staff . The general had a high regard for him officially , and was warmly attached to him personally . Rawlins in his youth had worked on a farm , and assisted his father in burning charcoal , obtaining what education he could acquire at odd times in the district school and at a neighboringseminary . Hewas frank , honest , and resolute , and loyally devoted to his chief . He always had the courage of us convictions , and was capable of stating them with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a genial disposition , and popular with all the other members of the staff . He had never served in a military organization , nor made a study of the art of war ; but he possessed natural executive ability of a high order , and developed qualities which made him exceedingly useful to his chief and to the service . The rest of the staff consisted of the following officers : Lieutenant-colonel C. B. Comstock , aidede-camp , an officer of the United States corps of engineers , with a well-deserved reputation for scientific attainments , who had shown great efficiency while serving with General Grant in the Vicksburg campaign . Lieutenant-colonel Horace Porter , aide-decamp . Lieutenant-colonel 0 . B. Babcock , aide-decamp , an accomplished officer of engineers , who had gained an excellent reputation in several campaigns , in which he had been conspicuous for his good judgment and great personal courage . Lieutenant-colonel F. T. Dent , aide-decamp , a classmate of General Grant , and brother of Mrs. Grant . He had served with credit in the Mexican war , and in Scott 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was twice promoted for gallant and meritorious conduct in battle . // qwq
