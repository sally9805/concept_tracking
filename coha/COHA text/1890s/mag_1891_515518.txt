BY THE REV . HEKRY M. FIELD , D.D . THE midsummer of this year witnessed a scene in the mountains of Virginia that recalled the events of a past generation . The 21st of July was the thirtieth anniversary of Bull Run , where North and South met in the first real battle of the war , for the engagements in West Virginia , near the Ohio , hardly rose to the dignity of battles . But Bull Run was a conflict of armies , in which both sides took their first lessons in war , and out of which came at least one great soldier , who stood so firmly while the battle raged around him that others who were broken and dismayed took courage as they saw his unshaken column standing " like a stone wall , " from which he received the name of " Stonewall " Jackson . This was the hero to whom a monument was now to be unveiled in Lexington , where he is buried . Of those who stood beside him on that bloody day thirty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survivors , the shattered wrecks of war , came from far and near to do honor to him who once led them to battle , and wept with overpowering emotion at the grave of their beloved commander . The demonstration furnishes an occasion for a Northerner to give his opinion of this extraordinary man . The years that have passed have removed us so far from the great tragedy of the war , and from the passions it aroused , that we can do justice even to those who were in arms against us ; and no one can read the history of Stonewall Jackson without recognizing in him all the qualities that go to make a popular hero . As a soldier , some competent critics rank him as the first that the war produced on either side . Not that he was at the head of the largest army , or undertook the most extensive military operations , but that with the means that he had he accomplished more than any other commander . He had made a study of the campaigns of Napoleon , and saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but in secrecy of design and rapidity of execution . In the latter he outdid even Napoleon himself , training his men to such a pitch of endurance that he could " rush " them twenty - five miles a day over a broken country , across rivers , and over mountains , and fight a battle as the sun was going down . Nothing in the war gave more decisive proof of military genius than the campaign in the Shenandoah Valley in the spring of 1862-the only one which he conducted absolutely alone , with no interference from those above him - where he was pitted not against one army , but four ( under Banks , Fremont , Shields , and Milroy ) , advancing upon him from different quarters , and outmano*uvred them all , attacking and defeating each in turn , till he drove them one after another , out of the valley , when he gave them all the slip , and crossing the Blue Ridge in one of his rapid marches , suddenly appeared on the flank of McClellan 's army before Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , and by a bold movement threw himself between Pope and Washington , and the second Bull Run proved far more bloody than the first . All this is matter of history which it is not necessary to recall , nor to follow the tireless soldier to Harper 's Ferry , to Antietam , to Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville , where he fell at the very moment that the great flank movement which he had conceived and conducted had struck the Union army with a shock from which it reeled and could not recover , but sought safety on the other side of the Rappahannock , which it had crossed only a few days before in all the confidence of victory . This is a record of continued success of which it is hard to find another example in our own history , or , indeed , in any other . Such was Jackson , the soldier , a man of iron , of whom we think , as we read tile histories of the war , that he must have been as unbending as the bronze statue that was unveiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there in his rugged composition some softer elements that bring him more in touch with our common humanity ? These questions are answered in a memorial that will have a unique interest because of the source from which it comes . There is always a peculiar interest in the life of a man written by a woman , especially if she be his wife ( for surely no one // can write of him so truly , as no one knows him so well ) , and if the man himself be a great character or a great actor in human affairs . All these elements of interest are united in a Life of Stonewall Jackson by his wife , the very mention of which touches a chord of sympathy . When the great soldier fell at Chancellorsville he was in the prime of manhood , not yet forty years old . He died on the 10th of May , 1863 , so that it is now twenty-eight years that she who bears his name has pursued her lonely way through the world , nourishing her sad heart with memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life together , and reading over and over the letters which speak to her as a voice from the unseen . Out of these materials and reminiscences , with the help of more elaborate histories and biographies , she has prepared the simple narrative which she now gives to the world . In opening these pages , so full of tender interest , we perceive at once how different is a woman 's way of telling a story from that of a man ! His style is blunt and abrupt , as he plunges at once into the heart of a subject , while she comes to hers by gradual approaches , soft and slow as her own gentle footsteps , lingering by the way to bring in every incident , however remote the connection , and thus leading us on by a pleasant though somewhat winding path to the end . If a woman has a story to tell , she begins at the beginning . Thus our author , to make her narrative complete , prefaces that which is personal to herself by a sketch of the ancestry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty years . This may seem a roundabout way of coming to her subject , but it is a woman 's way , winding round and round through secluded paths till she comes out at last on the upland , where the broad sunlight falls upon the hero of her story . While we would not anticipate the reader in following her back to an early period of American history , as into the deep shadows of the primeval forest , we may point the way in an outline which condenses many pages into one . The story begins like a novel , of course with a young woman in the foreground . It is in the middle of the last century ( 1748 ) that she steps upon the scene , in the great " London town " where her father is a well-to-do citizen , owning if not keeping a famous hostelry known as The Bold Dragoon . But the good man dies , and his wife marries his brother , to the great disgust of a dau*hter , who might almost have stood herself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masculine beauty , with the stature of a man ( she was six feet tall ) , and his strength as well ; and of such spirit that when her step-father would assert his authority over her , she threw a silver tankard at his head , and fled from his home , and took ship for America . On board she meets ( in the most approved style of romance ) the man who is to be her husband . On the long voyage there is time enough for love-making , but the proud beauty disdains her lover , till ( as usual in such cases ) , after long waiting , his perseverance and devotion are rewarded , and she becomes the wife of John Jackson . At first they settle in Maryland ; but soon , ambitious of broader lands , if not of a freer and bolder life , move off into the wilderness , where they are surrounded by Indians , and often startled by the warwhoop , when the wife is not a whit behind her husband in defending their cabin , and inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete " Romance of the Border , " which would find its climax in what no novelist would dare to invent , but was the historic fact , that this queen of the forest lived to be a hundred and five years old ! Such a couple might be expected to be the progenitors of a race of heroes , and when the war of the Revolution came on the father and the older sons took their places in the ranks on the side of independence . Reaping the fruits , his son George was a member of Congress when Andrew Jackson was Senator from Tennessee ; and comparing notes , they found that their ancestors were from the same parish , near Loudonderry , and may have taken part in the famous sigge in which many a hero fought and fell , while those who survived clung the closer to a freedom that had been bought with blood . This is a noble lineage from which to have sprung , and it is no wonder that Stonewall Jackson was always proud of his ancestry , and that his highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this our author records with just womanly pride , tracing their history from generation to generation , till , in the year 1824 , January 21st , appeared a little " Thomas , " who was born to a destiny // greater than them all . The surroundings were humble enou*ha one-story , lowroofed house in the little town of Clarksburg , Virginia . It is now , by the division of the State , in West Virginia ; but as that sundering in twain of the proud " Old Dominion " was not accomplished till after his death , he had the satisfaction of dying , as he was born , a Virginian . From the beginning it seemed as if " melancholy marked him for her own . " He was not three years old when his father died , so that it was as if lie never had a father , since he could not remember how he looked nor the sound of his voice . His widowed mother was left penniless , and supported herself and her three children by teaching a little school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to a man so shiftless that he could not take care of her family , and at six years of age , BIRTHPLACE OF GENERAL JACKSON , cLARKsBuRG , WE5T VIRGINIA . Thomas , " a pretty , rosy-cheeked , blue-eyed boy , with waving brown hair , " the darling of his mother , had to be sent to the care of an uncle . It is a pitiful scene , that of the little fellow , mounted behind an old negro servant , riding away from the mother , who stands at her door with streaming eyes and breaking heart , watching him till he disappears . She was not to see him again till a year later , when she was on her death-bed , and sent for him to receive her last blessing . Thus , while still a child , he was left doubly orphaned . But the mother had lived long enough to imprint her image on the heart of her son , and to his dyin day he could not speak of her but with an emotion that showed how he loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by his oldet brother , the two boys started in search of adventure , and wandered off to the Ohio and down the river , sleeping on flatboats and on the river banks , till they were shivering with fever and ague , when , after months of absence , the poor little prodigal children came back , too glad to have once more the comforts of a home . FATHER OF STONEWALL JACKSON . From a painted miniature . // But with all this , Thomas took to habits of industry , and as he grew up had charge of the men on his uncle 's farm . Active and high-spirited , he was the most daring rider in a horse-race , and thrashed a bully twice his size because he spoke rudely to a school-girl . Such is the stuff of which heroes are made . The boy was father of the man . But this country life came to an end on his receiving , quite unexpectedly , an appointment as a cadet at West Point , which determined his military career . He began almost at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its head , gaining slowly but steadily by his indomitable perseverance , till , when , after four years of hard study , he was sent to Mexico , there was not a better young officer in the army . Whenever he was under fire , he showed the coolness of a veteran , and was twice brevetted for gallantry-in the battle of Churubusco and the storming of Chapultepec . Then came the unexciting times of peace ; but he still remained in the army ( being once stationed at Fort Hamilton , in the harbor of New York , and afterwards at Tampa , in Florida ) , till 1851 , when he resigned to accept a professorship in the Military Institute at Lexington , Virginia  --  the West Point of the South-where he continued for ten years , till the beginning of the civil war . Here , in 1853 , he was married to a daughter of Rev. Dr. Junkin , the president of Washington College , but in little more than a year she died in giving birth to a child , the child also dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same grave . Thus his house was left desolate , and his only comfort was in the Christian society of his venerable father - in - law , in whose family he lived for two or three years . It was only in 1857 , after hi* return from Europe , that he found happiness again in a second marriage , to one who was , like his former wife , the daughter of a Presbyterian minister , the Rev. Dr. Morrison , of Charlotte , North Carolina , who had also been the president of a college , so that all his associations were academic and scholarly . She is the author of the present volume , and here begin those personal reminiscences which constitute its chieF interest and value . As we are introduced into the home life at Lexington , we see how the very atmosphere is changed by the presence of woman , and appreciate the fineness of her observations in the judgment of character . Though this is a delicate test , it is perhaps the truest and the best that can be applied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a kind of instinct , of her with whom his life is associated , as she sees all that he does from a feminine point of view , from the side of the affections , whereby are perceived things invisible to our duller sense . With such keen insight , the wife of a soldier , who looks straight into his eyes , may see beneath those heavy brows a soft and tender look , and the voice that is used to command , subdued to tones as gentle as her own . Thus brought into the closest relations , a fireside study reveals in many cases , and certainly in this , a character quite other than that by which a man has been known in the world . With Stonewall Jackson for the central figure , it is a great privilege to have the curtain raised on an interior in which our eyes rest upon a beautiful domestic scene . The man of iron is found to be the simplest , the gentlest , and the sweetest of men , who wins our confidence and our strong personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TwENTY-rouR-From a daguerreotype. // takes a good-naturedwe might almost say a mischievous - delight in showing how far he was from what he has been supposed to be . Instead of sitting apart , stern and silent , he is the most approachable of human be ings to those whom he knows well , with whom he talks without reserve . Nor is his conversation only in a grave monotone . It will surprise many to learn that this " grim soldier " was noted in hi* family for his playfulness , and the quiet humor that often rippled in a smile or a twinkle of the eye . As soon as lie enters his door he puts off all Inilitary stiffness as he would lay aside his military cloak ; the officer is THE JACK5ON DWELLING , LEXINGTON. changed into a man , and qwq promotion , he never got higher than a deacon whose duty was to look after the poor and take up the collection . He even stooped to the last extreme of self-abne*ation : when there was a good cause begging for help , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never stopped at any service , however humble . In Lexington , as in other Southern towns , there were many poor negroes , whose condition , especially that of THE vIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE . the children , excited his // compassion , and he opened a Sundayschool , into which he gathered the little pickaninnies from the street , and he did not take more pride in the martial appearance of the cadets on parade than in the rows of dark hut hright-eyed faces that glistened on the henches of his negro Sunday-school . Such was the simple round of this good man 's life in those tranquil days , when he was thrice happy-happy in his home , in his professional life , and in doing good . Such was the scene , too bright to last , that was now to he darkened , as suddenly rose the gathering clouds of war . When Virginia voted to secede , the cadets of the institute , having been already trained to arms , were quickly formed into a company , with Jackson as its commander , and awaited only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sunday morning , and they were drawn up on the parade-ground . When all was completed . Jackson returned to his home for a last farewell , and taking the old family Bihle , opened to this word of promise : " For we know that if our earthly house of this tahernacle he dissolved , we have a huilding of God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens ; " and then , in a voice choked with emotion , prayed for her whom he left behind , and for the country , that it might yet he spared the horrors of war . Then rising from his knees , he crossed the threshold which he was never to cross again . And now came in swift succession the great and awful scenes of hattle , at which the very heart of the nation stood still . The present narrative , though it continties to the middle of the war , when Jackson fell , throws hut little light on the war itself , of which the writer could have no personal knowledge ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never saw a hattIe , for as soon as one was impending , with his usual tender care , he sent her away to a place of safety , so that all she knows of the issue she has learned from others who were eyewitnesses . Of course she must give some account of the campaigns and hattles which were the great events of her hero*s life ; but these , however interesting in themselves , can not claim to he an original and independent contribution to history . One chapter , however , furnished by anvi*w NEAR LEXINGTON. // other pen , is new and startling-that which ascribes to Jackson at one moment a proposal to raise the black flag ! This is the last extremity of war , and its most horrible barbarity . The very word suggests slaughter without mercy . The black flag floats only at the mast-head of pirate ships , telling by a sign that can not be misunderstood that quarter will neither be asked nor given . In warfare on land it would be understood as a massacre of prisoners , a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring upon any man or any government that should attempt it the execi ation of the whole civilized world . The very idea of such a thing is so alien to the character of Stonewall Jackson that a statement of this kind must be received with great reserve . It would not be deemed worthy of a moment 's attention were it not that it is given on the authority of his own brother-in - law , General Rufus Barrin ger , of the Confederate army , who details at considerable length a remarkable interview that took place after the Seven Days battles , while the army was still encamped near Richmond . But the statement is explicit , and leaves no doubt that Jackson believed in the Cromwellian way of carrying on war ; that if wa must be , the more tremendous the blows , the sooner will it come to an end ; and he would push the war into the North , and make it felt in all its severity . But he would never have dealt with prisoners as Cromwell did with the Irish garrison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best proof of what he would do is in what he did do when the fortune of war threw a whole garrison into his hands . At Harper 's Ferry he captured eleven STONEWALL JACKSON . // thousand men , and instead of treating them with great severity , he paroled them all ; by which , instead of being sent to Southern prisons , they were transported to a camp near Chicago , where they were kept in comparative comfort till they were exchanged . Of course if they violated their parole they would be exposed to the utmost penalty of war . But the policy , instead of being cruel , was the mildest that could have been adopted . It was not , however , on the ground of humanity , but to disencumber his army , that he might move it rapidly , which he could not do with thousands of prisoners dragging on its heels . If at Harper 's Ferry he had stopped to look after them , it would have delayed his march to join Lee for the approaching battle . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners , " it was for a military reason . He had laid out a plan of campaign , which he believed , if vigorously pursued , would end the war . It was to form three or four great " movable columns " of forty thousand men each , which should be literally stripped for battle , leaving behind not only prisoners but even fortified posts , that the whole fighting force might be concentrated into a few compact bodies , which could be moved with great rapidity into the Northern States and against Northern cities . That this grand strategy would have succeeded we do not believe , for the best of all reasons , that it was twice attempted and failed-at Antietam and Gettysburg-in the first of which Jackson himself took part . But at the time of the interview this had not been attempted , and he was very sanguine of success , even picturing to himself how he would plant his guns within shelling distance of Philadelphia and New York ! But of this midnight council and planning of great campaigns not a whisper came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was content not to know . It might be supposed that letters from a great commander to his wife , written amid the scenes of war , would contain some private information which could not then be communicated to the public , TEE JACKSON 5TATIJE BY FOLEY , RIcHMOND . // and is now at this late day for the first time revealed . But the letters reveal nothing . He never told her his plans beforehand , for his rule of absolute secrecy in war extended even to his wife ; and , what is still more remarkable , he told her very little after , for he could fight battles better than he could describe them , and he did not like to talk of himself . Her knowledge of the war , therefore , is derived chiefly from others , and almost solely from Southern authorities ; we do not remember that she quotes a single Northern writer . It never enters her dear woman 's heart that there can be another side to the story . This total oblivion of that " other side , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors her own , would subject her book to severe criticism were it to be set up as an authority , claiming the deference due to the most authentic history . But it makes no such claim . It simply gives the generally known events of Stonewall Jackson 's life as the chain to connect her personal reminiscences , to which are added , what only she could supply , the letters written to her during the war . But since these contain but little about the war , or little that is new , what do they contam that makes them worthy of preservation ? We answer they furnish the most perfect revelation , not of the soldier , but of the mart , in which his moral and religious nature , his love and faith and devotion , stand out in splendid relief against the dark background of war . Stonewall Jackson was a devout man before , but the war made him still more devout , as new trials and new dangers called for a stronger faith . His recognition of God in all things , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humilitv and peace , becomes most notable when it keeps its hold and its mastery over him in a conflict of arms mighty enough to rouse all the passions that rage in the warrior 's breast . The religion of Stonewall Jackson is an enigma to many who study the life of the great soldier , while to others it is a scorn and a derision . To those who seek a subject for caricature , the eccentricities in which he carried some things to an extreme furnish plenty of material for their small wit . Such was his rigid observance of the Sabbath . Not only did he refrain from all worldly occupations on that day , he would not even write a letter , nor read one if lie received it , even though it was from her who was to be his wife . He was sure that it would keep its sweetness till the next day , and meanwhile he had the pleasure of anticipation . Nay , more , he would not post a letter on Saturday , lest it should travel on Sunday . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes he had to fight a battle on that holy day ; but that he looked upon as " a work of necessity , " if not of " mercy " ; and then he would keep Monday ! So scrupulous was he not to defraud the Lord of His just due that he would sometimes keep two or three days running to balance the account ! But more than any outward observance was the faith that vitalized his very being . JACKSON S TOMB . LExINGTON , VIRGINIA . // This was the iron in his blood . It has been said that he was a fatalist ; that he had a blind feeling of " destiny , " like that of Napoleon , as if his career was not of his own choosing , but that he was lifted up and borne on by a power that he could not resist . This is the creed of the Mosleni , to whom it gives a confidence in battle that is in itself an element of power . But it is a cold , hard , iron creed , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on with tremendous power , caring not for the happiness they destroy or the suffering they inflict , crushing the lives and hopes of men without pity and without remorse . Into this stupendous mechanism - this universe without a soul-faith puts intelligence and love , so that to the soldier who looks up from his tent to the stars above him they are not the cold , stony eyes of a relentless Fate , but the tender eyes of One who looks down upon him , a loving as well as an unsleeping Watcher . That love and care Jackson never doubted . The power above was a Father , into whose hands he committed the issnes of life and death with childlike trust . This simple faith was the inspiration of his life . He carried it into war ; indeed , it grew stronger as the clouds grew darker . His marvellous successes might well confirm his faith in the Divine protection , which lie sought constantly by prayer . His negro servant said he always knew when there was going to be a battle , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pray ! And he at once packed his haversack , for he knew that he would call for it in the morning . When he was riding to battle and spoke not a word , his lips were observed to he moving in prayer . Thus relying upon a higher power , how could he help looking upon success as the answer to his prayers , and say , what he fervently believed , that it was " not by his own might or power , " but that it was God who had given him the victory ? This religious feeling , which was so intense in Jackson , to , some extent pervaded the Southern army . Both armies were supplied with chaplains and with devoted men and women , who ministered to the WAR-HORSE " OLD SORREL , " AT THIRTY . From a photo* aph by J. H. Van Ness .

But in the Southern army there were at times-especially when in winter quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to the eloquent preachers of the South . Jackson often refers in his letters to the enjoyment he had in these services . Pious exhorters went from tent to tent talking to the men about their old homes , and the fathers and mothers far away , and how they felt for their sons exposed to the dangers of war , the kindly word ending in a little prayer-meeting , so that those who passed through the encampment in the evening saw here and there soldiers kneeling round their camp fires , and heard their simple but fervent prayers , with the singing not of war songs , but of hymns , such as " Jesus , lover of my soul , Let me to Thy bosom fly . " It is said that the soldiers of Gustavus Adolphus sang psalms in every tent-a scene that was often repeated in the Southern army , while the religious papers of the South reported great " revivals , " with hundreds of conversions . A volume entitled Christ in the Camp details these extraordinary scenes , that often preceded battles that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all-pervading faith in God which runs through the letters of Jackson , is the love of home and of that which makes home so dear . This tenderness lends a peculiar grace and charm to a soldier , because it is so alien to his pursuits that it comes upon us as a surprise . In the biography of the late Lord Lawrence , who saved India to England , there is nothing so beautiful as his devotion to his wife , to whom he whispers , with his dying breath , " To the last gasp , my darling 1 " Of the same heroic mould was Stonewall Jackson . In all epistolary literature there is nothing more tender than some of these letters , written amid the awful scenes of war . They run over with affection . The stern soldier uses the fondest terms of endearment . He addresses his wife as his " pet " and his " darling , " his " sunshine " and his " little somebody , " as if he would wrap her in a veil of mystery . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he learned in Mexico . The terms " husband " and " wife " are too cold and prosaic for his ardent affection , and he betakes himself to the more musical-if not more expressive-Spanish pet names , according to which he is her esposo , and she his esposct ; or , using the diminutive , his esposita , his little wife . Indeed , these letters will be criticised , perhaps severely , as being too effusive in their expressions of love to be seen except by her to whom they were addressed . No doubt it cost a struggle to permit other eyes to look upon that which was written only for her own ; but , on the other hand , it is in these very things which were not written to be seen that the true character is revealed . A soldier might write no end of military despatches , or even personal letters , in the phrases of formal etiquette , and those who read be no wiser as to the real man who is hidden behind the mask of this studied politeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it had not been better for the compiler of this volume to leave out these tender phrases and epithets , our answer would be , Not one ! Every omission would be a mutilation . " Out of the strong cometh forth sweetness , " and no sweetness is like that which comes from a lion heart . This union of love and faith he kept to the last . If anything more were needed to show how far was Stonewall Jackson from the reproach of cant and commonness , it is furnished by the way in which he met his end . It came not by a long , lingering decay , but in the very front of battle , where , caught between two armies , he was fired upon by his own men . Yet he was not to die amid " the battle 's splendor , " nor , like Wolfe on the Heights of Abraham , in the moment of victory . Borne from the field , he had full opportunity to contemplate the inevitable future . He did not " long for death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to give them . When his wife bent over him with their child in her arms , those little fingers drew him backward . Nor did it seem to him according to the fitness of things that his work should end in midcareer ; he felt that " the Lord had more for him to do . " But when he saw that this was not to be , when the shadow was on the wall , instantly the warrior s head bowed to the Almighty will . Nay , he recognized the goodness of God in the time of his departure . He said that " he had always wished to die on Sunday , " VOL . Lxxxnl. - No. 498-86 // HARPER 'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . qwq BY JULIAN RALPH . IF it were sought to express in one phrase the expectations of those who are planning the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago , it could best be done by calling it a Venetian spectacle . In all that governs its best effects , as it will burst upon the vision of the multitude , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind what , the poetic comprehension conceives that Venice might appear if she were in gala attire , and her beauties , seen under a flood of electric light , were effectively concentrated along two miles of the Adriatic shore . This is written while nature , still gaudy in autumn raiment , hesitates at the edge of the approaching winter of 1891 . Chicago has been visited , the site of the projected Columbian Exposition has been examined , and the men and women who have undertaken to arrange the major details of the great fair have willingly offered their forecasts of the finished work . The labor of preparation is , in point of time , still a year from that appointed stage of completion when , in October , 1892 , the Columbian anniversary is to be celebrated with several days of pageantry and festivity . After that seven months will be consumed in storing the buildings with exhibits ; and then , in May , 1893 , the great fair will be opened to the inspection of the world . Even in New York , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair , it is at this writing evident that the shrewdest business men have come to regard the projected exposition as likely to prove a complete triumph of American enterprise and skill . Not all who feel compelled to sink an already weakening local prejudice beneath national pride are even now willing to predict artistic and material success for Chicago 's undertaking . But it is in Wall Street that is heard the first note of confidence in the success of the undertaking , and it is scarcely necessary to say that in Wall Street the finer and more delicate aspects of the case are not likely to receive recognition , particularly in those bulletins in which financiers seek to convince their correspondents that we are on the eve of three years of prosperity . The basis and reasoning in these bulletins are that the movement and sale of our enormous food products will bring about the first year 's prosperity ; that next will occur a year distinguished by great railroad extension , to be paid for out of the first year 's transportation earnings ; and that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of entertaining the foreign visitors to the World 's Fair . Following this hopeful financial view , there is a growing belief that the exposition will not fail from an artistic point of view . The broad and liberal spirit which led its projectors to seek the aid of the most distinguished architects of the country is reassuring to those who have doubted whether our fair would vindicate American taste at the same time that it would display our wealth and progress . // The manner in which the architects are encouraged to work for the fair is quite as remarkable , and quite as potent in destroying borrowed concern . After ten men of admitted excellence have been selected from all over the country , to each has been paid an honorarium of ten thousand dollars . It is truly a royal way to insure hearty co-operation and the best work of the best men . All have been treated alike , and all are enabled to foitify themselves by special study here and abroad for the work they are undertaking . The note thus sounded in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the chord that has b6en struck in Wall Street . There will not long remain among well-informed persons a trace of the former belief that Chicago will too strongly impress her individuality upon the fair , or of the dying doubt that it will be fully and grandly national in its aims and accomplishments . Once again the peculiar manner in which American affairs are influenced by public opinion is in this matter made evident . Amid the clamor attending the competition among large cities which wished to possess the fair many angry and rude aspersions have been cast upon Chicago 's fitness for the honor to which she aspired . It is now evident that in a considerable degree the triumphs of the managers of the exhibition are due to the rancor that preceded and even followed the selection of Chicago as the exposition city . These shrewd officials may be in some measure unconscious of the fact , yet , in many remarks and arguments , they make it evident to me that in taking hold of the gigantic enterprise they bind themselves to disappoint their rivals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would belittle her opportunity by seeking to make only local capital , and would shock the cultivated taste of the nation by producing a crude and clumsy fair , lacking those elegances and luxurious attributes of ornament and finish which rendered the last Paris Exposition the wonder of the civilized world . I am not likely to be contradicted if I assert that the unkindly comparisons into which the Paris Fair of 1889 was constantly forced resulted in the establishment of the Parisian standard as the model that Chicago was to surpass at all hazards . To say this is to ascribe to Chicago qualities of which any city might be proud , for in her conduct she has shown that true and wholesome pride which is never found apart from modesty , and with these traits she has exhibited a clear consciousness of her strength to repress every weakness with which she has been unfairly credited . At the moment when this is being prepared for the press , the greater part of the fair tract in Jackson Park is onethird enclosed by the waters of Lake Michigan and two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enclosure is to be witnessed a scene of extraordinary activity . Close at hand , as one approaches the site from the city , the second story of the Woman 's Building already rises above the greenery , and as far as the eye can comprehend the scene the view is dotted with other white forests and thickets of new timber , marking the foundations and framework of the great buildings that the Commissioners are to erect as the nucleus and glory of the fair . Even through the disorder of such a field , wherein thousands of laborers and carpenters are at work , and where the surface of the ground is receiving no care , it is apparent that the site is well chosen , and that the grounds are capable of conversion into the unique and really extraordinary park of palaces which the managers have planned . It was a marsh when work upon it was begun , a sopping combination of low lands , water , and hummocks ; but the once uncertain beach is already a beautiful slope of neatly ordered stonework edged with sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white concrete , forming as noble a water-side way as can be pictured by the mind . Beyond this costly promenade the field is divided into promontories and islands , among which have been led beautiful sheets of water , in the form of lagoons , canals , basins , and straits . It is the water of the Great Lakes , and has the translucent quality of pure crystal . This , it must be remembered , is the character of the site for the ten or eleven principal buildings to be erected by the Commission in what is now the distant part of Jackson Park . But adjoining this is the older portion of the park , long ago in use as a finished part of the superb park system of Chicago . A large pond embellishes this section , and upon // the undulating ground around the pool are meadows , groves , and winding roads . This land is to form the site of the buildings of those foreign governments that are to participate in the exposition . Mexico has already selected the foremost plat close against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy . The two sections are to be thrown together , the great pond is to be connected with the lagoon system of the fair ground , and the finished site will include both grounds . Standing upon the broad , trim , artificial beach beside the blue and green expanse of Lake Michigan , I found it difficult to free what I saw from what , after a week 's study of the official plans , I knew must soon take the place of the disorder around me . After such a study , and with some of the officials of the exposition discussing the future in my hearing , it was easy to enjoy a prophetic view of the great park as it would appear after the exposition opened-almost as easy to comprehend and far more interesting than the actual scene . Already the unfinished model of a modern cruiser lay before me at the edge of Lake Michigan , and afar off the foundations of the almost fairylike Casino Pier fretted the surface of the great lake . I fancied myself on a barge approaching the gaudy wharf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful tower above them . The mind 's eye showed the pier joining the long expanse of artificial beach at a point in front of a beautiful emerald lagoon that lay between the palace of agriculture and the almost inconceivably vast building for Manufactures and Liberal Arts . Rising from the lagoon was the colossal yet graceful figure of Columbia , seen through the spaces in an impressive line of separate granite columns , whose capitals will bear figures displaying the arms of the States . The great building showed a general tone of darkened ivory or slightly smoked meerschaum , an effect produced by the " staff " or stucco composition with which the exterior walls are to be covered . All the exterior walls of all the buildings will be of this material , and the buildings themselves will therefore be rather architectural models than durable structures . Wherever great arches support heavy roofs or span wide openings between walls , the trusses will be of iron , but in Vot . LxxxIv. - xo. 500. - 19 mosi* cases the walls or frames will be of timber . But though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of enriched ivory , each view of every structure presents a more or less brilliant array of colors , the differing hues being seen wherever the walls are broken , as an the arcades , porticos , corridors , pavilions , and galleries , which relieve and ornament most of the edifices . For instance while still looking down the lagoon that is ornamented by the St. Gaudens chefd'ceuvre of statues and columns , the eye is taken captive by the brilliant golden dome of the Administration Building . Statuary , banners , gorgeous panels , medallions , and colonnades , all harmoniously blended , make this the most striking and one of the most admired of the works of the architects . Robert M. Hunt , of New York , is its designer . The beautiful waters of the system of lagoons pass every one of the main buildings , and all but surround some of them . On their surfaces all the palaces will be reflected , and at night the water will duplicate the full brilliancy of this , the second of the world 's expositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ifself , by-the-way , will be shot with brilliant light by scores of electric lamps placed in its depths . A hundred gondolas brought from Venice will loaf luxuriously along these liquid avenues , to be distanced contemptuously by a myriad of swift launches . Their motions on the water 's surface will but weakly imitate the fast-gliding artificial denizens of the deep which skilled electricians plan to send hither and thither by means of delicate machinery urged by power stored in the bodies of the toys . At night , when the eyes of these submarine monsters and beauties are lighted by electricity , they will add a strange feature to the general spectacle . Beside the gorgeous Administration Building , on the one hand , is the Machinery Hall , designed by Messrs . Peabody and Stearns , of Boston . It is a beautiful and imposing palace , and is connected artistically with the building for agriculture by means of a colonnade surrounding one end of a great canal . Messrs . McKim , Mead , and White , of New York , designed the Agricultural Building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above 800 feet long , and // the Machinery Building has an annex 550 feet in length , so that the roofs of these two buildings and their connections cover an unbroken length of 2400 feet . The Machinery Building will be constructed as if three great railway depots or train sheds were placed side by side , and it is the purpose of the Columbian Corporation to sell these parts for such uses after the fair closes . The managers expect to realize a salvage of at least three million dollars on the material used in the various structures , and they boast that they have already saved a million dollars on what was considered a careful preliminary estimate of the cost of the buildings . But to return to the view . Down the canal that half divides these buildings , the Electricity and Mining houses are reached . The Electrical Building ( designed by Van Brunt and Howe , of Kansas City ) is most unique , and besides being decorated by many towers , has a grand entrance that rises a story higher than the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will seem ablaze with light as if it were a colossal lantern . Beyond this building is the principal lagoon , from whose surface rises what is known as the Wooded Island . This island is many acres in extent , and is designed to remain bare of everything except flowers , trees , and paths , in order that it may furnish throughout the exposition a cool and alluring retreat for tired visitors . Behind this great lagoon are the Transportation , Horticultural , and Woman 's buildings , at the further end is the Illinois Building , and on the side between the lagoon and Lake Michigan are the Fisheries and United States Government buildings , all costly , extensive , and elaborate examples of the skill of the most gifted American architects . One buiding that has not yet been mentioned receives , perhaps , the highest praise . It is the Art Building , and will stand beyond the lake that is now in the old part of Jackson Park . Its designer is Mr. Atwood , of New York . Beyond the Art Building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid its groves and around its picturesque lake , are to be the seats of the foreign governments that participate in the fair . The domes and the towers of these still undetermined buildings will doubtless reach far down what is called Midway Plaisance , a parkway connecting Washington and Jackson parks . Down this plaisance , now a broad bowery boulevard , will also be gathered many of the lesser aI*tractions of the fair , not all of them wholly disconnected with private enterprise or the showman 's profession . Thus has been arranged the greatest of world 's expositions . The field laid out embraces 640 acres , and 400 acres adjoining this are available if needed . The floor space already provided for is equal to 400 acres , or more , it is said , than the entire ground utilized in any other exposition . The park is seven miles from the Chicago City Hall , but it is to be connected with the city by all of the great steam railroads that enter Chicago , by the cablecar lines and stages , by the lake boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the exposition ground connection between all the points of interest may be had both by land and waterby donkey-back , jinrikisha , bus , gondola , launch or skiff , and , perhaps , by a marvellous overhead travelling sidewalk . A trial bit of this is now undergoing construction by its sponsor in order to demonstrate its feasibility . Apparently the entire distribution of leadership and command has been characterized by as liberal a spirit as that which led Mr. D. H. Burnham , of Chicago , the Chief of the Bureau of Construction , to cluster the architectural genius of the country around him as he did . The architects in question are : Robert M. Hunt , of New York ; W. L. B. Jenny , of Chicago ; MeKim , Mead , and White , of New York ; Adler and Sullivan , of Chicago ; George B. Post , of New York ; Henry Ives Cobb , of Chicago ; Burling and Whitehouse , of Chicago ; Peabody and Stearns , of Boston ; S. S. Beman , of Chicago ; and Van Brunt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toward the same end of conducting a thoroughly national enterprise , Director - General George R. Davis has divided his work into fifteen branches , constituted each branch a department , and then sought men of national fame and acknowledged ability to take charge of these divisions . The Bureau of Agriculture has been put in the hands of Mr. W. I. Buchanan , a remarkable organizer and student of the interests of the agricultural class , and hero of the famous // Sioux City Corn Palace Exhibition . His plans for the agricultural exhibit are exceedingly broad , and are perfected to the minutest detail , so that the Western men at least feel certain that his will be as complete a display as can possibly be made . The Department of Ethnology is in charge of Professor F. W. Putnam , of Harvard , who has sent to South America naval and military officers , many of whom are specialists outside of their professions and whose business it will be to scour South America to secure a representative exhibit . The past and present methods of living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models provided by the gentlemen who have selected the objects after consulting wellinformed persons from those countries . The representation of lake dwellings from Venezuela is spoken of as likely to be more marvellous than the examples of the same study that will be sent here from Europe . The results from Patagoiila , Alaska , Greenland , Finland , and Iceland will all be notable . The bureau has in Africa an officer of the navy who is in correspondence with Tippu-Tib for fifteen pygmies . The Department of Fish and Fisheries is in charge of Captain J. W. Collins , of the United States Commission . He will exhibit an aquarium stocked with both salt and fresh water fish , and will present casts of all the known species of fish , together with a valuable presentation of the fauna and flora of the ocean . He will also exhibit the different modes of and appliances for fishing , both ancient and modern . Either here or elsewhere in the fair will be given graphic expositions of the work at the seal-fisheries of Alaska . The Department of Mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skiff , of Colorado , a man thoroughly familiar with the mining business , who proposes to have the department illustrated by workingmines if possible . This is the first international exhibition in which a separate building has been provided for this industry . The Department of Liberal Arts , comprehending a greater variety of exhibits than any other department , is in charge of Professor S. H. Peabody . It was offered to Professor John Gilman , of Johns Hopkins University , but he was unable to accept the trust . The Department of Machinery is in charge of Mr. L. W. Robinson , who was first assistant in charge of the Machinery Hall at the Philadelphia Exposition . The Columbian Fair will gain distinction from having at its service steam of the power of twentyfour thousand horses . It is said that the greatest of the engines which will be shown will dwarf the great Corliss machine exhibited in Philadelphia in 1876 . The Department of Publicity and Promotion is under the chieftainship of Major Moses P. Handy , of Virginia . There was never such a department in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the press work of this exposition is simply a branch of the work of promotion which is carried on both at home and abroad , and , as elaborated by Major Handy , is so formidable that his mailing department alone ranks by the bulk of its business with some of the most important second-class post-offices of the country . The Department of Fine Arts is in charge of Mr. Halsey C. Ives , of Missouri , who built up the great art school in St. Louis . He is now abroad , visiting every country in Europe , talking with artists , inspecting famed galleries , and arranging for the exhibition of pictures by loan and otherwise . While in Paris Major Handy met M. Prust , who had charge of the art department of the Paris Exposition , and who gave his word that France , which can contribute so much toward a successful art display , will do its best for this one . Sir Philip Cunliffe-Owen and Sir Henry Wood , Secretary of the Royal Society of Art , assured Major Handy that England does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that which the French years ago discovered , that America has become the greatest and most profitable field for the disposal of the best products of the Old World studios . In addition to the half-million-dollar Art Building on the fair grounds , it is proposed , aside from the exposition entirely , to build in Chicago a noble and permanent art palace . The money has been raised , and those concerned in the project hope to secure for the new museum many of the finest works exhibited at the exposition . Mr. James W. Allison , of Ohio , is in charge of the Department of Manufactures . He is noted for having conducted in Cincinnati the most successful local exposition in this country . His department // and the departments of Ethnology and the Liberal Arts will exhibit in the huge Palace of Manufactures . In view of the extraordinary competition among the great electrical combinations , it was a delicate and difficult task to secure for chief of the Electrical Department a person not connected with any interest , yet acceptable to all . Professor J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest hopes are based on the exhibition he will arrange . Mr. Thomas A. Edison is greatly interested in this department , and will aid the work in it in other ways than by contributing to it his newest marvel , upon the completion of which he is engaged . It is promised that the electrical theatre and ballet in Vienna will form part of our exposition . That is a marvellous showing of the service that can be rendered to the theatrical profession by electricity , especially in the production of scenic and spectacular effects . The Department of Horticulture is in charge of Professor J. M. Samuels , of Kentucky ; and that of Floriculture is beaded by Mr. John Thorpe , of New York . Already the growth of plants for the great exhibition is under way in a house on the Midway Plaisance . Ten acres on Wooded Island will be planted with flowers , and the entire out-door display will include wild and aquatic flowers as well as the cultivated varieties . The government exhibits will be uncommonly fine , and are to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display , aboard a brick model of a cruiser , will be exceptionally finethe exhibition being shown in the space which on a real ship would be given up to machinery and arms . The Post-office Department exhibit will show the progress of the postal system , especially in the methods of transporting and distributing mail . It will include an illustrated history of our postage-stamps . England will send illustrations of her postal department in connection with the working of the postal telegraph system . Mr. Willard A. Smith , Chief of the Bureau of Transportation , will make a collection demonstrating the development of the methods of traffic and travel from the use of the goat-cart and the dugout to that of the hotel car and transatlantic flyers of to-day . Mr. Walker Fearn , of Louisiana , head of the Department of Foreign Affairs , was our Minister to Greece under President Cleveland . His bureau will grow more and more useful and busy as it follows and directs the plans of the foreign governments that will join in the display . Uncommon interest has from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most notable feature of the great fair . It was fortunately placed under the charge of Mrs. Potter Palmer . She is a society leader in Chicago , where it is proudly boasted that she would grace any court . She is the possessor of great wealth , and was wholly unacquainted with public affairs before she undertook this charge , and yet she has taken hold of the Woman 's Department as of something by the conduct of which she may crown her life , and in doing so has shown the most marked executive ability . In choosing a plan for its building , the Woman 's Department has copied one of the most admirable designs made for the exposition . The architect who drew the design is Miss Sophia G. Hayden , of Boston . Mrs. Palmer has planned a treasury of objects illustrative of woman 's work . The exhibit will embrace a model kitchen , a modern cr*clie , a kindergarten and hospital with trained nurses , a notable exhibition of books written by women , periodicals edited and published by women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . It is curious to read in Western papers that Mrs. Palmer is of Southern birth and the wife of a Democrat . The reason for so unexpected a reference to a lady lies in the fact that originally it had been charged that the Columbian Exposition was to be a partisan Republican institution . It is unnecessary to further the discussion here . The chiefs of the two governing bodies  --  the National and State directories - are men of both parties , and the work of planning and perfecting the exposition has avowedly and apparently been apportioned to men chosen for their experience and ability , regardless of their political faith . The long list of officials composing both the national committee and the Illinois organization has been printed many times . The president of the government commission is Senator Thomas W. Palmer , of Michigan ; the secretary is Mr. John T. Dickinson , of Texas ; and the Director-General , by far the most active man on either board , is General George // H. Davis , of Illinois . The president of the local or Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Chicago Board of Trade ; Mr. Thomas B. Bryan is vice-president of the Illinois organization , for which the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth is solicitor-general and secretary ; the treasurer is Anthony Ii ' . Seeberger ; and the auditor is William K. Ackerman . Over in what has long been an important part of Jackson Park , on the lake front , but nearer to the city than where the greater buildings are to be located , is the ground set apart for the headquarters of foreign countries . Exposition officials are in the habit of calculating that the other countries of the globe will add about three millions of dollars to the amount expended at the fair . If the foreigners spend three millions , and the various States of the Union lay out five millions , as they are expected to do , the total expenditure for the fair will amount to about twenty-six millions of dollars . It is evident that there will be massed together in the foreign quarter a very gaudy , impressive , and unfamiliar jumble of picturesque and peculiar structures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main grounds . We know that with part of Mexico 's three-fourths of a million of dollars she will erect a fac-simile of an Aztec palace ; Guatemala will put up , out of her $120,000 , a model of a palace that distinguishes her ruined city of Antigua ; Colombia , which has appropriated 100,000 , will reproduce her splendid capitol ; Ecuador , which has allotted $125,000 for all her expenses , will again show , as she did in Paris , a copy of her Temple of the Sun ; Brazil will make a magnificent contribution , at a cost of at least half a million of dollars . Around the beautiful palace which she will erect will be gathered lesser buildings illustrative of the habits and industries of her people-huts with native inhabitants , a sugar-mill , and coffee planter 's outfit . Glimpses of the rubber industry will be among the additional exhibits . Brazil 's most famous band will be sent here also , perhaps to compete with the band of the Coldstream Guards of England , and certainly to blend its melody with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead , and with the music of the thousands of choral singers to be trained by Professor 211 Tomlins . Almost all the South American countries , even the smallest , and even the colonial islands off the Atlantic coast , have signified their intention to present themselves at the fair . At this date , a year from the celebration of the Columbus festival , it is becoming more and more apparent that what seemed to be an unwarranted liberality in the projected extent of the fair grounds will still leave the Commission hampered for room . The battle will be to economize space , and already skirmishes to protect the necessary beauty spots , like Wooded Island , are of daily occurrence . The Europeans , who never held an exposition covering half the area of this one , are insisting upon allotments that would have been out of the question at Paris or Vienna . England and Germany , for instance , will not be satisfied with less than 120,000 square feet of ground . It is the enthusiasm of their commissioners which leads to J*his demand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair will result in the grandest exhibitions their countries have ever made . It is perfectly apparent that France will not ask a jot less than these neighbors . England 's main building will be a reproduction of some notable manor-house , like Hatfield ( Lord Salisbury 's country place ) , or Sandringham perhaps . The idea will he to illustrate typical English architecture . A model English garden will be attached to the great house , and a fine feature of the building will be a spacious hall filled with armor and hung with pictures , and to be used for receptions and ceremonial purposes . England will appropriate ? 27,000 for her use at the exposition . Herr Wermuth , the German commissioner , who came to Chicago in September last with Sir Henry Wood of England , was less explicit with regard to Germany 's intentions . He said he thought his nation would select for its headquarters some typical ancient German building ; and he added , after speaking enthusiastically of the exposition grounds and buildings , that ours would be the grandest fair ever held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement of that degree of success . It is too early to discuss more fully the part that the foreign governments will take in the exposition . This is peculiarly disappointing , because there seems no doubt that many great countries will // surpass all their former efforts at international exhibitions . Major Moses P. Handy , one of the commissioners who went abroad last winter , says that their errand proved most wise and fruitful . It was thought advisable for some of the officials of the fair to put themselves in evidence in the old countries to answer questions , and to induce the more tardy governments to move toward participation in the display . In most cases it was only necessary to see the heads of such governments , but in Switzerland the rule was reversed , and there popular sympathy with the project needed to be aroused by public meetings . Switzerland was nearer to having done nothing than any other country , but owing to the formal visit of the commissioners the ancient republic is now earnestly interested in making a praiseworthy appearance at Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs of each government , and to urge that a more than perfunctory in*terest be taken in the project . In Sweden and Denmark the kings were seen , but in the majority of the countries visited our ministers presented the visitors to the foreign ministers of each court , and by these statesmen the Americans were introduced to those cabinet officials in whose departments the matter came . The leading statesmen of England , France , Germany , Switzerland , Holland , Belgium , Austria , Norway , Sweden , Denmark , and Russia were thus induced to interest themselves in our fair . In each country great success attended the visit of the commissioners . It is known that there will be sent from India all that is needed to picture life in an East Indian village . Turkey , reluctant to bear the expense herself , has authorized private individuals to construct a realistic reproduction of a Turkish street , probably of shops , and showing not only the wares peculiar to the country , but her mechanics , artisans , and professional entertainers . Egypt will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her people than that which was demonstrated by the famous Rue de Caire in the Paris Exposition . This exhibit will also take the form of a street . It will be four hundred feet long , and lined with shops , cafes , dwellings , and amusement halls . It will be peopled with donkey-drivers , Egyptian serving - maids , dancing - girls , jugglers , merchants , women , and children . Japan will spend half a million dollars in reproducing what is most picturesque and effective in her architecture and in scenes from her home life ; while China , exhibiting with governmental sanction for the first time , will add a notable feature of the fair . Persia also promises what will prove a glistening drop in the colossal bucket . It is whispered that from many of these foreign countries royalty itself will come in numbers and consequence greater than ever distinguished any universal exhibition since the last effort of imperial France . A dozen kingly and princely visitors are talked of as our possible guests . All and more  --  or none at all-may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . It is even possible that some of the things that are here set down as fixed and certain attractions of the exposition will be changed or omitted . It is certain that a host of inviting features not yet known even to the managers will be added to those here set forth . Allowance should be made by the reader for the uncertainties of so long a look ahead . Our Territories are nerved to make the most of their opportunity by uniting in a combined exhibit under one roof , though perhaps Utah may make a separate exhibition . The most important Territorial contributions will be in the line of mining and mineralogy , but this may not be the most generally interesting . The Territorial delegates will meet this exposition of wonders at the wonder capital in the spirit that is to produce its most amazing results . Mr. Richard Mansfield White , who is a son of the late Richard Grant White , told me when he was in Chicago as commissioner from New Mexico that his Territory will endeavor to emphasize the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florida , is the oldest city in the country . He says that " when the conquistadores entered New Mexico they found in Santa Fe a city already existent , and already so ancient as to have been for hundreds of years a town of the Aztecs , or Toltecs , or whatever people we like to call those who had a civilization of their own centuries before Europeans touched their soil . ' * The so-called palace of Santa Fe is the work of this misty past , and Mr. White hopes to bring part of it to Chicago and the exposition . Mr. White himself is an ideal exponent of the manhood which domi // nates the regions that have not yet reached the dignity of Statehood . He was revelling in the luxury of full evening dress in the palatial Auditorium Hotel , and might easily have been mistaken for a pampered child of the stagnant East , but five minutes ' conversation with him brought out the fact that , though born in New York , he had been for twelve years in the Apache country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , and now a leader among the white men there . He calls himself a Western man , and acknowledges stronger ties in the robust West than those by which birth binds him to the metropolis . An astonishing feature of the Columbian Exposition will be one of the palaces grouped in the heart of the fair grounds . It is the Manufactures Building , designed by Mr. George Post , of New York . It will bear the same relation to this exposition as the Eiffel Tower did to that of Paris in 1889 ; and , ii*deed , its possible use as a vantage-point from which to see the fair grounds has terminated in the negative the discussion for and against the construction in Chicago of a rival to the great tower of Paris . This greatest of all the exposition buildings , and of the buildings of the world , will present to Lake Michigan a facade of such a length as to PLAN OF THE EXPOSITION GROUNDS AND BUILDINGS . // suggest the wall of a city , yet it is so admirably designed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its true extent can only be comprehended when its dimensions are expressed in figures and by comparisons . It is one-third of a mile long , and to compass it round about is to walk a mile . The roof of it is 1688 by 788 feet , and the span of the dome , the largest ever attempted , is 388 feet . The roof is 230 feet from the ground , and the building has 40 acres of ground - floor . Two of the vast machinery halls of the Paris Exposition could be wheeled through it , and the Auditorium , the building of which Chicago is most proud , could be pushed under this great roof , tower and all . But , without any question , the most amazing exhibit at the Fair will be Chicago itself . It will interest every class of visitors . It will offer a tonic and exhilarant to the frivolous , and a subject for profound study to the thoughtful . Let those who go there like it or not , there it will be found  --  a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and masonry . It is so new that a tree which figured in an Indian massacre , at a border fort that marked the city 's beginning , is still standing - a far from ancient-looking object-in the smoke-burdened atmosphere of myriad factories , in the presence of 1,200,000 inhabitants , and in the shadow of an aggregation of buildings taller than the average European ever conceived the Tower of Babel to be . Admire Chicago or criticise it as they may , it will stand to awe and to confuse the men of our own as well as of foreign cities . Young it will be found , but not infantile , for it will display the most palpable monuments of a consummate civilization . It will show a magnificent park system not anywhere excelled , mile upon mile and line upon line of boulevards , magnificent in themselves , and bordered by homes which only vast wealth widely distributed can maintain . It will display splendid public schools , libraries , hospitals , storehouses , galleries , and theatres ; hotels unequalled elsewhere on the globe ; factories whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar in Europe and Canada as in Illinois . But it suffices those who love Chicago best to think that in the preparation she has made for the exposition in 1893 she has recognized the fact that Chicago is to be only one exhibit , and that the aim of the exposition is to reveal the progress of the United States first , and of the world afterward . Chicago 's financial part in the preparation for the exposition should be clear to every one , as it is a matter of public record ; but the people of that city assert that they are misunderstood and misrepresented . All the citizens appear to be agreed upon one explanation of the situation , and it is a very simple story . At the outset 28,000 persons subscribed $6,000,000 . This was to be collected in instalments , and more than $3,000,000 has been collected . Conditionally upon *3,000,000 being collected , the Illinois Legislature authorized the city to issue bonds for a farther contribution of $5,000,000 to the enterprise . The $6,000,000 that were subscribed and the additional $5,000,000 from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city agreed to put up . When the bonds for the $5,000,000 are issued , there will be $3,000,000 of the citizens ' subscription fund to collect . Now as to the national participation in the enterprise . The government appropriation of $1,500,000 has not been touched by the local corporation . It has no more to do with this money than it has with whatever sum Connecticut or Indiana may set apart for defraying the cost of their individual State exhibits . The Federal government appropriation is being used to meet the expenses of the National Commission and for the construction of the government buildings . But there will be made upon Congress a demand for a loan of $5,000,000 , to be secured to the nation out of the gate receipts of the exposition . It is asserted that the necessity for this sum was brought about by the National Commission , which so enlarged the classification lists of exhibits as to greatly widen the projected scope of the exposition , and to make $10 , 000,000 inadequate for the purpose . This National Commission is a supervisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , and placed over the local corporation in authority . The National Commission has recognized its responsibility , and has promised to co-operate with the local corporation in asking for this loan . The request , therefore , will come to the government from its own representatives .
