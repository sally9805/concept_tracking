txt The courageous Mr. Kempner has carried further the independent disposition that he showed when he was the only person who ventured to say boldly in the Democratic caucus , what all the Democrats in the caucus well knew , that MT . EDWARD MURPHY was not fit to be a , Senator . But the other Democrats merely murmured their conviction of MURPHY 'S unfitness in the cocktail glasses at the Delavan House , even as the veridical abut prudent Phrygian confided to the sedges his disloyal belief that Midas was an ass . Ever since his courageous performance Mr. KEMPNER has been considered more hopeful than the ordinary Tammany Assemblyman who goes like the galley slave at night scourged to his dungeon . He yesterday introduced two measure &; that will tend to increase the public confidence in him , while they will also increase the dislike which ho has earned from the political machinists . These bills have the same object , and that is to improve the administration of justice . One proposes to do this by removing the operation of " influence " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishing the number and the emoluments of the Police Justices . The first bill provides that any holder of an elective or appointive office under any City Government who intercedes with the Judge of any Criminal Court in behalf of any accused person , either before , during , or after the trial of such person , shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . It may be that the bill has special reference to the extraordinary experiences which Recorder SM YTEI has lately undergone . The attempt to tamper with a Judge in this manner with respect to matters of which the responsibility rests with him amounts . to a contempt of court . The Recorder has refrained from punishing it as such , in part , doubtless , because the motives of the persons who have tried to influence him were good , and in part , perhaps , because the statutory definition of the offense does not expressly cover such cases . Nevertheless , by the nature of the case , the power to punish for contempt involves a wide and largely an arbitrary discretion . If other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has publicly pointed out the impropriety of such attempts , he would doubtless be sustained by the law , and ho would certainly be sustained by public opinion in punishing them for contempt . But it is likely that Mr. KEMPNER 'S bill has been drawn mainly to put a stop to the practice of office-holding politicians of attempting to bring to bear upon magistrates a " pull " in favor of political dependents . This is a very common practice . If Mr. KEMPN ER ' S bill would put a stop to it , the bill would deserve ; hearty support . But this may seriously be doubted . A Judge or magistrate worthy to hold his place would not listen to such appeals , no matter by how powerful persons they were urged , and would judge every case solely by what was laid before him in open court . But a Judge who is entangled in political alliances with other office holders will be apt to yield to pressure whenever pressure is brought to bear upon him . Those who have power to put pressure upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power from the fear that ho will accuse them of misdemeanor . We doubt if the passage of the bill would do any good . The passage of the second bill , on the other hand , would be an excellent thing . The trouble about that is only to get it enacted . Eight competent Police Justices could do all the work that is now done by fifteen , and eight competent men could be found to do the work , which does nut require the whole time of the magistrate , for $5,000 a year . Perhaps $8,000 is not too much for a competent Police Justice , but now that Justice KILBRETH has been displaced , there is no such magistrate left on the bench . The men who are left would be exceedingly dear at $5,000 , which is more than any one of them could earn in any private business ; and eight of them would be quite as efficient as are fifteen . We wish Mr. KEMPNER better luck than we expect for him with his bill for retrenehment in the police courts .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
