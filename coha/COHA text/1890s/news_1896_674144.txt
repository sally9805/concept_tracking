txt Our Congressional jingoes would do well to lay to heart the effect which their performances have already had in Spain . The rumors of negotiations between our Government and that of Spain concerning Cuba ' have taken a definite enough form to be the subject of comment by the press of Madrid . That comment is without exception hostile to us and to our pretension to have anything whatever to say in the matter . One journal declares that if the Government tolerates the intervention of the United States the nation will repudiate it . Another thinks that Spain might perhaps listen to a suggestion from some European power of according to Cuba all the rights of local self-government that are compatible with Spanish sovereignty , " but never to the suggestion of the United States . " Of course , we must all understand this state a mind , and even in a manner sympathize with it , no matter how sincerely we may sympathize with the Cuban cause . Spain has no cause of complaint with our executive Government , which has observed the strictest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with Cuba . Our international duties have been punctually fulfilled . But Spain resents the behavior of the jingoes in Congress , who have been passing ridiculous resolutions on the subject without adducing any evidence , - Winding up with the ridiculous but - to a Spaniard infuriating proposition of CALL that we should send some men-of-war to the Cuban coast with instructions to find out Whether the war is conducted in a Christian spirit , and to open fire on the Spaniards if they find that the belligerent proprieties are exceeded .

They are men , that is to say , Who in Spain or any other European country would weigh their words and speak under some sense of responsibility and with some respect to national susceptibilities when they were discussing international questions Which might have grave issues .
