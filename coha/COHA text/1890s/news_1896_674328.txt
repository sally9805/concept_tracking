Abbey as a stock company theatre under the name of Wallack 's . The season was a failure , and in the Spring of 1888 , the famous Wallack company was disbanded forever . In the Fall of 1888 the name of the house was changed to Palmer 's . Mr. Palmer was then manager of the Madison Square Theatre . ( now Hoyt 's , ) where he maintained a good stock company . His avowed plan of establishing this company at Palmer 's permanently was never carried out , perhaps because of the scarcity of good plays , but Mr. Palmer 's company fl/led several long engagements there . The first performances after his name had displaced Wallack 's , in October , 1888 , were given by Coquelin , Jane Hading. , and a French company .

Mr. Palmer has charged $3,000 per week , including light , heat , orchestra , and attendance . The theatre was built by Theodore Moss in Lester Wallack 's name , and opened in January , 1882 , as Wallack 's , when the name of the old theatre at Broadway and Thir ' teenth Street was changed to the Star , AS Wallack 's it was generally unprofitable . AS Palmer 's , in spite of the many fine productions there , it has not lately been successful . Mr. Palmer opened the Great Northern Theatre , in Chicago , Nov. 9 , and established a stock company there .                @ @ @ @ @
