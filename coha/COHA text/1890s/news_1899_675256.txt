txt It would indeed be singular if the Dreyfus case should be the indirect cause of a more enlightened and just criminal procedure in England . Such an event seems by no means improbable . England has no Court of Criminal Appeal . La Patrie of Paris , taking the Maybrick case as its theme , taunts her with the fact . Theoretically , France , with her Com ' de Cassation , is more able to correct an error of justice than England , where there is no remedy for unjust convictions in criminal cases save the intervention of the Home Secretary . Several years ago Sir HENRY SA VMS , before he became Lord JAMES or Hereford , agitated the need of a Court of Criminal Appeal , and a committee was appointed in the House of Commons to look into the matter . Nothing came of it , however , and now the London journalists who have taunted France about the Dreyfus case find it somewhat difficult to reply to the taunt 01 La .. Patrie . At any rate , the agitation for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is evidence of a strong reeling in the legal profession fa , - voring such a court . Although the point of La Petrie is well taken . its attempt to hold up the Dreyfus case before the eyes of Englishmen as a rebuke to their criticisms of French procedure is ridiculous . The , scorn that has been turned upon France was provoked because the rights of the individual were made inferior to State policy , to a certain institution , . even to the prejudice of party and of race . According to AngloSaxon law the rights of the individual are deemed superior to State policy . Our courts even assert their privilege to control acts of government ending to deprive the individual of his rights . In - France and in other Continental countries the individual must ultimately look to the Government for protection ; in the United States and in England he appeals to the courts . Had not the French Government first set in motion the Cour de Cassation DREYFUS could have had ' no possible legal redress . This is the distinction that the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has nothing to do with the fact that England has no Court of Criminal Appeal . English procedure is based upon the presumption that the law can do no wrong . The right of pardon was hence defined as an act of mercy , of grace , of forgiveness . But the evolution of human progress has shown that juries are liable to make mistakes ; that the rulings and charges of Judges , while uttered in strict accordance with the law , are quite capable of being based on a misconception of facts . A broader conception of true justice has thus caused the pardon in certain cases to become simply an act to remedy an error of justice . The victim is released by what is technically an " act of mercy , " when he should be rehabilitated by legal procedure . A Dreyfus in an English prison can only appeal for mercy to the Home Secretary . Mrs. MAYBRICK , innocent or guilty , can hope for nothing but a gracious pardon . Thus it is incumbent on the Home Secretary not only to sit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge questions of fact and law as well . In the latter function of his office he is asked to remedy an error alleged to have been committed in a competent court of law . It is inconceivable that his judgment may not sometimes err . But the most obvious fault in the English system , and one that is fully recognized in the legal profession , is the anomaly that exists not only in criminal procedure itself , but between criminal courts and other courts . Criminals tried before different Judges and juries for the same kind of crime may receive varying sentences . One man may be condemned to six months ' imprisonment for an offense for which another man receives a sentence of five years . The respective judgments are final , as there is no court to which to appeal . While appeals may be made from judgments in every civil court  --  in the Admiralty Court , the Divorce Court , the Bankruptcy Court , the Ecclesiastical Courts  --  the defendant in a criminal case is denied this privilege . It is obvious that an absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man charged with obtaining money under false pretenses is convicted in a criminal court . A suit is brought in a civil court to compel him to return the money . Here , should the verdict be against him , he has the fullest right to apply to the Court of Appeal for a new trial . Suppose that , owing to newly obtained facts , a second trial is granted . It favors the defendant . His innocence is clearly established . But he can only obtain relief from the criminal sentence through an act of grace administered on the recommendation of the Home Secretary . The legal profession in England , recognizing that what is justice in one court should be justice in another , has begun a campaign in favor of a Court of Criminal Appeal . It is hard to see what reasonable objections can be raised against the establishment of such a court . When the question again comes before the House of Commons , as it inevitably will , the debates will be followed with the keenest interest       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
