txt It is easier to understand the President 's offer of the vacant Cabinet place to Mr. ELIRU ROOT than it is to understand Mr. RooT 's acceptance . The President might think himself fortunate indeed to have this able , clear-headed lawyer , broad of view and sound of judgment , always within call for Cabinet meeting or midnight conference . He has no experienced statesman in his official council . Probably he gets as good advice from Mr. HAY as from any member of his Cabinet , but Mr. HAY is practically new to public affairs . A man of Mr. ROOT 'S strength will strengthen President MCKINLEY . He can take his ear from the ground more frequently and reach conclusions in matters of policy with greater celerity and confidence when such a counselor sits at his elbow . All this explains the appointment . The acceptance must he explained , we suppose , on the theory that Mr. RooT , as a man of high patriotism and devoted to the interests of his party and to its chief , did not feel at liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his case is , of course , a heavy one , for the compensation which this generous Republic bestows upon its Secretary of War might be deducted entire from the annual earnings of a New York lawyer at or near the head of the bar without causing a serious diminishment , but when offered as a substitute seems , even with the honor added , far from tempting . It is fortunate that our Presidents are able to find so many men of high capacity in private life who put out of their minds the financial aspects of the summons to office . Mr. ROOT is of this patriotic temper , and it is much to his credit that he is . Although quite untried in executive work , no man who knows Mr. ELIIII7 ROOT 'S abilities and characteristics will have any misgivings as to his success in the post where his predecessor exhibited such a total want of it . We doubt whether he will undo the damage and demoralization in the department due to ALGER 'S influence as quickly or as thoroughly as a military man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been much in politics , but enough probably to soften his heart to the appeals of the bigger men of the machines . It takes a man of adamant to resist them . So many civilians have held and succesfully administered the office of Secretary of War that the country no longer expects to see a soldier in the place . If it did expect to see one appointed to this vacancy , it was because of the unsatisfactory nature of our situation in the Philippines , where there appears to be need of a dash of military genius to put an end to a very disagreeable little war . It has been said that the President wished to have a sound lawyer in the War Department , on account of the new and difficult problems that confront him in the administration of our dependent possessions . They are at present under military government , a situation which might suggest the need of a legal mind at the head of the department . But the President has one official law adviser already . It is surely a reflection on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ALGER 'S Place because of his learning in the law . It was the service of a trained and sagacious mind , a cool and sure judgment . . n.:111 a wise counselor , not at law but in politics and policies , we imagine , that Mr. MCKINLEY sought in Mr , ROOT . He will not be disappointed . The new Secretary is certainly loan-. nate in his opportunity . Under ALGER the War Department was the scandal and disgrace of the Administration . In the work of rebuilding , in extirpating abuses , in restoring the efficiency of the bureau forces , in weeding out the incompetents who have come in through favoritism and the abuses of patronage , and in putting the department in a position where it will once more have the confidence of the President and of the people Secretary RooT can win honor and lasting distinction . It was a high compliment to him to be asked to help the Administration where it is in sorest need of help .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
