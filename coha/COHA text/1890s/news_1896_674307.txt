txt When E. R. Chapman of Moore &; Schley learned through Senator Brice yesterday some facts about the political situation in the Middle Western States he said he would bet $500,000 , or any part of it , that the Democrats would not carry a State east of the Mississippi Itiver or north of the Ohio . Mr. Chapman has also a similar amount to bet that will carry Kentucky . The report communicated to Mr. Chapman was made by one of the leading officials of the United States Senate , whose ability for accurately sizing up political sentiment is valued by not only the Democratic but the Republican members of the Senate . He lives in the Middle West , and is thoroughly familiar with the politics of that section . He was commissioned by Senator Gorman and other Popocratic Senators to make this investigation . He returned yesterday from a ten days ' inquiry . " In my opinion , " said he , " Cook County , which is really Chicago , would give 100,000 votes if the election was held to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can , and I do n't believe I could overestimate the strength of the enemy , but at the same time it is rank folly to deceive one 's self . " I have gone about this work in as methodical and thorough a manner as it is possible for one man , and hope as much as I may , I can see no prospect of earring Illinois , and without that State Bryan can not be elected . Stronger in Ohio than in Illinois . " Really , I believe that if anything , Bryan is stronger in Ohio than in Illinois . The real battle ground is in Chicago . According to the most favorable canvass for Bryan in Illinois , made by the Democratic State Committee , Bryan will have 30,000 plurality outside of Cook County . Not even the most sanguaina of the Bryan managers believes that he can more than break even in Chicago , should he have the benefit of a political cyclone . His only hope is that the Republican majority in Cook County will be small . It is generally admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago than Bryan . I met a number who are for , but who will vote for Altgeld . " " In what way did you conduct your investigation in Chicago ? " " Well I learned what both sides are ? doing through their organizations . A more perfect political machine was never constructed than the one the Republicans have . Where they used to make one house-tohouse canvass , they are now making twenty . Our people have no money to speak of , and can not carry out such thorough work , or anything approaching that of our opponents . " I also talked to all classes of people , particularly those who work hard for their living . As is well known , there is a local pride in Chicago that is not equalled anywhere else . The city has experienced very hard lines since the World 's Fair , while her hated rival , St. Louis , has been comparatively prosperous . Unlike St. Louis , Chicago has been built up by Eastern capital . The Chicagoans think that if is elected Eastern capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there will be another boom , while if Bryan is elected that capital would certainly remain at home . Tne average Chicago man is for his city first and the rest of the country afterward . Probabilities in Indiana . " The chances in Indiana are much better for Bryan than in Illinois . There are no large cities in the former State . Still , I believe that the influence of Illinois will carry Indiana with it . I believe , though , that the silver sentiment in the Middle West is growing , particularly among the farmers , and if we had six weeks longer there might be a chance for Bryan . Of course Bryan will end the campaign in Illinois , and he will probably do some good , but the odds against him are too great for him to change the result . " WHO IS COLLECTING FUNDS ? A Question Raised over Chairman Hackett 's Letter . " Who is collecting the campaign funds for the Republicans in New-York City ? " This question waS asked last night by some of the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing it . One member of the County Committee said there was an agreement that all the funds for this city should come from Mr. Hanna 's committee . This was to make it easy for contributors and prevent all the organizations from assessing them . The cause of the comment was a letter which Chairman Hackett of the State Cornmittee sent out two or three days ago , asking for cash . This fell into the hands both of the National and the New-York County Committee yesterday . It read thus : " The political campaign of 1896 is one of the utmost importance to the people of this State . The financial honor of the Nation is at stake and no community is more interested in maintaining our National credit than the citizens of New-York , both working men and merchants . This must be a campaign of education . Most thorough and effective organization is necessary for complete success . The present contest brings the Nation face to face with perhaps the greatest crisis in its history . The friends of honest money are therefore called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should be pleased to received a contribution from you . Yours respectfully , " CHARLES W. HACKETT , Chairman . " The County Committee has been making no collections this year , it was said last night . Whenever it has needed cash , application has been made to Chairman Hackett of the State Committee , and he has secured it from the National Committee , as some members of the County Committee understand it . They were fearful that the National Committee would shut off the supply as soon as it was known that the State organization was collecting for itself . At State headquarters it was said that Mr. Hackett 's letter was sent only to small contributors who would not be reached by Mr. Hanna 's committee . There was no agreement that the State Committee would not secure funds on its own hook , it was said . Executive Chairman Odell laughed at the idea that the letter was a violation of any agreement . The rule that all funds for use in the campaign in New-York should come through the County Committee , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some campaign managers have secured help direct from the National Committee . Some of the Assembly District Committees have been raising campaign funds of their own . " Mr. Platt would never agree to let Mr. Hanna have exclusive control of raising the funds in this county so long as Cornelius N. Bliss is Mr. Hanna 's Treasurer , " was one comment on the situation .
