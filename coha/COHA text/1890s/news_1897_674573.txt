txt A. fire , which for a time it was feared might be accompanied by considerable loss of life , broke out at 5 o'clock this afternoon in the blowing room of the hat factory of William Reed &; Co. , on the lower floor of the Shethar Building , on Elm Street . Two large gas meters exploded immediately after the flames first burst forth . The escaping gas from the meters fed the flames . Within a few minutes the fire was breaking through the windows of the first and second stories . The gas carried the fire rapidly through the section of the building nearest to the spot where it started . The alarm was given by the engineer of the factory almost as soon as the fire broke out . The big whistle of the factory was opened , and the long , steady blow told the operatives of Reed &; Co. and other firms in the building what the trouble was . There were about 600 men and girls in the building at the time . The second story of the building was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor was the Yonkers silk factory , of which George B. Skinner is the agent . The fourth floor was used for storage , and on the fifth floor was the silk factory of Pass Brothers . The building extended along Elm Street about 300 feet . It was built of brick . On the side of the building furthest from the street the fire escapes were situated . The stairways and elevator shaft acted as suction ways for the flames , and through these the fire quickly communicated to the upper floors . As soon as the alarm was sounded the operatives on every floor made a rush for the stairways , but the smoke which rushed up these caused them to turn back and make for the fire escapes . In a minute these were overcrowded . No one had time to save anything , and the operatives lost all their street clothing . The escape of the employes was retarded by the fact that the fire escapes were unprovided with ladders reaching from the second floor to the ground . The ladder used for this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be lifted to its place . When it wag found necessary to take to the fire escapes the word was passed to let the girls go first . The result was that the ladders and landings were crowded with girls from the fifth to the second floors before a man attempted to leave the building . When the girls reached the landing at the second floor and found there were no means of going further except by jumping , for they could not manage the ladder , they stopped . This caused great excitement , and some of the girls became hysterical At this juncture a man employed in Pass Brothers ' works went out upon the escapes , and , swinging hi , mself around to the outer . side of the ladders , went down the three stories hand over hand . He reached the last landing , and there unfastened the ladder which reached the ground , and by a superb exhibition of strength placed it in position with one hand While he hung suspended by the other . By this.time , the fire had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breaking from the windows about the escape . The girls descended amid smoke and sparks . One girl who was a cripple was ' carried down by two men . Then the male operatives escaped down the iron ladders , which were now beginning to get hot from the fire inside the building . The operatives on the lower floors escaped somewhat more easily than those who were at work above , but the building was vacated not a moment too soon . Ten minutes after the first sign of fire the entire interior was a mass of flames , and they were bursting from every window and the roof . Within a short time the twenty fire companies of the city were at work . Streams of water were poured into the building from three sides , but seemed to have little or no effect . The fire soon ate through the floors , which were weighted with heavy machinery and stock , and they collapsed . This left nothing but the shell of the building , as the roof soon folloWed the floors in the fall to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little warning , and the firemen had to abandon their hose and run for their lives . The bricks scattered all around the last men to get away , but no one was hurt . The heat from the fire was so intense that the firemen were driven back time and again . The big crowd which had gathered was also driven Back . There was a high east wind blowing , and this carried the ? flames to the building occupied by Rowland Brothers as a hat factory . Despite the resistance made by the firemen , this building was gutted . The brewery of Jackson &; Co. was in danger for a time . Across the street from the building in which the fire started were the works of Alexander Smith &; Sons , the largest carpet manufacturers in the country . These were saved by a. change in the direction of the wind . Two thousand persons were at work there . During the progress of the fire the battery of four boilers in the cellar of the hat factory exploded and hurled burning embers and bricks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $60,000 . Rowland Brothers , Pass Brothers , and the Yonkers Silk Company are set down for $50,000 each , The loss on the two buildings totally destroyed is estimated at $240,00 . The insurance can not yet be obtained . The fire will throw about SOO persons out of work . RUBBER COMPANIES UNITE .
