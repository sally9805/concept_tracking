txt Those venerable shepherds , Messrs . LAWRENCE , Dtraso , and HARPSTER of Ohio , who direct the policy of the National Wool Growers ' Association , recently congratulated all their followers upon the very satisfactory condition of the wool schedule in the McKinley bill . They then betook themselves to shady places in their sheep pastures , there to enjoy repose after the labors of an exhausting campaign . Two or three days ago their rest was rudely broken by reports that the manufacturers of ingrain ? arpets had dared to go to Washington and ask for a reduction of the proposed duty on carpet wools . There was even brought to the ears of the shepherds a story that these carpetmakers had told MCKINLEY that the imposition of the proposed duty would close their mills and throw 20.000 men out of work in Philadelphia alone . It seemed clear that these impudent persons had set out to disturb the perfected work of the shepherds , as exhibited in the wool schedule , upon the wholly irrelevant plea that a great industry would bo destroyed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shepherds left their pastures and issued a proclamation . Their followers were told . again that the carpetmakers were " confidence men " striving to obtain carpet wools at a low rate for the use of MERUfaotarers of clothing . And they were instructed once more to " make their wishes known " by " telegraphing to their Congressmen . " All hands were urged to stand . like a wall against " any modification " of the reported schedule . Then Shepherd DELANO journeyed in haste to Washington , and Shepherds LAWRENCE and HARPSTER followed him as soon as they could lay aside their crooks and change their blouses for " store clothes . " What a pity it is that these old herders are not permitted to take a little well-earned rest .
