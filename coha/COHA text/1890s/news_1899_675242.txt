txt We have ceased to talk politics with The Evening Post , for reasons that we suppose are obvious to readers of this journal who are also readers of that . But as was ably observed by the gentleman who introduced Martin Chuzzlewit to Elijah Pogram , " Ginerous enemies may meet upon the neutral sile of private life . I rather think . " Respecting expansion and kindred questions we must allow The Post to be joincd to its idols , if it can find any with which it can itself get on without quarreling with them , and applying opprobrious epithets to them , as certain Polynesian tribes are said to do to theirs when things do not go to suit them . But when it comes to yachting The Post shall not instill heretical opinions into the public without our earnest protest . The Post had an article on modern yacht racing the other day in which there was a good deal of good sense but one persistent heresy , and that was that the two contestants for the America 's Cup were equally examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are examples of exclusively British invention and development , but certainly it is no truer . Shamrock is much broader in proportion to length than Genesta and Galatea , says The Post . Now the American model has always been distinguished by greater beam than the British . Therefore the American model has prevailed . Q. E. D. Very pretty . But , on the other hand , Columbia is very much deeper comparatively than Puritan or Mayflower , and much more than Gracie or Fannie . Now the British model has always been distinguished from the American by greater comparative draught of water . Therefore the British model has prevailed . Q. E. D. One of these demonstrations is as good as the other and neither is good for much . In fact , when we are able to compare the lines of the two and to compare them with the lines or a British and an American racing yacht of 1875 we shall doubtless find that the two models have been gradually approaching each other , but that it has been by a process of give and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own old model , the centreboard , is retained , where it is retained , rather as a " gonfalon " than for its utility . The differences between the original models were as the differences between the shallows of the North River and Long Island Sound to the deep water that is carried in ' close to the chalky cliffs of Albion . If we go from hull to spars we must admit that the borrowing has been done on our side . Columbia carries almost as strictly a British cutter rig as Shamrock . It is very much the rig that a British cutter carried twenty-five wears ago , when the American sloop rig was merely a huge jib and mainsail . There is , however , much force in The Post 's lament that a boat which is built and rigged to hunt or to hold the ugly mug which the America brought back almost half a century ago should be good for nothing else , should be a mere racing machine . But there does not seem to be any present help for that in view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Post should find anything American superior to the British competing article . Even if it happens upon the wrong thing the spirit is commendable , and we may hope to see it spread to other than the yachting articles of our esteemed contemporary .
