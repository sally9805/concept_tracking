txt It is , of course , far from pleasant for the American people that its Government should find its credit impaired in the markets of the world in so short a time as has elapsed since the last loan was made in November . Then the Treasury was able to borrow on what was a trifle better than 3 per cent . interest . To-day the rate required is , let us say , 334 per cent . That is an advance of one-sixth , or 16 2-3 per cent . in three months . A business house whose paper should undergo such a change as that in such a period , when the average rate for money on first-class security . had not changed at all , would feel that it had been disgraced and would be perfectly justified in that feeling . The people of the United States can not avoid the same conclusion as to their Government . Nor is it much consolation that the people are themselves responsible for this disgrace , negatively if not positively . They could at any time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halls of Congress the men who have brought this about , and it has not been done . The miserable faction that has found its profit in the advocacy of " cheap " money has simply lived on the greed , the cowardice , or the partisan prejudice of the Democrats and the Republicans alternately . Each party has courted this faction . Each in its turn has hoped that " thrift would follow fawning , " each has refused to do its plain duty and to sustain the financial credit and honor of the Government . Each has been afraid that if it did what its leaders knew to be right , it would lose a Congressman here , a Senator there . During all that time the real issue between the two parties has been obscured or put aside . There is not in the history of politics in this country anything more sordid , - revolting , and contemptible than the way in which the " cheap " money men have dictated now to one party and now to the other , solely because the leaders of neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recent evidence of the deterioration of the credit of the United States in a way that has not been known since the crisis of the struggle for the life of the Nation is the price we pay in money and mortification for having tolerated this folly and crime . If the loan which is now generally expected shall be negotiated , the course of the Administration will have the sober and hearty approval of all reasonable men , because it is plain that there is no other means of doing what the Administration is bound to do . With the gold reserve melting from the Treasury at such a rate that another fortnight might easily drain it to the bottom , there was no other recourse . Very probably the President will be blamed for asking for authority for a gold loan to retire the legal-tender notes on Monday of one week , and negotiating a loan , on the bonds of 1810 and 1875 , the next week . But the complete answer to this is that the present action is inevitable , that it is compelled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated to Congress that he should take such action , and had renewed his statement . The authority he asked for would remove the cause of the necessity , but until it was given , the necessity was liable to come at any moment . As a matter of fact , it is now upon him , and he would be guilty of the gravest neglect , of the most serious violation of his clear duty , if he did not meet it in the only way that it can be met , How far that way will , for the time , be efficacious is shown by the effect on the popular mind of the belief that it is to be pursued . Exchange weakens , the demand for gold falls off , a wave of confidence spreads on both sides of the ocean , American securities advance in the London market . It is obvious that for the time the cause of all our difficulties has been checked . But it is for the time only , and the cause is checked , not abolished . We borrow gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the tide rises again , if circumstances again stimulate a demand for gold , every dollar of those notes must be turned loose again to renew the mischief already done . We have but a respite , and with the respite another lesson as to what the situation really requires , what alone will put us on a sound and healthy basis and free not merely our Government finances , but the business of the whole country from this perpetually recurring menace and peril .
