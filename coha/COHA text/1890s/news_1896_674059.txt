txt President Cleveland 's nominations for the Venezuelan Commission were Withheld at the White House until nearly midnight yesterday , so that they were known only to the press associations , which sent out the news , and as there was nobody about the hotels where such matters usually are discussed by public men , there was absolutely no comment upon them until to-day , when they were made known in the morning papers . The impression made upon Washington people is that the commission is good . Justice Brewer is known so well and esteemed so highly in this city that it was not expected that his appointment , which had been anticipated , although the Justice was quoted as having denied the report of his selection , would be anything but gratifying . A , Man of High Repute . Of Judge . Alvey , who had been urged for the post of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when Justice Fuller was named , this entire section has the highest possible regard . His associates on the District Court of Appeals bench consider him one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been enviable ever since he began practice . The court of which he is the Chief Justice , although it is still a new court , is esteemed one of the best in the land . To the men who had named Mr. Phelps and Mr. Edmunds , but who had not ascertained whether the President could or desired to nominate either of those gentlemen , or Robert T. Lincoln , there is some disappointment . Senator Cullom , perhaps naturally , regrets the failure to choose Mr. Lincoln , whom he would have selected , not only because he was somewhat familiar with the Venezuelan question , but because he is from Illinois . But the disappointment at the make-up of the commission is not general enough to amount- todisapproval of the men chosen . It is suggested that if any of its members are not now as prominent as others who had been suggested , they have an opportunity to prove that they were entitled to be chosen , and . their management-Of the investigation for the President may make them quite as prominent as anybody else who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no session of the Senate today , nor of the House . Nearly all the members of both branches are away from the city . At the House the appointments were discussed by a few stragglers . In the Ways and Means Committee , Mr. - Dingley looked over the list and then answered the inquiry as to what he thought of it with the short and decided answer : " That is a good commission . " Over at the Senate side , where the Finance Committee was in session , the Republican members and other leading Republicans who were in their committee rooms , were about of one opinion regarding the nominations . There were a few critics - who would have preferred that all the Commissioners should have names familiar to the readers of the newspapers , Out the appointments nowhere were received with harsh criticism . All Expected to Serve . It is not at all probable that any of the persons appointed will decline . The President took care before finally announcing the names that he should have assurances from the men asked that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caused in obtaining the consents of the members of the commission , and it was the necessity of making inquiries about the business which these men must lay aside for a while that gave the public an opportunity to suspect in advance that Brewer , Alvey , White , and Coudert were to be chosen . Mr. Gilman is the only one appointed whose name does not appear to have been heard by any body as that of one likely to be on the commission before his appointment was announced from the White House . Among the comments heard upon the appointments these are quoted as conveying the general opinion held here . Could Not Have Been Better . Senator Kyle said : " I think it is an excellent commission . I do n't see how it coald have been better . It includes two great Judges , Brewer and Alvey ; a great historian , White ; a geographer of enviable reputation , Gilman , and a lawyer capable of arguing any case , Coudert . " Senator Murphy said : " The commission is a good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory . " Senator Wilson said : " It appears to be a good commission . " Senator Chandler thought it was a good , fair commission , and that its decision would command respect . He said he supposed it was difficult to get men of great National and international reputation to serve . No one would question the ability of the men selected and their personal fitness to make the investigation desired . Representative Bailey thought it strange that the Democratic end of the commission was in the minority , but said he judged that it was a good commission . He was somewhat distrustful , however , of college professors when dealing with a question of this sort . Representative Dockery of Missouri said he believed the commission was a very able one . He could not speak from , personal knowledge , but the men all had good reputations . If he had any doubt at all , it was as to the wisdom of selecting college Presidents for such a mission . Voorhees Is Satisfied . Senator Voorhees said : " The commission is an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been better . Of course it is // coi*Ctiy:iaketi ! tr  --  pi : Fawn ; X. about - impossible : ? to , ? appoint - Mich ? a mission withiaA ? having soiree room for criticism , but I have no triticistrs I think the commission will prove to - be highly satisfactory . " Judge Sayers of Texas Said he regarded the commission as an admirable one . He said he knew Justice Brewer and Chief Jusiz tice , Alvey , and had met . Mr. Coudert . The others he knew by reputation , and he was satisfied that any decision rendered by such a commission would have weight . Representative Babcock said he supposed it was a good commission , judging from the general reputation of the men . Will Command the Country 's Respect . " I would have liked it better had there been a couple of names there that do not appear , but I believe the commission is composed of men who will do their duty well and thoroughly , " said Senator Frye of Maine . " They will command the respect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a fairly good commission , but disappointing in the omission of some of the names that had been mentioned in connection with it . He ? thought the commission would have been stronger had such men as Edmunds , Phelps and Lincoln been named . While it is known that the commission will be free to select its own presiding officer , it is assumed that Justice Brewer will be made its President . What he has to say , therefore , about the work of the commission is interesting , although he has not yet become acquainted with the full scope of the inquiry to be made according to the President 's message . Talk with Justice Brewer . 1 In talking to-day about the commission Justice Brewer said that while he could not speak with full ' information he had no doubt the sessions of the commission would be held in Washington , as it was the most accessible point , and much of the documentary evidence , maps , &c.,; which would initiate the inquiry , were to be found here . The Justice will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it is felt that the preliminaries of organization and the assembling of evidence may continue through the present month , leaving the more serious work of examination by the commission to begin about Feb. 1 , when the Supreme Court will take a month 's recess . This will permit the Justice to hear pending cases , and there-. after give his exclusive time to the commission . If , however , the commission 's labors shall begin earlier than anticipated , Mr. Brewer will be ready at any time to join his associates . May Go Abroad . Justice Brewer , when asked if the commission was likely to go abroad to pursue its investigations , said it might be that the State Department had prepared certain features of evidence regarded as essential , which would serve as a groundwork for the invest  --  gation . In that event , doubtless , this would be gone over , and then the commission would determine what further steps were required to ascertain the facts . It might be that Venezuela and England would be asked to present their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be the desire for the fullest information from all available sources . When all this documentary evidence should be in hand the question might then arise as to the desirability of verifying certain features of it by personal inspection of the originals of the documents in the archives of Spain , Holland , and other countries . This would involve a trip abroad , and there was the possibility that it might become desirable personally to view the locality of contention along the Guiana-Venezuela line . Justice Brewer illustrated this by referring to some of the boundary contests over Mexican land grants , a number of which have been decided by him , including the Maxwell grant case . The Executive Staff . The Justice says he has not given a thought to the executive staff of the commission , and as yet no names have been suggested . Thoroughly competent translators , both in Spanish and Dutch , as distinguished from German , will be required to examine the originals of the old Spanish and Dutch grants , on which the respective claims are based . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of the list , as announced , confers upon him any suggestion that he will imitate the work of the body , as the commission itself may select its Chairman MR . COLDERT WILL ACCEPT . by arbitration . Of all questions requiring careful %settlement by arbitration this surely is one of Ithe first . It is right in line with the spirit of ( bivilization , of this nineteenth century . President Cleveland 's war talk  --  threatening war talk , if you like  --  was only used after eignt or ken years ' earnest endeavor to have the matter ipeaceably settled . The sentiment that prevailed in this city yesterday in regard to the members of the ommis.sion that President Cleveland apointes1 Wednesday was fully expressed-by 1I0Dr . Chauncey M. Depew in an interview ' which he gave on the subject . He said : " Judge David J. Brewer is one of the ( ornaments of the Supreme Court bench . His Iparticipation in untangling the boundary question will assure as careful and thorough an inquiry as the parties at interest ' will permit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew D. White hs also admirable . Himself highly educated Bind a distinguished educator , he has shown great ' capacity as a man of affairs by his businesslike administration of Cornell , and by his record as Minister to Russia and as n member of the United States Commission to Santo Domingo . " Daniel Colt Gilman is another whose breadth of mental vision has not been limited by service as an educator . His ability in that line is unquestioned , but none but a man of broad views and the largest Ca1pacity could have developed the Johns Hopkins University as it has grown under his Presidency . New-Yorkers are too familiar with the career and repute of Frederic R. Coudert to need more than the mention of his name to approve his selection . Concerning Judge Alvey I know nothing , but the President doubtless had weighty reasons in selecting him . The commission will doubtless sit in Washington , and it has plenty of work cut out for it . " Too Early to Talk of the Work  --  Mr. ? Depew Voices Public Sentiment . Frederic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appointment and would act as a member of the commission appointed to inquire- into the respective rights of England and Venezuela in the territory in South America , as to which the dispute between those countries now exists . " I will accept Mr. Cleveland 's appointment , " Mr. Coudert said . " As yet I have received no official notification from the President of my appointment , and hence have sent no formal acceptance . I have just learned of my appointment from the newspapers . As to the work of the commission it is rather early to talk . " I presume that a meeting will be arranged at the earliest possible moment , that the investigation may be pushed with all possible dispatch . " I do not believe that it will be necessary for us to go to Venezuela as a body , for I do not see that we can get anything there that we could not have access to in this country . We will simply have to get at the records . Doubtless some of these are in the possession of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us access to these records . Why should they not ? We are simply investigating to get at facts . Do I believe that England will aid us ? It is hard to say what she will do . I do not see why she should not , since the result of our investigation may be the end of the whole matter . " It is possible that one or two of our commission may have to go abroad or to South America to ' sink up records , but I think most of the work can be done in this country . " It would indeed be a strange thing if two of the greatest powers of the world should go to war on a simple . boundary question , the only difference between tnem being that one desired arbitration and the other did not  --  this , too , where ? the two nations concerned nave both placed themselves on record for years past . as favorable to this intelligent and humane way of settling international differences . " What Mr. Coudert thinks of the question that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to-  the Congress is shown in the following interviews nad with him , which was published subsequent to the message . It was printed in THE NEW-YORK TIMES Christmas morning . It was given in connection with , and to express his opinion of the so-called " peace meeting- " that was held in Cooper Union . It is as follows : I consider it most unfortunate that such a thing happened . It was ill advised and unwise as well as unpatriotic . No matter What the views of these men may be with ' regard to the Venezuelan message , they should not have forgotten that just now the eyes of Europe and of all the world are upon us . They might have known , one would think , that , with the great majority in the city against teem. the resuit of the meeting could only have been what it was . If there is any result to such a Itieeting , ' what is it to be ? Why , simply to ericoorage Great Britain not to yield to any reasonable concession that she might otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lite ' other effect . They can not move the great : body of New-York opinion . Do they consider what it is that we desire ? It is not war usat we desire , - bin " - simply - that the question of a boundary line should be.settled
