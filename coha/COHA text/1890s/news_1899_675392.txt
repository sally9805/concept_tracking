txt A study of the annual report of the Children 's Aid Society brings to light a condition of things among the poorest and most destitute of the recent immigrants from Italy , Austria , and Russia which is worse than anything described in the stories of the London slums . The sweating system , irregular and low wages , physical weakness , race degeneracy , and the dreadful crowding together of people of both sexes and all ages among the most submerged of these people act and re-act upon each other to bring about from year to year a condition which , were it not for agencies such as the Children 's Aid Society , would result in shocking degeneracy . Among these people there have for years been established by the society schools known as " industrial schools , " one of them especially for crippled children , to which were attracted during the past year as many as 14,000 children . These schools are in charge of devoted women who are giving their lives to this missionary labor  --  a labor of love . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclothed when necessary , and to the half-starved are given noon lunches , for the needs of the body must first be looked to if the mind is to be reached . Morality , honesty , purity , and good manners are inculcated , the only knowledge that is given these children that there are such things as Goo and conscience and right and wrong . These schools are but in Part supported from public appropriations , and we urge upon the benevolent in these Christmas times to remember the needs of this effort  --  the expenses for clothing and shoes and meals , and the maintenance of such a work . Most important also are the needs of the children after leaving these schools and when they are at work . The years between the ages of twelve and sixteen are most impressionable , and the Children 's Aid Society urges upon the benevolent the importance of evening schools , recreation classes , and boys and girls ' clubs for these young people . The society ' has the buildings , but has not the means to meet the expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a whole Winter 's season , and the Trustees of the society appeal urgently for several funds of this description . Turning from these schools to the boys and girls ' lodging houses carried on by the Children 's Aid Society , the farm school at Kensico , where homeless boys from the city streets are trained for employment and homes in the country , it is most encouraging to the-student of sociology to note h6W certa.inly the change of environment seems to act on the character of the child . The-lodging houses gather in the homeless children , and after being trained at the farm , they are in large numbers sent to family homes in the State of New York , in adjoining States and to the West . One hundred dollars will place five homeless children in country homes . No work of benevolence is so satisfactory as this . These children , fated to grow into vagrancy if allowed to remain in the city , transplanted to the country become as good citizens as the average of the people born in the communities in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this work of transplanting for forty-six years , during which time many thousands have been removed from the city to the country , and under the supervision of the agents of the society have grown to manhood and womanhood . The report of the society speaks with pride of the fact that two of their boys have become Governors of States , several have become District Attorheys , Sheriffs , and members of Legislatures in the West ; one a member of Congress ; two are professors in colleges , a dozen or more are clergymen ; two are railroad managers , and most of them , even if they have not achieved eminence , are respectable and useful citizens in our Western States . Of all our benevolent organizations , none is doing more for manhood and citizenshIp . Mr. A. B. HEPBURN of the Chase National Bank is the Treasurer of the society , and donations may be sent to him or to Mr. C. LORING BRACE , Secretary , 105 East Twenty-second Street .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
