txt IT is apparent to any man who will take the trouble to think , that , no matter what the learning , the knowledge , the ability or genius of the individual may be , these rest on the animal , and that without the animal , and , still further , without the animal in health , they are as nothing . Let but a little splinter of bone , no largeP than the head of a pin , press upon the brain , and the wisest statesman that ever moulded the destinies of nations , the greatest judge that ever proclaimed the majesty of law , may be less than a little child . Little as we know of him , the most significant fact in the life of Shakespeare is that he never seems to have had any illness worthy of mention . Men may be civilized , they may be educated , they may be governed by the highest ideals , // yet under all and carrying all , even as the foundation carries the palace above it , is the animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In every act in life , in every thought for others , we have to reckon first with this animal . Nature has guarded it well . No act of the will usually is or can be as strong as an instinct , and the brain with its energy , its power of thought , its range of knowledge , is but the servant of the instinct of self-preservation . For while it is true that there have been men and women who have risen above this for the sake of truth , honor or love , they have been the exceptions which prove the general law . While the instinct of self-preservation has been implanted in the animal in order to guard the individual , the second strongest instinct in existence insures the continuance of the race . As the first , so is this a purely physical thing ; something which may be over-ridden and crushed down by the few , but which will dominate and rule the many , for without it the human race would cease to exist . Now , while it may be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , the justice , the humanity , the right-doing of men are all that excuses the infinite wrong which members of our race have done each other , we must not forget that these rest on the animal in that race . If the race is to go on towards greater triumphs in the future it must be by keeping the animal strong and healthy . I emphasize this fact because there is at the present moment in this country a condition existing among the women which is cause for the gravest alarm . So far as I can learn , first from that personal knowledge which comes to each physician in his practice , and second from that consensus of knowledge had by all physicians and reflected in medical magazines and journals , the problem before the medical men of this country to-day is the health of the educated women , of those women who represent the third or fourth generation born on the soil . While it is true that from time to time articles appear in the lay publications in which this problem is alluded to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really reflected . None know better than I do the difficulty which makes itself felt when we would discuss this subject . Modern canons of taste forbid any but the most distant allusions to what is going on among us in many ways , and he is considered immodest or even indecent who seeks to draw the veil . At the same // time things have come to such a point that our progress as a nation may be seriously imperilled unless we can recognize the evil and find a remedy . Were this not true , the aggregate of torture inflicted on the American women would in itself be enough to make any one speak out who realizes what it is . When we read of the physical pain inflicted on those who were racked during the Middle Ages , or when we think of how the martyrs died , our sympathy with the victims and our abhorrence of the tortures is almost lost in our wonder that the people at large permitted such things to go on . Yet there exists to-day in the United States an aggregate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as nothing . Fox , in his Martyrology , gives 60,000 as the number who suffered under the persecutions of the Roman Emperors , and he is probably as near right as anyone will ever be . Great as those sufferings undoubtedly were , they were at least short . There are probably 60,000 women in the United States who suffer month in and month out , who have suffered for years and who are destined to suffer for years to come . Is not this cause for speech ? More than this , there are probably 65,000 girls now growing up who will suffer as their mothers have suffered and do suffer . It seems to me that when we realize such a condition of things , we xviii realize that it ought to be seriously and candidly considered . Let me briefly state facts as they are . Au American girl , educated as it is our pride to educate her , marries the man of her choice amid the warm good wishes of all her friends . She is clever , bright , beautiful , and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , at most , two children are born , and if we meet her we can scarcely recognize her . She looks dragged and worn , she is fretful and peevish , she has become a burden on her husband instead of a help to him , she feels as if she were a nuisance to herself and to others ; worse than all , because it is the cause of all , she is a confirmed invalid , doomed to suffer more or less during the coming years , and these , alas ! may be many . None knows better than these women how fully the sympathy of their husbands is dealt out to them ; how the love and affection surrounding them do xvhat is possible to lessen the evil of their lot . Unfortunately , there can be in this world no bearing of the burden of pain for another , and the aching agony must be endured as best it may . // 443 There sometimes comes to the physician , who reflects on what nature intended there should be and what he actually sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast . The pain and misery seem to be so useless , so uncalled for . Never is this feeling stronger than when one contemplates the condition of these women , for it is , so to speak , so utterly unreasonable . But this impatience does not prevent the existence of the evil , and as we are concerned with what is , rather than with what should be , regret , no matter how genuine , is useless unless we can find the remedy . Expressed in the fewest words , the evil is that an increasingly large proportion of the women of the American race are unable to perform their functions as mothers , and these women include the mentally best we have among us . Under the law of natural selection the race can only improve , provided the best men and women are parents . Just as there are inherited muscles so there are inherited brains . We have found by experience that it pays the community at large to develop the brain of the boy or gil in order to fit him or her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government shall continue to exist . With universal suffrage ignorance is the only enemy to be dreaded , for on the intelligent vote of the individual rests the ultimate wisdom of national acts . The stream can not rise above its source , and the rule of the majority is only safe when the average intelligence is high . The ability of each , as shown in self-support , is the simple interest on the investment , while the continuation by each of the proper share in the cost of developing the brains of the next generation is the return of the capital loaned . But there is  --  to carry out the simile  --  a compound interest due to the community at large from this investment , namely , the greater natural ability to be inherited by the coming generat&gt;rns . The gravity of the evil confronting us lies in this , that we seem to be able to bring the women up to a certain point in mental development and then they cease to be able to bo mothers . Why ? It is to the last degree difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , and while some are obvious others are merely suspected . It will be worth while , however , to consider those we can recognize because it is plainly true that the first step towards a remedy is fixing the reason of its necessity . If what I have said concerning the animal be true , it follows // that the primary duty of the majority of women is to bear children . This is not less the fact because a large percentage of edu cated American women tacitly deny it and silently agree with the utterances of the small number who openly claim women were created for " something nobler than slavery to children . " In view of its truth , the question arises whether we bring up our girls in the right way . I am aware of the weight of the arguments in favor of equality in education for the sexes , and certainly I have no wish to be understood as wishing that women should be ignorant . Yet I have examined the schedule of studies given to girls between the ages of ten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . As a physician I have learned two things : First , that mental work exhausts the strength as much as physical labor without its compensating advantages in exercise ; and , Second , that between those ages , girls go through a physical change in which very great demands are made on the strength . While reading over that list of studies , therefore , the question has risen in my mind whether they do not imply drafts on the strength so great as to seriously impair the physical health . From the girls in our schools we demand they shall keep up with their classes , and we have enlisted as whips to urge them their ambition , the rewards offered for success and the disgrace attaching to failure . Thus stimulated , they drive their brains and they do the work-judging from school commencements I have been at they do it splendidly . But while we see to it that this artificial drain on the strength is kept up , nature is making her demands , none the less surely because we do not see them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and nature will not be refused . It must be remembered that by no possible means can we take more out of the body than there is in it , and the fact that both natural and artificial demands have been satisfied is itself sufficient to show that the strength was there . But what has been done in reality is this : we have used up all the strength . What is usually called stamina is that reserve of strength in the body which nature stores up in some way we do not understand , to respond to unusual strains , such as those of illness . It is not enough that from the food we eat and the blood we make we gather strength and nervous energy enough to meet the demands of the present ; we have in addition to this to keep up C. // the reserves . Now , it is perfectly possible to work ourselves to the point where the reserves are exhausted , and when a man breaks down with nervous prostration , that is what he has done . There are men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are attacked by some simple and slight disease , show an utter inability to rally . The reason is simple-they have no reserves left . If Nature be left to herself she is to the last degree careful to supply an abundance of stamina to growing girls . Not only are girls who are really strong less apt to contract disease than are boys of the same age , but healthy young women if they contract a disease will , as a rule , have the less violent attack . In what is called the fever belt in Central and South America more young men than young women of the peon class catch the malaria fever . The deaths from yellow fever in such observed centres as iRio de Janeiro are less among the peon women from fifteen to twenty-five than among the men , and the percentage of those who recover is larger , the exposure being about equal . Now , recovery from such a disease as yellow fever means that the patient has a reserve of strength which , when the disease has run its course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among these peon girls this reserve exists to a greater extent than among their brothers . But it is the fact that no such difference is observed between the girls and boys in this country . If anything , the results show the girls less able to endure any very exhausting disease . I am unable to find any reason for this reverse in nature 's methods except it be in the tax which by our system of education we put on these girls . It is true , of course , that they are subject to hundreds of influences besides that of the schools ; some of which are to be found in society , others in the press and jostle of American life , others , again , in the many sources of mental excitement which have their effect on all of us . Still , no one of these involves such a direct tax on the energies as is found in study , as our girls understand the word , although their combined effect must not be left unmentioned . I once heard a married woman say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is a fact that a very large number of American women now refuse to bear children . Ideas have changed . The religious sentiment which forbids efforts to pre // vent the accomplishment of the natural function of their sex has been greatly lessened in force for many of them . To no class in the community is the realization of what is going on so vivid as to physicians , because to them the sufferers from the results of their own acts must come for relief . It is almost useless to point out the terrible consequences of this interference with Nature , or to say the exchange is pain during a short period avoided and pain during life secured . I say " useless , " because women and men alike rarely learn except by experience , and women , even to a greater extent than men , are functionally unable to realize the results of their acts . Herbert Spencer has this in view when he speaks of " the aptitude which the feminine intellect has to dwell on the concrete and proximate rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold up our hands in horror when we think of acts of this kind , and it is easy enough to find words of condemnation which shall indeed be strong . Probably there is no one who would say , whatever the thought might be , that the words were too strong or the horror too great ; but when the physician , than whom no one knows better the ghastly folly of the act and its terrible punishment , reflects on its causes , he can find , if not excuses , at least less than utter condemnation . So far as the act is the result of a dislike to be deprived of the pleasures of society by the care of children , it is damnably wrong . So far as it results from the dread of the pain of child-birth , it is folly so absolute that it may not be expressed in words . But when it is the result of an innate feeling that there is not stamina enough to stand the strain-what then ? It is true that the consequences of the act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , involve far greater strains on the strength than can ever rcsult from its alternative , but I seriously question whether women generally know this or whether if they know it theoretically they really believe it . It is impossible for a physician to say anything with a more absolute knowledge of its truth than when he declares that no matter what the evil results of child-bearing may be they are less than those following on criminal operations . It is not to be supposed for a second that all or even the majority of women who have been broken down have their own folly to thank for it , but while the number is relatively small , when compared to the number of the sick , it is the reluctant belief of // those who have an opportunity of knowing " whereof they speak " that it is increasing . It is this belief which gives a part of its importance to the lowering of the birth-rate in the United States , as shown by the census of 1890 . The other and greater part of that importance is derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broken down as the result of a lack of stamina sufficient to meet the physical strain of childbearing . It is , unfortunately , the fact that evidence of this evil is not confined to physicians . There is not a man or woman , and this is especially true of what we call the cultured classes , that does not count among his or her acquaintances married women who are confirmed invalids . The small average size of American fantilies is a matter of notoriety . Let us see how this fact is reflected in statistics . Massachusetts ranks deservedly high among her sister States in her patriotism , wealth , energy , industry , education and progress . On the roll of her public men are the names of many whom the nation delights to honor , and she has been foremost in all good deeds . Remembering that these all rest ultimately on the animal in her citizens , the following figures of the births per 1,000 population among her people during the years given are instructive 1860 United States census 25.61 1870 22.63 1875 State census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1890 United States census 19.22 Ordinarily speaking , the birth rate of a race is regulated by the food supply , and where there is an abundance of food the population increases in a ratio which may be easily ascertained . Now while I am willing to grant that the conditions of life in Massachusetts were easier in 1860 than they are now-that is , it was easier for a man to earn that which would enable him to buy sufficient food for his children-I do not think the difference in the conditions can correspond with that of the birth rate . If the opposite be alleged , we are required to believe in a deterioration of onequarter in these conditions during a period of thirty years , and that with the knowledge that were the agricultural methods of Belgium applied to the soil of Massachusetts , the amount of food // produced would be two and one-third times what it is to-day . I submit this is a demonstration ad alsitrdum . Is it to be supposed that the conditions of life in Massachusetts are as severe as those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pauperism in London , of persons receiving in-door or out-door relief , was 29.6 in the 1,000 , while in Massachusetts it was less than 10 . Yet the birth rate in London during the past eighteen years has remained nearly stationary , from 35 in 1875 to 33 in 1892 . The birth rate of the whole of the United States has steadily fallen from 1880 , running from 36 in the 1,000 of population in that year to 30 in 1890 . Dr. Billings , Director of the Division of Vital Statistics of the last census , to whose work I am indebted for the statistics given , says " It is probable that the most important factor in the change is the deliberate and voluntary avoidance and prevention of child-bearing on the part of a steadily increasing number of married people , who not only prefer to have but few children , but who know how to obtain their wish . " While I agree with Dr. Billings in thinking the number is " steadily increasing , " I am forced to disagree with him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in the fact that an enormous and constantly increasing number of our women are so exhausted physically before marriage that the birth of one child , or at the most of two children , leaves them physical wrecks . This brings me back once more to the strains put upon growing girls , for it is apparent that there is nothing in the food supply of this country to account for the decrease in the birth rate . The United States has not as yet had one-third of its development , and the land of the country would support five times the present population . If it were utilized , as is land in parts of China , it would support a people twenty times as numerous . It may not be denied that every girl or woman has the right to remain single if she so elect . It is equally apparent that if she chooses she may devote all her strength to mental effort . It therefore follows that could we know beforehand that a girl would refuse to marry , we could be certain that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , no one may decide such a thing for another , and neither the parents nor the // 449 community have a right to assume that such a decision will be arrived at . As the community can oniy exist by the continued birth of children , it is plain that any treatment by it of the girls which will incapacitate them to perform their natural functions is , to the last degree , suicidal . While the parents would naturally prefer that their daughters should be healthy and strong , they have not the saiiie interest in that health and strength as the community , for their existence does not depend thereon . So far as the strains placed on the girls in the schools are to be considered , these are , under our system of public schools , regulated by the community . If , then , I am right in ascribing chiefly to these strains that physical exhaustion of the young women , which is showing itself in the birth rate , we have before us the extraordinary spectacle of the community making war on itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last twenty years , an advance greater in importance than are all the discoveries and inventions of that period , has been in the enfranchisement of American women . To the person who looks at their status to-day and compares it with that of 1870 , the change is wonderful . It is natural that the pendulum should swing as far one way as it swung the other , and that in their greater freedom , especially of the mind , the women should go to excess . Just as for centuries their minds were sacrificed to their bodies by the will of others , so now by their own will they are sacrificing their bodies to their minds . This will remedy itself in time ; there need be no fear that it will continue forever , unless , indeed , the human race be destined to end in an apotheosis of intellect ! But the time necessary for the reaction may be shortened by a free discussion of the evils of the present course , and no one who realizes the suffering and pain which results from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils . It is the duty of every physician to exert his influence to save the growing girls from strains too great for them , and it is the duty of the mothers to save their daughters . There is another aspect of the question which was very forcibly brought to my attention in a conversation in which one of the speakers was a gentleman of very great wealth whose only son is engaged to a German girl . One of these present said laughingly that the prospective bridegroom had shown a lack of patriotism // in his choice , and that America contributed more than her fair share to the support of foreigners in the marriages of her girls . " I should like to have more than one grandchild , for there is money enough , and I do not want my son to bear the sorrow I have borne . It means a good deal to a man to be forced to watch the person who is dearest to him a hopeless invalid , " was the answer . I could not help noticing the quick look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While no one can respect or sympathize with this sorrow more than the physician , to no one does the scientific significance of the first part of the speech more forcibly appeal . If there be any truth shown by the history of the development of the human race-of any animal race for that matter-it is that the members of that race will not permit those causes to exist which threaten its continuance . One sex is as much interested as the other in the result , but the desire for offspring is stronger in the male than in the female . It follows , therefore , that if the system of education prevents American women having children , and if the influence of those women is strong enough to put a stop to any change in that system , or if those women refuse to be mothers , American men will , so far as they can , marry girls of other races . Nothing would be easier than to place a construction on this which would make it ridiculous , because the racial movement , of which it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would be modified by a thousand influences . I do not mean , then , that there would be another " Rape of the Sabines , " or that the young men of America would assemble in crowds to meet the emigrant ships even as the men of Louisiana assembled to meet the ships from France . I do mean that in time there would gradually permeate through the minds of men the understanding that health was a requisite in the women they would make their wives , and that this would probably show itself in health having that attraction for men which beauty now has . Healthy girls , girls with stamina , would then have the same advantage over their less fortunate sisters that is now possessed by the pretty girls over those that are ugly . Ultimately , therefore , the remedy for the evil lies in the hands of the men . It is not , however , in the least degree probable that the remedy must be found there . The women of America are not fools , and it is impossible that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work are now tending . More than this , they are the proper persons to move in the matter , for they are the greatest sufferers.
