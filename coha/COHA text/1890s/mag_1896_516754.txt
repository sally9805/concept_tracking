BY ANNA C. BRACKETT . IN these days of indiscriminate forestfelling and ruthless destruction of the beautiful growths along country roadsides it is a great pleasure to own a tree . Delightful is it to sit at my door and look at my tallest Elm , the beautiful creature , lifting on high its sweeping arms drooping on every side , shooting its clouds of feathery foliage higher and higher to the topmost tiny twigs , on which the robin loves to perch and swing , and to know that from the firm-set roots below to that tiniest spray it is all mine and in my power ; to be sure that no one can destroy its life , and that it may grow on in safety , more beautiful each year . To be conscious of the power to protect anything enlarges the mind , and when that thing is a live and breathing tree , one grows fast in tenderness and breadth of sympathy . Life must be a strange thing to those who do not know atid love trees . I can not conceive what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does not recognize and mentally call them by name as he passes ; I can not recall the time when I did not know all the common trees by name , and greet them when seen in a new locality as old and delightftil friends . I supposed that all people did so ; and yet i met not long ago a man and a woman who had none of this knowledge , and who asked languidly , when I took them out to one of my prides , " Oh , is that a Chestnut ? " " Doubtless the Lord might have made ' a more beautiful thing than a Chestnut leaf , but doubtless He never did ; and they did not know it ! I feel ashamed that blindfold I am not able to tell any kind of tree when standing under it by the sound of the wind in its branches . I ought to be able to do this without the least hesitation ; it is not the fault of the trees that I do not in every instance , and these people did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me no great use either in living or dying without a knowledge of and friendship for the forest-makers . The next greatest pleasure to owning a tree is cutting one down ; and a little thinking will make it plain that my two statements are not contradictory . So the great requisite for happiness is to own a wood-lot ; for of course one tree could not VOL . XCILI. - No. 556-65 satisfy both desires . " Woodman , spare that tree ! " was all very well if the tree was not in the way of others more deserving , but there is mistaken sensibility as to tree-cutting as much as about other things , and it is not worth while to leave a wood-lot unmolested till its occupants have killed each other , or till the few that remain are worth nothing , either to themselves or any one else . One differeth from another in glory and in the right to live , and there is much food for reflection on the doctrine of evolution in a wood full of trees . A man will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it represents the Deity as hard , mechanical , and implacable , but , for all that , next day he will weed his corn , and cut out one tree for the sake of another , not reflecting that thus he only practises the doctrine which he condemns , and uses his best human wisdom in the same line with that of the Creator ; lie also desires the fittest to survive , and if only one of two or three can do so in this world of strictly limited time and space , it must be the fittest that he will spare . Is it more cruel to kill the old horse that has borne you many a pleasant mile than it is to leave him to die of starvation in the midst of plenty when his teeth fail him * Is it hardhearted to choose between growths that are stifling and mutilating each other , and to save many , rather than leave all to perish ? The forester must learn the wisdom of some of the theories connected with the doctrine of evolution for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It comes to pass that the practice of forestry is by no means a simple amusement , but more like a game of chess , where you can not move one piece without taking account of every other , even the most insignificant . For when you handle hatchet or saw it is to be asked , Is this tree to be cut for itself or for others ? If for the sake of others-i. e. , for the greatest good of the greatest numher-then are you cutting with a view to timber for future money value , or to make a wood in which one may take his ease and his fill of pleasure ? Then , again , are you working for the creation of a screen , or caring for trees as individuals ? Upon the answers to all these questions depends // the use of the tool with which long years of human ingenuity have supplied you against the defenceless tree . A large degree of restraint is necessary , lest the demon of destruction for destruction 's sake should get hold of your ardor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never should be allowed to own any vegetable growth but asparagus and rhubarb . Of course , too , one must have a considerable knowledge not only of the names of the different trees likely to be met with in an American wood , but also of their habits and practical value . She must be able to distinguish them by bark as well as by leaf , and she will soon learn to know them in some measure by the sound of the saw as it eats its way . No one , for instance , could mistake a Maple for a Linden after the teeth of the saw had taken their first hold , or fail to recall from " The One-hoss Shay " the words " cuts like cheese , " and , " the wedges flew from between their lips , Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips , " and to wonder where Dr. Holmes , in the midst of his busy life , found time to gain so much exact knowledge of trees if lie had never owned a wood-lot . To be among the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual labor and to exercise the requisite judgment ; as the work goes on , all sorts of quotations throng into the memory , and poems learned long ago in school-days spring out of retreat and link themselves to those of later date . So it comes to pass that while the hands are busy and the whole body exercised to healthful excitement , the whole mind is alive with the best poetry of our language , and one goes into the house at last , tearing herself away from the fascinating work , cornpanied with the best writers of all time . There is a pretty touch in " Hermaun und Dorothen , " where the housewife , as she goes through the garden , with her mind full of more important things , mechanically picks off a caterpillar from the cabbage . I have often thought of her , for I have recently found myself breaking off dead twigs wherever I went . But it is not alone dead wood that has concerned me , for many hours of each day in the last summer have been spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an exercise for women that I am moved to speak . If it be objected that a woodlot is an expensive luxury , I have only to reply that it is not so expensive as a physician , and much more agreeable . There are many abandoned farms in New England that may be had for a song , with trees on all of them , and there is almost no form of exercise that may not come in as part of real work in the woods . The use of the saw-for a woman can hardly use an axe to advantage either of herself or of a tree-with the different positions required in sawing , according to the position of the trunk to be cut , brings into play almost every muscle of the body , one after another , in a fashion that no gymnasium can rival . Then the climbing , which is sometimes necessary , and always interesting ! Often in running a race with gravitation to see whether you can get the trunk sufficiently sawed through before the weight of the wood , no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall bind the blade so that it can not be moved , it is necessary to pull on the trunk with one arm while you saw with the other , and that is a very pretty and general exercise . Then the pushing and pulling and swaying , to induce the tree to topple over when it is impossible to saw any further , without rasping some neighboring trunk that must not be injured ; the lifting and dragging away the prostrate tree , and even tIme stooping to pick up the twigs or small branches from the ground-all these motions , following in no regular order , and kept up for two or three hours in the shade and sunshine , will send you to the house full of exultation , while you hear in imagination the long sigh of pleasure left behind , where a struggling yet never-despairing little Maple , choked by more unworthy growths for years , is rejoicing in its newly gained freedom , and spreading its leaves into the sunlight for which it has longed and towards which it has struggled . Perhaps some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so helpless ; at any rate , will you be less patient and courageous than a tree ? And so you may take with you to your dressing-room fresh courage ; for who knows how soon the great Forester may come in His own good time to your aid ? Does He care less for you than you for your trees ? I have always remembered the remark of a New York physician , that the best // exercise for children was the " fooling round " which they get in the country when left to their own desires , and I have thought of it many times as I have fooled round all the morning under the fresh green shade , wishing that more parents would find the truth of his words . Many years ago when at the Normal School we were obliged to take just so much exercise every afternoon , and I did not like walking in the rain or staying in the house , I timidly proffered an unheard-of request to the principal that I might be allowed to saw wood in the barn with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sloppy streets . There was no hesitation in granting the petition , much to my relief , and that winter I sawed all the wood that warmed our room sometimes to the detriment of my skirt , but much to my comfort . Thus I was not quite ignorant of the art of sawing when , wooed by the cool shade and fascinated by the many trees that had grown for me or that I had planted , I ventured one day to do a little work among them , and found thereafter many pleasant hours ' labor in their company . With a handsaw not much over fourteen inches long , and not too fine in teeth , a clipper to take off branches too high to be otherwise reached , a light ladder easily carried , and once in a while the services of a man to complete the very high work , there is nothing to prevent a woman from clearing out her wood-lot , to her own exceeding advantage and that of its occupants . She will soon learn many things , and acquire the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one trade as in another . The qualities of different kinds of wood will be a field of interest for any healthy mind ; even after the leaves have fallen , she will learn to know the dead wood from that which is alive though quiescent , by the sound as she sways the branch or cuts with the saw , and she will recognize her old acquaintances in their nakedness by bark , shape , and manner of behavior ; and all this is like being admitted into the confidence of friends . She will make other acquaintances also , to be looked on as enemies , and will enlarge her entomological knowledge in a way to give her much food for thought . For although " i*iisects injurious to vegetation " have undoubtedly some rights , and trees seem to have been provided for their food , yet , since a tree is fastened to its place , and therefore helpless , it would seem that it is entitled to help from without against the numerous army of worms and bugs , and that help you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one must be on the side either of the spider or of the fly ; when it comes to that question , I stand by the spider , but in the case of trees , I am bound to aid them . In my experience , almost any wel 1-constituted worm will eat what is set before him , and not trouble his conscience about it . I am surprised to find how many trees will be injured by one species of worm , and how many kinds of worms may be found on one tree . The " stick-worm " is one of the most interesting , because he seems always to mimic the leaf-stalk of the tree upon which he is , so as to deceive even the elect . On the Woodbine he is gray with tiny brown markings , on the Purple Plum , purple , and on the Poplar , a decorous green . Moreover , he always on the least alarm stands out stiffly from the branch at the exact angle at which its leaves grow , so that sometimes you pick him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may look for him*along the edges of the leaf ; and one thing which I respect him for is his thoroughness of work , for he leaves nothing but the midrib , which often you will take off supposing it to be the creature you are hunting for . There is one little white worm , however , that I have never so far met anywhere but on the leaves of the Sugar-Maple . He commences operations by pulling up together any two of the spreading ribs from the point where they fork by weaving innumerable silky threads across from one to the other , and then drawing these taut . Having thus finished his residence , he begins to keep house by feeding on the portion of leaf which constitutes his roof . From this he eats the green ; and as he eats he forms around himself a hard black tunnel , in which lie lives , increasing it in length and in size as lie goes along . You will notice the leaf in its sewed-up condition , and pulling apart the threads , will find inside this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled upon itself , with its larger end open . If you take it out and break off its end , which you may do easily , for it is hard and granular , you will find nothing till you almost reach the closed end , for the creature backs at the slightest attack . But // at last , as you go on diminishing its length , he is forced to appear  --  a small white and remarkably active worm , wriggling out of his cover and attempting to fall to the ground as a means of escape . A prettier arrangement may be found also on the Sugar-Maple . A brown spot on the wideopen leaf attracts attention , and you find that it is a piece of another leaf , say a quarter of an inch in diameter , circular , and carefully stuck to the upper surface by its edges . If you detach it , underneath you will find another bit of leaf , precisely similar , except in size , and as carefully attached . Take this off , and a still smaller circle comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which used to fascinate you in childhood , and go on ; but the pieces are growing smaller , and as you lift the last tiny one , a very small and tidy - looking green worm squirms out from beneath his many blankets . There are two other green worms , differing greatly in size if ' not in glory from my little one of the blankets , for they are as large round as a pea-pod , and the only wonder is how they can hold on at all , they are so heavy . One is trimmed with many red and yellow brilliant spots , and the other with bunches of white bristles standing out all over him . Neither of them lacks powerful jaws , and they leave nothing behind them but the middle stem of the leaf . It is an impossibility to step on them for purposes of crushing , and cremation is in order as the only remedy . The prescription for them is " a clear fire , a clean hearth , and the rigor of the game , " more especially as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chestnut . Many surprises will be in store for you as the work goes on . You cut off a young Poplar a few inches above the ground to find that the remnant of trunk left is really nothing but a neatly perforated hole with traces of sawdust in it , surrounded by a few outer rings of wood . Saw six inches above the first cut and there is no hole . Cautiously sawing up the short piece which you hold into inch lengths , it will not be long before a dirtylooking brownish-hooded head will poke itself out of the upper opening , and a little pushing at the other will force from his privacy the fat white borer that is slowly making his way up the heart of the defenceless tree . It must be a curious life this , in utter darkness and silence , working straight ahead and up in a right line . And imagine the horrified fear when the sound of the outside woodpecker makes its way in faint vibrations ! There is no turning round and going back possible for the hermit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell may possibly tremble , and so relieve his nervous excitement , but trembling would be hardly possible to the borer , for his quarters are exactly the size of his body . Or cut off another Poplar close to the ground , and you will find a commodious chamber within the little trunk filled with scurrying black ants , who rush to carry their eggs to a place of safety . How did they get into that tree ? It looked all right , and was cut only to make room for others . You may consider the ways of the anxious little creatures whose safe home you have spoiled , but you will hardly gain much accurate knowledge of them , for they are past finding out . You are continually impressed with the universal presence of busy animal life , and if the earth " rings hollow from below , " you will begin to suspect that you are warned not so much of the presence of the dead as of the living . Most worms prefer solitude at their meals , but I have found two kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their green table close side by side . Two kinds of green worms do this , one of them actually waving their tails in the air with seeming pleasure while the mouths are filling , and the other lying snugly one against the other in a long row , heads all to the edge of the leaf . Currant - worms will feed together , but more after the manner of cows in a pasture , with superb indifference to each other but these worms actually seem to find pleasure in company . There is a very small and dirty brown one of this kind that spoils the leaves of my Elms . Another , more disgusting still in color and fatness , eats the Poplar . The worms at least are honest , and do not mask their intentions , and for that I respect them , as also for the thoroughness of their work . But I have become acquainted with a brown bug , a quarter of an inch long , of the Coleopterous family , whom I found one day on a young Lombardy Poplar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object of peculiar attention . As I was looking out for creeping things only , I passed him over as of no account , and as having // merely rested on the leaf from a journey . He was very innocent-looking , very clean , and well groomed . Soon , however , I begaii to discover many curious little places on the fresh green leaves , where every bite could be easily counted , little munchings out of the smooth covering , and I said , " An enemy hath done this . " It was not long , for I kept daily watch , before I found out a decided synchronism between the rows of bites and my innocent friend the brown bug , and ever since there has been daily warfare against the treacherous foe , who loves to walk round the leaves near the edge on the upper surface , taking out rows of tiny morsels of the green covering as he goes . It was a trifle discouraging to start with that he has wings while I have none , though , strangely , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sheet of sticky flypaper one morning to see if , finding his legs fettered , he would not make efforts to escape by his wings . But he was less intelligent than a fly , for instead of doing so he gave up in the most cowardly and spiritless manner , and did not try to move even his legs . Or possibly he was more intelligent , perceived at once that it was useless to try , and so restrained the remainder of wrath , and would condescend to give me no information . Incensed at this conduct , I guillotined him and put him under the microscope , forcibly opening his wing-cases , and unfolding thin , gauzy , but large and evidently sufficient wings . He looks much like a potato-bug without the stripes , and must be some relation of his , for the family traits are strong . His cut-off head lay motionless ; but as to his body , he was , as the country people say , " suffering terribly without being conscious of it " ; for it was in constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed wing , as if that were the cause of all his misfortune , while it was not that at all , but the quiet jaws , that had got him into trouble . When I first began to pick off these bugs it was easy , for they made no resistance and no attempt at escape . I had only to take them between finger and thumb ; for if not securely held they would just take up their legs and thus roll off the shiny leaf into the grass , where it was impossible to find them . But at the end of three weeks ' careful killing every morning those bugs had become so suspicious of me that it was only necessary for me to look steadfastly at one to have him tuck up his legs at once and roll off . I had observed under the microscope that they had very large eyes , but had not supposed them capable of detecting a fell intent . The fact , however , is as I have stated it , and after this the hunt became rather discouraging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeable to be regarded with calm scrutiny by a mantis , but to know that these quarterinch bugs were looking at me was even more trying . I have now come to the conclusion that the munchings on the leaves constitute to the bugs a kind of hieroglyphic alphabet , and that they leave thus warning of danger to those who shall Come after them . At any rate , the markings are not unlike the demotic writing of the Egyptians . All this goes to prove that they are far superior in intelligence to flies , for I have never known a fly to get out of the way when looked at . I would rather have them eat a good clean piece of my leaves than disfigure them so , but what am I to dol They go on their own way , crawling up the stem instead of flying , and I think they may be the new bug invented for this year to balance the account with the new machines . On the way down the path made by the dragged brush I find lying helpless a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back by the twigs as they were dragged carelessly over himso hurt that he makes no movement as I pick him up to examine . His little life is over , though the lidless eyes are as bright as ever ; concussion of the spine is as fatal to him as to us , and hence a sort of pitiful sympathy is established between us . He does not eat leaves , so I have nothijig but pity for him as he lies in my hands with only a faint quiver of the fleeing life  --  a life that knew volition and desire , that moved with intention . Whither is it going , and can it diel The little red forked tongue is still flexile , though the jaws are set . It seems a pity , for he was taking an innocent walk when the sharp brush struck him . Or I come suddenly upon a forsaken birds ' nest jauntily swung from the horizontally projecting small poplar branches at some distance from their crotch , built outside of straw and torn-off strips of Yellow-Birch bark , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemlock . Or still another in the same situation , but with a lining // of straws , which must have been searched for in front of the barn . So much for chance acquaintances that I meet among my trees . Less than twen4y years ago , where my hanging wood now climbs high with great Canoe Birches and overtopping Cherries , and reaches out in Maples and Elms , there was an open slope of ploughed land lying in the furrow . It seems incredible as I work in it . Below , where the ground is soft with springs , lies my Alder grove . That was not in existence eight years ago . If the Alder has a chance to spread its branches , it will grow into a large bushy tree ; but if , as in this place , the stems spring close together , it grows steadily upward , seeking for light , its lower branches all dying as it goes . It is a pretty thing to go into an Alder clump like this and clear off all these dead twigs . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate clinking sound like the breaking of slender glass rods , or more like brittle sugar candy . Let them lie where they fall ; they make an excellent dry carpet for the feet as you step round among the trunks breaking the dry sticks , your mind full of the old ballad of Goody Blake and Harry Gill : " The moon was full and shining clearly ; Stick after stick did Goody pull ; He stood behind a rick of barley Till she had filled her apron full . " And then the catastrophe : " Then Goody , who had nothing said , Her bundle fioin hei ' lap let fall ; And kneeling on the sticks , she prayed To . God , who is the Jud*e of all ; She prayed , her withered hands uprearing , While Harry held her by the arm : God , who art never out of hearing " .... But we all know the old ballad , only it lies lost in our memory , hidden under a heap of less worthy things since we have grown , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , till I said it over and over to myself as I worked on the " Cathedral . " For when the dead twigs were all cleared away , hundreds of pillars rose straight up to where , high overhead , the green roof let in changing flecks of sunlight , and it seemed like Seville . On any hot day you can lie down there at full length on a carriage blanket , looking up ; the wind stirs , and every straight tall shaft rocks with it in a slumberous motion , while through the changing spaces of the swaying green roof brilliantly illuminated openings show the crystal blue of the sky . It is very good to be there then , and when you have had your fill of it you can walk between the pillars up the nave to where the largest Alder of them all , free near the head of the bank to spread itself out , stands like a great organ . I remember that in my childhood 's geographies one-third of a page was occupied with a picture of a Banyan-tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suppressed wish that our lot had not been cast in a country where only commonplace things grew . But it is not only the foreign Banyan that has the trick of growing into a grove ; for my big Alder , reaching out its lowest branches to touch the top of the bank , roots them there , and sends up a shoot with roots at every place where the branch has touched the moist earth , to grow into a new tree , making a Banyan grove for me , and finally , after so many years , relieving me of the carefully suppressed childish doubt as to the impartiality of the Creator . I know an Alder is not an Osier , and yet the two are inseparably connected in my imagination , which fact will account for the words floating in my mind : " Sabrina fair , Listen where thou art sitting , Under the glassy , cool , translucent wave , In twisted braids of lilies knitting The loose tress of thy amber-dropping hair . " All this rings through my head because the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows the Willow and the Osier dank , My sliding chariot stays , Thick-set with agate and the azure sheen Of turkis blue and emerald green That in the channel strays . " Of Willows the name is legion . The poorest kind of all , with its rough unsightly leaves and its dull ragged bark , grows cheerfully on in spite of worms that infest it , perhaps doing its part in mellowing the soil for something of more value , then struggling vainly afterwards with the Birches and fate . It stands no chance with the hard - wood trees , that drive their roots far off and down , taking all the sustenance there is , and by their more athletic growth soon overtopping the Willows , whose dead stems are left below to choke up the wood . One can hardly cut out too many of these , unless , indeed , she be planning for a screen , in // which case they may be left till something better shall grow . No one speaks a good word for them , and I have often thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may perhaps be grateful even to the green worms that deprive it of leaves , saying softly to itself , as it suffers , " Well , at any rate , it is good of the worms to like me a little , though it be only to hurt . " The shiny-leaved Willow is even pretty , growing as it does along the sides of the rivers , and at least looking clean . By the lines of Willow and Alder crossing the meadow you trace from afar the course of the brooks that " make a sudden sally , And sparkle out amid the fern , To bicker down the valley . " I should also at their signal begin to repeat , " A full-fed river , winding slow By herds upon an endless plain ; The ragged rims of thunder hrooding low , With shadow-streaks of rain , " only that at present the rivers are fullfed with sawdust from the steam-mills , and that rather chokes the impulse . As for my Weeping-Willow , it is an immigrant ; but having been relieved of the impetuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it than if it had not been a stranger , it is taking on beautiful lines and weeping to its heart 's content . Strange to say , when it was crowded and persecuted it stopped weeping , and tried with every one of its pendulous branches to struggle up . Not a bad lesson perhaps for those who are accustomed to find sermons in trees as well as in stones . I saw ruthlessly at the Willows that obstruct my Birches , getting slapped and snapped at viciously as I pull out the tortuous branches from their place ; for the Birches are an aristdcratic family in the best sense of the word , and accept graciously all the help that I give them towards air and sunlight . Some botanists are unable to distinguish the Black from the Yellow Birch ; I confess to a strong sympathy with them , and after much acquaintance I have come to the conclusion that of the two I have only the Yellow . It is of the shredded bark of this tree that the birds are so fond for nest - trimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to taste in its tender young buds and leaf - stalks , but also from its old bark in the well-grown trunks as the saw cuts , makes it very pleasant to deal with . " So does the fragrant Sandal bow In meek forgiveness to its doom , And o'er the axe , at every blow , Sheds in abundance rich perfume . " Thus ran the verse of the old hymn in my thought as I worked over and among them . The first verse is good too , coming up afterwards word by word from dim depths of memory : " Forgive thy foes , nor that alone , Their evil deeds with good repay ; Fill those with joy who leave thee none , And kiss the hand upraised to slay . " This Birch sends out its lower branches horizontally , reaching far in every direction , and bearing up its leaves as the dogwood does , like the outstretched hands of the Adorante . One distinguishing trait of these high-bred trees is their superb disdain for anything that is outworn . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives up its dead branches at the least pressure , letting go of them close to the trunk with a clean cleavage . It uses them till it has done with them , and then gives them up with no regret . The trunk of a young Yellow Birch is not very unlike that of the Wild Red Cherry , but you can tell them apart without looking , by the foolish persistency with which the Cherry holds to its dead branches . It is as if the Birch said , " Oh , I can make plenty more , and better than those ! " while the plebeian Cherry fears to let anything go , because it may once have been of value . This would be one reason why I should like the Birch , even were it not so very beautiful . But if the Yellow Birch is so attractive , what shall be said of the Canoe or Paper Birch , growing in companies of two or three , shooting skyward like a great white rocket , discarding its lower branches as it goes , and spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It goes high and free , as if it wanted to give all the smaller trees near it a chance for their own lives . When it is young . on its trunk , and always on its smaller brauches , it carries a finely marked brown bark ; but when it puts on its toga virilis of white , it is one of the most beautiful things that can be imagined or loved . You will not need to do much for that tree but to admire it , for it can take care of itself superbly . The smaller White Birch is not so common and not so impressive , its trunk not // so charming ; but it is always clean , and its sharply pointed , finely cut leaves , with their glandular spots , entitle it to the praise which I think Bryant gives it , of being the " ladyof the woods . " MyPurpie Birches are exotics , and have had to struggle with the climate , but are now growing fine and tall , and as they were set out with plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the Wild-Cherry I can say nothing but praise of its red-bronze bark and the way in which it climbs high , but further than that , it is a most exasperating tree . It will not let go of its multitude of dead branches , and a tall ladder and much work with the clipper are needed for the tree that must not be at once wholly condemned for the sake of other and better things . It grows fast , and does not take the pains to strike its roots deep , in some cases actually running them over the ground and sending up sh6ots at every node , and consequently it does not make good wood , nor can it count upon long life even if let severely alone . How often , as I have looked up to its feathery top plumage , have I addressed to it the Trenchant words , " Bear highly as thou wilt thy branches in the air , But that thy roots shall strike as deep in earth , take care The Cherry - trees persist in their own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I persist in wisely cutting down most of them . As to those that are spared for the sake of their plumy foliage , high over most of the other trees , each one costs an hour of hard labor in cutting off dead branches with the clipper , and in clearPig away afterwards from the ground the crooked and tangled mass of them into which I descend when I come down from the ladder , and which , branching at the most impossible angles , snap at me in face and eyes as I try to arrange them into something that can by courtesy be called a pile . It is as if they wanted to revenge themselves on me for my disparaging remarks , the smallness of the revenge being another proof of their low breeding . Thus most of my Wild-Cherries have been reduced to ignominious stumps . The bunches of transparent gum on the trunk recall childhood 's days , and are not unpleasant to the taste even now , while the prussic-acid odor , as the saw cuts its way through the trunk , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bring to bear on the fieldmice , who destroy my young Maples by carefully gnawing off the sweet bark all around the trunk , to partake of Cherry bark instead . Prussic acid ki , lls swiftly , and without much pain , I think , and it does seem too cruel to the tree which , asleep all the long winter , and joyfully awaking in the spring , makes ready to put forth its leaves only to discover that it is dead , and that the birds will no more build nests and sirg amnon g its branches . The field - mice are charming creatures ; when they get into the house by mistake in the summer and are caught , I let them out again , rejoicing to see them leap away ; but they might find some other food , it seems to me , than Sugar-Maple bark ! Saw on the upper side of the Cherry trunk , if possible , so that gravitation may aid in the fall . I know no more pleasing sound , when I have been at work long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have been obliged to stop several times , out of breath , and aching as to arms , than to hear the first sharp crack of fibres which announces that not much more personal labor will be needed , but that the great forces of nature are taking hold to throw it down . The comparison may seem ridiculous , but I think I never heard that first crack without thinking , " As falls on Mount Avernus A thunder-smitten oak , Far o'er the crashing forest The giant arms lie spread , And thepale au*urs , muttering low , Gaze on the blasted head . " The augurs have other business than to mutter in my wood ; they have to see to it that the tall crashing Cherry , as it goes down , shall do no harm to the little Maples and Poplars , to say nothing of the Elms and Birches that may happen to be in the vicinity . Of Poplars there are many varieties . At a distance the bark might be easily mistaken for that of a Maple , but the bark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that the clean Maple knows nothing of . The color of both is like the old weather-worn fences that still close in some of the fields  --  a sort of blue-gray . They are fast growers , and thus do not make very good wood . That they quiver with the wind when other trees are still is due to the fact of the flatness of the stem where it joins the leaf , giving the // slightest zephyr a hold , like ships with their sails widespread for a calm . As far as the eye can determine , they , the Maples and the Willows , spring often from one and the same seed , for they grow so closely together that it seems as if no other fact could account for it . They are pretty in clumps for a screen , and they try to imitate White Birch leaves , but in this they do not succeed . The Balm of Gilead , with its strong odor , is one of them , as also the tall and straightly folded Lombardy , formerly so much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , ai-e exotics , though they take kindly to the soil , and are the wonder of the farmers for their rapid growth . They do not care to dig deep with their roots , but go trailing them incredible distances , just under the surface , sending up shoot after shoot . I have a little one that has grown eight feet high in two years , and still keeps on . They are very pretty to stand , like Frederick William 's tall grenadier guards , sentinels at the side of the entrance gates , where I have put them . Trees that command respect and must be saved , whatever else is sacrificed , are the Ash , " for nothing ill , " with its curdled bark , its wood fine-grained and elastic , and the Elm , which , if it have room , is sure to grow on steadily into a sheaf of drooping , well - furnished boughs . The Linden grows freely , with enormous leaves and a clean smooth bark of two shades of gray . It will not let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they must be sawed or cut . I fail to see why Birch twigs should have gained such a reputation as a corrector . If the rod is to be applied to the fool 's back , I should recommend strongly that it be cut from the Red Cherry or the Linden . Because I have so many Maples , I cut them sometimes for the sake of a promising Linden , though it grieves me to do so ; for the Maple , of whatever variety , is perhaps the most human and individual of trees . Spenser gives it the character of being " seeldom inward sound , " but he had never seen our American forests . Those who know the Sugar-Maple only as an ornamental shade tree for lawns would hardly recognize it in its native woods , where it goes up a hundred feet high , immense and straight , with no boughs to its rough trunk for the height of , say , forty feet or more . These giants are voL . XCIII. - No. 550-66 specimens of the survival of the fittest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the light , casting off all lower boughs in their sure purpose to reach it , and finally , as they wax stronger and stronger , sending vast roots so far in search of food as to kill out all surrounding growths . Even the little saplings make hard wood , difficult to saw , fine-grained , and beautifully white , and the large trees yield the curly maple , so dear to the furniture manufacturer . When young , the Maple is a little obstinate and bigoted about letting go of its outworn branches , but in every other respect it is a delight , with its strongly built , smooth , cool leaves , individually beautiful , and the great masses of them with which it clothes its gray branches , giving wonderful depths of shade for the artist . There is no small job that pays better than trimming uu a young SugarMaple . The cutting off of the lower branches transforms it from a bush to a tree at once , and it has such an air of being grateful that it is a pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his skirts , has been allowed to put on trousers , and takes on much the same air that he does of sudden importance . The Rock - Maple does not grow to a great size , but yields the bird's-eye maplewood . The leaf is more succulent and of a more graceful shape , though not so strong . Then comes the Moosewood for another variety , with its exquisite bark , smooth as satin even on trees of considerable size , and marked with green Javanese figures on a dark gray ground , so pleasing that I have done such a thing as to cut down twenty Sugar-Maple shoots to give one Moosewood room and breathing-space . This was a great tribute paid to it , and I hope that the tree will reimburse me for the sacrifice by excellent growth in the future . It has a large , only three-lobed leaf , but the unmistakable maple character . Neither the White Maple nor the Cut-leaved variety grows in my woods , though of the latter I have many fine examples , imported , but evidently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they remind me of the traveller who complained that " the streets were so broad and the lanes were so iiarrow , " for they are all either too big or too little for me to do anything with theru . The former , from the individual leaves with their exquisite texture and // the rightly drawn lines of their ribs , to what Thoreau calls their " clean bole and well-turned instep , " are a delight to look at , and I would sit under them for hours if it were not for the multitude of tender seedlings which would be crushed by the pressure . They grow luxuriantly where they choose , but are apt to resent to the death attempts to transplant them . The wonderful vitality of most trees is shown in one corner of my hanging wood , into which the merciless woodcutters were turned loose some ten years ago to cut down everything close to the ground . That corner is now full of crowding clumps of young trees fifteen aI ) d twenty feet high , growing thick in circles round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old roots . The lithe trunks of the smaller ones crowd and push , winding round among each other like snakes , and many the Willow , Linden , and Poplar , where one might have expected such a result , but Maples , Birches , and even Elms are growing there in the same wanton way . Pine , Hemlock , Fir , and Spruce I find among them , but choked down generally by the harder trees , with which it is no use for them to try to struggle . Sometimes I give them room , but oftenest have to confine my efforts to taking off their dead and ragged boughs , to make them feel a little respectable . Among all the masses of other trees the Wild Apple with its thorny boughs thrusts itself heavy with fruit , and my Butternuts grow well at the top of " the dreadful hollow behind the little wood . " These two can take care of themselves , which they do in a very viragoish way ; so also what is known here as the Green Osier-I fancy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same way , and the leaves resemble it . The Mountain-Ash-not an Ash , however , but a Rose-needs the many shoots to be cut that spring from the root if we are ever to be able to sing to it , " Thy leaves are aye the first of Spring , thy flowers the Simmer 's pride , There is na sic a bonnie tree in a ' the country 's side , 0 Rowan-tree I " If I add to the friends already mentioned the Larch , growing luxuriantly , the Mountain-Maple bush , the Choke-Cherry , the Wild Black Cherry , and the Leverwood , with its hoplike seeds , my list will not compare unfavorably as to number with that of Chaucer : " The bilder ook , and eek the hardy asshe ; The piler elm , the cofre unto careyne ; The boxtree piper , holm to whippes lasshe ; The sayling firr ; the cipres , deth to pleyne ; The sheter ew ; the asp for shaftes pleyne ; The olyve of pees , and eek the drunken vyne , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with Spenser 's imitation , so often criticised by English writers as unreasonably numerous : " The sayling Pine ; the Cedar proud and tall ; The vine-propp Elme ; the Poplar never dry ; The builder Oake , sole king of forrests all ; The Aspine good for staves ; the ( ypresse fo-nerall ; The Laurell , meed of mightie Conquerours And Poets sage ; the Firre that weepeth still The Eugh obedient to the benders will ; The Birch for shaftes ; the Sallow for the mill* The Mirihe , sweete bleeding in the hitter wound ; The warlike Beech ; the Ash , for nothing ill ; The fruitful Olive , and the Platane round ; The carver Hohne ; the Maple , seeldom inward sound . " And yet my friends who did not know a Chestnut when they saw it remarked on the little variety of the trees in this region ! No wonder , for the Rule of Three and the Integral Calculus must appear not unlike to those who recognize neither . It must be confessed that Henry Vaughan 's angels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " might find difficulty here , for there are no Junipers , and in the whole large township only four ' Oaks , of which I own three , and I am fearful that they are too small for the convenience of any angels . But their leaves are already quite as immense as those of the largest " monarchs of the forest " ; and as for trunk and branches , they will have them to match in a hundred years more , for which I make no question that the angels can wait . On the south and west edges of the hanging wood my Clematis plunges wild in fountains and cataracts with its white blossoms and feathery , tufted seeds , binding together the tops of the waistdeep ferns , making long wreaths with the Golden-Rod , so strong and tangled that one might lean back upon its ropy stems without being allowed to fall , and finally ending its wild chase by rushing up the L // rough trunk of a solitary Lombardy Poplar , and embracing it for more than half its height with arms full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over its ocean of blossoms , blue mountains bound the whole horizon . Away up in my big forest , above the hanging wood in which I have been finding so much pleasure and profit , where , I am afraid , more vigorous arms and other implements than saw and clipper will be needed , there where the great maples stand and the beeches spread their strong arms , I think there is the most beautiful thing I have seen this summer . It is a massive beech trunk , cut off say four feet from the ground , which stands firm , leaning to the south , clasping the earth by six mighty roots . Green mosses , soft and velvety , cover it on the north side to the height of three feet , and the chips of fine wood that flew from it when it was cut lie still undecayed at its side . It was not of those old trees which , having no life but in their heads , like some old people , die wholly at the stroke of the axe ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old stump was alive in its heart , and when spring surged in its roots it put forth leaves with a superb abandon all around its top from beneath the rough outer bark-leaves not like those of the usual Beech , quite straight and exquisitely proper in vein and color , but a riot of light and succulent greenery , crisp and curling like lettuce , a great circle of them , like a woven wreath laid on the sloping top of the pedestal by some reverent hand to greet every day the summer sun as he swings across the meridian . I think of it and of my friendly trees in the winter nights when the snow lies deep , printed in every direction by myriads of little feet , and the frosty moon shines clear . In the silence there is a sudden sound as some one of the birch branches that I left unwittingly in the maze of tossing foliage drops sharply to the earth with a muffled sound . Then I am almost inclined to forgive the field-mice for their gnawing ; but not quite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are therefore what we call solids . I think the trees may be pictures of the different thoughts of God . If , like King David , we would " find out a place for the temple of the Lord , " still comes to mind the answering verse of the psalm , " Lo , we heard of the same at Ephrata , and found it in the wood . "
