txt Capt . MAHAN treats of certain " Current Fallacies Upon Naval Subjects " in Harper 's Magazine for June , in an article which , from the point of view of the editor of that periodical , may be called fortunate in its subject , its author , and the time of publication . It is an article that will not only be read with interest in official and professional circles , but is of value as an aid to the formation of right opinions among the people who , as they are represented in Congress , have not been easily convinced of the urgency of those naval preparations in which we now find ourselves so deficient . The chief fallacy combated in Capt . MAHAN 's article is that involved in the familiar assertion that the United States needs a navy " for defense only , " meaning defense in its narrowest sense , the protection of our coasts and harbors against the attack of an enemy . Capt . MAHAN broadens the significance of the word defense to make it include defense of our just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself satisfied with the policy of a navy for defense only . To illustrate his meaning he asserts that the exclusion of direct European control from the Isthmus of Panama is as clearly a matter of National defense as the protection of New York Harbor ; that if Germany should seek to detach from Brazil her growing colony in that republic , and aid it to get free and become a part of the Fatherland , as we aided Texas to get free from Mexico , or if she should absorb Holland , and so come into possession of the Island of Curacao , where CERVERA , coaled the other day , we might feel deeply solicitous about the Monroe Doctrine , and apprehend peril to our National interests . But " what objection can we urge , or what can we do with a navy ' for defense only , ' in the military sense of the word defense " ? Capt . MAHAN refers to the principle universally accepted among masters of military and naval art that " mere defensive war means military ruin , and therefore National disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of making it logically easy for the partisans of the navy-for-defense-only policy to accept his view . The most beneficial use of military force , he observes , is not to wage war but to prevent war . A navy maintained merely to defend our coast line and incapable of sallying forth to do harm would be left quite out of the account in diplomatic negotiations , and so would deter nobody from making war on us . The power to hurt inspires fear , and this brings Capt . MAHAN to a most important point in his argument . In order to act as an effective deterrent the power to hurt need by no means be increased to the degree where it bcomes the power to destroy any and every assailant . That is to say , we do not need a navy as powerful as Great Britain in order to defend our territory and our interests against Great Britain , for the simple reason that she can not afford to send against us her entire force , nor even one-half of it . " Suppose , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty days . and that we had threatening trouble with either Germany , France , Great Britain , or Russia . There is not one of them except Great Britain that could afford to send over here twenty-five battleships , which would be the very fewest needed , seeing the distance of their operations from home , while we have friendly ports ; while Great Britain , relying wholly on her navy for the integrity of her empire , equally can not afford the hostility of a Nation having twenty battleships and with whom her points of difference are as inconsequential to her as they are with us . " The teaching of that illustration is that if we keep a strong navy and live justly we need fear no war . The point as to the relative strength of our navy is of very great importance . We may easily persuade our short-sighted statesmen of the West that a navy of twenty battle .. ships and the necessary complement of lighter craft is necessary for the National defense . We could not induce them to vote appropriations for fifty battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy the navy of Great Britain . While the lessons of the war with Spain are yet fresh . in the Congressional mind and practical evidence may be cited to show the terrible cost of our weakness on the sea , it is reasonable to expect that provision may be made for a navy proportioned to our dignity and our interests as a Nation . In view of the debates sure to be bed on that question , in which the statesmen of Kansas and Nebraska will cheerfully refute maxims of war accepted by every professional writer , it is interesting to note Capt . MAHAN 's exposure of the fallacy about warships becoming obsolete . It is a favorite belief of the opponents of navy building that the accepted types of vessels change so swiftly that ships costing millions become " obsolete " before they are launched . The pressing into service of our old monitors , although it was done after Capt . MAHAN 'S article was written , perfectly illustrates his view . A ship of war may be superseded in the first line of battle by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thereby lose all value nor is it cast aside . It takes its place in the reserve , or is assigned to some duty where it relieves a better ship . In either case the navy is the stronger for the change . Nor are the changes in naval construction so sudden and revolutionary as the laity imagine . On this point the high authority of Capt . MAHAN gives his opinions unusual interest : " The day can be recalled when the broadside battleship was considered as dead as Cock Rabin  --  her knell was rung and herself buried without honors ; yet not only has she revived , but I imagine that I should have a very respectable following among naval officers now in believing , as I do , that the broadside guns and not those in the turrets are the primary battery of the ship  --  primary , I mean , in fighting value . Whatever the worth of this opinion  --  which is immaterial to the present contention  --  a change so radical as from broadside battery to turreted ships and from the latter back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should cause some reasonable hesitancy in Imputing obsoleteness to any armored steamship . The present battleships reproduce , in essential principles , the ships that preceded the epoch-making Monitor  --  the pivot guns of the earlier vessels being represented by the present turrets , and their broadside by the present broadside . The prevalence of the Monitor type was an interlude powerfully affecting the development of navies , but making nothing obsolete . " The one lesson thus far drawn from the present war is the importance of good gunnery . , Straight shooting is a well-nigh irresistible advantage over even a stronger enemy whose shots go wild . The need of ships that can steam 19 knots and fight anything they can catch is demonstrated also by the present situation in West Indian waters . A third matter , not exactly a lesson , but a question to be answered , concerns the efficiency of warships in destroying really formidable coast defenses . That question was not answered to our satisfaction at San Juan .                @ @ @ @ @
