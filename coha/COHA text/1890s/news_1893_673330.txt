txt Alarmed by the exposures by THE New York TIMES of reckless mismanagement and aroused to a realization of the necessity forimmediate action by the threats of criminal prosecution emanating from depositors , the Directors of the suspended Commercial Bank in Brooklyn yesterday put forth a hastily-formulated plan for resumption . In giving out the plan , David . Barnett , the bank 's counsel , expressed the hope that it would be agreeable to all the depositors . The present stockholders are to be assessed for an amount equal to the par value of their stock . This is the requirement of law in all cases like that of the Commercial , where the capital stook and surplus are entirely wiped out . In addition , the stockholders are to be assessed for the purpose of providing a surplus at the outset , the assessment to be to the extent of from one-quarter to one-half the par value of their new stock . The present depositors are asked to take one-half of their deposits in stock in the bank . The rest of their deposit they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months , or longer if necessary . The capital of the bank maybe increased from $200,000 to $250,000 , in the option of the depositors . " The plan for resumption has not been fully matured , " said Mr. Barnett . " What the surplus will be fixed at has not yet been settled It will depend somewhat on how favorably the plan is received . " By adopting this plan . " continued Mr. Barnett , " the stockholders will have a chance to get a part of their money back . As it is now , if the receiver winds up the affairs of the bank they will lose their stock and probably bo called upon for an amount nearly equal to the par to pay off the depocitors . By joining in this plan they will secure a stock which ought to be worth 100 cents on the dollar . The depositors will have their deposits in a bank which is starting out with a large and unimpaired capital alley will secure a stock which they can sell on the open market for at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will avoid the long delay which a receivership makes necessary before they could secure all their money . It will save a great deal of time , probably several years , for the assets of this bank must be turned into money before the receiver can disburse them to the depositors , and the law 's delays are , as you know , very tedious . " If the project is carried through , and I hope it will be , the new stockholders will have a chance to elect a new Board of Directors and so arrange that the bank can be carried on in the future as they desire . " It is thought that the plan , if carried out , will prove very advantageous to the depositors , since it will convert them into shareholders , and give them all a strong personal interest in the bank . " It is not anticipated , " said Mr. Barnett , in conclusion , " that the smaller depositors will care to invest in the new stock of the bank . " It was understood yesterday in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank 's counsel , was the result of a compromise between President Keettey and his friends and those of the Directors who desire to gat out of the bank entirely and separate themselves from all further connection with or responsibility for its affairs . Several of the Directors have openly offered to give their stook away since the failure , and one of the Directors , John H. Rowland , was quoted by his friends as being willing to part with his $14,000 in stock not only without price , but with a bonus of $2,000 to any one who would accept it and assume the responsibilities that went with it . It was said yesterday that the plan for resumption was the work of Receiver Dykman and was intended to give certain Directors a chance to close up their responsibilities at once by a transfer of their stock to friends of the President , who had been induced to agree to come in under a reorganization . It was announced that the plan for resumption would be presented . to the depositors at their meeting to-morrow night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustus Haviland , after he had learned the outlines of the plan , " the credit will lie with THE NEW-YORK TIMES . It is the only paper that has exposed the way in which the bank was conducted . If it had not revealed the discrepancies between the books of the bank and the June quarterly report and between that report and the report of Superintendent Preston of the State Banking Department there would never have been any resumption . By its exposures THE TIMES has forced the Commercial Directors to attempt to resume . THE TIMES has increased its influence in Brooklyn by its course in this matter . " The plan of resumption did not seem to be regarded with favor by the depositors . " It will never be accepted . by the depositors in anything like its present shape , " said one of those whose money is tied up in the suspended bank . " it asks the depositors to convert one-half of their deposits into stock . By doing this they not only loSe the use of one-half of their money , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will be responsible for twice the value of their stock in case the reorganized institution is not successful . " Take the case of a man who has $1,000 on deposit . He leaves $500 indefinitely on deposit and turns $500 into stock . He thus does not get back any of his $1,000 , but he takes on himself a contingent liability for $500 over and above the sum of his present deposit . It is like putting up $1,500 to save $500 . " Most of the Commercial depositors are contractors and builders . They depended on their funds in the bank to carry on their operations , and very many of them were put to serious trouble by the suspension . What they need is the ready money which they were calculating to draw out the Saturday the bank failed . It will not relieve them to have their money stay indefinitely on deposit . They can not pay off their employes with bank stock . " Receiver William N. Dykman took hold of the bank yesterday formally . Through his paper , President Keeney yesterday gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promissory note for $10,000 which he had put in the bank safe four years ago . There were eight of these notes , and they were drawn by the Directors in 1889 to make up a large impairment of the bank 's capital through the operations of George L. . Hassell . ' If these notes , made payable on demand , " said Horace Groves , attorney for several of the depositors , yesterday . " had been paid before the ' bank failed , and during the financial stringency , and if the Directors bad called in their own discounted notes for about $53,000 which were outstanding , the Commercial might have been tided over its troubles . There would have been added to its available funds $133,000 . " The way iu which President Keeney paid his note for $10,000 was by giving a check to the receiver for that amount on the Long Island Loan and Trust Company , of which he is a , Director . The receiver announced yesterday that be was sending ( ) lathe other ten-thousand. - dollar notes for collection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends by his continued silence under the serious charges of President Keeney that he took $25,000 of the latter 's personal bonds from the Commercial safe and gave them to the Bank of New-York ; and also gave to the Bank of New-York , on the eve of the failure . without the knowledge of President Keeney and the Directors ; $314,000 in discounted notes . " I have known John J. Vail intimately for many years , " said John A. Schilling of 429 Fifth Avenue , Brooklyn , one of the depositors , " and he was not the man to take those securities or bonds without the knowledge and consent of President Keeney . Vail is as honest as the day is long . He was always looking after the interests of the bank and he brought in a great many depositors . He lived quietly , and had no bad . habits . He gave twenty-five years of his life to the bank , and ie now thrown out with the charges of President Keevey flung after him . I shall want more evidence than this that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge or consent of the owner .
