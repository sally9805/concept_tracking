CHEERFUL YESTERDAYS. y . THE FUGITIVE SLAVE PERIOD . " I canna think the preacher himself wad be heading the mob , the ' the time has been they have been as forward in a bruilzie as their neighbors. " - SCOTT 'S The Heart of Alidlothian . NOTHING did more to strengthen my anti-slavery zeal , about 1848 , than the frequent intercourse with Whittier and his household , made possible by their nearness to Newburyport . It was but a short walk or drive of a few miles from my residence to his home ; or , better still , it implied a sail or row up the beautiful river , passing beneath the suspension bridge at Deer Island , to where the woods called " The Laurels " spread themselves on one side , and the twin villages of Salisbury and Amesbury on the other . There was something delightful in the position of the poet among the village people : he was their pride and their joy , yet he lived as simply as any one , was careful and abstemious , reticent rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-of-fact ground . He could sit on a barrel and discuss the affairs of the day with the people who came to the " store , " but he did not read them his poetry . I was once expressing regrets for his ill health , in talking with one of the leading citizens of Amesbury , and found that my companion could not agree with me ; he thought that Whittier 's ill health had helped him in the end , for it had " kept him from engaging in business , " and had led him to writing poetry , which had given him reputation outside of the town . That poetry was anything but a second choice , perhaps a necessary evil , did not seem to have occurred to my informant . Had he himself lost his health and been unable to sell groceries , who knows but he too might have taken up with the Muses ? It suggested the Edinburgh citizen who thought that Sir Walter Scott might have been " sic a respectable mon " had he stuck to his original trade of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry as well as his politics , nothing could have been more delightful than his plain abode with its exquisite Quaker neatness . His placid mother , rejoicing in her two gifted children , presided with few words at the hospitable board whose tablecloth and napkins rivaled her soul in whiteness ; and with her was the brilliant " Lizzie , " so absolutely the reverse , or complement , of her brother that they seemed between them to make one soul . She was as plain in feature as he was handsome , except that she had a pair of great luminous dark eyes , always flashing with fun or soft with emotion , and often changing with lightning rapidity from one expression to another ; her nose was large and aquiline , while his was almost Grecian , and she had odd motions of the head , so that her glances seemed shot at you , like sudden javelins , from each side of a prominent outwork . Her complexion was sallow , not rich brunette like his ; and whereas he spoke seldom and with some difficulty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as much as by anybody , so that he really appeared to have transferred to her the expression of his own opinions . The lively utterances thus came with double force upon the auditor , and he could not fail to go out strengthened and stimulated . Sometimes the Whittiers had guests ; and " Lizzie " delighted to tell how their mother was once met at the door by two plump maidens who announced that they had come from Ohio mainly to see her son . She explained that he was in Boston . No matter ; they would come in and await // his return . But lie might be away a week . No matter ; they would willingly wait that time for such a pleasure . So in they came . They proved to be Alice and Pha*be Cary , whose earlier poems , which had already preceded them , were filled with dirges and despair ; but they were the merriest of housemates , and ns the poet luckily returned next day , they stayed as long as they pleased , and were welcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed in those trying days . The Fugitive Slave Law had just passed , arid a year or two after Garrison had proudly showed a row of escaped negroes sitting on the platform of an anti-slavery convention , and had defied the whole South to reclaim them , these very men were fleeing to Canada for their lives . When the storm first broke , on February 15 , 1851 , in the arrest of Shadrach , Boston had a considerable colored population , which handled his rescue with such unexpected skill and daring that it almost seemed as if Garrison were right ; yet it took but a few days for their whole force to be scattered to the winds . The exact story of the Shadrach rescue has never been written . The account which appears most probable is that on the day of the arraignment of the alleged fugitive , the fact was noted in a newspaper by a colored man of great energy and character , employed by a firm in Boston and utterly unconnected with the Abolitionists . He asked leave of absence , and strolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door and had been excluded ; but he , being known and trusted , was admitted , and the others , making a rush , followed in behind him with a hubbub of joking and laughter . There were but a few constables on duty , and it suddenly struck this leader , as he and his followers passed near the man under arrest , that they might as well keep on and pass out at the opposite door , taking among them the man under arrest , who was not handcuffed .. After a moment 's beckoning the prisoner saw his opportunity , fell in with the jubilant procession , and amid continued uproar was got outside the Court-House , when the crowd scattered in all directions . It was an exploit which , as has been well said , would hardly have furnished a press item had it been the case of a pickpocket , yet was treated at Washington as if it had shaken the nation . Daniel Webster called it " a case of treason ; " President Fillmore issued a special proclamation ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to the Fugitive Slave Law , so as to settle the question " whether the government of white men is to be yielded to a government of blacks . " More curious even than this was the development of anti-slavery ethics that followed . The late Richard H. Dana , the counsel for various persons arrested as accomplices in the rescue of Shadrach , used to tell with delight this tale of a juryman impaneled on that trial . To Dana 's great surprise , the jury had disagreed concerning one client whose conviction he had expected ; and this surprise was all the greater because new and especial oaths had been administered to the jurymen , pledging them to have no conscientious scruples against convicting , so that it seemed as if every one with a particle of anti-slavery sympathy must have been ruled out . Years after , Dana encountered in a country farmhouse the very juryman whose obstinacy had saved his client , and learned that his unalterable reason for refusing to condemn was that he himself had taken a hand in the affair , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concord . I fear I must admit that while it would have been a great pleasure to me to have lent a hand in Shadrach 's rescue , this feeling did not come wholly from moral conviction , but from an impulse perhaps hereditary in the blood . Probably I got from my two soldier and sailor grandfa // . thers an intrinsic love of adventure which haunted me in childhood , and which threescore and thirteen years have by no means worn out . So far as I can now analyze it , this early emotion was not created by the wish for praise alone , but was mainly a boyish desire for a stirring experience . No man so much excited my envy during my whole college life as did a reckless Southern law student , named Winfield Scott Belton , who , when the old Vassall House in Cambridge was all in flames , and the firemen could not reach the upper story with their ladders , suddenly appeared from within at an attic window , amid the smoke , and pointed out to them the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fires ; but after this the trophies of Belton would not suffer me to sleep , and I often ran miles towards a light in the horizon . But the great opportunity never occurs twice , and the nearest I ever came to it was in being one of several undergraduates to bring the elder Professor Henry Ware out of his burning house . It was not much of a feat , - we afterwards risked ourselves a great deal more to bring some trays of picklejars from the cellar , - but in the case of the venerable doctor the object was certainly worth all it cost us ; for he was the progenitor of that admirable race upon which , as Dr. Holmes said to Professor Stowe , the fall of Adam had not left the slightest visible impression . This combination of motives was quite enough to make me wish that if there should be another fugitive slave case I might at least be there to see , and , joining the Vigilance Committee in Boston , I waited for such an occasion . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to be followed by another . One day in April , 1851 , a messenger came to my house in Newburyport and said briefly , " They have arrested another fugitive slave in Boston , and wish you to come . " I went back with him that afternoon , and found the Vigilance Committee in session in the Liberator office . It is impossible to conceive of a set of men , personally admirable , yet less fitted on the whole than this committee to undertake any positive action in the direction of forcible resistance to authorities . In the first place , half of them were non-resistants , as was their great leader , Garrison , who stood composedly by his desk preparing his next week 's editorial , and almost exasperating the more hotheaded among us by the placid way in which he looked beyond the rescue of an individual to the purifying of a nation . On the other hand , the " political Abolitionists , " or Free-Soilers , while personally full of indignation , were extremely anxious not to be placed for one moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be relied upon for action were a few whose temperament prevailed over the restrictions of non-resistance on the one side , and of politics on the other ; but of course their discussion was constantly damped by the attitude of the rest . All this would not , however , apply to the negroes , it might well seem ; they had just proved their mettle , and would doubtless do it again . On my saying this in the meeting , Lewis Hayden , the leading negro in Boston , nodded cordially and said , " Of course they will . " Soon after , drawing me aside , he startled me by adding , " I said that for bluff , you know . We do not wish any one to know how really weak we are . Practically there are no colored men in Boston ; the Shadrach prosecutions have scattered them all . What is to be done must be done without them . " Here was a blow indeed ! What was to be done ? The next day showed that absolutely nothing could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred armed policemen in and around the Court - House . Only authorized persons could get within ten feet of the building . Chains were placed across the doors , and beneath these even the judges , entering , had to // stoop . The United States court - room was up two high and narrow flights of stairs . Six men were at the door of the court-room . The prisoner , a slender boy of seventeen , sat with two strong men on each side and five more in the seat behind him , while none but his counsel could approach him in front . ( All this I take from notes made at the time . ) The curious thing was that although there was a state law of 1843 prohibiting every Massachusetts official from taking any part in the restoration of a fugitive slave , yet nearly all these employees were Boston policemen , acting , so the city marshal told me , under orders from the mayor and aldermen . Under these circumstances there was clearly nothing to be done at the trial itself . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those few among us who really , so to speak , meant business . I remember consulting Ellis Gray Loring , the most eminent lawyer among the Abolitionists , as to the possibility of at least gaining time by making away with the official record from the Southern court , a document which lay invitingly at one time among lawyers ' papers on the table . Again , I wrote a letter to my schoolmate Charles Devens , the United States marshal , imploring him to resign rather than be the instrument of sending a man into bondage , - a thing actually done by one of the leading Boston policemen . It is needless to say to those who knew him that he answered courteously and that he reserved his decision . No other chance opening , it seemed necessary to turn all attention to an actual rescue of the prisoner from his place of confinement . Like Shadrach , Thomas Sims was not merely tried in the United States Court-House , but imprisoned there , because the state jail was not opened to him as he had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no jail in Boston . In the previous case , an effort had been made to obtain permission to confine the fugitive slave at the Navy Yard , but Commodore Downes had refused . Sims , therefore , like Shadrach , was kept at the Court-House . Was it possible to get him out ? There was on Tuesday evening a crowded meeting at Tremont Temple , at which Horace Mann presided . I hoped strongly that some result might come from this meeting , and made a vehement speech there myself , which , as Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe honored me by saying , was bringing the community to the verge of revolution , when a lawyer named Charles Mayo Ellis protested against its tone , and threw cold water upon all action . It was evident that if anything was done , it must be done by a very few . I looked round , during the meeting , for a band of twenty-five men from Marlborough , who had seemed to me to show more fighting quality than the rest , but they had probably gone home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following plan . The room where Sims was confined , being safe by reason of its height from the ground , had no gratings at the windows . The colored clergyman of Boston who alone had the opportunity to visit Sims , Mr. Grimes , agreed to arrange with him that at a specified hour that evening he should go to a certain window , as if for air , - for he had the freedom of the room , - and should spring out on mattresses which we were to bring from a lawyer 's office across the way ; we also providing a carriage in which to place him . All was arranged , - the message sent , the mattresses ready , the carriage engaged as if for an ordinary purpose ; and behold ! in the dusk of that evening , two of us , strolling through Court Square , saw men busily at work fitting iron bars across this safe third-story window . Whether we had been betrayed , or whether it was simply a bit of extraordinary precaution , we never knew . Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " It is always best to take for // granted that your opponent is at least as smart as you yourself are . " This , evidently , we had not done . I knew that there was now no chance of the rescue of Sims . The only other plan that had been suggested was that we should charter a vessel , place it in charge of Austin Bearse , a Cape Cod sea-captain and one of our best men , and take possession of the brig Acorn , on which Sims was expected to be placed . This project was discussed at a small meeting in Theodore Parker 's study , and was laid aside as impracticable , not because it was piracy , but because there was no absolute certainty that the fugitive would be sent South in that precise way . As no other plan suggested itself , and as I had no wish to look on , with my hands tied , at the surrender , I went back to my home in deep chagrin . The following extract from a journal written soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period - " It left me with the strongest impressions of the great want of preparation , on our part , for this revolutionary work . Brought up as we have all been , it takes the whole experience of one such case to educate the mind to the attitude of revolution . It is so strange to find one 's self outside of established institutions ; to be obliged to lower one 's voice and conceal one 's purposes ; to see law and order , police and military , on the wrong side , and find good citizenship a sin and bad citizenship a duty , that it takes time to prepare one to act coolly and wisely , as well as courageously , in such an emergency . Especially this is true among reformers , who are not accustomed to act according to fixed rules and observances , but to strive to do what seems to themselves best , without reference to others . The Vigilance Committee meetings were a disorderly convention , each having his own plan or theory , perhaps stopping even for anecdote or disquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most unflinching unity in action . . . . Our most reliable men were non - resistants , and some who were otherwise were the intensest visionaries . Wendell Phillips was calm and strong throughout ; I never saw a finer gleam in his eyes than when drawing up that stirring handbill at the anti-slavery office . " During the months which followed , I attended anti-slavery conventions ; wrote editorially for the newly established Commonwealth , the Boston organ of the Free Soil party ; and had also a daily " Independent Column " of my own in the Newburyport Union , a liberal Democratic paper . No other fugitive slave case occurred in New England for three years . The mere cost in money of Sims s surrender had been vast ; the political results had been the opposite of what was intended , for the election of Charles Sumner to the United States Senate practically followed from it . The whole anti-slavery feeling at the North was obviously growing stronger , yet there seemed a period of inaction all round , or of reliance on ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Worcester , into a strong anti-slavery community of which my " Free Church " was an important factor . Fugitives came sometimes to the city , and I have driven them at midnight to the farm of the veteran Abolitionists , Stephen and Abby Kelley Foster , in the suburbs of the city . Perhaps the most curious case with which we had to deal was that of a pretty young woman , apparently white , with two perfectly white children , all being consigned to me by the Rev. Samuel May , then secretary of the Boston Anti-Slavery Society , and placed by him , for promptness of transportation to Worcester , under the escort of a Worcester merchant , thoroughly proslavery in sympathy , and not having the slightest conception that he was violating the laws in finding a seat for his charge and holding the baby on his knee . We had them in our care all winter . It was one of those cases of romantic incident // which slavery yielded . She was the daughter of her former master , and was the mistress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read and write , but was perfectly ladylike , modest , and grateful . She finally married a tradesman near Boston , who knew her story , and she disappeared in the mass of white population , where we were content to leave her untraced . All this minor anti-slavery work ended when , on Thursday evening , May 25 , 1854 , I had a letter by private messenger from the same Samuel May just mentioned , saying that a slave had been arrested , and the case was to be heard on Saturday morning ; that a meeting was to be held on Friday evening at Faneuil Hall , and it was important that Worcester should be well represented . Mr. A. B. Alcott also came thither on the same errand . I sent messages to several persons , and especially to a man of remarkable energy , named Martin Stowell , who had taken part in a slave rescue at Syracuse , New York , urging them to follow at once . Going to Boston on the morning train , I found myself presently in a meetbig of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proved so disappointing three years before . There was not only no plan of action , but no set purpose of united action . This cnn be imagined when I say that at one moment when there seemed a slight prospect of practical agreement , some one came in to announce that SuttIe and his men , the slave-catchers , were soon to pass by , and proposed that we should go out and gaze at them , " pointing the finger of scorn , " - as if Southern slave-catchers were to be combated by such weapons . This , however , had an effect in so far that the general committee adjourned , letting those alone remain who were willing to act personally in f orcible resistance . This reduced our sixty down to thirty , of whom I was chosen chairman . Dr. Howe was then called on to speak , and gave some general advice , very good and spirited . Two things were resolved on , - to send the names of those willing to act , and to have definite leadership . One leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached that point , so an executive committee of six was chosen at last , - Phillips , Parker , Howe , Kemp ( an energetic Irishman ) , Captain Bearse , and myself ; Stowell was added to these at my request . Even then it was inconceivably difficult to get the names of as many as twenty who would organize and obey orders . The meeting adjourned till afternoon , when matters were yet worse , - mere talk and discussion ; but it seemed to me , at least , that something must be done ; better a failure than to acquiesce tamely as before , and see Massachusetts henceforward made a hunting-ground for fugitive slaves . All hopes now rested on Stowell , who was to arrive from Worcester at six p . M. I met him at the train , and walked up with him . He heard the condition of affairs , and at once suggested a new plan as the only thing feasible . The man must be taken from the Court - House . It could not be done in cold blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public meeting , such as was to be held at Faneuil Hall that night . An attack at the end of the meeting would be hopeless , for the United States marshal would undoubtedly be looking for just that attempt , and would be reinforced accordingly ; this being , as we afterwards found , precisely what that official was planning . Could there not be an attack at the very height of the meeting , brought about in this way ? Let all be in readiness ; let a picked body be distributed near the Court House and Square ; then send some loud-voiced speaker , who should appear in the gallery of Fanenil Hall and announce that there was a mob of negroes already attacking the CourtHouse ; let a speaker , previously warned , - Phillips , if possible , - accept the opportunity promptly , and send the whole // meeting pell-mell to Court Square , ready to fall in behind the leaders and bring out the slave . The project struck me as an inspiration . I accepted it heartily , and think now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best plots that ever - failed . " Good plot , good friends , and full of expectation . " Why it came within an inch of success and still failed will next be explained . The first thing to be done - after providing a box of axes for attack on the Court-House doors , a thing which I personally superintended - was to lay the whole matter before the committee already appointed and get its concurrence . This committee was to meet in the ante-room of Fanenil Hall before the general meeting . As a matter of fact it never came together , for everybody was pushing straight into the hall . The moments passed rapidly . We caught first one member of the committee , then another , and expounded the plot . Some approved , others disapproved ; our stout sea - captain , distrusting anything to be attempted on land , utterly declining all part in it . Howe and Parker gave a hasty approval , and - only half comprehending , as it afterwards proved - were warned to be ready to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , but we sent urgent messages , which never reached him ; Kemp stood by us : and we had thus a clear majority of the committee , which , although it had been collectively opposed to the earlier plan of an attack at the end of the meeting , was yet now committed to a movement half way through by way of surprise . We at once found our gallery orator in the late John L. Swift , a young man full of zeal , with a stentonan voice , afterwards exercised stoutly for many years in Republican and temperance meetings . He having pledged himself to make the proposed announcement , it was only necessary to provide a nucleus of picked men to head the attack . Stowell , Kemp , and I were each to furnish five of these , and Lewis Hayden , the colored leader , agreed to supply ten negroes . So far all seemed ready , and the men were found as well as the general confusion permitted ; but the very success and overwhelming numbers of the Fanenil Hall meeting soon became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest gathering I ever saw in that hall . The platform was covered with men ; the galleries , the floor , even the outer stairways , were absolutely filled with a solid audience . Some came to sympathize , more to look on , - we could not estimate the proportion ; but when the speaking was once begun , we could no more communicate with the platform than if the Atlantic Ocean rolled between . There was then no private entrance to it , such as now exists , and in this seemingly slight architectural difference lay the failure of the whole enterprise , as will be presently seen . Those of us who had been told off to be ready in Court Square went there singly , not to attract* attention . No sign of motion or life was there , though the lights gleamed from many windows , as it happened - a bit of unlooked-for good fortune - that the Supreme Court was holding an evening session , and ordinary visitors could pass freely . Planting myself near a door which stood ajar , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trap to be sprung , and for the mob of people to appear from Fancuil Hall . The moments seemed endless . Would our friends never arrive ? Presently a rush of running figures , like the sweep of a wave , came round the corner of Court Square , and I watched it with such breathless anxiety as I have experienced only twice or thrice in life . The crowd ran on pell-mell , and I scanned it for a familiar face . A single glance brought the conviction of failure and disappointment . We had the froth and scum of the meeting , the fringe of idlers on its edge . The men on the platform , the real nucleus of that great gathering , were far in the // rear , perhaps were still clogged in the hall . Still , I stood , with assumed carelessness , by the entrance , when an official ran up from the basement , looked me in the face , ran in , and locked the door . There was no object in preventing him , since there was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , I ran against Stowell , who had been looking for the axes , stored at a friend 's office in Court Square . He whispered , " Some of our men are bringing a beam up to the west door , the one that gives entrance to the upper stairway . " Instantly he and I ran round and grasped the beam ; I finding myself at the head , with a stout negro opposite me . The real attack had begun . What followed was too hurried and confusing to be described with perfect accuracy of detail , although the main facts stand out vividly enough . Taking the joist up the steps , we hammered away at the southwest door of the CourtHouse . It could not have been many minutes before it began to give way , was then secured again , then swung ajar , and rested heavily , one hinge having parted . There was room for but one to pass in . I glanced instinctively at my black ally . He did not even look at me , but sprang in first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inestimable value to me , for it removed once for all every doubt of the intrinsic courage of the blacks . We found ourselves inside , face to face with six or eight policemen , who laid about them with their clubs , driving us to the wall and hammering away at our heads . Often as I had heard of clubbing , I had never before known just how it felt , and to my surprise it was not half so bad as I expected . I was unarmed , but had taken boxing lessons at several different times , and perhaps felt , like Dr. Holmes 's young man named John , that I had " a new way of counterin ' I wanted to try ; " but hands were powerless against clubs , although my burly comrade wielded his lustily . All we could expect was to be a sort of clumsy Arnold Winkelrieds and " make way for liberty . " All other thought was merged in this , the expectation of reinforcenients . I did not know that I had received a severe cut on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ignorant how it came . Nor did I know till next morning , what had a more important bearing on the seeming backwardness of my supposed comrades , that , just as the door sprang open , a shot had been fired , and one of the marshal 's deputies , a man named Batchelder , had been killed . Nor did I know - nor did even the public know - for more than twenty-five years who killed him , or even by what weapon it was done . It was one of those curious incidents which for a time baffle all conjecture . There had been other fugitive slave rescues in different parts of the country , but this was the first drop of blood actually shed . In all the long procession of events which led the nation through the Kansas struggle , past the John Brown foray , and up to the Emancipation Proclamation , the killing of Batchelder was the first act of violence . It was , like the firing on Fort Sumter , a proof that war had really begun . The mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posse inside was frightened , and what should have been the signal of success brought check and ultimate failure . The theory at the time was that the man had been stabbed by a knife , thrust through the broken panel . The coroner 's inquest found it to be so , and the press , almost as active as now , yet no more accurate , soon got so far as to describe the weapon , - a Malay kris , said to have been actually picked up in the street . For years I supposed all this to be so , and conjectured that either my negro comrade did the deed , or else Lewis Haydien , who was just behind him ; the latter supposing in the same way , as I found after his death , that I did it . Naturally , we never exchanged a word on the subject , as it was // a serious matter ; and it was not till within a few years ( 1888 ) that it was revealed by a well-known Worcester and Boston journalist , the late Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stabbed , Batelielder ; that Drew had originally given Stowell the pistol ; and that when the latter was arrested and imprisoned , on the night of the outbreak , he sent for Drew and managed to hand him the weapon , which Drew gave to some one else , who concealed it till long after the death of Stowell in the Civil War . This vital part of the facts , at the one point which made of the outbreak a capital offense , remained thus absolutely unknown , even to most of the participants , for thirty-four years . As to the coroner 's verdict , it turned out that there was no surgical examination of the body , but that it was hastily assumed that the deed was done by a certain light mulatto in the crowd who had been foolishly brandishing a knife . As Drew had seen the revolver loaded in Worcester , and had found , after its restoration , that one barrel had been discharged , and as he was also in the attacking party and heard the firing , there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this , however , was unknown till later ; we only knew that we were gradually forced back beyond the threshold , the door standing now wide open , and our supporters having fallen back to leave the steps free . Mr. C. E. Stevens , in his Anthony Burns , a History , published in 1856 , says that I said on emerging , " You cowards , will you desert us now ? " And though his narrative , like most others heretofore printed , is full of inaccuracies , this may be true ; it was certainly what I felt , not knowing that a man had already been killed , and that Stowell and others had just been taken off by the police . I held my place outside , still hoping against hope that some concerted reinforcement might appear . Meanwhile the deputy marshals retreated to the stairway , over which we could see their pistols pointing , the whole hall between us and them being brightly lighted . The moments passed on . One energetic young lawyer , named Seth Webb , whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I dissuaded him from entering alone , and he waited . Then followed one of the most picturesque incidents of the whole affair . In the silent pause that ensued there came quietly forth from the crowd the well-known form of Mr. Amos Bronson Alcott , the Transcendental philosopher . Ascending the lighted steps alone , he said tranquilly , turning to me and pointing forward , " Why are we not within ? " " Because , " was the rather impatient answer , " these people will not stand by us . " He said not a word , but calmly walked up the steps , - he and his familiar cane . He paused again at the top , the centre of all eyes , within and without ; a revolver sounded from within , but hit nobody ; and finding himself wholly unsupported , he turned and retreated , but without hastening a step . It seemed to me that , under the circumstances , neither Plato nor Pythagoras could have done the thing better ; and the whole scene brought vividly back the similar appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended the whole affair . Two companies of artillery had been ordered out , and two more of marines , these coming respectively from Fort Warren and the Charlestown Navy Yard . ( Here again I follow Stevens . ) Years after , the successor of the United States marshal , the Hon. R. G. Usher , said to me that his predecessor had told him that the surprise was complete , and thirty resolute men could have carried off Burns . Had the private entrance to the platform in Fanenil Hall existed then , as now , those thirty would certainly have been at hand . The alarm planned to be given from the gallery was heard in the meeting , but was disbelieved ; it was thought to be a scheme to interrupt the proceedings . Phillips had not received notice of it . // Parker and Howe had not fully comprehended the project ; but when the latter could finally get out of the hall he ran at full speed up to the Court-House , with Dr. William Francis Channing at his side , and they - two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had they and such as they been present , it might have been very different . The attempt being a failure and troops approaching , I went down the steps . There is always a farce readyto succeed every tragedy , and mine occurred when a man in the crowd sidled quietly up to me and placidly remarked , " Mister , I guess you ye left your rumberill . " It flashed through my mind that before taking hold of the beani I had set down my umbrella - for it was a showery day - over the railing of the Court-House steps . Recapturing this important bit of evidence , I made my way to Dr. W. F. Channing 's house , had my cut attended to , and went to bed ; awaking in a somewhat battered condition the next morning , and being sent off to Worcester by my advisers . Then followed my arrest after a few days , - a matter conducted so courteously that the way of the transgressor became easy . Naturally enough , my neighbors and friends regarded my arrest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opinions on the slavery question . Fortunately it did not disturb my courageous mother , who wrote , " I assure you it does not trouble me , though I dare say that some of my friends are commiserating me for having a son riotously and routously engaged , ' " - these being the curious legal terms of the indictment . For myself , it was easy to take the view of my old favorite Lamennais , who regarded any life as rather incomplete which did not , as in his own case , include some experience of imprisonment in a good cause . ( " Il manque toujours quelque chose it la belle vie , qui ne finit pas sur le champ de bataille , sur l ' 6chafaud ou en prison . " ) In my im mediate household the matter was taken coolly enough to suggest a calm inquiry , one day , by the lady of the house , whether all my letters to her from the prison would probably be read by the jailer ; to which a young niece , then staying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not if he writes them in his usual handwriting . " It was left to my honor to report myself at the station in due time to meet the officers of the law ; and my family , responding to this courtesy , were even more anxious than usual that I should not miss the train . In Boston , my friend Richard Henry Dana went with me to the marshal 's office ; and I sat in a chair to be " looked over " for identification by the various officers who were to testify at the trial . They sat or stood around me in various attitudes , with a curious and solemn depth of gaze which seemed somewhat conventional and even melodramatic . It gave the exciting sensation of being a bold Turpin just from Hounslow Heath ; but it was on a Saturday , and there was something exquisitely amusing in the extreme anxiety of Marshal Tukey - a dark , handsome , picturesque man , said to pride himself on a certain Napoleonic look - that I should reach home in time for my Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which , happily , my presence was not necessary after pleading to the indictment . Theodore Parker was the only one among the defendants who attended steadily every day , and he prepared that elaborate defense which was printed afterwards . The indictment was ultimately quashed as imperfect , and we all got out of the affair , as it were , by the side-door . I have passed over the details of the trial as I omitted those relating to the legal defense of Burns , the efforts to purchase him , and his final delivery to his claimant , because I am describing the affair only as a private soldier tells of what he personally saw and knew . // I must , however , mention , in closing , a rather amusing afterpiece to the whole matter , - something which occurred on October 30 , 1854 . A Boston policeman , named Butman , who had been active at the time of Burns 's capture , came up to Worcester for the purpose , real or reputed , of looking for evidence against those concerned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable colored population , there was a strong disposition to lynch the man , or at least to frighten him thoroughly , though the movement was checked by a manly speech to the crowd by George Frisbie Hoar , now United States Senator , but then a young lawyer ; the ultimate result being that Butman was escorted to the railway station on Mr. Hoar 's arm , with a cordon of Abolitionists about him , as a shelter from the negroes who constantly rushed at him from the rear . I was one of this escort , and directly behind Butman walked Joseph Howland , a non-resistant of striking appearance , who satisfied his sensitive conscience by this guarded appeal , made at intervals in a sonorous voice : " Do n't hurt him , mean as he is ! Do n't kill him , mean though he be ! " At Howland 's side was Thomas Drew , a vivacious little journalist , already mentioned , who compounded with his conscience very differently . Nudging back reprovingly the negroes and others who pressed upon the group , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and administer a vigorous kick to the unhappy victim , and then fall back to repress the assailants once more . As for these last , they did not seem to be altogether in earnest , but half in joke ; although the scene gave the foundation for a really powerful chapter , called The Roar of St. Domingo , in the now forgotten novel Harrington , by W. D. O'Connor . Nevertheless , when we reached the station just as the express train moved away , thus leaving Butman behind , there began to come up an ugly shout from the mob , which seemed to feel for a moment that the Lord had delivered the offender into its hands . As a horse with a wagon attached was standing near by , it was hastily decided to put Butman into the wagon and drive him off , - a proposal which he eagerly accepted . I got in with him and took the reins ; but the mob around us grasped the wheels till the spokes began to break . Then the owner arrived , and seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address of the late William W. Rice , I think , - since member of Congress , - a hack was promptly substituted for the wagon ; it drove up close , so that Butman and I sprang into it and were whirled away before the mob fairly knew what had happened . A few stones were hurled through the windows , and I never saw a more abject face than that of the slavecatcher as he crouched between the seats and gasped out , " They 11 get fast teams and be after us . " This , however , did not occur , and we drove safely beyond the mob and out of the city towards Westborough , where Butman was to take a later train . Having him thus at my mercy , and being doubtless filled with prophetic zeal , I took an inhuman advantage of Butman , and gave him a discourse on the baseness of his whole career which would perhaps have made my reputation as a pulpit orator had my congregation consisted of more than one , or had any modern reporter been hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town , I returned borne , pausing only at the now deserted station to hunt up my wife 's india-rubber overshoes , which I was carrying to be mended when the *meute broke out , and which I had sacrificed as heroically as I had nearly relinquished my umbrella at the Boston Court-House . The Burns affair was the last actual fugitive slave case that occurred in Massachusetts , although for some years we kept up* organizations and formed plans , and were better and better prepared for // action as the call for it disappeared . I was for some years a stockholder in the yacht Flirt , which was kept in commission under the faithful Captain Bearse , and was nominally let for hire , though really intended either to take slaves from incoming vessels , or , in case of need , to kidnap the claimant of a slave and keep him cruising on the coast of Maine until his claim should be surrendered . It all now looks very far off , and there has been time for the whole affair to be regarded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to the habitual use of arms and to military organization , the " Burns riot " naturally appeared in retrospect a boyish and inadequate affair enough ; we could all see how , given only a community of veteran soldiers , the thing might have been more neatly managed . And again , now that thirty years of peace have almost extinguished the habits and associations of war , still another phase of feeling has come uppermost , and it seems almost incredible that any condition of things should have turned honest American men into conscientious law-breakers . Yet such transitions have occurred in all periods of history , and the author of the Greville Journals records the amazement with which be heard that " Tom Grenville , so mild , so refined , adorned with such an amiable , venerable , and decorous old age , " should be the same man who had helped , sixty years before , to carry the Admiralty building by storm in the riots occasioned by the trial of Admiral Keppel , and had been the second man to enter at the breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sincere law - breakers of the world are the children of temperament as well as of moral conviction , and at any period of life , if the whirligig of time brought back the old conditions , would act very much as they acted before .
