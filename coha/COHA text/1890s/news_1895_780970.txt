txt The most elaborate social event of many seasons in this vicinity occurred to-night in Harmanus Bleecker Hall . The occasion was the ball , which Mr. and Mrs. Erastus Corning gave for their debutante daughter , Miss Harriet Corning . The hall was transformed into a bower of beauty with the aid of the entire collection of flowers and plants from the Corning conservatory . Fifteen hundred invitations were issued . The guests included the most prominent society people of the Capitol City , and there were a large number present from out of town . Gov. and Mrs. Morton and the Misses Edith and Lena Morton were among the more prominent guests . Mrs. Corning and her daughter were assisted in receiving by Mrs. Levi P. Morton and the Misses Morton . Mrs. Levi P. Morton wore a handsome toilet of heavy white satin , made en traine and embroidered elaborately in silver . Diamond and emerald stars gleamed in her snowy coiffure , and a necklace of the same gems flashed around her throat . Miss Morton , a tall , graceful blonde , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiffon of the same shade , and white ribbons . Her ornaments were of pearls . Miss Lena Morton , Who stood beside her mother , was in pale green peau de soie , with bodice and sleeves of chiffon . Forecaster Dunn has a scientific explanation for the density of the fog which yesterday laid its veil over this city , its bays , and tributary waters . It is the same old one of a sudden rise in temperature and a moist and vapor-laden wind blowing over a cold surface . Mariners considered the result only , and cared nothing for the cause . They found their vision obscured in every direction , and masters of ferryboats and other river craft had to steer by dead reckoning , and as best they could . Many casualties on the water resulted from the impenetrable mist . Considering the many difficulties of navigation , the wonder is that there were not more . The ferryboat Central of the Central Railroad of New-Jersey lost her way in the thickness , and for little more than an hour groped blindly about the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where he was . The boat left her Communipaw slip at 9 A. M. with a large number of passengers on board . A phantom-like tug appeared almost directly ahead soon after the vessel had glided into the stream . The engines were backed with great haste , and the helm was shifted . When the boat had ceased swinging , the pilot had lost all sense of direction . The craft wandered aimlessly around with engines slowed to bare steerage way until a brief thinning of the vapor. disclosed the shore line . The boat was then headed for her Liberty Street slip , but before she reached it the fog shut in again . Instead of making the slip , the Central bumped against the Pennsylvania Railroad Dock . It was just one hour before she finally got into her slip and landed her passengers . The double-decked Pennsylvania ferryboat Chicago and a car float of the same company were in collision . The float , which was in tow of the tug Beldevere , bumped against the side of the Chicago , indenting some of the plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place shortly after 9 A. M. Neither vessel sustained much damage . The ferryboat Castieton of the Staten Island Rapid-Transit Company , bound for New-York , and the ferryboat South Brooklyn of the Thirty-ninth Street Ferry , collided off Governor 's Island . No damage was done beyond the breaking of a few timbers . Neither boat will be laid up . The Cunard steamship Aurania , which arrived off the bar ' Sunday evening , did not reach Quarantine until 9:30 o'clock yesterday morning , having been compelled to anchor in the lower bay on account of thick weather . The fog caused her to undergo a further detention at Quarantine . She did not reach her pier until 2 P. M. During the morning hours the fog caused considetable delay on all the elevated railroads . All of the trains were delayed , and many were so crowded that the engines could barely move them . During the early hours men were stationed along the track at intervals of two blocks to prevent accidents . All of the trains were from a quarter to half an hour behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
