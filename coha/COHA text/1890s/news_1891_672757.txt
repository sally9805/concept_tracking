txt Our dispatches of yesterday morning from San Francisco showed that under what appears to be a change of management the outlook for a largely increased production of tin at-the mines of the San Jacinto Estate in Temescal is not encouraging . We had been led by the repeated assertions of the San Francisco papers and the stories told by persons reprep  --  ting the company to expect that the mines would soon be yielding tin at the rate of 2.000 or 3,000 tons per annum , and we should be glad to believe that a much larger quantity can be turned out . Perhaps the English owners have decided to wait vantil the prospective duty of 4 cents a pound shall be imposed in 1893 . While progress seems to have been checked at the Temescal mines , a more favorable report from certain mines in Durango , Mexico , is published . These mines are owned by Pittsburg capitalists , adn the Dispatch of that city asserts that the smelting furnaces now in operation are producing tin of a fine quality at the rate of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in courserof erection will give the concern a capacity of two to three tons of pig tin . per day within three months , and it is expected that the output will be at the rate of 1,500 tons per annum twelve months hence . " But there will be a duty on this tin in 1893 . The owners in Pittsburg say : " If we are kept out by a . high tariff we shall find a market inLiverpooL The German and English bankers in Mexico are very anxious to buy our tin . " It is probable , therefore , that the prospective duty will serve the interests of the Englishmen who own the California mines , while it will work to the disadvantage of the Americans who own the mines in Mexico .
