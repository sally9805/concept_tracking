txt THE leading article in the April number of this IREVIEW , " Great Britain and the United States : Their True Relations , " by Mr. David A. Wells , was evidently intended to describe , not what the relations of the countries named actually are , but what in the author 's opinion they ought to be . The actual relations of two nations are , of course , defined not by the writings or speeches of private individuals , however worthy of esteem , but by the acts of their respective Executives and Legislatures ; and from what is done at any given time by those official representatives of national opinion and feeling , especially if it be done with a close approach to unanimity , their future acts may be reasonably inferred . This will be admitted , no doubt , by Mr. Wells , and he will probably acknowledge , also , that the views expressed by him are at present held by only a very small minority of his fellow-citizens , if we may judge from the manner in which Mr. Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the mass of the American people . While conceding this , he would have us believe that the minority of which he is the spokesman is what Matthew Arnold used to call " the *aviug remnant , " meaning by the phrase a body of men , numerically weak , but strong in intellect and virtue , who may be relied upon eventually to clarify and elevate the whole community . It is the views of this saving remnant which he undertakes to expound at considerable length , and the outcome of his exposition is , that there is no reason why Americans should not regard England with cordial friendship ; but that on the contrary we ought to welcome the acquisition by Great Britain of the control // of the Orinoco , and inferentially , of the Amazon and La Plata river systems , because the South American countries concerned would thereby acquire the blessings of a better government and of free trade . We purpose to examine , paragraph by paragraph , the article in which these paradoxical opinions are set forth , and to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , and whether the deductions drawn from them are logically sound . I. MR . WELLS begins with the assertion that , * The peoples of the United States and of England are essentially of the same blood , language , religion and political principles . " There is no doubt that almost all Americans of both sexes who were born in the United States , speak , with varying degrees of correctness , the English language . It is also true that our political principles were , to a large extent , derived from the same source as those of Englishmen , although it is probable that our debt to Holland is generally underrated . The applications of those principles , however , differ materially in the two countries , not only our federal polity , but our State Constitutions being examples of the presidential type of government , as distinguished from the parliamentary system operative in the United Kingdom . It is not true , however , that " the people of the United States and of England are essentially of the same blood . " The infusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years immediately preceding our Revolutionary War has acquired such enormous proportions since the Irish famine of 1846 , that a large fraction of our population must now be recognized as wholly or partly of Irish descent . Even before the thirteen colonies achieved independence the Dutch constituted a large minority , if not a majority , in New York and the eastern section of New Jersey ; Germans were numerous in Pennsylvania ; there were some Swedes in Delaware and southwestern New Jersey ; and a good many Hugnenots had settled in South Carolina . When we acquired the Louisiana Territory , most of its white inhabitants were of French , and the rest of Spanish , origin . Since 1848 , the inflow of emigrants from Germany has been many times greater than that which came from England to the colonies between 1607 and // 1J7'V6 . There are now , beyond doubt , more Americans who are , wholly or in part , of German lineage , than there were Germans in the Kingdom of Prussia at the close of the last century . There are more men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Kingdom of Norway ; there are at least half as many Italians as can be found in the island of Sicily ; there are more than half as many French Canadians as were returned by the last Dominion census in the province of Quebec . We understate the truth when , in view of the facts just cited , we assert that not one-half of the 62,000,000 human beings reported by the census of 1890 to exist in the United States could prove themselves to be of pure English descent for the last three generations . So much for the statement that the people of the United States and of England are essentially of the same blood . Are they of the same religion ? It is well known that Roman Catholics are incomparably more numerous in the United States than in England , not only absolutely , but proportionately to the total population . The same thing is true of the Methodists and Baptists . The Lutheran Church , which has a great body of adherents on this side of the Atlantic , has not , to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither has the Dutch Reformed Church any representatives in England , although in the United States it is a powerful organization . The Church of England professes to comprehend more than half of the English population , although its claim is disputed by the Dissenters ; it is certain that its couiiterpart in this country , the Episcopal Church , ministers to a fraction of the people which is numerically insignificant . Obviously , then , we can aver that England and the United States are essentially of the same religion only in the sense that both countries are Christian . It would be more reasonable to compare the United States with the German Empire , from the religious point of view , because in Germany the Catholic factor , although not preponderant , is large , while in the Protestant majority there is a strong Calvinistic element . Of Mr. Wells 's primary proposition , there remains , then , simply this , that only in respect of language can the term identity be applied to England and the United States . Even with regard to language , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England // States and a few seaboard cities , divergent tendencies are not acquiring considerable momentum . There is , then , no fundamental reason rooted in human nature by virtue of a community of blood and religion why Americans as a nation should regard England with instinctive sympathy and friendship . That mere identity of language is no guaranty of good will is one of the tritest lessons of history , taught by innumerable civil wars in England , by the wars of religion in France , by the Thirty Years ' war in Germany , and by our own war of the rebellion . II . DIVERSELY constituted as are England and the United States in respect of descent and of religion and even of the methods of applying political principles , we should expect misunderstandings and prejudices , not to say antagonisms , to occur under the most favorable circumstances , historical and actual . There would be nothing more surprising in such phenomena than there is in the lack of sympathy evinced between Englishmen and Germans . Mr. Wells himself admits that " there is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against England , " but he attributes this to three causes , neither of which in his opinion has any moral justification . The greater part of his article is occupied with an examination of these causcs , and it is this to which we now invite the reader 's attention . The first cause assigned by Mr. Wells for American prejudice against England is " the memory of two wars with the mother country . " He adds that , " In each of these contests , the people of the Anglo-American colonies in the first instance , and the people of the United States in the second , obtained all for which they contended , and the parties and the measures responsible for what happened have long passed into history . " If Mr. Wells 's comments were warranted by the facts , the memories of the two wars mentioned would have produced no deep and rankling animosity ; indeed , the War of 1812 would never have taken place if what he says in the passage quoted about the outcome of the Revolutionary War were historically correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonists all for which they had contended ; it withheld from them some of the very things which they recognized as indispensable to the quick healing of wounds and the prompt and firm re-establishment of kindly rela // tions between the mother country and the daughter State . They perceived from the outset of their war for independence the strategic importance of the Bermudas and of Canada to their projected confederacy . They knew that those coigns of vantage , if retained by England , would be the source of incessant friction and perpetual menace . They tried , though unsuccessfully , to gain possession of both , and their Articles of Confederation provided for the immediate and unconditional admission of Canada to the Union . There were men in England at the time who foresaw that if the restoration of cordial relations with the former colonies was desired both Canada and the Bermudas ought to be surrendered . Not only was their prescience disregarded , but the forts on the northwest frontier , which the treaty bound the British to evacuate , were long occupied by them ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which involved the disastrous rout of the American army nuder General St. Clair , was due in a large degree to British instigation . When the Indians in their turn were beaten by General Wayne they took refuge under the guns of a British fort , thereby betraying their reliance upon British sympathy . The odious oppression which American commerce suffered at the hands of England during the first twelve years of this century is set forth with a cogency and emphasis , which few Americans are likely to forget , by Mr. Henry Adams in his history of the administrations of Jefferson and Madison . Mr. Wells is strangely mistaken when he says that by the Peace of Ghent , which put an end to the War of 1812 , the people of the United States obtained all for which they had contended . It is well known that the treaty in question left us precisely where we were before , not even the exasperating right of search being renounced by England . The treaty left unsettled the inflammatory questions of the northeaste ; n and northwestern boundaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon kept alive jealousies , suspicion , and resentment , and brought the two countries more than once to the brink of war . Scarcely had the people of the United States begun to forget their irritation at the loss of the valuable tract lying between the Fifty-four-Forty line and the present northern border of Oregon , when the secession of most of our slave States took place , and the governing classes in England made no secret of their satisfaction at the prospective dissolution of the Union . // Before glancing , however , at Mr. Wells 's attempt to palliate that unfriendly demonstration we should note a curious statement with regard to the fundamental wrong which drove the American colonies to separation from Great Britain . " It may not be uninteresting , " he says , " to call attention to the fact that the grievance of the colonies which is generally regarded as the prime cause of the American revolution , namely , that the colonists were taxed by the mother country without representation in Parliament , was not in the nature of a special discrimination by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical investigations have since shown that at the same time not more than one-tenth of the people of England had any vote for , or personal representation in , the British Parliament . " It requires no extended historical investigation to acquaint ourselves with the fact that in 1776 no close approach to manhood suffrage existed in most of the American colonies , any more than it did in England . The colonies did not ask for manhood suffrage ; what they said was , that , if they were to be taxed , they certainly had a right to the same kind of representation as was conceded in England , where the right to elect members of the House of Commons was shared by every county , and was distributed among a large proportion of the boroughs . Because representation was confined to only about a tenth of the English people , it obviously did not follow that the American people should have no representation at all . England never offered us a property qualification , whereby about one-tenth of the colonists would have been empowered to send delegatcH to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us an unreasonable effort to minimize the capital grievance of our forefathers . III . WE come now to a second cause which is acknowledged by Mr. Wells to have been " most influential for prejudice against England , " namely " the policy of the administration of the British government under Lord Palmerston during the Civil War towards the United States . " An endeavor is made to dissuade us from the resentment still felt on that account , by a plea which may be described as one of confession and avoidance . Mr. Wells does not deny that the rupture of the Union was desired by those classes in the British community which then controlled // and still control the government , the classes , in other words , which monopolize the House of Lords and preponderate in the *present House of Commons . He would have us distingnish between the governing classes and " the masses of the the people of England " and " especially the British working people " who he says " followed without murmuring the advice of those earnest and constant friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Palmerston and his Ministry . " On this point we need only remark that , when the British working people control the House of Commons and have abolished the House of Lords , it is highly probable that comparatively amicable relations will be established between the British and American democracies . Meanwhile , our feeling toward England as toward every other European conntry , will be shaped by those who have the power to dictate the words and acts of its legislature and executive . It is true , as is pointed out by Mr. Wells in an attempt to show that the British working people were not powerless , that the motion made by Mr. IRoebuck in the House of Commons for the recognition of the independence of the Southern Confederacy was defeated . The defeat , however , was due to a coalition of the Coriservatives with the Radicals , and this temporary coalition was brought about because it was known to the leaders of the Conservatives , who as a body were quite as hostile to the American Union as were the Palmerstonians , that a recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cansed a declaration of war on our part , and that in such a war we were assured of the support of Russia . That to give us such support was the intention of the Czar , Alexander II. , is now kno ' **n to every one familiar with the diplomatic history of the period , and both at London and Paris it unquestionably turned the scale in our favor . That Palmerston and the majority of his colleagues , including conspicuously Mr. Gladstone , longed for a specious pretext on which to interpose by force on behalf of the Secessionists , was proved by the eagerness with which they seized on the excuse afforded by our exercise in the case of the steamer " Trent " of the right of search , the very right which England had refused to renounce in the treaty of Ghent . it is probably true that Queen Victoria used her personal influence to prevent too much being made of the " Trent " incident , but the fact manifestly does not weaken the ground of our dislike of the governing classes . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they detest the part of the English community which for two hundred years has , ninety-nine times out of a hundred , had the power to determine England 's action . They do not think that a feeling justified by the almost unbroken history of two centuries should be materially qualified because , once in a reign of nearly sixty years , the Queen is said to have interposed in their behalf , or because they have now and then commanded the sympathy of the British working people , which from a political point of view has usually proved a negligible factor . As for another statement made by Mr. Wells in reference to our civil war , it is certainly true that the action of the French Second Empire stopped little short of actual hostility against the Union , but it is incorrect to say that it would have been more offensive but for the restraining influence of England . Notoriously , it was not Lord Palmerston who restrained Napoleon III . ; it was , as we have said , Alexander II . In another assertion Mr. Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view " It should also not be forgotten " he says , " that after the war Great Britain submitted our claim of damages against her as a nation to arbitration , and paid without grumbling $15,000,000 in cash into the United States treasury , a sum which in the opinion of the arbitrators covered all the legitimate claims of the United States against her . " As for grumbling , Mr. Wells must have sealed his ears with wax , if he has heard none from Englishmen over the Geneva award . We scarcely need point out , however , that the award was given to cover only such direct damages as could be brought home to particular privateers . The arbitrators were strictly forbidden to consider the question of indirect damages resulting from the annihilation of our enormous ante-bellum share of the ocean-carrying trade . A few years before the civil war , we transacted at 1ea*t as much of the ocean-carrying trad ' * of the world as did England ; when the civil war closed , we had practically none . For that almost incalculable loss we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the depredations of Confederate cruisers , which were built in England and equipped therefrom . It would be strange , had we already forgotten to what extent England is chargeable with the disappearance of our merchant navy which was once second to none upon the globe . Mr. Wells acknowledges that the above enumerated causes of // prejudice on the part of the people of the United States against England were powerfully operative in the past , but he thinks that they " ought not now to be , inasmuch as all the international differences involved have been amicably settled , undeniably to the advantage of the former , and are now only important as matters of history . " We have shown that the international differences involved have not been settled to the advantage of the United States , and never will be , until British North America and the Bermudas are ceded to us , and until our ocean-carrying trade shall have recovered the proportions which it would have retained but for British connivance at the effort of Confederate privateers to drive our merchant vessels from the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third cause of Anglophobia , which Mr. Wells terms " more potential than the aggregate influence of all other causes , and which is accepted and endorsed as in the nature of a rightful international grievance by nearly every member of our National or State legislatures , and by nearly every newspaper and magazine in the country . " This third cause " is the assumption that the governmental and commercial policy of England is characterized by no other principle save to monopolize through arbitrary , selfish and unjust measures everything on the earth 's surface that can glorify herself and promote the interests of her insular population , to the detriment of all other nations and peoples . " Mr. Wells is mistaken in averring , that this third cause of American prejudice against England is far " more potential than the aggregate influence " of the causes previously named . We regret to say , but truth compels us to affirm , that , had we not repeatedly suffered at the hands of England wrongs which we are unable to forget , we might look with comparative indifference on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , Bnrmah , South Africa and Egypt . Whether in the interests of humanity we ought to exhibit such indifference is another question . Mr. Wells devotes a number of pages to the attempt to prove that for the last half of a century , at all events , the period coincident with England 's adhesion with a free-trade policy , her acts of aggression have been prompted by unselfish motives , and have had beneficial results for all parties concerned . He refers to the eul // tivation of the cinchona tree in India as one of the blessings due to the British occupation of that country ; but he overlodks the cultivation of opium there , and the employment of a fleet and army to coerce China into a consumption of the noxious drug . He bids us admire the increase in the amount of wheat exported from India , which in 18*0 was 500,000 bushels and is now 30 , 000 ,  - -  000 bushels . He omits to note that there has been so great a coincident decline in the quantity and quality of the cotton fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from extinction , the Calcutta Government has been obliged to impose a duty on the cheaper but formerly inferior cotton goods sent from Manchester . It is only , however , a question of time when the ideal outcome of England 's notion of free trade will have been reached in India , when , namely , almost all manufactured articles will be imported from Great Britain , and the whole labor of the enormous population from the Himalayas to Ceylon will be applied to the production of food staples and raw materials . That is not England 's view of what constitutes civilization at home , but it is the kind of civilization which she would like to promote in her dependencies . Unquestionably , there is peace and there is order under British rule in India , but the British rulers are disliked , and the mass of the people would prefer to work out the problems of social existence in their own way . They have the same right to such a preference that all other peoples have . This may be said of the Egyptians also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower in Egypt to-day than it was before the British occupation ; that the interest on the public debt is promptly paid , and that the national securities in the hands of foreign bondholders are worth several times what was paid for them . Nevertheless , all intelligent Egyptians , while recognizing the value of the temporary service rendered by Great Britain , are of the opinion that the occupation should now end , and that opinion is shared by almost every civilized country except England . Mr. Wells is apparently unaware that England 's refusal to evacuate the Nile delta is a glaring breach of faith , committed in defiance of explicit promises made by successive British Governments . V. WE have seldom seen a more extraordinary perversion of recent history than is presented in Mr. Wells 's account of Great // Britain 's relations with the Transvaal . What he calls a " striking and instructive exemplification " of England 's beneficent treatment of weaker peoples is thus set forth : " Twenty years ago , when the safety of Europeans in South Africa was menaced by a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Transvaal or South American republic ; no other government covetiiig the expense or task of so doing . To provide for the common safety of the various people who , allured by the diamond fields and other inducements , were flocking into it , some rules of government became necessary . Accordingly , at a so-called Pretorian convention of South African representatives assembled in 1881 , a code of rules or laws , drafted by the British Colonial Office in London , was adopted . " One of these rules is then quoted by Mr. Wells , apparently for the purpose of conveying the impression that the alien residents of the Rand , who instigated Jameson 's piratical expedition , have been deprived of rights to which they were legally entitled . The sentences in quotation marks are literally full of errors : it was not " twenty , " but nineteen years ago , namely , in 11877 , when the Sonth African republic was not in the least endangered by a " revolt of the dark-skinned races " that England , we will not say " assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent Transvaal Commonwealth . It is true that no other European nation coveted the task , for the reason that the burghers of the Transvaal were fully competent to govern themselves . As for emigrants being " allured by the diamond fields " in the Transvaal , the great deposits of diamonds are notoriously outside of the ilollander commonwealth . By " a so-called Pretorian ' convention of South African representatives assembled in 1881 , " Mr. Wells apparently means the convention or treaty concluded in 1881 at Pretoria between Great Britain and the Transvaal State ; but he neglects to mention that this convention was wholly superseded in 1884 , whereby , although England secured the right to veto within six months a treaty made with any foreign power except the Orange Free State , the South African republic in all other particulars became entirely independent , and consequently qualified to make any laws for citizens or resident aliens that it might choose . How do the actual facts , as they are here narrated by us , constitute a striking and instructive exemplification of the benefits accruing from England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1881 was wrung from England by the victory at Majuba Hill , and the subsequent treaty of 1884 was conceded simply because the Boers refused to tolerate the former arrangements any longer . VI . IT is admitted by Mr. Wells that the accusations preferred against England 's foreign policy on the score of greed had formerly some foundation . For then , he explains , England was protectionist , as all the countries on the continent of Europe , as well as the United States , are now . But now , he says , England is not chargeable with greed , for the reason that her commercial policy is framed upon the free trade principle . The wider her area of conquests now the better for us , because the larger will be the market to which we , as well as she , will gain access . Elsewhere in his article Mr. Wells has recognized that England allows her self-governing colonies , and , to some extent , British India , to impose protectionist tariffs in their own interests , the result of which fact is that American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Halifax , or at Melbourne than they are at Hamburg or Bordeaux . But assuming that through British Guiana 's absorption of the whole of Venezuela our commodities would be admitted duty free to that vast region , are we on that account to justify the extinction of a Latin-American nationality ? Mr. Wells says frankly that what England wants is Barima Point , and that she wants it for the sake of procuring the free navigation of the Orinoco ; and he holds that it would be for the benefit of the world to throw open that great river system , of which the Caracas Government now claims exclusive control . The argument obviously proves too much . If the Venezuelans are to have no voice in the disposal of their own possessions , and if Great Britain is to be sole arbiter of what the interests of civilization require , the compulsory opening of the Orinoco to free navigation to-day may be followed by a like nsnrpation with regard to the Amazon or La Plata river systems to-morrow . Nay , England would be justified in trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi l*iver system , for we , like the Venezuelans , are , as Mr. Wells contends , discredited and cursed by tariffs formed upon protectionist principles . In a word , if the remarkable opinions propounded // by Mr. Wells last April in this REVIEW are pushed to their logical conclusions we should arrive at the assertion that a free trade country can do no wrong , while , on the other hand , protectionist countries have no rights that anybody need respect . In the course of his article , Mr. Wells denies that the wrongs and abuses suffered by Ireland at the hands of England should have any influence on the feeling with which Great Britain is regarded by American citizens . It is out of the question that such wrongs and abuses should be entirely forgotten by that considerable element of the American population which is wholly or partly of Irish descent , or by those other elements which are brought into close and sympathetic contact with it . Sympathy for Ireland , indeed , had absolutely nothing to do with the fervent outburst of approval which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither Irish Americans , German Americans nor Scandinavian Americans could be distinguished in the vehement response returned from all sections of the country . A word more , and we have done . In one of his later paragraphs Mr. Wells acknowledges that England is hated by other nations . This hatred is attributed to fear , and the fear is in turn ascribed to the success of her commercial policy . On what ground , then , does he go on to say that the United States are hated in an equal degree ? It can not be for our commercial policy , because this is diametrically opposed to that of England . If then , both countries are hated , it is probably for some cause with which commercial policy has nothing whatever to do . As a matter of fact , we deny that " there is not a government on the American continent except Canada and Venezuela that does not both fear and hate us . " The truth is that we are honored , esteemed and liked by every Latin-American republic with the possible exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and if the Conservatives regard us sourly , it is only because we refused to favor their rebellion against President Balmaceda . Equally unjustified by evidence is the assertion that " all countries save England , and possibly Russia and Japan , would rejoice at the dissolution of the Federal Union . " Now that France has become a republic , we know of no country in the 014 World , with the exception of Spain , and possibly of England , that would wish to see the Union shattered.
