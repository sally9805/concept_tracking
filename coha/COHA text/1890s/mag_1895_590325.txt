TRAMPS WITH AN ENTHUSIAST . To a brain wearied by the din of the city , the clatter of wheels , the jingle of street cars , the discord of bells , the cries of venders , the ear-splitting whistles of factory and shop , how refreshing is the heavenly stillness of the country ! To the soul tortured by the sight of ills it can not cure , wrongs it can not right , and sufferings it can not relieve , bow blessed to be alone with nature , with trees living free , unfettered lives , and flowers content each in its native spot , with brooks singing of joy and good cheer , with mountains preaching divine peace and rest ! Thus musing one evening , soon after my arrival at a lone farmhouse in the heart of the Green Mountains , I seated myself at the window to make acquaintance with my neighbors . Not the human ; I wished for a time to turn away from the world of people , to find rest and recreation in the world outside the walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the cottage farthest from the life that went on in it , from the kitchen and dairy , from the sight of barns and henhouses . It was , consequently , as solitary as it could be , and yet retain a slight hold upon humanity . It was connected with the family and farm life by two doors , which I could shut at will , and be alone with nature , and especially with the beloved birds . From my window I looked upon a wide view over the road and the green fields , and across the river to a lovely range of the Green Mountains , with one of the highest peaks in the State as a crown . Close at hand was a bank , the beginning of a mountain spur . It was covered from the road up with clumps of fresh green ferns and a few young trees , - a maple or two , half a dozen graceful young hemlocks , and others . The top of the bank , about as high as my window , was thick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open their eyes , sleepily , one lash at a time ; and on looking closely I saw ranks of them still asleep , each yellow eye carefully covered with its snow-white fringes . When the blossoms were fully opened , a few days later , my point of view - on a level - made even The daisy 's frill a wondrous newness wear // 659 faces turned to the sky , while the stems were visible down to the ground , and formed a Lilliputian forest in which it were easy to imagine tiny creatures spending days as secluded and as happy as I enjoyed in my forest of beech and birch and maple , which came down to the very back steps of the house . On the evening when my story begins , early in June , I was sitting , as I said , at my window , listening to the good-night songs of the earlier birds , enjoying the view of woods and mountains , and waiting till tea should be over before taking my usual evening walk . I had fallen into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , and in a moment a horse appeared , trotting rapidly up the little hill . In his wake was a face . There was of course a body also , and some sort of a vehicle , but neither of them did I see ; only a pair of eager , questioning eyes , and an intelligent countenance framed in snow-white curls which streamed back upon the wind , - a picture , a vision , I shall never forget . I recognized at once my Enthusiast , a dear friend and fellow bird-lover , who I knew was coming to spend some weeks in the village . I rushed to the door to greet her . " I 'm delighted to see you ! " she cried , as we clasped hands across the wheels . " I arrived an hour or two ago , and now I want to go where I can hear a hermit thrush . I ye come all the way from Chicago to hear that bird . " She dismounted , declined the invitation to tea given by my hostess , who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea for the sake of a bird song , and we started at once up the road , where I had seen the bird perched in a partially dead hemlock-tree , and heard " his ravishing carol ring From the topmost twig he made his throne . " Everything was perfectly still . Not a bird peeped . Even the tireless vireo , who peopled the woods as the English sparrow the city streets , was hushed . I began to be anxious ; could it be too cool for song ? or too late ? We walked steadily on , up the beautiful winding road : on one side dense forest , on the other lovely changing views of the hills across the intervale , blue now with approaching night . Crows called as they hurried over ; the little sandpiper 's " ah weet ! weet ! weet ! " came up from the river bank , but in the woods all was silent . Still we went on , climbing the steep hills , loitering through the valleys , till suddenly a bird note broke the stillness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " The veery ! " I whispered . " Is that the veery ? " she exclaimed . ( She had come from the home of the wood thrush , where hermit and veery were unknown . ) Yes , " I said ; " listen . " Again it came , more plaintive than before ; once more , in an almost agonized tone ; and so it continued , ever growing higher in pitch and more mournful , till we could hardly endure to listen to it . Then arose the matchless song , the very breath of the woods , the solemn , mysterious , wonderful song of the bird , and two listeners , at least , lingered in ecstasy to hear , till it dropped to silence again . Then , slowly and leisurely , we went on . The dead hemlock , the throne of the hermit , was vacant . On a bank not far off we sat down to wait , talking in hushed tones of the veery , of the oven bird whose rattling call was now just beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sounding from the upper twig of another deadtopped tree , of the hermit himself , when , to our amazement , a small bird soared out of the woods , a few feet above our heads , flew around in a circle of perhaps fifteen feet in the air , and plunged again into the trees , singing all the time a rapturous , thrilling song , bewitching both in manner and in tone . " The oven bird ! " we exclaimed in a // breath . That made our walk noteworthy . We should not regret , even if the hermit refused to bless us . Silently on up the road we passed , till the deepening shadows reminded us of the hour and the long drive before my friend , and we turned back . By this time the sun had set , and the sky was filled with gorgeous rosy clouds floating above the richest red-purple of the mountains . This surely crowned our walk . We were sauntering homeward , lingering , waiting , we hardly knew for what , since we had given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as his first rich clause fell upon the air , I turned to my companion , who was a few steps behind me . She stood motionless , both hands raised , but dumb . " Glorious ! " she whispered when she recovered her voice . " Wonderful ! " she added , as he warmed into fuller song . Quietly drawing as near as we dared , we dropped upon the bank and listened in spellbound silence to our unseen melodist . Slow , rapturous , entrancing , was his song , and when it ended we came reluctantly back to earth , stole in the growing darkness down to the farm , and my friend resumed her place in the carriage and drove away , saying with her good-by , " I am already paid for my long journey . " Yet after the first surprise and wonder were over , she swung loyally back to her first love , the wood thrush , of whose sublime voice she says , " The first solemn opening note transports you instantly into a holy cathedral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose permanently between these two glorious singers , and at that time I had been under the spell of the hermit song for days . Morning after morning I had spent in the woods , listening to the marvelous voice , and trying to discover its charm . The bird began to sing his way down to us about ten o'clock in the morning . I heard him first afar off , then coming nearer and nearer , till he reached some favorite perch in the woods behind and very near the farmhouse , before noon , where he usually sang at intervals till eight o'clock in the evening . I studied his song carefully . It consisted of but one clause , composed of a single emphasized note followed by two triplets on a descending scale . But while retaining the relative position of these few notes he varied the effect almost infinitely , by changing , both the key and the pitch constantly , with such skill that I was astonished to discover the remarkable simplicity of the song . A striking quality of it was an attempt which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale than he could reach , so that the triplets became a sort of trill or tremolo , at the very extreme of his register . Sometimes lie gave the triplets alone , without the introductory note , but never , in the weeks that I studied his song , did he sing other than this one clause . It was only with an effort that I could force myself to analyze the performance . Far easier were it , and far more delightful , to sit enchanted , to be overwhelmed and intoxicated by his thrilling music . For me , the hermit voices the sublimity of the deep woods , while the veery expresses its mystery , its unfathomable remoteness . A wood warbler , on the contrary , always brings before me the rush and hurry of the world of people , and the wood pewee its undercurrent of eternal sadness . Into the mood induced by the melancholy pewee song breaks how completely and how happily the cheery optimism of the chickadee ! Brooding thoughts are dissipated , all is not a hollow mockery , and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hermit song , I wondered that at the first note of the king of singers all other birds were not mute . But evidently time birds have not enthroned this thrush . Possibly , even , they do not share human admiration for his song . The redstart goes on jerking out his monotonous ditty ; chippy irreverently mounts a perch and trills out his // 661 inane apology for a song ; the vireo in yonder tree spares us not one of his neverending platitudes . But the hermit thrush goes on with sublime indifference to the voices of common folk down below . Sometimes he is answered from afar by another of his kind , who arranges his notes a little differently . The two seem to wait for each other , as if not to mar their divine harmony by vulgar haste or confusion . " We must find the see-here ' bird , " said my friend the next morning , when she appeared at the door of the farmhouse , and I joined her for our second tramp . This was a bird whose long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tantalized me from the day of my arrival . We resolved this time to go into the woods we had skirted the night before . A set of bars admitted us to a most enticing bit of forest , a paradise to cityweary eyes and nature - loving hearts . From the bars rose sharply a rough wood road , while a few steps to the right and a scramble up a rocky path changed the whole world in a moment . We were in a perfect nook , which I had discovered a few days before : with a carpet of dead leaves , a sky of waving branches , the fierce sun shut out by curtains of living green , the air cooled by a clear mountain stream , and the " priceless gift of delicious silence " - silence that had haunted my dreams for months - broken only by the voices of birds , whispers of leaves , and ripple of brook . In this spot , " where Nature dwells alone , Of man unknowing , and to man unknown , " ( as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of - door study , and here I had spent perfect days , watching the residents of the vicinity , and saturating my whole being with the delights of sight and sound and scent till it was thrilling happiness just to be alive . Would that I could impart the freshness , the fragrance , the heavenly peace of those days to this chronicle , to comfort and strengthen my readers not so blessed as to share them ! The dwellers in this delectable spot , where I persuaded my friend to rest a moment , I had not found altogether what I should have chosen ; for , unfortunately , the place most desirable for the student is not always the best for birds . They are quite apt to desert the cool , breezy heights charming to wood lovers , to build in some impenetrable tangle , where the ground is wet and full of treacherous quagmires , where mosquitoes abound and flies do greatly flourish , where closegrowing branches and leaves keep out every breath of air , and there is no solid rest for the legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to a desirable situation , from which side you look at it . The principal inhabitant presented himself before we were fairly seated , a chipmunk , who came out of his snug door under the roots of a maple-tree and sat up on his doorstep - one of the roots - to make his morning toilet , dress his sleek fur , scent the sweet fresh air , and enjoy himself generally . In due time he ran down to the little brook before the door , and then started out , evidently after something to eat ; and he went nosing about on the ground with a thoroughness to make a bird - lover shudder , for what ground bird 's nest could escape him ! I recognize the fact that , from his point of view , chipmunks must live , and why should they not have eggs for breakfast ? Doubtless , in squirrel philosophy , it is a self-evident truth that birds were created to supply the tables of their betters in fur , and the pursuit of eggs and nestlings adds the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , therefore , as the law that " might makes right " prevails in higher quarters , we are forced to acknowledge , however grudgingly , his " right " to his game ; but for all that I should like exceedingly to protect it from him . I could not long keep a bird-lover studying // a chipmunk . In a few minutes we started again on our way up the mountain . Each side of our primitive wood road was bordered with ferns in their first tender green , many of them still wearing their droll little hoods . Forward marched the Enthusiast ; breathlessly I followed . Up one little hill , down another , over a third we hastened . " See ! " I said , hoping to arrest the tireless steps ; " on that tree I saw yesterday a scarlet tanager . " " Oh , did you ? " she said carelessly , pausing not an instant in her steady tramp . Then rose the note we were listening for , far to the left of the road . " He s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , and pushing in the direction of the sound . " But I 'm afraid I shall tire you , " she added . " You sit down here , and I 11 just go on a little . " " No , indeed ! " I answered hastily , for I knew well what " just go on a little " meant , - I had tried it before : it meant pass out of sight in two minutes , and out of hearing in one more , so absorbed in following an elusive bird note that everything else would be forgotten . " No , indeed ! " I repeated . " I shall not be left in these woods ; where you go I follow . " " But I wo n't go out of sight , " she urged , her conscience contending with her eager desire to proceed , for well she knew that I did not take my woods by storm in this way . I said nothing in reply , but I had no intention of being left , for I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a vivid remembrance of being greatly startled , only a day or two before , by unearthly cries in these very woods ; of seeing a herd of young cattle rushing frantically away , turning apprehensive glances toward the sounds , and huddling in a frightened heap down by the bars , while the strange cries came nearer and nearer , till I should not have been surprised to see any sort of a hor an Enthu8iast . May , ror emerge ; of calling out to the farmer whom I met at the door , " Oh , there s something dreadful up in the woods ! " and his crushing reply , " Yes , I heard it . It s a fox barking ; we hear one now and then . " I cast no doubts on the veracity of that farmer , though I could not but remember the license men sometimes allow themselves when trying to quiet fears they consider foolish ; nor did his solution seem to account satisfactorily for the evident terror of the cattle , which had lived in those woods all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bark " of a fox . I preferred , therefore , not to encounter any such eccentric " fox " alone ; hence I refused to listen to my friend 's entreaties , but simply followed on , over fallen treetrunks , under drooping branches , and through unyielding brush : now sinking ankle-deep in a pile of dead leaves , now catching my hair in a broken branch , and now nearly falling over a concealed root ; wading through swamps , sliding down banks , cutting and tearing our shoes , and leaving bits of our garments everywhere . On we went recklessly , intent upon one thing only , - seeing the bird who , enthroned on his treetop , calmly and serenely uttered his musical " see-e he-e-re ! while we struggled , and scrambled , and fought our way down below . We reached a steep bank , and paused a moment , breathless , disheveled , my interest in the beguiler long ago cooled . " There s a brook down there , " I said hastily ; " we ca n't cross it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of a little further rending , and the addition of wet feet to our other discomforts . But at last ! at last ! we came in sight of our bird , a mere black speck against the sky . " It s a flycatcher ! " exclaimed my companion eagerly . " See his attitude ! I must get around the other side ! " and on we went again . A fence loomed before us , a fence of brush , impossible to get through , and almost as impossible to // get over . But what were any of man 's devices to an eager bird-hunter ! Over that fence she went - like a bird , I was going to say , but like a boy would perhaps be better . More leisurely and with difficulty I followed , for once on the other side I should be content . I knew the road could not be far off , and through the tangled way we had come I was resolved I would not pass again . Well , we ran him down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent to our noisy presence on the earth below , while we studied him on all sides , and decided him to be the olivesided flycatcher ( Contopus borealis ) . We entered his name and his manners in our notebooks , and we were happy , or at least relieved . The habit of this bird , as I learned by observation of him afterward , was to sit on the highest twig of a tree dead at the top , where he could command a view of the whole neighborhood , and sing or call by the hour , in a loud , drawling , and rather plaintive tone , somewhat resembling the wood pewee 's , though more animated in delivery . I found that the two notes which syllabled themselves to my ear as " see-e he-e-re ! " were prefaced by a low , staccato utterance like " quick ! " and all were on the same note of the musical scale . Occasionally , but not often , he made a dash into the air , flycatcher fashion , and once I saw him attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alighting on a neighboring dead treetrunk . Down upon him like a small tornado came the flycatcher instantly , expecting , apparently , to annihilate him . But the big , clumsy woodpecker merely slid one side a little , to avoid the onslaught , and calmly went on dressing his feathers , as if no small flycatcher existed . This indifference did not please the olive-sided , but he alighted on a branch below and bided his time ; it came soon , when the golden-wing took flight , and he came down upon him like a kingbird on a crow . I heard the snap of the woodpecker 's beak as he passed into the thick woods , but nobody was hurt , and the flycatcher returned to his perch . When we had rested a little after our mad rush through the woods , we found that the hours were slipping away , and we must go . Passing down the road at the edge of the woods , we were about to cross a tiny brook , when our eyes fell upon a distinguished personage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we instantly stopped to see him . He did not linger , but gave himself a thorough splashing , and flew at once to a tree , where he began dressing his plumage in frantic haste , as if he knew he was a " shining mark for man and beast . He stayed half a minute on one branch , jerked a few feathers through his beak , then flew to another place and hurriedly dressed a few more ; and so he kept on , evidently excited and nervous at being temporarily disabled by wet feathers , though I do not think he knew he had human observers , for we were at some distance and perfectly motionless . He was a beauty , even for his lovely family , and the rose color of his wing-linings was the most gorgeous I ever saw . Moreover , I knew this bird , later , to be as useful as he was beautiful . He it was who took upon himself the care of the potato patch in the garden below , spending hours every day in clearing off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his labors , and , when the toils of the day were over , treating us to a delicious evening song from the top of a tree close by . In that way the grosbeak 's time was spent till babies appeared in the hidden nest , when everything was changed , and he set to work like any hod-carrier ; appearing silently , near the house , on the lowest board of the fence , looking earnestly for some special luxury for baby beaks . No more singing on the treetops , no more hunting of the beetle in stripes ; food more delicate was needed // May , now , and he found it among the brakes that grew in clumps all about under my window . It was curious to see him searching , hopping upon a stalk which bent very much with his weight , peering eagerly inside ; then on another , picking off something ; then creeping between the stems , going into the bunch out of sight , and reappearing with his mouth full ; then flying off to his home . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The red of his breast was continued in a narrow streak down through the white , as if the color had been put on wet , and had dripped at the point . The third tramp with my Enthusiast was after a warbler . To my fellow birdstudents that tells a story . Who among them has not been bewitched by one of those woodland sprites , led a wild dance through bush and brier , satisfied and happy if he could catch an occasional glimpse of the flitting enchanter ! This morning we drove a mile or two out of the village , hitched our horse , - a piece of perfection , who feared nothing , never saw anything on the road , and would stand forever if desired , - and started into the pasture . The gate passed , we had first to pick our way through a bog , which had been cut by cows ' hoofs into innumerable holes and pitfalls , and then so overgrown by weeds and moss that we could not always tell where it was safe to put a foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bog on the side of a mountain must probably be a provision of Mother Nature 's , an irrigating scheme for the benefit of the hillside vegetation . If all the water ran off at once , we argued , very little could grow there . So we who love to see our hills covered with trees should not complain , but patiently seek the stepping-stones sometimes to be found , or meekly resign ourselves to going in over boot-tops without a word . Our first destination was the nest of a hermit thrush , discovered by my friend the day before , and we stumbled , and slipped , and picked our way a long distance over the dismal swamp , floundering on till we reached a clump of young hemlocks , on ground somewhat more solid , where we could sit down to rest . There was the nest right before us , a nicely made , compact bird home , exquisitely placed in one of the little trees , a foot from the ground . While waiting for the owners to appear , I was struck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most evergreen trees . From the time a hemlock has two twigs above ground it is always picturesque in its method of growth . Its twigs , especially the topmost one , bend over gracefully like a plume . There is no rigid uniformity among the smaller branches , no two appear to be of the same length , but there is an artistic variety that makes of the little tree a thing of beauty . When it puts out new leaves in the early summer , and every twig is tipped with light green , it is particularly lovely , as if in bloom . How different the mathematical precision of the spruce , which might indeed have been laid out upon geometrical lines ! When a baby spruce has but three twigs , one will stand stiffly upright , as if it bore the responsibility of upholding the spruce traditions of the ages , while the other twigs will duly spread themselves at nearly right angles , leaving their brother to represent the aspirations of the family , and thus even in infancy reproduce in miniature the full-grown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain for the birds to appear , we examined the nest before us , we found that it held two thrush eggs and one of the cowbird . The impertinence of this disreputable bird in thrusting her plebeian offspring upon the divine songster , to rear at the expense of her own lovely brood , was not to be tolerated . The dirty speckled egg looked strangely out of place among the gems // that belonged to the nest , and I removed it , careful not to touch nest or eggs . So pertinacious is this parasite upon bird society that my friend says that in Illinois , where the wood thrush represents the charming family , almost every woodthrush nest , in the early summer , contains a cowbird 's egg ; and not until they have reared one of the intruders can the birds hope to have a brood of their own . Fortunately they nest twice in the season , and the cowbird does not disturb the second family . While we sat watching the hermit 's nest , we were attracted by another resident of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low shrub within twenty feet of us , and began to sing . First came a long , deliberate note , of the clearest and sweetest tone , then two similar notes , a third higher , followed by three triplets on the same note . Though dressed in sparrow garb , his colors were bright , and he was distinguished and made really beautiful by two broad lines of buff-tinted white over his crown , and a snowy white throat . He was the white-throated sparrow , one of th' largest and most interesting of his family . The charm of his song is its clearness of tone and deliberateness of utterance . It is calm as the morning , finished , complete , and almost the only bird song that can be perfectly imitated by a human whistle . I never shared the enthusiasm of some of my fellow birdlovers for the sparrows till I knew the white-throat and learned to love the dear little song sparrow . It is unfortunate that the song of the former has been translated into a word so unworthy as " peabody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become fastened on him in New England . Far more appropriate the words applied by Elizabeth Akers Allen to an unknown singer , - possibly this very bird , - embodied in her beautiful poem The Sunset Thrush . For whatever bird it was intended , the syllables and arrangement correspond to the whitean Enthusiast . 665 throat 's utterance , and the words are , " Sweet ! sweet ! sweet ! Sorrowful ! sorrowful ! sorrowful ! " A white-throat who haunted the neighborhood of my farmhouse did not confine himself to the family song ; which , by the way , varies less with this species than with any other I know . At first , for some time , he entirely omitted the triplets , making his song consist of four long notes , the fourth being in place of the triplets . Then , later , he dropped the last note a half tone below the others , still omitting the triplets , which , in fact , in three or four weeks of listening and watching , I never once heard him utter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian Pacific Railway on my way West , I heard innumerable songs by this bird . Every time the train stopped , white-throat voices rang out on all sides , and with considerable variety . Many dropped half a tone at the end , and some uttered the triplets on that note , while others began the song on a higher note , and gave the rest a third below , instead of above , as usual . But to return to the singer before us on that memorable day . After singing a long time , he suddenly began to utter the first two notes alone , and then apparently to listen . We also listened , and soon heard a reply of the same two notes on a different pitch . These responsive calls were kept up for some time , and seemed to be signals between the bird and his mate ; for neither she nor her nest could be found , though the pair had been startled out of that very bush on the preceding day . We searched the clumps of shrubs carefully , but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to find nests easily is as truly a natural gift as the ability to become a musician , or the power to see a statue in a block of marble . That gift is not mine . I have an ahnost invincible repugnance to poking into bushes and thrusting aside branches to discover who has hidden there . Moreover , if a bird // seems anxious or alarmed , I never can bear to disturb her . Nor indeed do I care to find many nests . A long list of nests found in a season gives me no pleasure ; how many birds belong to a certain district does not concern me in the least . But if I have really studied one or two nests , and made acquaintance with the tricks and manners of the small dwellers therein , I am satisfied and happy . While we lingered in the little hemlock grove , enraptured with the whitethroat , and feeling that " Here were the place to lie alone all day On shadowed grass , beneath the blessed trees , " a distant note reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warbler , and a most alluring song . Such indeed we found it , for on the instant the Enthusiast sprang to her feet , alert to her finger-tips , crying , " That 's the bird we re after ! " adding as usual , as she started across the field , " You sit still ! I wo n't go far , " while as usual , also , I snatched my things and followed . The song was in the tone of one of the most bewitching as well as the most elusive of warblers , the black-throated green ; a bird not so big as one 's thumb , with a provoking fondness for the tops of the tallest trees , where foliage is thickest , and for keeping in constant motion , flitting from twig to twig , and from tree to tree , throwing out as he goes " The sweetest sound that ever stirred A warbler 's throat . " This one was tireless , as are all of his tribe , and led us a weary dance over big , steep-sided rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of our open fields into deep woods . Now , my companion in these tramps has a rooted opinion that she is easily fatigued , and must rest frequently ; and I have no doubt it is true , when she has no strong interest to urge her on . So she used to burden herself with a clumsy waterproof , to throw on the ground to sit upon ; and in compliance with this notion ( which was most amusing to those whom she tired out in her tramps ) , whenever she thought of it - that is , when the bird voice was still for a moment - she would seek a sloping bank , or a place beside a tree where she could lean , and then throw herself down , determined to rest . But always in one minute or less the warbler would be sure to begin again , when away went good resolutions and fatigue , and she sprang up like a Jackin-the-box , saying , of course , " You sit still ; I 11 just go on a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While pursuing this vocal ignisfatuus I made a charming discovery . In one of the temporary pauses in our wild career , I was startled by the flight of a bird from the ground very near us , and , searching about , I soon found a veery 's nest with one egg . It was daintily placed in a clump of brakes or big ferns , resting on a fallen stick , over and around which the brakes had grown . The bird was not so pleased with my discovery as I was . She perched on a tree over our heads , and uttered the mournful veery cry ; and though I did not so much as lay a finger on that nest , I believe she deserted it at that moment , for several days afterward it was found exactly as on that day , with its one egg cold and abandoned . If I had not , through two summers ' close study , made myself very familiar with the various calls and cries of the veery , I think I should be driven wild by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance to his notes , and few can get around so silently and unobserved as he . A great charm in his song is that it rarely bursts upon your notice ; it appears to steal into your consciousness , and in a moment the air seems full of his breezy , woodsy music , his " quivering , silvery song , " as Cheney calls it . Not long were we allowed to meditate upon the charms of the veery , for again the luring song began , the other side of // the belt of woods , and off we started ane*v . This time we secured the bird , or his name , which was all we desired . The sweet beguiler turned out to be the warbler mentioned above , the black-throated green , but with a more than usually exquisite arrangement of his notes . Indeed , my friend , who was what I call warbler-mad , - a state of infatuation I have with care and difficulty guarded myself against , - heard in the woods of the neighborhood , during that summer 's visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of warbler . While slowly and weariedly dragging myself back to where our patient horse stood waiting , I fell into meditation on this way of making the study of nature hard work instead of rest and refreshment , and the comparative merits of chasing up one 's birds and waiting for them to come about one . Without doubt the choice of method is due largely to temperament , but I think it will be found that most of our nature-seers have followed the latter course . June was now drawing to an end , and the day of my friend 's departure had nearly arrived . One more tramp remained to us . It was a walk up a long , lonely road to a solitary thorn-tree , where I was studying a shrike 's nest . Just as we left the village a robin burst into song , and this bird , because of certain associations , was the Enthusiast 's favorite singer . We paused to listen . When bird music begins to wane , when thrushes have taken their broods afar , and orioles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , the cheerful and pleasing song , of the robin . It is truly delightful then to hear his noisy challenge , his gleeful " laugh , " his jolly song . We may indeed rhapsodize over our rare , fine singers , but after all we could better spare one and all of them than our two most common songsters , our faithful stand - bys , upon whom we can always count to preach to us the gospel of contentment , cheerfulness , and patience , - the dear common robin and the blessed little song sparrow . No weather is so hot that they will not pour out their evangel to us ; no rain so wet , no wind so strong , that these two will not let their sweet voices be heard . Blessed , I say , be the common birds , living beside our dwellings , bringing up their young under our very eyes , accepting our advances in a spirit of friendliness , coming earliest , staying latest , and keeping up their song even through the season of feeding , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these two should be dearest to us ; these , above all others , should our children be taught to respect and love . The robin ceased , and we passed on . One more voice saluted us from the last house of the village : a wren , whose nest was placed in a bracket under the roof , sang his gushing little ditty , and then in a moment we were in a different bird world . From one side came the bobolink 's voice , " Preaching hoidly to the sad the folly of de-spair , And telling whom it may concern that all the world is fair ; " from the other , the plaintive notes of the meadow lark . Lovely indeed the lark looked among the buttercups in the pasture , stretching himself up from the ground , tall and slim , and almost as yellow as they ; and very droll his sputtering cry , as he flew over the road to the deep grass of the meadow , to attend to the wants of his family , for the meadow was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give both bobolink and lark much concern . The call I name the " sputter , " because it sounds like nothing else on earth , is a sort of " retching " note followed by several sputtering utterances , hard to describe , but not unpleasant to hear , perhaps because it suggests the meadow under the warm sun of June , with bobo // links soaring and singing , and a populous colony beneath the long grass . Now night was coming on , and the larks were passing from the pasture , where they seemed to spend most of the day , some with song and some with sputter , over the road , to drop into the grass and be seen no more ; " While through the blue of the sky the swallows , flitting and flinging , Sent their slender twitterings down from a thousand throats . " Sometimes , on that lonely road , which I passed over several times a day , I was treated to a fairy-like sight . It was when a recent shower had left little puddles in the clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meadow came down to procure material for their adobe structures . Most daintily they alighted on their tiny feet around the edge , holding up their tails like wrens lest they should soil a feather of their plumage , and raising both wings over their backs like butterflies , fluttering them all the time , as if to keep their balance and partly hold them up from the ground , - a lovely sight which I enjoyed several times . Under the eaves of the distant house , where the nests of these birds were placed , and which I visited later , were evidences of tragedies . The whole length of the cornice on the back side of the house showed marks of many nests , and there were left at that time but four , two close together at each end of the line . I can not say positively that the nests had fallen while in use , but in another place , a mile away , I know of a long row having fallen , with young in , every one of whom was killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes thus perished ? And was the trouble with their material or with their situation ? I noticed this : that the nests had absolutely nothing to rest on , not even a projecting board . They were plastered against a perfectly plain painted board . Another bird whom I caught in a new r51e , apparently giving a lesson in foodhunting to a youngster , was a phoibe . Hearing a new and strange cry , mingled with tones of a voice familiar to me , I looked up , and discovered a young and an old phoibe . The elder kept up a running series of remarks in the tone peculiar to the species , while the infant answered , at every pause , by a querulous single note in a higher key . Every moment or two the instructor would fly out and capture something , talking all the while , as if to say , " See how easy it is ! " but careful not to give the food to the begging and complaining pupil . No sooner did the parent alight than the youngster was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while the old bird flew away , when that deceiving little rogue took upon himself the business of fly-catching . He flew out , snapped his beak , and , returning to his perch , wiped it carefully . Yet when the elder returned he at once resumed his begging and crying , as if starved and unable to help himself . A friend and bird-student , whose home is in these moRntains , assures me that the phoibes in this vicinity do not confine themselves to the traditional family cry , but have a really pleasing song , which she has heard several times . That , then , is another of the supposed songless birds added to the list of singers . I know both the kingbird and the wood pewee sing , not , to be sure , in a way to be compared to the thrushes , *though far excelling the utterances of the warblers . But why are they so shy of exhibiting their talent ? Why do they make such a secret of it ? Can it be that they are just developing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last evening , we seated ourselves on a bank beside the road , to enjoy the music of the meadow , and to see the shrike family . At the nest all was still , probably settled for the night , but the " lord and master " of that snug homestead // stood on a tall maple-tree close by , in dignified silence , watching our movements , no doubt . We waited some time , but he refused either to go or to relax his vigilance in the least , till the hour grew late , and we were obliged to turn homeward . The sun had set , and the sky was filled , as on that first evening , with soft , rosy sunset clouds , and the distant mountains , with Jay Peak for a crown , were clothed in gorgeous purple again . With all this beauty before us , we slowly walked back to the village , and I felt it a fitting close to my delightful , if exhausting tramps with an Enthusiast . Olive Thorne Miller . A TALK OVER AUTOGRAPHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Astronomer Royal , Sir G. B. Airy , when I was writing the Life of my uncle , Sir Rowland Hill . A few years ago , an American gentleman , to whom I was showing Oxford , spoke of Sir Rowland Hill as if he had not only reformed the postal system of the world , but had also , by way of Sabbath day rest , cracked a good many jokes in the pulpit . When I pointed out to him the strange confusion he was making , he replied , " Down in Illinois we always think the postal reformer and the great pulpit humorist one and the same man . " The indexmaker of the Early Letters of Thomas Carlyle has fallen into the same blunder . Carlyle , writing of the Rev. Edward Irving , says , " Unless he looks to it , he bids fair for becoming a kind of theological braggadocio , an enlarged edition of the Rev. Rowland Hill .
