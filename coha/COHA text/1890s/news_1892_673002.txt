txt Those Denioerats who attended the caucus last night and who asBurned , after it was over , that it would prove fruitless to break the dead-look over the Chicago appropriation , were absolutely correct . After a meeting of the House , business stands just where it did yesterday , and the members are now wondering what will happen if , in conMUNRO ? Of the llegleet or refusal or those present to agree , or of the absent members to attend , the necessity should arise for another extension of the appropriations of last session . For , Hopkins , and other Illinois men , some Republicans and some Democrats , say that they will not permit another extension to be made by unanimous consent , while the opponents of the appropriation for Chloago are just as determined that the bill shall not be passed upon the plea that public necessity is to be made the club by which to compel the gift of $5,000,000 to the show . The longer the opponents of the Chicago appropriation talk about the manner in which this appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' becomes their opposition . Te them there appears to have been a deliberate scheme to work its passage . The Sundry Civil bill was permitted to be made the last bill to pass . Having allowed all the appropriations approved by the House , the Senate added to it a rider appropriating the five millions asked tot in a separate House bill introduced by Mr. Durborow ( Dem. , ni. , ) and sent it back to the House . The assumption was that there would be a sufficient number of members of the House in favor of the appropriation to override the rule against legislation on appropriation bills , and that , by adhering to this decision , the Senate amendment would be adopted and the Sundry Civil bill made to carry something entirely foreign to it . Nearly every member has some paragraph in the Sundry Civil bill which is of interest and Importance to his district , and so every one is averse to having the bill fail . The result is a situation something like what would be presented if there was a River and Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the various paragraphs for various branches of the service impels members to vote to allow the five millions for Chicago . in order that the armories and Soldiers ' Homes and arsenals may be provided for . There is no dispute about the necessity for making the usual appropriations . It is the tenacity of the friends of the fair that makes an agreement impossible , that keeps Congress in session , and that threatens to deprive the branches of the service named in the Sundry Civil bill from receiving the supplies which ought to have been voted before July 10 . The opponents Of the World 's Fair appropriation declare that they will not take the appropriation upon compulsion . When the House met to-day it was known that the participants in last night 's caucus were as far apart as ever . A motion for an adjournment followed immediately after the assembling , when Mr. Bailey ( Dem. , Texas , ) moved an adjournment until Friday . Mr. Dingley ( Rep .. Me. , ) wanted to know if " that was the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fifteen minutes was taken . When the fifteen minutes had expired , and the Democrats were still undetermined on any policy different from the old one , another recess of half an hour was taken . The Republicans worked at their desks during this time , and then a recess to last an hour was allowed at the suggestion of Mr. . After the order for the last recess was made , the Democrats assembled in the rooms of the Ways and Means Committee and there was speechmaking , following the lines discussed in last night 's caucus . But there was no agreement , except to disagree . The opponents of the Chicago appropriation were obstinate , and the friends of the appropriation were determined that there should be an appropriation for the fair or no bill . About all that seemed to be agreeable to all was the suggestion that the attendance of all members should be compelled , and that an effort be made to dispose of the appropriation bill in a full House . Upon the reassembling of the House the filibusters began again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Dem .. Texas. ) raised . the point of no quorum , and there was a call of the House . The call mustered 183 members , and then Mr. Lanham ( Dem. , Tema% ) offered the following resolution : Resolved , That the condition of the public business imperatively demands the immediate presence of all ablent members of the House ; that the Speaker be an 18 hereby requested to notify all such absentees to return at Once ; that all leaves of absence heretofore granted are revoked ; that it any absent member shall fail to return or notify the Speaker that he is en route to the capital within the next two days the Sergeant at Arms shall , in person or by deputy , proceed at once to the residence of such absent member and enforce his attendance . This resolution was promptly adopted , and , later on , the Speaker sent a , dispatch to each of the absentees , including " our own " Stahlneoker , as follows : " I urgently request your immediate attendance here . We can not break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not adjourn without disposing of the Sundry Civil bill . All leaves of absence are revoked . " It being impossible to make an progress , : the House adjourned until to-morrow . Some of the opponents or the Chicago appropriation have been amused at the suggestion made by Mr. Williams ( Dem. , 111.0 that a separate vote be taken on the Durborow bill , and that , pending the result of that vote , the appropriation bill be laid aside . But that seems to be a sort of " Heads I win , tails you lose " prop . osition to the opponents of the five-million gift , If the fair people lost the Durborrow bill , they would still be able to prevent a rejection of tint Senate amendment . On the other band , tint Chicago people say that , by allowing a vote on the Durborow proposition , the House would see that the majority is ip. favor of the approplat uriatipon on , ha and vi that its the majority is-en.latied to ilk , sng way .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
