txt //rly and lamented a termination . The whole has also been submitted to a careful revision , in order that it might be brought down to the latest advances in the department of science of which it treats , and also to include in it the final suggestions of the author . While Dr. Napheys evidently considered the second edition of the present work as meeting closely the requirements of readers , and therefore left behind him no notes which would alter the general plan , a number of corrections and minor changes have been made in the text , various paragraphs have been materially modified , and the Appendix referring to authorities more or less altered . The continued popularity of the work has been shown , not only by the steady demand for it , but by the efforts of various authors to write imitations of it , and various publishers to issue mutilated and imperfect editions . Against these the present publishers would warn innocent purchasers . The present is the only edition containing the important additions and corrections made by the author during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was authorized by him . In its present form , The Physical Life of Woman may justly claim to count among the classics of American literature . Its popularity increases with time , and none of the many similar works which have appeared have approached it in public estimation . It is believed that in the present edition no important scientific fact bearing upon the subject has been omitted , and the most recent developments of hygiene will be found discussed . 1878 . PREFACE TO THE SECOND STEREOTYPE EDITION . Three years have passed since the author of the present work ventured to lay it before the public , not without unusual anxiety as to the manner in which he had fulfilled a task he knew to be so fruitful of good results if well done . Those years of trial are over , and they have brought a recognition of his labors beyond his most sanguine dreams . Nearly one hundred and fifty thousand copies of the work have been sold in that period ; it has been separately republished both in Canada and England ; it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it which have been written form almost a small library ; and , more to the satisfaction of the author than all this , it has received the highest praise both at home and abroad , from both the medical profession and the general learned world . The present new stereotype edition contains the result of three more years of study and experience , enlightened and aided by very many letters from readers , which served to point out wherein the previous edition fell short of their wants . The text has been carefully revised , and in large part wholly rewritten ; nearly one hundred and fifty pages of selected new matter have been added ; and the latest steps of medical science in this direction have been followed . Of the parts which are quite new , and which from the inquiries of numerous readers will add greatly to the value of the work , are the sections on the disturbances of the monthly function in girls , the care of the child , the management of diseases of children , the diseases incident to pregnancy , childbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition the author has aimed to omit nothing which can aid Woman in performing her full duty to herself and others , so far as that duty lies in the sphere of her Physical Life , whether she is called upon to act as Wife , Mother , Teacher , or Guide . His most ardent desire continues to be that the work will be found a sure and safe monitor amid the difficult duties of Maidenhood and Maternity . LONDON , ENGLAND , October , 1872 . PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION . It seems well to offer , at the outset , a few words explanatory of the nature and object of this book . The author feels that its aim is novel , is daring , and will perhaps subject him to criticism . He therefore make his plea , pro domo sua , in advance . The researches of scientific men within the last few years have brought to light very many facts relating to the physiology of woman , the diseases to which she is subject , and the proper means to prevent those diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in great benefit to the individual and the commonwealth . The difficulty is to express one 's self clearly and popularly on topics never referred to in ordinary social intercourse . But as the physician is obliged daily to speak in plain yet decorous language of such matters , the author felt that the difficulty was not unsurmountable . He is aware that a respectable though diminishing class in the community maintain that nothing which relates exclusively to either sex should become the subject of popular medical instruction . With every inclination to do this class justice , he feels sure that such an opinion is radically erroneous . Ignorance is no more the mother of purity than she is of religion . The men and women who study and practise medicine are not the worse , but the better , for their knowledge of such matters . So it would be with the community . Had every person a sound understanding of the relations of the sexes , one of the most fertile sources of crime would be removed . A brief appendix has been added , directed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult some of the original authorities upon whom the author has drawn . And here he would ask from his fellow-members of the medical profession their countenance and assistance in his attempt to distribute sound information of this character among the people . None but physicians can know what sad consequences are constantly occurring from the want of it . * * * BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF GEORGE HENRY NAPHEYS , M.D. Were man 's life measured by his deeds , as the poet suggests , how brief would be the long years of many an octogenarian , and how extended the short span which has been allotted to not a few of the world 's famous heroes ! This oft-repeated thought strikes us forcibly in considering the biography of the subject of this sketch . Closing his life at an age when most professional men are but beginning theirs , he had already studied broadly , had traveled widely over two continents , had gained credit and fame by the sword and the pen , and had amassed a fund of erudition and experience which the more lethargic lives of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is eminently appropriate that a record of his busy career should be attached to the works on which his celebrity is chiefly bound , and in which he most conspicuously displays that command of language and happy facility of imparting instruction for which he was so remarkable . GEORGE HENRY NAPHEYS ( pronounced N=a'feez , the =a as in fate ) was born in the city of Philadelphia , March 5th , 1842 . His parents died while he was still at a tender age , and he was placed with some relatives who resided in the city . From early years he was characterized by quick perceptions and a retentive memory . In the Philadelphia High School , from which he received the academic degree of Master of Arts , he was considered the best scholar in his class , a marked distinction in view of the large numbers which attend that institution . Besides acquiring the usual studies of the High School , he gave considerable time to phonography , in which he became so skilled that he could report any ordinary speaker with entire accuracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical career . After his graduation he repaired to Hartford , Conn. , where he was offered and accepted the position of private secretary to a gentleman of prominence in the literary and religious world . Thus he was engaged when the civil war broke out . With his natural warmth of feeling and strong emotions , he entered the fray among the first , and went out as Lieutenant , and subsequently as Captain , Company F , 10th Connecticut State Volunteers . The regiment was enlisted for nine months , and was dispatched to Louisiana , General Banks then commanding the Department . It participated in engagements near Baton Rouge and on the Red River , in which Captain Napheys always acquitted himself with bravery and credit . At the time the regiment was disbanded , an early preference for medical subjects led him to devote a year to the preliminary studies of that profession , but not waiting the full period required for a degree , he was appointed assistant medical officer on the U. S. steamer Mingo , of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron . On her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of the Carolinas and Georgia , and ascended the St. John river . These active duties prevented him from receiving his degree of Doctor of Medicine until after the close of the war , when , in 1866 , his diploma was conferred upon him by the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia , one of the most renowned institutions of our country . After graduation , he opened an office in Philadelphia , and connected himself with the clinics which are held at the College for the purpose of supplying medicine and medical advice to the poor gratuitously , as well as for giving students an opportunity of witnessing various forms of disease . The practical experience he gained in this manner was considerable , and his natural ability soon recommended him to the authorities of the institution , who appointed him Chief of Medical Clinic of the College , a position he held for several years . One of the advantages of this post was that it brought him into constant communion with many eminent medical men , and rendered him practically acquainted with their treatment of disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lectures , and this led to his early connection with the periodical literature of the profession . Most of the reports he drew up were published in the Medical and Surgical Reporter , a weekly journal , devoted to medical science , published in Philadelphia . The series of reports commenced in April , 1866 , and continued , with slight interruptions , until June , 1870 . They are characterized by a clear and correct style , and a manifestly thorough grasp of the numerous topics treated . The success which these ephemeral writings obtained turned his thoughts in the direction of authorship . His tastes and associations led him to employ his powers in two directions : first , in preparing for the general public a series of works which would acquaint them with anatomy , physiology , hygiene , sanitary science , nursing , and the management of disease , to the extent that intelligent general readers can and ought to know about these subjects ; and secondly , in writing for professional men several treatises on the means of alleviating and curing diseases . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was early impressed with the utter absence of any treatise on the hygiene of the sexual life in either sex , written in the proper spirit by a scientific man . The field had been left to quacks or worse , who , to serve their own base ends , scattered inflammatory and often indecent pamphlets over the land ; or else , had one or more of the points been handled by reputable writers , it was in such a vague and imperfect manner that the reader gained little benefit from the perusal . While all agreed that a sound treatise on these topics was most desirable , it had been openly averred that it could not be written in a proper style for the general public . Strong in the conviction that pure motives , literary tact , and the requisite scientific knowledge qualified him to undertake this difficult task , Dr. Napheys prepared , in the early months of 1869 , his work on " The Physical Life of Woman . " Proceeding with caution , he first submitted the MSS. to some professional friends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , and before publication , he sent complete copies to a number of gentlemen , eminent as medical teachers , clergymen , educators , and literateurs . Their replies left him in no doubt but that he had succeeded even beyond his anticipations . Almost unanimously the opinions were complimentary in the highest degree , and evidently written after a close examination of the book . As many of these have been printed to accompany the work , in the last and previous editions , it is needless to do more in this connection than to say that they were penned by such judges as Dr. W. A. Hammond , late Surgeon-General U. S. Army ; Dr. Harvey L. Byrd , Professor in the Medical Department of Washington University , Md. ; Dr. Edwin M. Snow , Health Officer of the City of Providence , R. I. ; Rev. Henry Ward Beecher , Rev. Horace Bushnell , D.D. , Rev. George A. Crooke , D.D. , D.C.L. , and others . On its appearance , the work was received with enthusiasm by both the medical press and the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and censure the author , the intelligent and the pure-minded , on all sides , recognized in him the only writer who had yet appeared able to treat these delicate subjects with the dignity of science and the straightforwardness necessary for popular instruction . Satisfied that he had chosen the proper exercise for his talents , he composed and placed in the hands of his publisher , the following year , his not less extraordinary work , " The Transmission of Life , " a treatise addressed to the male , as his previous one had been to the female sex . It was dedicated to the late Rev. John Todd , so well known for his interest in young men , and his " Student 's Manual " and other works addressed to them . He accepted the dedication and addressed the author a letter , in which occurs the following high compliment to his work : " I am surprised at the extent and accuracy of your reading ; the judiciousness of your positions and results ; the clear , unequivocal , yet delicate and appropriate language used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similar expressions poured in from many other distinguished critics , as , for instance , Dr. Noah Porter , President of Yale College ; the Rev. Henry Clay Trumbull , the Rev. Abner Jackson , President of Trinity College , Hartford , etc . In the same year ( 1870 ) he brought out the first edition of his " Modern Therapeutics , " a technical work , addressed to physicians . This was enlarged in successive editions , until in its present form , as continued by other hands in its latest editions , it comprises two parts of 600 pages each . Although the author claimed little other originality in this work than the selection and arrangement of known facts , yet in these respects he displayed the strongly practical and original turn of his mind . As a student of the art of Therapeutics in large hospitals , clinics , and dispensaries , he had convinced himself that it is not by experiments on lower animals , nor yet on the human body in health , that the physician can attain the glorious power of alleviating pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sickness , by the bedside and in the consulting room . Chemistry and physiology , he believed , could teach but little in this branch ; observation and experience everything . Hence , in his work on Therapeutics he announced himself as " aiming at a systematic analysis of all current and approved means of combating disease , " selecting his formulae and therapeutical directions from the most eminent living physicians of all nations . This work was most favorably received by medical men ; and , edited and revised by competent hands , continues to be regarded as one of the most valuable works in American medical literature . The unanimous opinion of the leading medical journals , as well as of its numerous purchasers , have testified to its real and great worth to the practitioner of medicine . Having thus established a wide , popular and professional reputation , one which would have guaranteed him a lucrative practice , it would have tempted another , no doubt , to make the most of this opportunity , so rarely granted a young physician . Not so was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned been completed than he sailed for Europe , in order to familiarize himself with the famed schools of learning of the Old World and its rich stores of material for culture . The summer was that of the Franco-German war ; and spending most of it in Paris , he was witness of several of the most exciting scenes which attended the dethronement of the Emperor . These he would describe afterwards with a vividness and power of language rarely excelled . The excitement of the period did not , however , withdraw his attention from the studies he had in view . These were partially indicated in a series of letters he contributed to various periodicals during his absence . While these letters were principally of a scientific character , it is noteworthy how the relations of medicine to the welfare of man always occupied his attention . Thus we find , in one sent from England , June , 1870 , a description of the Liverpool Medical Missionary Society , a charity which combines religious instruction with medical advice ; and again , he comments on the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English workingmen by a committee of competent physicians , organized for that purpose . It was the author 's purpose to collect and expand these letters into a volume , but the project was not carried out . The siege of Paris , which city he left in one of the last trains before the blockade commenced , and the prolongation of the war , induced him to return home . In the United States he found offers from several publishers awaiting him , which would more than occupy him for a full year . There was a new edition of his " Therapeutics " demanded , and a revision of both " The Physical Life of Woman " and " The Transmission of Life . " A New England firm urgently pressed him to superintend the production of several hygienic works , and secured him as literary adviser to their house . He assumed the editorship of the " Half-Yearly Compendium of Medical Science , " and also of a " Physician 's Annual , " besides undertaking a number of articles for the periodical press , both scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1871 ; but at its close felt more strongly than ever that he must give himself several years of studious quiet , in order to accomplish his best . Refusing , therefore , any further engagements , he sailed for Europe again , late in 1871 , and did not return this time until the spring of 1875 . In this period , of more than three years , he visited almost all the principal cities of Europe , and enjoyed the friendship of many eminent men at London , St. Petersburg , Vienna , and Paris . Reading , visiting hospitals , and attending clinics , he accumulated a mass of material which he designed to work up into future literary enterprises . With these collected stores he returned to the United States early in 1875 , and set to work with his wonted energy . A new and much enlarged edition of the " Therapeutics " was sent to press ; a " Handbook of Popular Medicine , " designed to give , in simple language , the domestic treatment of disease , the rules for nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the outlines of anatomy and physiology , was put in the hands of a publisher ; a Synopsis of Pharmacy and Materia Medica , a work of enormous labor , was well under way ; and other literary projects were actively planned ; when , suddenly , the summons came which , in an instant , with the shears of fate , slit the strand of this activity . The rest of the story may be told in the words of the biographer appointed by the Medical Society of the County of Philadelphia to prepare a memoir of his life :  --  " While earnestly laboring to prepare for the press his literary collections , he suffered a severe blow by the sudden death of a person to whom he was deeply attached . Over-work and this emotional shock produced a result likely enough to occur in one of his ardent temperament . One afternoon , while engaged in writing , he fell , unconscious , from his chair , and for several days lay in a very critical condition . On recovering his powers , it was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and love of labor had completely gone ; even the capacity for work seemed absent . Marked melancholy followed , characterized before long by avoidance of friends and the loss of a desire of life . This occurred with increasing force until it led to his death , on July 1 , 1876 , through some toxic agent , the nature of which was not ascertained . " Thus early , and thus sadly , terminated a career of unusual brilliancy and promise . " It is probable that much that he has written will be read with pleasure and instruction by future generations ; and the memory of his genial disposition , his entertaining conversation , and earnest sense of professional honor , will long be cherished by those of his contemporaries who enjoyed his friendship . "  --  Transactions of the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania , vol. xi , p. 720 . Various tributes were paid to his memory by the societies with which he was connected , and by the scientific journals to which he had been a contributor . One of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke as follows :  --  " Thus did our unfortunate associate close his short but brilliant career . The emotions , the tender sentiments he has described with such a magical pen , he felt himself with an unmatched keenness . They mastered his whole frame with an intensity surpassing all romance . His descriptions of the passions , descriptions which have been the wonder of thousands , such is their fire and temper , were not rhetorical studies , but the ebullition of a soul sensitive to their lightest breath , and not shunning their wildest tempests . " The genius which dictated the lines he has left us is not to be judged by the conventionalities which suit the cold temperaments of ordinary men ; there is a strong vein of egotism in most devotion ; but here was one who felt , ' all is lost , when love is lost . ' " This extract well sets forth the extraordinary depth of his sentiments , and the fervor of his feelings . It may be added that these mental traits were not generally ascribed to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bearing , evidently not one who sought friendships or displayed to the general gaze the current of his thoughts . Consequently , of intimates he had but few , and was considered by those whose intercourse with him was superficial , to be much more of an intellectual than of an emotional type of character . This impression was doubtless increased by the strongly practical turn of his mind , which is conspicuous in all his works . He was the reverse of a dreamer and had little patience with theorists . In his professional study he always aimed at bringing into the strongest light the utilitarian aspect of medicine , its ameliorating power on humanity , its real efficacy in preserving or restoring health and limiting human misery . On this his theory of therapeutics was based , and , inspired by the same opinions , he was one of the most earnest advocates of the day of popularizing medical science in all its branches among the masses . In this effort he was at times severely criticized by that class of physicians  --  and they are by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mystery , and that the people should be kept in ignorance of themselves and of their own physical frailties , to the utmost possible extent . With these learned obscurantists Dr. Napheys had no patience , and naturally found but slight favor . Fortunately , they were in the decided minority , and , we are happy to add , even that minority is daily decreasing . Of the various learned societies to which he was attached may be mentioned the Philadelphia County Medical Society , the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia , and the Gynecological Society of Boston . His election as Corresponding Member to the latter body ( which is an association of scientific men who make an especial study of the hygiene and diseases of women ) took place shortly after the first publication of the Physical Life of Woman , and was meant as a direct tribute of respect to him as the author of that work , thus obtaining for it the testimony of the highest body in that specialty then existing in our land . The general plan on which Dr. Napheys prepared his sanitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most opposed to instructing the general public in such branches . While he confidently believed that vastly more harm than good is done by a prudish concealment of the physiology of sex and its relations to health , he also clearly recognized that such instruction should be imparted at the proper age and under certain limitations ; while the general facts common to the species can not be taught too generally , or made too familiar . Hence , he projected three books , one to be placed in the hands of young women , a second for youths , and a third for a general household book of reading and reference on medicine and hygiene . These three he completed in " The Physical Life of Woman , " " The Transmission of Life , " and the " Handbook of Popular Medicine . " This plan , he believed , met all the objections to popular medical instruction , at least all well-grounded objections , while at the same time it did away with any necessity for concealing truths important to be known , for fear they should come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed , and on whose minds they might have a disturbing tendency . There can be no doubt but that both the plan and its execution were successful . The many letters he received , filled with thanks from private parties who had gained inestimable knowledge from these works , made rich compensation for the occasional severe strictures he received from those wedded to ancient ways , and who often condemned without even reading his works . The intelligent reading public , on whom , after all , the writer must depend for a verdict on his works , were unanimous in his favor . They bought them in quantities , and the writer of his life in the Transactions of the Pennsylvania State Medical Society , above quoted , who wrote in 1877 , estimates that by that time over a quarter of a million copies had been printed and sold . Translations were made into the German , and several editions pirated and printed in Canada and England . In fact , the works may now be considered to rank as classics in the language , and many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on topics of this nature , with equal delicacy of touch and accuracy of knowledge .

NOTES 405-420 INDEX 420-426 THE PHYSICAL LIFE OF WOMAN . KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY . ' Knowledge is power , ' said the philosopher . The maxim is true ; but here is a greater truth : ' Knowledge is safety , '  --  safety amid the physical ills that beset us ,  --  safety amid the moral pitfalls that environ us . Filled with this thought , we write this book . It is the Revelation of Science to Woman . It tells her , in language which aims at nothing but simplicity , the results which the study of her nature , as distinct from that of man , has attained . We may call it her physical biography . It is high time that such a book were written . The most absorbing question of the day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefest interest concern her . And nowhere are those problems more zealously studied than in America , which has thrown aside the trammels of tradition , and is training its free muscles with intent to grapple the untried possibilities of social life . Who can guide us in these experiments ? What master , speaking as one having authority , can advise us ? There is such a guide , such a master . The laws of woman 's physical life shape her destiny and reveal her future . Within these laws all things are possible ; beyond them , nothing is of avail . Especially should woman herself understand her own nature . How many women are there , with health , beauty , merriment , ay , morality too , all gone , lost for ever , through ignorance of themselves ! What spurious delicacy is this which would hide from woman that which beyond all else it behooves her to know ? We repudiate it ; and in plain , but decorous language ,  --  truth is always decorous ,  --  we purpose to divulge those secrets hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE SEXES . The distinction of the sexes belongs neither to the highest nor to the lowest forms of existence . Animals and vegetables of the humblest character have no sex . So it is with spirits . Revelation implies that beyond this life sexual characteristics cease . On one occasion the Sadducees put this question to Christ : There was a woman who lawfully had seven husbands , one after the other ; now , at the resurrection , which of these shall be her husband ? or shall they all have her to wife ? He replied that hereafter there shall be neither marrying nor giving in marriage , but that all shall be ' as the angels which are in heaven . ' Sexuality implies reproduction , and that is something we do not associate with spiritual life . It further implies imperfection , which is equally far from our hopes of happiness beyond the grave . The polyp , which reproduces by a division of itself , is in one sense more complete than we are . The man is in some respects inferior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A happy marriage , a perfect union , they twain one flesh , is the type of the independent , completed being . Without the other , either is defective . ' Marriage , ' said Napoleon , ' is strictly indispensable to happiness . ' There is , in fact , a less difference between the sexes than is generally believed . They are but slight variations from one original plan . Anatomists maintain , with plausible arguments , that there is no part or organ in the one sex but has an analogous part or organ in the other , similar in structure , similar in position . Just as the right side resembles the left , so does man resemble woman . Let us see what differences there really are : The frame of woman is shorter and slighter . In the United States the men average five feet eight inches in height , and one hundred and forty-five pounds in weight ; the women , five feet two and a half inches in height , and one hundred and twenty-five pounds in weight . Man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broad hips . Her skull is formed of thinner bones , and is in shape more like that of a child . Its capacity , in proportion to her height , is very little less than in man ,  --  about one-fiftieth , it is said ,  --  which , so far as brain-power is concerned , may readily be made up by its finer texture . Her shoulders are set farther back than in the other sex , giving her greater breadth of chest in front . This is brought about by the increased length of her collar-bone ; and this is the reason why she can never throw a ball or stone with the accuracy of a man . Graceful in other exercises , here she is awkward . Her contour is more rounded , her neck is longer , her skin smoother , her voice softer , her hair less generally distributed over the body , but stronger in growth than in man . She breathes with the muscles of her chest  --  he with those of his abdomen . He has greater muscular force  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attributes of maternity ,  --  she is provided with organs to nourish and protect the child before and after birth . PERSONS OF BOTH SEXES AND OF NEITHER SEX . Nature is very sedulous in maintaining these differences . It is the rarest thing in the world to find a human being of doubtful sex . Many a physician disbelieves that there ever has been a person of both sexes  --  a true hermaphrodite . They are very scarce , but they do exist . There is one now living in Germany . It bears a female name , Catherine Hohmann . She was baptised and brought up a female ; but Catherine is as much man as woman . The learned professor of anatomy , Rokitansky , of Vienna , asserts most positively that this is a real hermaphrodite . Her history is sad . Born in humble circumstances , when of marriageable age she loved a man , who wished her to emigrate with him to America . But when she disclosed to him her deformity , he broke off the engagement and deserted her . Then her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she make her suit to one apparently of her own sex ? With passions that prompt her to seek both sexes , she belongs to neither . ' What shall I do here on earth ? ' she exclaimed , in tears , to a man of science who recently visited her . ' What am I ? In my life an object of scientific experiment , and after my death an anatomical curiosity . ' There are also persons  --  very few indeed  --  who have no sex at all . They are without organs and without passions . Such creatures seem to have been formed merely to show us that this much-talked-of difference of sex is , after all , nothing inherent in the constitution of things , and that individuals may be born , live and thrive , of both sexes , or of neither . THE SPHERE OF WOMAN . Our province lies within the physical sphere of woman . But we will here allow ourselves a momentary digression . It will be seen that while these differences are not radical , yet they are peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of woman . What opinion should we hold on this much-vexed question ? To this effect : The mental faculties of man and woman are unlike , but not unequal . Any argument to the contrary , drawn from the somewhat less weight of the brain of woman , is met by the fact that the most able men are often undersized , with small heads . The subordinate place which woman occupies in most states , arises partly from the fact that the part she plays in reproduction prevents her from devoting her whole time and energies to the acquisition of power , and partly from the fact that those faculties in which she is superior to man have been obscured and oppressed by the animal vigor and selfishness of the male . As civilisation advances , the natural rights of woman will be more and more freely conceded , until the sexes become absolutely equal before the law ; and , finally , her superiority in many respects will be granted , and she will reap the benefits of all the advantages it brings , without desiring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are imperatively needed . The most peculiar features of woman 's life are hers for a limited period only . Man is man for a longer time than woman is woman . With him it is a lifetime matter ; with her it is but for a score of years or so . Her child-bearing period is less than half her life . Within this time she passes through all the phases of that experience which is peculiarly her own . And these phases , what are they ? Nature herself defines them . They are three in number ,  --  the Maiden , the Wife , and the Mother . In one and then another of this triad , her life passes . Each has its own duties and dangers ; each demands its own precautions ; each must be studied by itself . Let us at once commence this important study , and proceed in the order of time . THE MAIDEN . PUBERTY . At a certain period in the life of the female , she ceases to be a girl , and becomes a woman . Hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her playmates . But now a crisis takes place , which is for ever after to hedge her round with a mysterious , invisible , but most real barrier from all mankind . This period is called the age of puberty . Its sign is a flow of blood recurring every month ; its meaning , that the female has entered upon that portion of her life whose peculiar obligations are to the whole race  --  no longer to herself alone . The second part of her twofold nature is opened . Why is it that on her , the weaker sex , this extra burden is laid ? Why this weakness , these pains , this recurring loss of vital fluid ? Perhaps , as has been observed , it is a wise provision that she is thus reminded of her lowly duty , lest man should make her the sole object of his worship , or lest the pride of beauty should obscure the sense of shame . But this question concerns rather the moralist than the physician , and we cease asking why it is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns a clear reply . In the anatomy of woman there are two small bodies , in shape and size like large almonds , called the ovaries . They lie one on each side of the womb , and are connected with it by tubes about four inches in length . These bodies are solid , but contain a great number of diminutive vesicles , which , by some mysterious law of nature , mature one at a time , every thirty days , for thirty years of woman 's life . When mature , the vesicle separates from the ovary , traverses the tube into the womb , and is thence expelled and lost , or becomes , by contact with the other sex , the germ of a living being . This process is accompanied by a disturbance of the whole system . Wandering pains are felt ; a sense of languor steals over the mind ; the blood rushes with increased violence through the vessels , and more or less of it escapes from the veins , causing that change which we term menstruation . The ancients had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made from an egg ; the naturalists of past generations had this maxim : Everything living comes from an egg ; and science to-day says the same . For this vesicle we have mentioned is in fact an egg , similar in structure to those which birds , fish , and turtles deposit . The only differences are , that the one is developed out of the body , the other within ; the one has a shell , the other has none . Therefore physiologists give this definition : Menstruation is ovulation ,  --  it is the laying of an egg . WHAT IS THE AGE OF PUBERTY ? This has been a matter of careful study by physicians . They have collected great numbers of observations , and have reached this conclusion : In the middle portion of the temperate zone , the average age when the first period appears in healthy girls is fourteen years and six months . If it occurs more than six months later or earlier than this , then it is likely something is wrong , or , at least , the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely departed from in apparently perfect health , are rare . But they do occur . We have known instances where the solicitude of parents has been excited by the long delay of this constitutional change , and others in which it has taken place at an almost tender age , without causing any perceptible injury to the general health . There is an instance recorded , on good authority , where a French child but three years old underwent all the physical changes incident to puberty , and grew to be a healthy woman . But what children can surpass the American in precocity ? This French child-woman is quite left in the shade by one described in a recent number of a western medical journal , who from her birth had regular monthly changes , and the full physical development which marks the perfect woman ! Thus , sometimes , a wide deviation from the average age we have stated occurs , without having any serious meaning . Yet at no time is such a deviation to be neglected . In nine out of ten instances it is owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or formation , which should be ascertained and corrected . Otherwise years of broken health and mental misery may be the sad results . Mothers , teachers , it is with you this responsibility rests . The thousands of wretched wives , who owe their wretchedness to a neglect of proper attention at this turning-point of their lives , warn you how serious is this responsibility . The foundation of old age , says a distinguished author , is laid in childhood ; but the health of middle-life depends upon puberty . Never was there a truer maxim . The two years which change the girl to the woman often seal for ever the happiness or the hopeless misery of her whole life . They decide whether she is to become a healthy , helpful , cheerful wife and mother , or a languid , complaining invalid , to whom marriage is a curse , children an affliction , and life itself a burden . We reiterate our warning : Mothers , teachers , you to whom children are confided at this crisis of their lives , look well to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have assumed . Let no false modesty prevent you from learning and enforcing those precautions , so necessary at this period of life . WHAT HASTENS AND WHAT RETARDS PUBERTY ? As a rule , we find that those who develope early , fade early . A short childhood portends a premature old age . It often foreshadows , also , a feeble middle-life . Having ascertained , therefore , what is the average age at which puberty takes place with us , let us see what conditions anticipate or retard this age . The most important is climate . In hot climates , man , like the vegetation , has a surprising rapidity of growth . Marriages are usual at twelve or fourteen years of age . Puberty comes to both sexes as early as at ten and eleven years . We even read in the life of Mohammed , that one of his wives , when but ten years of age , bore him a son . Let another dozen years pass , and these blooming maidens have been metamorphosed into wrinkled , faded old women . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flower which is plucked . Very different is it in the cold and barren regions of the far north . There man , once more partaking of the nature of his surroundings , yields as slowly to the impulses of his passions as does the ice-bound earth to the slanting rays of the summer sun . Maturity , so quick to come , so swift to leave in the torrid heats , arrives , chilled by the long winters , to the girls of Lapland , Norway , and Siberia , only when they are eighteen and nineteen years of age . But , in return for this , they retain their vigor and good looks to a green old age . Between these extremes , including as they do the whole second decade of existence , this important change takes place normally in different latitudes . We have said that in the middle temperate zone the proper age is fourteen years and six months . Let us now see what conditions lead to deviations from this age in our climate . First on the list is that sacred fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , in our material language , the constitution . The females of certain races , certain families , it is often noticed , mature earlier than their neighbours . Jewesses , for example , are always precocious , earlier by one or two years . So are colored girls , and those of creole lineage . We can guess the reasons here . No doubt these children still retain in their blood the tropic fire which , at comparatively recent periods , their forefathers felt under the vertical rays of the torrid zone . Nor is this all . It is well ascertained , from numerous observations , that brunettes develope sooner than their blonde sisters ; that those who will grow to be large women are slower than those whose stature will be small ; that the dark-haired and black-eyed are more precocious in this respect than the light-haired and blue-eyed ; that the fat , sluggish girl is more tardy than the slender , active one ; that , in general , what is known as the nervo-bilious temperament is ever ahead of that called the lymphatic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a good sign to see this change before the usual average time . It betokens a weakly , excitable , diminutive frame . Hard labor , vigorous , regular muscular exertion  --  prime health , in other words  --  never tends to anticipate this epoch , but rather to retard it . With this warning fresh in our ears , let us now rehearse what causes constantly incline unduly to hasten puberty , and thus to forestall wise Nature in her plans for health and beauty . They are of two kinds ,  --  physical and mental . Idleness of body , highly-seasoned food , stimulating beverages , such as beer , wine , liqueurs , and , in a less degree , coffee and tea , irregular habits of sleep ,  --  these are the physical causes of premature development . But the mental causes are still more potent . Whatever stimulates the emotions leads to an unnaturally early sexual life . Late hours , children 's parties , sensational novels , ' flashy ' papers , love stories , the drama , the ball-room , talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of riper years which is so often and so injudiciously thrown around childhood ,  --  all hasten the event which transforms the girl into the woman . A particular emphasis has been laid by some physicians on the power of music to awaken the dormant susceptibilities to passion , and on this account its too general or earnest cultivation by children has been objected to . Educators would do well to bear this caution in mind . How powerfully these causes work is evident when we compare the average age of puberty in large cities and in country districts . The females in the former mature from six to eight months sooner than those in the latter . This is unquestionably owing to their mode of life ,  --  physically indolent , mentally over-stimulated . The result , too , is seen with painful plainness in comparing the sturdy , well-preserved farm-wife of thirty , with the languid , pale , faded city lady of the same age . THE CHANGES IT WORKS . Two short years change the awkward and angular girl of fourteen into the trim and graceful maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fairy has touched her , and she comes forth a new being , a vision of beauty to bewitch the world . Let us analyze this change . The earliest sign of approaching puberty is a deposit of fat in the loose cellular tissue under the skin . This gives roundness to the form , and grace to the movements . According to a distinguished naturalist ( Buffon ) , it is first observable by a slight swelling of the groins . Thence it extends over the whole body . The breasts especially receive additions , and develope to form the perfect bust . Parts of the body previously free from hair become covered with a soft growth , and that which covers the head acquires more vigor and gloss , usually becoming one or two shades darker . The eyes brighten , and acquire unwonted significance . These windows of the soul betray to the close observer the novel emotions which are arising in the mind within . The voice , too , shares in the transformation . The piping , slender articulation of the child gives way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the sweetest music man ever hears . To the student of humanity , to the observant physician , nothing is more symbolical of the whole nature than the voice . Would you witness a proof of its power ? Watch how a person born blind unerringly discriminates the character of those he meets by this alone . Beyond all external modifications , we find others , which indicate how profound is the alteration now taking place . The internal organs of the body assume new functions and new powers . The taste for food changes , hinting that the system has demands hitherto unknown . Those organs we have adverted to , called the ovaries , increase in size , as also does the uterus . The very framework of the structure does not escape . The bones increase in weight , and those around the hips expand , and give the female her distinctive form , upon the perfection of which her life and that of her children depend . MENTAL CHANGES . Such are the changes which strike the eye . But there are others which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchful heed . New thoughts , strange desires , are invading the soul . A novel relation is assumed to the world . It is vague , misunderstood , but disturbing all the same . The once light-hearted girl inclines to reveries ; she seeks solitude ; her mother surprises her in causeless tears ; her teacher discovers an unwonted inattention to her studies , a less retentive memory , a disinclination to mental labor ; her father misses her accustomed playfulness ; he , perhaps , is annoyed by her listlessness and inertia . What does it all mean ? What is the matter with the girl ? Mother , teacher , father , it is for you to know the answers to these questions . You have guarded this girl through years of helpless infancy and thoughtless childhood . At the peril of her life , and of what is of more value than life , do not now relax your vigilance . Every day the reaper Death reaps with his keen sickle the flowers of our land . The mothers weep , indeed ; but little do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as was their duty , that the Lord of Paradise has taken them back unto Himself . THE COMPLETION OF PUBERTY . The symptoms increase until at length the system has acquired the necessary strength , and furnished itself with reserve forces enough to complete its transformation . Then the monthly flow commences . In thoroughly healthy girls it continues to recur at regular intervals , from twenty-five to thirty days apart . This is true of about three out of four . In others , a long interval , sometimes six months , occurs between the first and second sickness . If the general health be not in the least impaired , this need cause no anxiety . Irregularities are found in the first year or two , which often right themselves afterwards . But whenever they are associated with the slightest signs of mental or bodily disorder , they demand instant and intelligent attention . It used to be supposed that the periods of the monthly sickness were in some way connected with the phases of the moon . So general is this belief even yet in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth while carefully to compare over four thousand observations , to see whether they did bear any relations to the lunar phases . It is hardly worth while to add that he found none . We have known perfectly healthy young women who were ill every sixteen days , and others in whom a period of thirty-five or thirty-six days would elapse . The reasons of such differences are not clear . Some inherited peculiarity of constitution is doubtless at work . Climate is of primary importance . Travellers in Lapland , and other countries in the far north , say that the women there are not regulated more frequently than three or four times a year . Hard labor and a phlegmatic temperament usually prolong the interval between the periodical illnesses . An equal diversity prevails in reference to the length of time the discharge continues . The average of a large number of cases observed in healthy women , between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five , is four days and a fraction . In a more general way , we may say from two to six days is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it is likely some mischief is at work . In relation to the amount of the discharge , every woman is a law unto herself . Usually , it is four or five ounces in all . Habits of life are apt to modify it materially . Here , again , those exposed to prolonged cold and inured to severe labor escape more easily than their sisters petted in the lap of luxury . Delicate , feeble , nervous women  --  those , in other words , who can least afford the loss of blood  --  are precisely those who lose the most . Nature , who is no tender mother , but a stern step-mother , thus punishes them for disregarding her laws . Soft couches , indolent ease , highly spiced food ; warm rooms , weak muscles ,  --  these are the infractions of her rules which she revenges with vigorous , ay , merciless severity . It is well known , too , that excitement of the emotions , whether of anger , joy , grief , hatred , or love increases the discharge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misinterpreting it as half-knowledge always does , suppose it a sign of stronger animal passions . It bears no such meaning . But the fact reads us a lesson how important it is to cultivate a placid mind , free from strong desire or fear , and to hold all our emotions in the firm leash of reason . Physicians attach great importance to the character of the discharge . It should be thin , watery , dark-coloured , and never clot . If it clots , it is an indication that something is wrong . THE DANGERS OF PUBERTY . We have shown that there are constantly individual deviations , quite consistent with health , from any given standard . They only become significant of disease when they depart decidedly from the average , either in the frequency of the illness , its duration , the amount of the discharge , or the character . More or less pain , more or less prostration and general disturbances at these epochs , are universal and inevitable . They are part of the sentence which at the outset He pronounced upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception . ' Yet with merciful kindness He has provided means by which the pain may be greatly lessened , and the sorrow avoided ; and that we may learn and observe these means , their neglect often increases a hundred-fold the natural suffering . At this critical period , the seeds of hereditary and constitutional diseases manifest themselves . They draw fresh malignancy from the new activity of the system . The first symptoms of tubercular consumption , of scrofula , of obstinate and disfiguring skin diseases , of hereditary insanity , of congenital epilepsy , of a hundred terrible maladies , which from birth have lurked in the child , biding the opportunity of attack , suddenly spring from their lairs , and hurry her to the grave or the madhouse . If we ask why so many fair girls of eighteen or twenty are followed by weeping friends to an early tomb , the answer is , chiefly from diseases which had their origin at the period of puberty . It is impossible for us here to rehearse all the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practised physician of the approach of one of these fearful foes in time to allow him to make a defence . We can do little more than iterate the warning , that whenever , at this momentous epoch , any disquieting change appears , be it physical or mental , let not a day be lost in summoning skilled , competent medical advice . There is , however , a train of symptoms so frequent , so insidious , so fruitful with agony of mind and body , that we shall mention them particularly . They illustrate , at once , how all-important is close observation , and how significant to the wise physician are trifles seemingly light as air . If you notice a girl of fourteen or sixteen , who , in walking , always gives one arm in preference to the other to her companion ; if , in sleeping , she mostly lies on the same side ; if , in sitting , she is apt to prefer a chair with a low back , and throws one arm over its back ; if you perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the other ; if she , on inquiry , confesses to slight , wandering pains in one side of her chest ,  --  do not chide her for awkwardness . These are ominous portents . They mean spinal disease , than which a more fearful malady is hardly known to medicine . Not less stealthy is the approach of disease of the hip-joint , of white swelling of the knee , of consumption ,  --  all curable if taken in hand at the very first , all well-nigh hopeless when they have once unmasked their real features . Apart from these general dangers , to which those of thoroughly sound constitutions are not exposed , there are disorders called functional , to which all are subject . GREEN SICKNESS . When we speak of the ' green sickness , ' we mention perhaps the most common of all , and one of which every mother has heard . Doctors call it chlorosis , which also means greenness ; for one of its most common and peculiar symptoms is a pale complexion with a greenish tinge . It never occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was long supposed to be merely an impoverishment of the blood . Now , however , we have learned that it is a disease of the nervous system , and one very often confounded by physicians with other complaints . Its attack is insidious . A distaste for exertion and society , a fitful appetite , low spirits ,  --  these are all the symptoms noticed at first . Then , one by one , come palpitation of the heart , an unhealthy complexion , irregularity , dyspepsia , depraved tastes ,  --  such as a desire to eat slate-pencil dust , chalk , or clay ,  --  vague pains in body and limbs , a bad temper ; until the girl , after several months , is a peevish , wretched , troublesome invalid . Then , if a physician is called in , and gives her iron , and tells her nothing is the matter , or is himself alarmed , and imagines she has heart disease or consumption , it is a chance if she does not rapidly sink , out of mere fright and over-much dosing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that chlorosis , though often obstinate and obscure , is always curable if properly and promptly treated . The remedies must be addressed to the nervous system , and can be administered with intelligence only by a competent medical adviser . It can be prevented by a hygienic mode of life , and , as its most common causes are anxiety , home-sickness , want of exercise , or overwork at school , nothing is so salutary in its early stages as a change of air and scene , cheerful company , a tour to the mountains or some watering-place , and regular exercise . Many young women suffer considerable pain during their monthly illness . This may arise from many different causes , such as , congestion , inflammation , malformation , or a wrong position of the parts , or over-sensitive nerves . They can only be successfully treated when the cause is known ; and they may rest assured that this suffering , in nearly every case , can be removed . Sometimes a girl grows to the age of eighteen or twenty without having her periodical changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some climates and in some families ; so , as long as the general health is good and the spirits cheerful ,  --  always an important point ,  --  it need cause no anxiety . But if the health grow poor , and especially if there be pains and weakness recurring monthly without discharge , then something is wrong , and the doctor should be consulted . HYSTERICS . There is a disease of the nerves to which girls about the age of puberty are very subject , particularly in the higher circles of society , where their emotions are over-educated and their organization delicate . It is called hysteria , and more commonly hysterics . Frequently it deceives both doctor and friends , and is supposed to be some dangerous complaint . Often it puts on the symptoms of epilepsy , or heart disease , or consumption . We have witnessed the most frightful convulsions in girls of fourteen or fifteen , which were brought on by this complaint . Sometimes it injures the mind ; and it should always receive prompt and efficient attention , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar affection in other girls of the same age who see the attacks . For this reason , hysterical girls should not be sent to large schools , but cured at home . Often a strong mental impression restores them . The anecdote is told of a celebrated surgeon ( Boerhaave ) who was called to a female seminary where there was a number of hysterical girls . He summoned them together , heated a number of iron instruments before their eyes , and told them that the first one who had a fit should be cauterized down the spine . They all recovered immediately . SECRET BAD HABITS . We now approach a part of our subject which we would gladly omit , did not constant experience admonish us of our duty to speak of it in no uncertain tone . We refer to the disastrous consequences on soul and body to which young girls expose themselves by exciting and indulging morbid passions . Years ago , Miss Catherine E. Beecher sounded a note of warning to the mothers of America on this secret vice , which leads their daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , the brothel . Gladly would we believe that her timely admonition had done away with the necessity for its repetition . But though we believe such a habit is more rare than many physicians suppose , it certainly exists to a degree that demands attention . Surgeons have recently been forced to devise painful operations to hinder young girls from thus ruining themselves ; and we must confess that , in its worst form , it is absolutely incurable . The results of the constant nervous excitement which this habit produces are bodily weakness , loss of memory , low spirits , distressing nervousness , a capricious appetite , dislike of company and of study , and finally , paralysis , imbecility , or insanity . Let it not be supposed that there are many who suffer thus severely ; but , on the other hand , let it be clearly understood that any indulgence whatever in these evil courses is attended with bad effects , especially because they create impure desires and thoughts , which will prepare the girl to be a willing victim to the arts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have the charge of young females than to protect them against this vice . But , it is exclaimed , is it not dangerous to tell them anything about it ? Such a course is unnecessary . Teach them that any handling of the parts , any indecent language , any impure thought , is degrading and hurtful . See that the servants , nurses , and companions with whom they associate are not debased ; and recommend scrupulous cleanliness . If the habit is discovered , do not scold nor whip the child . It is often a result of disease , and induced by a disagreeable local itching . Sometimes this is connected with a disorder of the womb , and very frequently with worms in the bowels . Let the case be submitted to a judicious , skilful medical adviser , and the girl will yet be saved . But do not shut your eyes , and refuse to see this fact when it exists . Mothers are too often unwilling to entertain for a moment the thought that their daughters are addicted to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician . THE HYGIENE OF PUBERTY . Concerning the maladies of puberty , we may broadly say , that if we are obliged to have recourse to medicine , it is because we have neglected hygiene . That the period requires assiduous care , we grant ; but given that care , drugs will be needless . In a general way , we have already emphasized the danger of indolence and the benefits of exercise or labor ; the perils of exciting the emotions , and the advantages of a placid disposition ; the impropriety of premature development , and the wisdom of simplicity and moderation . This is an old story  --  a thrice-told tale . Let us go more into minutiae . One of the most frequent causes of disease , about the age of puberty , is starvation . Many a girl is starved to death . Food is given her , but not of the right quality , or in insufficient quantity , or at improper hours . The system is not nourished , and , becoming feeble , it is laid open to the attacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to consumption . To correct this , let the food be varied , simply prepared , and abundant . Good fresh milk should be used daily , while tea and coffee should be withheld . Fat meats and vegetable oils , generally disliked by girls at this age , are exactly what they need ; and were they partaken of more freely , there would be less inquiry at the druggists for cod-liver oil . A modern writer of eminence lays it down as one of the most common causes of consumption in young people , that just at the age when their physical system is undergoing such important changes , that invaluable article of diet , milk , is generally dropped , and nothing equally rich in nitrogen substituted in its place . Exercise , whether as games , the skipping rope , croquet , walking , dancing , riding , and calisthenics , or as regular labor , is highly beneficial , especially when it leads one into the fresh air , the sunshine , and the country . A particular kind of exercise is to be recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who have a hereditary predisposition to consumption . If it is systematically practised along with other means of health , we would guarantee any child , no matter how many relatives have died of this disease , against its invasion . It is voluntary inspiration . Nothing is more simple . Let her stand erect , throw the shoulders well back , and the hands behind ; then let her slowly inhale pure air to the full capacity of the lungs , and retain it a few seconds by an increased effort ; then it may be slowly exhaled . After one or two natural inspirations , let her repeat the act , and so on for ten or fifteen minutes , twice daily . Not only is this simple procedure a safeguard against consumption , but , in the opinion of some learned physicians , it can even cure it when it has already commenced . At first the monthly loss of blood exhausts the system . Therefore , plenty of food , plenty of rest , plenty of sleep , are required . That ancient prejudice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl should retire early , and if she will , should sleep late . Hard study , care , or anxiety should be spared her . This is not the time for rigid discipline . Clothing is a matter of importance , and , if we were at all sure of attention , there is much we would say of it . The thought seriously troubles us , that so long as women consent to deform themselves and sacrifice their health to false ideas of beauty , it is almost hopeless to urge their fitness for , and their right to a higher life than they now enjoy . No educated painter or sculptor is ignorant of what the model of female beauty is ; no fashionable woman is content unless she departs from it as far as possible . Now beauty implies health , and ugliness of form is attained not only at the expense of aesthetics , but of comfort . The custom of fastening growing girls in tight corsets , of flattening their breasts with pads , of distorting their feet in small high-heeled shoes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is calculated to disgust every observer of good sense and taste , and , what is of more consequence , to render these girls , when they become women , more liable to every species of suffering connected with child-bearing . The monthly change is the prelude to maternity . On its healthful recurrence depends present comfort and future health ; and not these alone , but also happiness in marriage , easy child-beds , and the constitution of children to a degree the thoughtless girl and even the mature woman rarely understand . She , therefore , who neglects the due care of her own condition , violates a duty owed to others as well as herself . We would have mothers impress this on their daughters . Let no mistaken modesty prevent them . Especially at their commencement should the monthly changes be carefully watched . The mother should prepare her daughter 's mind betimes for such an expected incident in her life , thus preventing a useless fright , or the employment of injurious means to stop what the child may look upon as an accident . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should exist on the one side , such trusting confidence on the other , that the mother should acquaint herself with every detail of each recurring period until the function is thoroughly established . She should inquire into the duration of each epoch , the abundance of the discharge , the presence of pain , and its effects on the general health . She should convince herself that all these do not vary from the standards of health we have previously laid down . Or should they do so , she should not delay to use the proper means to bring them to that standard . Long observation proves that if , during the first two or three years which follow the attainment of puberty , the health of the girl is successfully guarded , and this , her most important physical distinction , meets with no derangement , her life-long health is well-nigh secured ; but , on the contrary , if she commences her sexual life with pain and disorder , she is likely to be a life-long sufferer . We are about to approach a topic of vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , the precautions necessary to attain this end . They can most conveniently be divided into those to be observed during the monthly changes , and those more general rules of health to be obeyed in the intervals of the periods . PRECAUTIONS DURING THE MONTHLY CHANGES . At the head of all cautions and warnings which we could give about the care of the health at these monthly periods , we put rest , rest , bodily and mental . Do less than usual , we say to all , whether the necessity for it is manifest or not . Over-exertion is a most fruitful cause of disease . Long walks , shopping , dancing , riding , hard work whether for pleasure or profit , should be avoided to the utmost . The advantages of rest can not be over-estimated . A striking example of it occurs to our mind . Most readers are aware how toilsome are the lives of the Indian women among our Western tribes , and also how singularly easy and almost painless is their child-bearing . The pangs of travail are almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even physicians . We can tell them . It is because it is an inviolable , a sacred rule among all those tribes , for the woman , when having her monthly sickness , to drop all work , absent herself from the lodge , and remain in perfect rest as long as the discharge continues . Traces of this wide-spread custom among primitive people , extended themselves , are discoverable among civilized lands . The famous general council of the Christian Church held at Nice in the fourth century , passed a rule disapproving of women coming to church at the times of their menstrual sickness . The cold and dampness of large edifices , the mental excitement and its unfavourable effects and the exertion requisite for long walks to and fro , would justify this rule on purely hygienic grounds , and such may have caused its adoption . A moderate and uniform temperature favors health at such epochs ; while exposure to heat or cold , and the drinking freely of iced water or stimulants should be shunned . The popular belief that bathing is hurtful , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned ; but it is well to know , in the interests of comfort and cleanliness , that a moderately warm-bath , about 80 deg . Fahr. , will do no injury . Such a bath can be taken without any hesitation . We sanction , also , another well-known rule , and that is , that no purgative medicine should be taken immediately before or during the change . If called for by some other disorder , a mild laxative is all that should be administered , unless by the direction of a physician . PRECAUTIONS IN THE INTERVALS OF THE MONTHLY CHANGES . If girls suffer from irregularities in this respect , the causes can generally be found either in some affection threatening the general health , such as scrofula , consumption , green sickness , etc. , or else in their mode of life . For the former , the family physician must be consulted ; but if it is the latter which is at fault , the remedy is in the hands of the parents . Boarding-school life , city life , mental troubles  --  these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girlhood . No one rates at higher value than ourselves the training of the mind ; but we do not hesitate a moment to urge that if perturbations of the functions become at all marked in a girl at school , she should be taken away . Better live at home in seeming idleness a year at that time of life , than become a dead-weight , through constant ill health , on her husband in after life . So of the unwholesome excitement of a city life . There is a poison in crowds , and it acts in a thousand unseen ways . With the ceaseless noise , the broken sleep , the late hours , the impure air , and the nervous tension which all these produce , it requires no strength of imagination to perceive that the city is not the best place for the delicate girl . We have mentioned mental troubles . Perhaps there are , among those who read this , some superficial enough to smile at the possibility of serious mental troubles in girlhood . There are , we know , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them . But we have an unfailing witness in the sympathetic heart of the mother . She has not forgotten how bitter were the crosses of her own younger years ; she knows that the sensitive soul of woman wakes early to the keenest appreciation of grief as well as joy . If anything , years blunt us , and the sorrows of youth are often the bitterest of our lives . Let the mother , therefore , read with her wondrous maternal instinct the trials of her daughter ; let her become her most intimate confidant , and pour upon the wounded spirit that balm which none but a woman , and that woman a mother , knows how to apply . Such a relationship of mother and daughter is no less natural and wholesome than it is beautiful . WHEN THE CHANGES ARE DELAYED . In health an equal interval , or one nearly equal , elapses between the monthly illnesses . Often in the spring , however , their appearance anticipates the expected date of their occurrence , and in the autumn they are frequently a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , heat accelerating and cold retarding the process of ovulation . Such slight irregularities need not give rise to anxiety ; but if there is an unwonted delay , combined with other symptoms of ill-health , as headache , pain in the side and back , a sense of languor and exhaustion , loss of appetite , and nausea , and fitful sleep , then it is important that some steps be taken to bring on the courses . For this purpose , soaking the feet in hot-mustard water , a tumbler of hot ginger or camomile-tea , a brisk walk , or a gentle laxative will generally be found sufficient . Gently kneading the lower abdomen and loins is a familiar , and if intelligently done , a safe means for the same purpose . More violent means than these should be eschewed . Whichever are used subsequent to their employment , rest , in a recumbent position , in a warm room should be secured . WHEN THE CHANGES ARE PAINFUL . There are wide individual differences in this respect . Some young women suffer much from local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently losing anything in general health ; others experience no distress whatever . The causes of painful periods are various . Sometimes they depend on a tendency to rheumatism or to ague . Over-work , or excessive devotion to social duties and pleasures , is often their source . Cold and damp are common incidental causes . Green sickness and general debility are sometimes to blame . Of course the treatment must depend on which one of these is present . It is a good rule , however , always to wear flannel next the skin ; also , to avoid exposure to the weather for several days before the change is expected . A large , hot , linseed-meal poultice , over which a dessert-spoonful of laudanum has been sprinkled , or a large mustard-plaster , spread on the lower abdomen , will afford much relief . A hot brick or bottle of hot water wrapped in flannel , and applied to the small of the back , is often of great service . Rest in bed is always to be recommended . A tea-spoonful of sweet spirits of nitre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means are not sufficient , it would be better to consult a physician . A common belief is that such troubles are cured by marriage . Sometimes they are , but we do not approve the remedy . The state of marriage should be entered upon in perfect health and full vigor . Upon it depends the health of future generations , and it were better for them did only those assume its bonds who are able to endow their children with sound physical frames . THE AGE OF NUBILITY . It does not follow , because a girl is capable of marriage , that she is fit for it . Science teaches us many valid objections to too early unions . It goes farther , and fixes a certain age at which it is wisest for woman to marry . This age is between twenty and twenty-five years . Anatomists have learned that after puberty the bones of a woman 's body undergo important modifications to fit her for child-bearing . This requires time , and before twenty the process is not completed . Until the woman is perfect herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is not properly qualified to assist in perpetuating the species . We might urge that up to this moment neither does her self-knowledge qualify her to choose a life-companion , nor can her education be finished , nor is her experience sufficient for her to enter on the duties of a matron . But we do not appeal to these arguments . There are others still more forcible . If her own health , life , and good looks are of value to her , if she has any wish for healthy , sound minded children , she will refrain from premature nuptials . A too youthful wife finds marriage not a pleasure but a pain . Her nervous system is prostrated by it ; she is more liable to weakness and diseases of the womb ; and if of a consumptive family , she runs great risk of finding that fatal malady manifest itself after a year or two of wedded life . It is very common for those who marry young to die young . From statistics which have been carefully compiled , it is proven that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful , tedious , and dangerous to life , than others . As wives , they are frequently visited either with absolute sterility , and all their lives must bear the reproach of barren women , or , what to many is hardly less distasteful , they have an excessively numerous family . What adds to their sufferings in the latter event , is that the children of such marriages are rarely healthy . They are feeble , sickly , undersized , often with some fault of mind or body , which is a cross to them and their parents all their lives . They inherit more readily the defects of their ancestors , and , as a rule , die at earlier years than the progeny of better-timed unions . These considerations are formidable enough , it would seem , to prevent young girls from marrying , without the need of a law , as exists in some countries . Moreover , they are not imaginary , but real , as many a woman finds out to her cost . The objections to marriage after the age of twenty-five are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She should know that the first labors of wives over thirty are nearly twice as fatal as those between twenty and twenty-five . Undoubtedly nature points to the period between the twentieth and twenty-fifth year as the fittest one for marriage in the woman . LOVE . ITS POWER ON HUMANITY . Love , pure love , true love , what can we say of it ? The dream of youth ; the cherished reminiscence of age ; celebrated in the songs of poets ; that which impels the warrior to his most daring deeds ; which the inspired prophet chooses to typify the holiest sentiments ,  --  what new thing is it possible to say about this theme ? Think for a moment on the history or the literature of the world . Ask the naturalist to reveal the mysteries of life ; let the mythologist explain the origin and meaning of all unrevealed religions ; look within at the promptings of your own spirit , and this whole life of ours will appear to you as one grand epithalamium . The profoundest of English poets has said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever stirs this mortal frame , All are but ministers of Love , And feed his sacred flame . ' That life which is devoid of love is incomplete , sterile , unsatisfactory . It fails of its chiefest end . Nature , in anger , blots it out sooner , and it passes like the shadow of a cloud , leaving no trace behind . Admirable as it may be in other respects , to the eye of the statesman , the physician , the lover of his species , it remains but a fragment , a torso . Love is one thing to a woman , another to a man . To him , said Madame de Stael , it is an episode ; to her , it is the whole history of life . A thousand distractions divert man . Fame , riches , power , pleasure , all struggle in his bosom to displace the sentiment of love . They are its rivals , not rarely its masters . But woman knows no such distractions . One passion only sits enthroned in her bosom ; one only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no successor . This passion is love ! This idol is its object . This is not fancy , not rhetoric ; it is the language of cold and exact science , pronounced from the chair of history , from the bureau of the statistician , from the dissecting table of the anatomist . We shall gather up their well-weighed words , and present them , not as fancy sketches , but as facts . This deep , all-absorbing , single , wondrous love of woman , is something that man can not understand . This sea of unfathomed depth is to him a mystery . The shallow mind sees of it nothing but the rippling waves , the unstable foam-crests dashing hither and thither , the playful ripples of the surface , and , blind to the still and measureless waters beneath , calls woman capricious , uncertain ,  --  varium et mutabile . But the thinker and seer , undeceived by such externals , knows that beneath this seeming change is stability unequaled in the stronger sex , a power of will to which man is a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe . Therefore , in the myths and legends which the early races framed to express their notions of divine things ,  --  the Fates , who spin and snip the thread of life ; the Norns , who Lay down laws , And select life For the children of time  - -  The destinies of men ,  --  are always females . The seeresses and interpreters of oracles  --  those who , like the witch of Endor , could summon from the grave the shades of the departed  --  were women . Therefore , also , modern infidelity , going back , as it ever does , to the ignorance of the past , and holding it up as something new , makes woman the only deity . Comte and his disciples , having reasoned away all gods , angels , and spirits , and unable to still the craving for something to adore , agree to meet once a week to worship  --  woman . The French revolutionists , having shut up the churches and abolished God by a decree of the Convention , set up in His stead  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere we see the unexpected hand of Love moulding , fashioning all things . The fortunes of the individual , the fate of nations , the destinies of races , are guided by this invisible thread . Let us push our inquiries as to the nature of this all-powerful agent . WHAT IS LOVE ? It has a divided nature . As we have an immortal soul , but a body of clay ; as the plant roots itself in decaying earth , but spreads its flowers in glorious sunlight ,  --  so love has a physiological and a moral nature . It is rooted in that unconscious law of life which bids us perpetuate our kind ; which guards over the conservation of life ; which enforces , with ceaseless admonition , that first precept which God gave to man before the gates of Eden had been closed upon him : ' Be thou fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth . ' Nothing but a spurious delicacy , or an ignorance of facts , can prevent our full recognition that love looks to marriage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask proofs of this ? We have them in abundance . Those unfortunate beings who are chosen by Oriental custom to guard the seraglios undergo a mutilation which disqualifies them from becoming parents . Soon all traces of passion , all regard for the other sex , all sentiments of love , totally disappear . The records of medicine contain not a few cases where disease had rendered it necessary to remove the ovaries from women . At once a change took place in voice , appearance , and mind . They spoke like men , a slender beard commenced on their faces , a masculine manner was conspicuous in all their motions , and every thought of sexual love passed away for ever . These are the results in every case . What do they signify ? Undoubtedly that the passion of love is dependent upon the capacity of having offspring , and that such was the intention of Nature in implanting in our bosom this all-powerful sentiment . But this is not all . Nature , as beneficent to those who obey her precepts as she is merciless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment of love a physical pleasure in its gratification ,  --  an honourable and proper pleasure , which none but the hypocrite or the ascetic will affect to condemn , none but the coarse or the lewd will regard as the object of love . There is , indeed , a passion which is the love of the body . We call it by its proper name of lust . There is another emotion , for which the rich tongue of the ancient Greeks had a word , to which we have nothing to correspond . Call it , if you will , Platonic love , and define it to be an exalted friendship . But understand that neither the one nor the other is love , in the true sense of the word , and that both are inferior to it . Does the father , watching , with moistened eyes , his child at its mother 's breast ; does the husband , bending with solicitude over the sick-bed of his wife ; does the wife , clinging to her husband through evil report and good report , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than lust , no warmer sentiment than friendship ? What ignorance , what perversity is so gross as not to perceive something here nobler than either ? Do you say that such scenes are , alas , rare ? We deny it . We see them daily in the streets ; we meet them daily in our rounds . Admitted , by our calling , to the sacred precincts of many houses in the trying hours of sickness and death , we speak advisedly , and know that this is the prevailing meaning of love in domestic life . A warm , rich affection blesses the one who gives and the one who receives . Character developes under it as the plant beneath the sunlight . Happiness is an unknown word without it . Love and marriage are the only normal conditions of life . Without them , both man and woman for ever miss the best part of themselves . They suffer more , they sin more , they perish sooner . These are not hasty assertions . As a social law , let it be well understood that science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forced upon many of both sexes , in our present social condition . Many choose it from motives of economy , from timidity , or as a religious step , pleasing to God . The latter is a notion which probably arose from a belief that , somehow , celibacy , strictly observed , means chastity . It simply means continence . The chastest persons have been , and are , not the virgins and celibates , but the married . When this truth is known better , we shall have fewer sects and more religion . We know women who refrain from marrying to keep out of trouble . The old saying is , that every sigh drives a nail in one 's coffin . They are not going to worry themselves to death bearing children and nursing them ! It is too great a risk , too much suffering . How often have we been told this ! Yet how false the reasoning is ! Very carefully prepared statistics show that between the ages of twenty and forty-five years , more unmarried women die than married , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . The celebrated Dr. Hufeland , therefore , in his treatise on the Art of Prolonging Life , lays it down as a rule , that to attain a great age , one must be married . As for happiness , those who think they can best attain it outside the gentle yoke of matrimony are quite as wide of the mark . Their selfish and solitary pleasures do not gratify them . With all the resources of clubs , billiard-rooms , saloons , narcotics , and stimulants , single men make but a mock show of satisfaction . At heart every one of them envies his married friends . How much more monotonous and more readily exhausted are the resources of woman 's single life ! No matter what ' sphere ' she is in , no matter in what ' circle ' she moves , no matter what ' mission ' she invents , it will soon pall on her . Would you see the result ? We invoke once more those dry volumes , full of lines and figures , on vital statistics . Stupid as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what is more , the stories are all true . Some of them are sad stories , and this is one of the saddest : Of those unfortunates who , out of despair and disgust of the world , jump from bridges , or take arsenic , or hang themselves , or in other ways rush unbidden and unprepared before the great Judge of all , nearly two-thirds are unmarried , and in some years nearly three-fourths . And of those other sad cases  --  dead , yet living  --  who people the madhouses and asylums , what of them ? Driven crazy by their brutal husbands , do you suggest ? Not at all ! In France , Bavaria , Prussia , Hanover , four out of every five are unmarried ; and throughout the civilised world there are everywhere three or four single to one married woman in the establishments for the insane , in proportion to the whole number of the two classes above twenty-one years of age . Other women decline to marry because they have , forsooth , a ' life work ' to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulate Madame de Stael , and would electrify the country by their novel views in politics ; or they have a literary vein they fain would exploit ; or they feel called upon to teach the freedmen , or to keep their position as leaders of fashion . A husband would trammel them . If they did marry , they would take the very foolish advice of a contemporary , and go through life with an indignant protest at its littleness . Let such women know that they underrate the married state , its powers and its opportunities . There are no loftier missions than can there be carried out , no nobler games than can there be played . When we think of these objections , coming , as they have to us , from high-spirited , earnest girls , the queens of their sex , our memory runs back to the famous women of history , the brightest jewels in the coronet of time , and we find as many , ay , more , married women than single who pursued to their ends mighty achievements . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fatherlands from the enemy by a daring no man can equal , we shall recall the peaceful victories of her , wife of the barbarian Chlodwig , who taught the rude Franks the mild religion of Nazareth , and of her who extended from Byzantium the holy symbol of the cross over the wilds of Russia . The really great women of this age , are they mostly married or single ? They are mostly married , and they are good wives and tender mothers . What we have just written , we read to an amiable woman . ' But , ' she exclaimed , ' what have you to say to her whom high duties or a hard fate condemns to a single life , and to the name of the old maid ? ' Alas ! what can we say to such ? We feel that ' Earthlier happy is the rose distilled , Than that which , withering on the virgin thorn , Grows , lives , and dies in single blessedness . ' Yet there is ever a blessing in store for those who suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to bear the present . LOVE IS ETERNAL . We have said love is a necessity in the life of either man or woman to complete their nature . Its effects , therefore , are eternal . We do not intend this as a figure of speech . It is a sober statement of physiology . From the day of marriage the woman undergoes a change in her whole structure . She is similar to her former self , but not the same . It is often noticed that the children of a woman in her second marriage bear a marked resemblance to her first husband . In the inferior races and lower animals this obscure metamorphosis is still more apparent . A negress who has borne her first child to a white man , will ever after have children of a color lighter than her own . Count Strzelewski , in his Travels in Australia , narrates this curious circumstance : A native woman who has once had offspring by a white man , can never more have children by a male of her own race . Dr. Darwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a hybrid race , marked by the zebra 's stripes , was produced from certain mares . Always after , the colts of those mares bore the marks of the zebra on their skins . In some way the female is profoundly altered throughout her whole formation , and entirely independent of her will , by the act of marriage , and the alteration is never effaced . If the body is thus influenced , shall not the far more susceptible mind and spirit be equally impressed ? Another common observation supports what we say , and extends it farther . Not the woman alone ,  --  the man also undergoes a change , and loses a portion of his personality in his mate . They two are one , not merely in a moral sense . We constantly notice a decided resemblance in old couples who have passed , say , two score years together . They have grown to look alike in form , feature , and expression . That for so long a time they have breathed the same air , eaten the same fare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent . But the greater part of the change flows from mental sources . They have laughed and wept together ; they have shared the same joys and pleasures ; a smile or a tear on the face of one has evoked a corresponding emotion and expression on the face of the other . Their co-partnership has become a unity . Even without speaking , they sympathize . Their souls are constantly en rapport . The man is as different as the woman from his former self . OF SECOND MARRIAGES . Science , therefore , seems to say to woman , ' Your first husband is your eternal husband . ' How , then , about second marriages ? Are we to say that they are not advisable ? Let us not answer hastily . It is yet to be seen whether ill-assorted marriages produce those impressions we have mentioned . They may , indeed , on the body , while the mind is free . One must remember , also , that the exigencies of social life must be consulted . If a woman can not love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  other motives , worthy of all respect , justify her in entering the marriage life a second time . Then , the higher refinements of the emotions are not given to all alike , nor do they come at the same age to all . True love may first dawn upon a woman after one or two husbands have left her a widow . Orphan children , widow-hood , want of property , or the care of property ,  --  these are sad afflictions to the lonely woman . Do not blame her if she accepts a husband as a guardian , a protector , whom she can no longer receive to her arms as a lover . She is right . We cherish the memory of a lady of strong character , who died past eighty . She had survived three husbands . ' The first , ' she said , ' I married for love , the second for position , the third for friendship . I was happy with them all . ' But when , in her mortal illness , this venerable friend sank into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of her first husband only . More than half a century had not effaced the memory of those few years of early love . This is fidelity indeed . OF DIVORCE . He of Nazareth laid down the law that whoever puts away his wife for any cause except adultery , and marries again , commits adultery ; and that whatever woman puts away her husband for any cause save adultery , and marries again , herself commits adultery . This has been found a hard saying . John Milton wrote a book to show that the Lawgiver did not mean what He said , but something quite different . Modern sects , calling themselves Christians , after this Lawgiver , dodge the difficulty , and refer it to State legislatures . State legislatures , not troubling themselves at all about any previous law or lawgiver , allow dozens of causes  --  scores of them  --  as perfectly valid to put asunder those whom God has joined together . Science , which never finds occasion to disagree with that Lawgiver of Nazareth , here makes His words her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , in morals , or in physiology , the American plan of granting absolute divorces is dangerous , and destructive to what is best in life . It leads to hasty , ill-assorted matches , to an unwillingness to yield to each other 's peculiarities , to a weakening of the family ties , to a lax morality . Carry it a trifle farther than it now is in some of the Western States , and marriage will lose all its sacredness , and degenerate into a physical union , not nobler than the crossing of flies in the air . Separation of bed and board should always be provided for by law ; and whether single , married , or separated , the woman should retain entire control of her own property . But in the eyes of God and nature , a woman or a man with two faithful spouses living , to each of whom an eternal fidelity has been plighted , is a monster . OF A PLURALITY OF WIVES OR HUSBANDS . What has been said of divorce applies with tenfold force to the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of a man as husband to several women . We should not speak of these customs , but that we know both exist in America , not among the notoriously wicked , but among those who claim to be the peculiarly good  --  the very elect of God . They prevail , not as lustful excesses , but as religious observances . It is worth while to say that such practices lead to physical degradation . The woman who acknowledges more than one husband is generally sterile ; the man who has several wives has usually a weakly offspring , principally males . Nature attempts to check polygamy by reducing the number of females , and failing in this , by enervating the whole stock . The Mormons of Utah would soon sink into a state of Asiatic effeminacy were they left to themselves . COURTSHIP . A wise provision of nature ordains that woman shall be sought . She flees , and man pursues . The folly of modern reformers , who would annul this provision , is evident . Were it done away with , man , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prone when yielding is most dangerous , would fritter away his powers at an early age , and those very impulses which nature has given to perpetuate the race would bring about its destruction . To prevent such a disaster , woman is endowed with a sense of shame , an invincible modesty , her greatest protection , and her greatest charm . Let her never forget it , never disregard it ; for without it she becomes the scorn of her own sex and the jest of the other . The urgency of man and the timidity of woman are tempered by the period of courtship . This , as it exists in the United States , is something almost peculiar to Americans . On the continent of Europe , girls are shut up in convents or in seminaries , or are kept strictly under the eyes of their parents until marriage , or , at any rate , betrothal . The liberty usual in America is something unheard-of and inconceivable there . In Spain a duenna , in France some aunt or elderly cousin , in Germany some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every interview which a young lady has with an admirer . He never dreams of walking , driving , or going out of an evening with her alone . It is taken for granted that , should he invite her for such a purpose , the mother or aunt is included in the party . They would look on the innocent freedom of American girls as simply scandalous . We have had opportunities to see society in these various countries , and have failed to perceive that the morality of either sex is at all superior to what it is with us , while the effect of cloister-like education on young women is to weaken their self-reliance , and often prepare them for greater extravagances when marriage gives them liberty . With us , the young woman is free until her wedding day . After that epoch , she looks forward to withdrawing more or less from society , and confining her thoughts to family matters . In France , Spain , or Italy , in the wealthier classes , precisely the contrary is the rule . Marriage brings deliverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the avenue to a life in public and independent action . How injurious to domestic happiness this is , can readily be imagined . It is true that the liberty of American girls occasionally leads to improprieties . But , except in certain great cities , such instances are rare . The safeguards of virtue are knowledge and self-command , not duennas and jalousies . Let mothers properly instruct their daughters , and they need have no apprehension about their conduct . The period of courtship is one full of importance . A young woman of unripe experience must decide from what she can see of a man during the intercourse of a few months , whether he will suit her for a life-companion . She has no knowledge of human nature ; and what would it avail her if she had , when at such a time a suitor is careful only to show his eligible traits ? ' Go a-courting , ' said old Dr Franklin , in his homely language , ' in your everyday clothes . ' Not one man out of a thousand is honest enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask aid of another . She must judge for herself . What , then , is she to do ? There is a mysterious instinct in a pure-minded woman which is beyond all analysis ,  --  a tact which men do not possess , and do not readily believe in . At such a crisis this instinct saves her . She feels in a moment the presence of a base , unworthy nature . An unconscious repulsion is manifest in her eye , her voice . Where a suitor is not a man of low motive , but merely quite incongruous in temper and disposition , this same instinct acts , and the man , without being able to say just why , feels that he is laboring in vain . If he blindly insists in his wooing , he has no one to chide but himself when he is finally discarded . But if the man is worthy , and suitable , does this blessed instinct whisper the happy news with like promptness to the maiden 's soul ? Ah ! that raises another issue . It brings us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIRST SIGHT . Jung Stilling , a German author of note , a religious enthusiast , and full of queer fancies , was , when young , a tutor in a private family . On one occasion his employer took him to a strange house , and introduced him to a roomful of company . Stilling had not contemplated marriage ; but , in the company , he saw , for the first time , a young woman who he felt was his destined wife . Walking across the room , he addressed her with the utmost simplicity , telling her that an inward monitor advised him that she , of all womankind , was his predestined helpmeet . She blushed , was confused , but presently confessed that she had experienced the same conviction on first beholding him . They married , and the most curious part of the tale remains to tell ,  --  it is , that they proved a happy , well-matched couple . We do not advise others to follow their example . Not many souls are capable of such reciprocity . Choosing an associate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair of a moment . Reason , reflection , thought , prayer ,  --  these are aids in such a momentous question not to be lightly thrown aside . Many a passing fancy , many an evanescent preference , catches for a moment the new-fledged affections . But for the long and tedious journey of life we want a love rooted in knowledge . We are not blind to the fact , that often from the first interview the maiden feels an undefined spell thrown around her by him who will become her husband . She feels differently in his presence ; she watches him with other eyes than she has for the rest of men . She renders no account to herself of this emotion ; she attempts no analysis of it ; she does not acknowledge to herself that it exists . No matter . Sooner or later , if true to herself , she will learn what it is , and it will be a guide in that moment , looked forward to with mingled hopes and fears , when she is asked to decide on the destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . That she may then decide aright , and live free from the regrets of a false step at this crisis of life , we shall now rehearse what medical science has to say about HOW TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND . ' Choose well . Your choice is Brief , and yet endless . ' Woman holds as an inalienable right , in this country , the privilege of choice . It is not left to notaries , or parents , to select for her , as is the custom in some other parts of the world . First comes the question of relationship . A school-girl is apt to see more of her cousins than of other young men . Often some of them seek at an early hour to institute a far closer tie than that of blood . Is she wise to accept it ? SHALL COUSINS MARRY ? Hardly any point has been more warmly debated by medical men . It has been said that in such marriages the woman is more apt to be sterile ; that if she have children , they are peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ,  --  deafness , blindness , idiocy , or lameness ; that they die early ; and that they are subject , beyond others , to fatal hereditary diseases , as cancer , consumption , scrofula , etc . An ardent physician persuaded himself so thoroughly of these evils resulting from marriage of relatives , that he induced the Legislature of Kentucky to pass a law prohibiting it within certain degrees of consanguinity . Many a married couple have been rendered miserable by the information that they had unwittingly violated one of nature 's most positive laws . Though their children may be numerous and blooming , they live in constant dread of some terrible outbreak of disease . Many a young and loving couple have sadly severed an engagement , which would have been a prelude to a happy marriage , when they were informed of these disastrous results . For all such we have a word of consolation . We speak it authoritatively , and not without a full knowledge of the responsibility we assume . The risk of marrying a cousin , even a first cousin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taint in the family . And when such hereditary taint does exist , the danger is little more than in marrying into any other family where it is also found . Indeed , a certain German author has urged the propriety of such unions , where the family has traits of mental or physical excellence , as a means of preserving and developing them ! So far as sterility is concerned , an examination of records shows , that whereas in the average of unions one women in eight is barren , in those between relatives but one in ten is so . And as for the early deaths of children , while , on an average , fifteen children in a hundred die under seven years , in the families of nearly-related parents but twelve in a hundred is the mortality as shown by French statistics . The investigations about idiotic and defective children are by no means satisfactory , and are considered by some of the most careful writers as not at all proving a greater tendency to such misfortunes in the offspring of cousins . Among a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended from a healthy consanguinity . But as few families are wholly without some lurking predisposition to disease , it is not well , as a rule , to run the risk of developing this by too repeated unions . Stock-breeders find that the best specimens of the lower animals are produced by crossing nearly-related individuals a certain number of times ; but that , carried beyond this , such unions lead to degeneracy and sterility . Such , also , has been the experience of many human families . How slight a cause even of that most insidious disease , consumption , such marriages are , may be judged from the fact , that of a thousand cases inquired into by Dr. Edward Smith , in only six was there consanguinity of parents . THE MIXTURE OF RACES . Mankind , say the school geographies , is divided into five races , each distinguished by its own color . They are the white , the black , the red , the yellow , and the brown races . In this country , practically , we have to do with but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly asked , Shall we approve of marriages between them ? Shall a white woman choose a black man to be her husband ? We are at the more pains to answer this , because recently a writer  --  and this writer a woman , and this woman one of the most widely known in our land  --  has written a novel intended to advocate the affirmative of this question . Moreover , it is constantly mooted in certain political circles , and is one of the social problems of the day . The very fact that it is so much discussed , shows that such a union runs counter to a strong prejudice . Such aversions are often voices of nature , acting as warnings against acts injurious to the species . In this instance it is not of modern origin , created by peculiar institutions . Three centuries ago , Shakspeare , who had probably never seen a score of negroes in his life , with the divination of genius , felt the repugnance which a refined woman would feel to accepting one as her husband . The plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes Iago say of Desdemona : ' Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime , complexion , and degree ; Whereto , we see , in all things nature tends : Foh ! one may smell in such a will most rank , Foul disproportions , thoughts unnatural . ' It is , indeed , ' nature erring from itself ' which prompts to these marriages . They are not sterile , but the children are sickly and short-lived . Very few mulattoes reach an old age . Then it is well known that the black race can not survive a northern climate . Dr. Snow , of Providence , Rhode Island , who has given great attention to the study of statistics , says emphatically that , in New England , the colored population inevitably perish in a few generations , if left to themselves . This debility no woman should wish to give to her children . A mental inferiority is likewise apparent . Friends of the negro are ready to confess this , but attribute it to his long and recent period of servitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever be its cause ; and she who would willingly curse her offspring with it , manifests indeed ' thoughts unnatural . ' The children born of a union of the black and red race , negroes and Indians , are on the contrary , remarkable for their physical vigor and mental acuteness ; though , of course , the latter is limited to the demands of a semi-barbarous life . SHOULD NATIVE WOMEN MARRY FOREIGNERS ? When we narrow the question of race to that of nationality , entirely new elements come in . In speaking of the intermarriage of relatives , we showed that a certain number of such unions in healthy stocks was advantageous rather than otherwise , but that too many of them lead to deterioration . This law can be applied to nations . Historians have often observed that the most powerful states of the world arose from an amalgamation of different tribes . Rome , Greece , England , are examples of this . On the other hand , France , Russia , Spain , China , Persia , which have suffered no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their progress on foreigners . Physicians have contributed other curious testimony on this point , the bearing of which they themselves have not understood . Marriages between nationalities of the same race are more fertile , and the children more vigorous , than those between descendants of the same nation . For instance , it has been proved that if two descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers in Massachusetts marry , they will probably have but three children ; while , if one of them marries a foreigner , the children will number five or six . So it is well ascertained that in the old and stationary communes of France , where the same families have possessed their small farms for generation after generation , the marriages have become gradually less and less productive , until it has seriously interfered with the quota those districts send to the army . American women have suffered many hard words because they do not have more children . Several New England writers have accused them of very bad practices , which we shall mention hereafter . But the effect of the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it is best that there should be four or five children in a family in ordinary circumstances , the union of American and foreign blood is very desirable . We need to fuse in one the diverse colonies of the white race annually reaching our shores . A century should efface every trace of the German , the Irish , the Frenchman , the English , the Norwegian , and leave nothing but the American . To bring about this happy result , free intermarriage should be furthered in every possible way . THE AGE OF THE HUSBAND . The epoch of puberty comes to a boy at about the same age as it does to a girl ,  --  fourteen or fifteen years . And an even greater period passes between this epoch and the age it is proper for a man to marry ,  --  his age of nubility . Not only has he a more complete education to obtain , not only a profession or trade to learn , and some property to accumulate , some position to acquire , ere he is ready to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of woman . He is more tardy in completing his growth , and early indulgence more readily saps his constitution . We have placed the best age for woman to marry between twenty and twenty-five years ; for similar reasons , man is best qualified to become a husband between twenty-three and thirty-three years . Previous to the twenty-third year , many a man is incapable of producing healthy children . If he does not destroy his health by premature indulgence , he may destroy his happiness by witnessing his children a prey to debility and deformity . An old German proverb says , ' Give a boy a wife , and a child a bird , and death will soon knock at the door . ' Even an author so old as Aristotle warns young men against early marriage , under penalty of disease and puny offspring . From the age of thirty-three to fifty years , men who carefully observe the laws of health do not feel any weight of years . Nevertheless , they are past their prime . Then , also , with advancing years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will leave a young family with no natural protector . The half-century once turned , their vigor rapidly diminishes . The marriages they then contract are either sterile , or yield but few and sickly children . Many an old man has shortened his life by late nuptials ; and the records of medicine contain accounts of several who perished on the very night of marriage . The relative age of man and wife is next to be considered . Nature fits woman earlier for marriage , and hints thereby that she should , as a rule , be younger than her husband . So , too , the bard of nature speaks : ' Let still the woman take An elder than herself ; so wears she to him , So sways she level in her husband 's heart . ' The woman who risks her happiness with a man many years younger than herself , violates a precept of life ; and when her husband grows indifferent , or taunts her with her years , or seeks companions of more suitable age , she is reaping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matches turn out badly , that in 1828 the kingdom of Wuertemberg prohibited unions where the woman was more than twelve years the senior , except by special dispensation . After forty-five years , most women can not hope for children . A marriage subsequent to this period can at best be regarded as a close friendship . Marriage in its full meaning has no longer an existence . The relative age of man and wife has another influence , and quite a curious one . It influences the sex of the children . But this point we reserve for discussion on a later page . The folly of joining a young girl to an old man is happily not so common in America as in Europe . It would be hard to devise any step more certain to bring the laws of nature and morality into conflict . ' What can a young lassie do wi ' an auld man ? ' What advice can we give to a woman who barters her youthful charms for the fortune of an aged husband ? Shall we be cynical enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auld Auntie Katie upon me takes pity ; I 'll do my endeavor to follow her plan : I 'll cross him , and rack him , until I heart-break him , And then his auld brass will buy me a new pan . ' No ! She has willingly accepted a responsibility . It is her duty to bear it loyally , faithfully , uncomplainingly to the end . Let us sum up with the maxim , that the husband should be the senior , but that the difference of age should not be more than ten years . WHAT SHOULD BE HIS TEMPERAMENT ? It is often hard to make out what doctors mean by temperaments . It is supposed that our mental and physical characters depend somehow on the predominance of some organ or system which controls the rest . Thus a person who is nervous , quick , sensitive to impressions , is said to have a nervous temperament ; one who is stout , full-blooded , red-faced , has a sanguine temperament ; a thin , dark-featured , reticent person , is of a bilious temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called phlegmatic , or lymphatic . In a general way these distinctions are valuable , but they will not bear very exact applications . They reveal in outline the constitution of mind and body ; and what is to our present purpose , they are of more than usual importance in the question of selecting a husband . Nature , hating incongruity , yet loves variety . She preserves the limits of species , but within those limits she seeks fidelity to one type . Therefore it is that in marriage a person inclines strongly to one of a different temperament  --  to a person quite unlike himself . So true is this , that a Frenchman of genius , Bernardin de St. Pierre , vouches for this anecdote of himself . He was in a strange city , visiting a friend whom he had not seen for years . The friend 's sister was of that age when women are most susceptible . She was tall , a blonde , deliberate in motion , with blue eyes and fair hair . In a jesting way , St. Pierre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her personal life , said ,  --  ' Mademoiselle , you have many admirers . Shall I describe him on whom you look with most favor ? ' The lady challenged him to do so . ' He is short in stature , of dark complexion , dark hair and eyes , slight in figure , active and nervous in all his movements . ' The lady blushed to her eyes , and cast a glance of anger at her brother , who , she thought , had betrayed her secret . But no ! St. Pierre 's only informant was his deep knowledge of the human heart . This instinct is founded upon the truth that the perfect temperament is that happily balanced one which holds all the organs in equilibrium ,  --  in which no one rules , where all are developed in proportion . Nature ever strives to realize this ideal . She instills in the nervous temperament a preference for the lymphatic ; in the sanguine , a liking for the bilious constitution . The offspring should combine the excellencies of both , the defects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to bear in mind that those matches which combine opposite temperaments , are , as a rule , the most fortunate . THE MORAL AND MENTAL CHARACTER . Very few words are necessary here . We have already said we speak as physicians , not as moralists . But there are some false and dangerous ideas abroad , which it is our duty as physicians to combat . None is more false , none more dangerous , than that embodied in the proverb , ' A reformed rake makes the best husband . ' What is a rake ? A man who has deceived and destroyed trusting virtue ,  --  a man who has entered the service of the devil to undermine and poison that happiness in marriage , which all religion and science are at such pains to cultivate . We know him well in our capacity as physicians . He comes to us constantly the prey to loathsome diseases , the results of his vicious life ; which diseases he will communicate to his wife , for they are contagious , and to his children , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his system , for they are ineradicable . Is this the man a pure woman should take to her arms ? Here repentance avails nothing . We have witnessed the agony unspeakable which overwhelmed a father when he saw his children suffering under horrible and disgusting diseases , the penalty of his early sins . Very few men of profligate lives escape these diseases . They are alarmingly prevalent among the ' fast ' youths of our cities . And some forms of them are incurable by any effort of skill . Even the approach of such men should be shunned ,  --  their company avoided . A physician in central Pennsylvania lately had this experience : A young lady of unblemished character asked his advice for a troublesome affection of the skin . He examined it , and to his horror recognised a form of one of the loathsome diseases which curse only the vilest or the most unfortunate of her sex . Yet he could not suspect this girl . On inquiry , he found that she had a small but painful sore on her lip , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic with a young man . Just as he was bidding her good-night , he had kissed her on the lips . At once everything was clear . This young man was a patient of the physician . He was a victim to this vile disease , and even his kiss was enough to convey it . The history of the sixteenth century contains the account of an Italian duke , who on one occasion was forced by his ruler to reconcile himself with an enemy . Knowing he could not escape obedience , he protested the most cheerful willingness , and in the presence of the king embraced his enemy , and even kissed him on the lips . It was but another means of satisfying his hatred . For he well knew that his kiss would taint his enemy 's blood with the same poison that was undermining his own life . How cautious , therefore , should a woman be in granting the most innocent liberties ! How solicitous should she be to associate with the purest men ! Would that we could say that these dangerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional experience forbids us to offer this consolation . Every physician in our large cities , and even in smaller towns , knows that they are fearfully prevalent . We have been consulted by wives , pure , innocent women , for complaints which they themselves , and sometimes their children , suffered from , the nature of which we dared not tell them , but which pointed with fatal finger to the unfaithfulness of the husband . How utterly was their domestic happiness wrecked when they discovered the cause of their constant ill-health ! Nor are such occurrences confined to the humbler walks of life . There , perhaps , less than in any other do they occur . It is in the wealthy , the luxurious , the self-indulgent class that they are found . Are we asked how such a dreadful fate can be averted ? There are , indeed , certain signs and marks which such diseases leave with which physicians are conversant . As if nature intended them as warnings , they are imprinted on the most visible and public parts of the body . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lines on the face , often divulge to the trained observer , more indubitably than the confessional , a lewd and sensual life . Such signs , however , can only be properly estimated by the medical counselor , and it would be useless to rehearse them here . Those women who would have a sure guide in choosing a man to be their husband , have they not Moses and the prophets ? What is more , have they not Christ and the apostles ? Rest assured that the man who scoffs at Christianity , who neglects its precepts and violates its laws , runs a terrible risk of bringing upon himself , his wife , and his children , the vengeance of nature , which knows justice but not mercy . Rest assured that the man who respects the maxims of that religion , and abstains from all uncleanness , is the only man who is worthy the full and confiding love of an honorable woman . THE SYMBOLISM OF THE HUMAN BODY . Philosophers say that every idle word which is spoken continues to vibrate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passions and the thoughts . Each impresses on the body some indelible mark , and a long continuance of similar thoughts leaves a visible imprint . Under the names of phrenology , physiognomy , palmistry , and others , attempts have been made at divers times to lay down fixed principles by which we could judge of men by their outsides ; but only vague results have been obtained . A learned German author , of high repute in exact science , has gone a different way to work . He has studied the body as a whole , and sought with the eye of an anatomist how different avocations , passions , temperaments , habits , mould and fashion the external parts of man . His results are embraced in a curious volume which he entitles The Symbolism of the Human Body . We shall borrow some hints from it , germane to our present theme . As to size , large-bodied and large-boned men possess greater energy , a more masculine character , but often less persistence , and are usually devoid of the more delicate emotions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full of life , but irascible . The neck is a significant part of the body . View it from in front , and it discloses the physical constitution . There are the conduits of the food and the air ; there , the great blood-vessels pass to the head , and its base is modified by their form as they pass from the heart . When broad and full , it denotes a vigorous physical life ,  --  a plethoric constitution . A distinguished teacher of midwifery , Professor Pajot of Paris , says that when he sees one of those necks full in front , like that of Marie Antoinette , as shown in her portraits , he prepares himself to combat childbed convulsions . That queen , it is well-known , nearly perished with them . The back of the neck contains the vertebral column , and is close to the brain . It reveals the mental constitution . The short round neck of the prize-fighter betrays his craft . The slender , arched , and graceful neck of the well-proportioned woman is the symbol of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Beautiful , calls it the most beauteous object in nature . It is a common observation , that a sensual character is shown by the thick and coarse development of this portion of the body . The hair , also , has a significance . Fine whitish hair , like that of a child , goes with a simple , child-like disposition ; black hair denotes a certain hardness of character ; red hair has long been supposed to be associated with a sensual constitution , but it rather indicates a physical weakness ,  --  a tendency to scrofula . This is , however , a tendency merely . Thin hair is often the result of protracted mental labor , though many other causes produce it . Every great man , says Herder , has a glance which no one can imitate . We may go farther , and say that every man of decided character reveals it in his eyes . They are the most difficult organs for the hypocrite to control . Beware of the man who can not look you in the eyes , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet makes you shudder . The one has something he dares not tell you , the other something you dare not listen to . Symmetry , strength , grace , health ,  --  these are admirable qualities in a man . From the remotest ages they have been the marks of heroes . Secondary though they are to moral and mental qualities , they should be ever highly valued . A manly man ! Nature designs such to be the sires of future generations . No danger that we shall fall to worshiping physical beauty again . The only fear is that in this lank , puny , scrawny generation of ours , we shall , out of vanity , underrate such beauty . Let it be ever remembered that this is the ideal , from which any departure is deterioration . THE ENGAGEMENT . When our grandmothers were engaged , the minister rose in his pulpit on Sunday morning , before the assembled congregation , and proclaimed the ' banns , ' stating that if any one knew just cause or lawful impediment why the lovers should not be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great hubbub was created when some discarded suitor rose , forbidding the banns , and claimed that the capricious maiden had previously promised herself to him . Perhaps it was to avoid such an uncomfortable check on the freedom of flirtation that the ancient custom was dropped . Certain it is , that to be ' engaged ' sits very lightly on the minds of both young men and maidens now-a-days . We know some of either sex who make it a boast how often they have made and unmade this slender tie . It is a dangerous pastime . ' The hand of little use hath the daintier touch , ' and they who thus trifle with their affections will end by losing the capacity to feel any real affection at all . Undoubtedly there occur instances where a woman has pledged herself in all seriousness , and afterwards sees her affianced in a light which warns her that she can not be happy with him ,  --  that the vows she will be called upon to pronounce at the altar will be hollow and false . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Court of Love . Here is the advice of another to her hand : ' First to thine own self be true , And then it follows , as the night the day , That thou canst ne'er be false to any man . ' CONCERNING LONG ENGAGEMENTS . They are hurtful , and they are unnecessary . Is love so vagrant that it must be tied by such a chain ? Better let it go . True love asks no oath ; it casteth out fear , and believes without a promise . There are other reasons , sound physiological reasons , which we could adduce , if need were , to show that the close personal relations which arise between persons who are engaged should not be continued too long a time . They lead to excitement and debility , sometimes to danger and disease . Especially is this true of nervous , excitable , sympathetic dispositions . If we are asked to be definite , and give figures , we should say that a period not longer than a year , nor shorter than three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE RIGHT TIME OF YEAR TO MARRY . Woman , when she marries , enters upon a new life , and a trying one . Every advantage should be in her favour . The season is one of those advantages . Extreme heat and extreme cold both wear severely on the human frame . Mid-winter and mid-summer are , therefore , alike objectionable , especially the latter . Spring and fall are usually chosen , as statistics show , and the preference is just . On the whole , the spring is rather to be recommended than the autumn . In case of a birth within the year , the child will have attained sufficient age to weather its period of teething more easily ere the next summer . THE RIGHT TIME IN THE MONTH TO MARRY . We mean the woman 's own month , that which spans the time between her periodical sicknesses , be it two or five weeks . Let her choose a day about equidistant from two periods . The reasons for this we shall specify hereafter . THE WEDDING TOUR . Custom prescribes a journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . It is an unwise provision . The event itself is disturbance enough for the system ; and to be hurried hither and thither , stowed in narrow berths and inconvenient carriages , troubled with baggage , and annoyed by the importunities of cabmen , waiters , and hangers-on of every description , is enough , in ordinary times , to test the temper of a saint . The foundation of many an unhappy future is laid on the wedding tour . Not only is the young wife tried beyond all her experience , and her nervous system harassed , but the husband , too , partakes of her weakness . Many men , who really love the women they marry , are subject to a slight revulsion of feeling for a few days after marriage . ' When the veil falls , and the girdle is loosened , ' says the German poet Schiller , ' the fair illusion vanishes . ' A half regret crosses their minds for the jolly bachelorhood they have renounced . The mysterious charms which gave their loved one the air of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarity . Let neither be alarmed , nor lose their self-control . Each requires indulgence , and management , from the other ; both should demand from themselves patience and self-command . A few weeks , and this danger is over ; but a mistake now is the mistake of a lifetime . More than one woman has confessed to us that her unhappiness commenced from her wedding tour ; and when we inquired more minutely , we have found that it arose from an ignorance and disregard of just such little precautions as we have been referring to . Yet it is every way advisable that the young pair should escape the prying eyes of friends and relatives at such a moment . Let them choose some quiet resort , not too long a journey from home , where they can pass a few weeks in acquiring that more intimate knowledge of each other 's character as essential to their future happiness . THE WIFE . THE WEDDING NIGHT . We now enter upon the consideration of the second great period in the life of Woman . The maiden becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She assumes new relationships ,  --  the sweetest , and , at the same time , the most natural of which she is capable . The great object of the conjugal union is the transmission of life ,  --  a duty necessary in order to repair the constant ravages of death , and thus perpetuate the race . In the fulfilment of this sublime obligation , woman plays the more prominent part , as she is the source and depositary of the future being . It is of moment , therefore , that she should not be altogether ignorant of the nature and responsibilities of her position . Ignorance here means suffering , disease , and sometimes death . Let us then interrogate science in regard to these matters , among the most interesting of all human concerns . The initiation into marriage , like its full fruition , maternity , is attended with more or less suffering . Much , however , may be done to avert and to lessen the pain which waits upon the first step in this new life . For this purpose , regard must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said that a time about midway between the monthly recurring periods is best fitted for the consummation of marriage . As this is a season of sterility , it recommends itself on this account , in the interest of both the mother and offspring . The first nuptial relations should be fruitless , in order that the indispositions possibly arising from them shall have time to subside before the appearance of the disturbances incident to pregnancy . One profound change should not too quickly succeed the other . About the tenth day after menstruation should therefore be chosen for the marriage ceremony . It sometimes happens that marriage is consummated with difficulty . To overcome this , care , management , and forbearance should always be employed , and anything like precipitation and violence avoided . Only the consequences of unrestrained impetuosity are to be feared . In those rare cases in which greater resistance is experienced than can be overcome by gentle means , the existence of a condition contrary to nature may be suspected . Violence can then only be productive of injury , and is not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alone can afford assistance in such an emergency . Although the first conjugal approaches are ordinarily accompanied by slight flooding , a loss of blood does not always occur . Its absence proves nothing . The appearance of blood was formerly regarded as a test of virginity . The Israelites , Arabs , and others carefully preserved and triumphantly exhibited the evidence of it as an infallible sign of the virtue of the bride . They were in error . Its presence is as destitute of signification as its absence ; for it is now well known that widows , and wives long separated from their husbands , often have a like experience . The temperament is not without its influence . In those of lymphatic temperament , pale blondes , who often suffer from local discharge and weakness , the parts being relaxed , there is less pain and little or no haemorrhage . In brunettes , who have never had any such troubles , the case is reversed . The use of baths , unguents , etc. , by the young wife , however serviceable they might prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces swelling and inflammation of the glands of the neck . Marital relations ordinarily continue during the first few weeks to be more or less painful . General constitutional disturbance and disorders of the nervous system often result . These troubles are all increased by the stupid custom of hurrying the bride from place to place , at a time when the bodily quiet and the mental calmness and serenity so desirable to her should be the only objects in view . Too frequent indulgence at this period is a fruitful source of various inflammatory diseases , and often occasions temporary sterility and ill-health . The old custom requiring a three days ' separation after the first nuptial approach was a wise one , securing to the young wife the soothing and restoring influence of rest . Nothing was lost by it , and much gained . In a little while , however , all irritation should subside , and no suffering or distress of any kind , whether general or local , should attend upon the performance of this important function . The presence of suffering now becomes indicative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUSBAND AND WIFE OCCUPY THE SAME ROOM AND BED ? One-third of life is passed in sleep . This period of unconsciousness and rest is necessary for the renewal of vital strength , and upon its proper management depends much of the health not merely of the husband and wife , but of their offspring . A great deal has been written upon the effect on health and happiness of occupying separate apartments , separate beds in the same apartment , or the same bed . This vexed question it is impossible to settle by absolute rules , suitable to all cases . In general , it may be asserted that there are no valid physiological reasons for desiring to change the custom which now prevails in this and most other countries . When both parties are in good health , and of nearly the same age , one bed-chamber , if sufficiently roomy , may be used without any disadvantage to either . Such an arrangement is also to be commended , because it secures closer companionship , and thus developes and sustains mutual affection . It is said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrelsome couple applied for a divorce , the magistrate refused to listen to them at first . He ordered that they should be shut up together in one room for three days , with one bed , one table , one plate , and one cup . Their food was passed in by attendants , who neither saw nor spoke to them . On the expiration of the three days , it was usual to find that neither of them wanted a separation . As before stated , there are conditions under which sleeping together is prejudicial to the health . A certain amount of fresh air during the night is required by every one . Re-breathed air is poisonous . During sleep constant exhalations take place from the lungs and from the skin , which are injurious if absorbed . A room twelve feet square is too small for two persons , unless it is so thoroughly ventilated that there is a constant change of air . In fact , a sleeping apartment for two persons should contain an air-space of at least twenty-four hundred cubic feet , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be changed in an hour ,  --  that is , at the rate of forty cubic feet per minute ; for it has been ascertained that twenty cubic feet of fresh air a minute are required for every healthy adult . Very young and very old people should never occupy the same bed . When the married couple hold the relation to each other , in regard to age , of grandfather and granddaughter , separate apartments should be insisted upon . Certain diseases can be produced by sleeping together . The bed of a consumptive , it is well known , is a powerful source of contagion . In Italy it is the custom , after death , to destroy the bed-clothes of consumptive patients . Tubercular disease has , within the past few years , been transferred from men to animals by inoculation . Authentic cases are upon record of young robust girls of healthy parentage , marrying men affected with consumption , acquiring the disease in a short time , and dying , in some instances , before their husbands . In these significant cases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , either husband or wife is known to have consumption , it would be highly imprudent for them to pass the long hours of the night either in the same bed or in the same room . WHAT KIND OF BED IS MOST HEALTHFUL ? Feather-beds are not conducive to the health of either sex . Mattresses made of wool , or of wool and horsehair , are much better . The bed should be opened , and its contents exposed to the air and sunlight , once every year . Beds long saturated with the night exhalations of their occupants are not wholesome . A number of ancient writers have alleged  --  and it has been reasserted by modern authorities  --  that sleeping on sponge is of service to those who desire to increase their families . The mattresses of compressed sponge recently introduced , therefore , commend themselves to married people thus situated . Hemlock boughs make a bed which has a well-established reputation for similar virtues . The odor of cone-bearing trees has a well-known influence upon the fruitfulness of wedlock . Those who live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing at night is highly injurious . So also is a fire in the bed-room , except in case of sickness . If the body be too much heated during sleep , perspiration occurs , or the action of the heart is increased , and the whole economy becomes excited . Either condition prevents sound sleep and reinvigoration of the body . Wives in feeble health , and those liable to attacks of flooding , should therefore have a particular regard to the quantity of clothing on their beds . THE DIGNITY AND PROPRIETY OF THE SEXUAL INSTINCT . A distinguished medical writer has divided women into three classes in regard to the intensity of the sexual instinct . He asserts that a larger number than is generally supposed have little or no sexual feeling . A second class of women , more numerous than these , but still small as compared with the whole of their sex , are more or less subject to strong passion . Those of the first class can no more form an idea of the strength of the impulse in other women , than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their judgments . The third class comprises the vast majority of women , in whom the sexual appetite is as moderate as all other appetites . It is a false notion , and contrary to nature , that this passion in a woman is a derogation to her sex . The science of physiology indicates most clearly its propriety and dignity . There are wives who plume themselves on their repugnance or their distaste for their conjugal obligations . They speak of their coldness and of the calmness of their senses , as if these were not defects . Excepting those afflicted with vices of conformation , or with disorders of sensibility ,  --  which amount to the same thing ,  --  all wives are called upon to receive and pay the imposts of love ; and those who can withdraw themselves from the operation of this mysterious law without suffering and with satisfaction , show themselves by that fact to be incomplete in their organization , and deficient in the special function of their being . There should be no passion for one which is not shared by both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preservation of the species is as proper as that which induces the preservation of the individual . Passionate , exclusive , and durable love for a particular individual of the opposite sex , it has been well said , is characteristic of the human race , and is a mark of distinction from other animals . The instinct of reproduction in mankind is thus joined to an affectionate sentiment , which adds to its sweetness and prolongs infinitely its duration . Many physiologists have assigned to the feelings an important role in conception , the possibility of which has even been doubted if there be no passion on the side of the woman . Although this extreme view is not tenable in the light of modern research , yet all recent authorities agree that conception is more assured when the two individuals who co-operate in it participate at the same time in the transports of which it is the fruit . It is also without doubt true that the disposition of the woman at that time has much power in the formation of the foetus , both in modifying its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mind . The influence , long ago attributed by Shakspeare to ' a dull , stale , tired bed ' in creating a ' tribe of fops , ' is not a mere poet 's fancy . In this manner also may be explained the results of prolonged continence upon the offspring , for desires are usually vivid in proportion to the previous period of rest . The father of Montaigne , returning after an absence of thirty-two years , during which he was engaged in the wars of Italy , begot his son , so justly celebrated in French literature . The father of J. J. Rousseau , after a considerable absence in Constantinople , brought to his wife the reward of a long fidelity . Sexual passion exerts , therefore , a marked influence upon the future being before conception , by the impression made upon the elements which come together to form it . The question now occurs ; What effect does its presence and gratification produce upon the parents ? We answer ; It is a natural and healthful impulse . Its influence is salutary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often follows a happy marriage . This sometimes occurs even in those cases where , from the nature of the disorder , the reverse might be expected . The utility of the passions , well directed , has become a maxim in medicine as in morality . And what passion is more important and fervent than that of which we write ? The fathers in medicine , and their modern followers , agree in ascribing to the pleasures of love , indulged in with moderation , activity and lightness of the body , vigor and vivacity of the mind . Music , apart from its immense influence on the nervous system in general , seems sometimes to exercise a special action on the sexual instinct . Science possesses at the present day some facts beyond dispute , which prove the great power of music in this respect . ON THE INDULGENCE AND THE RESTRAINT OF SEXUAL DESIRE . The act of generation is a voluntary one . But nature has so placed it under the empire of pleasure , that the voice of discretion is no longer heard , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for hygienic reasons , to consider its laws . The too frequent repetition of the reproductive act is known to be followed by consequences injurious to the general health . Too rigid continence is not unattended , in many constitutions , with danger , for the victory over passion may be dearly bought . Science recommends the adoption of a wise mean between two extremes equally destructive . By following her counsel , women may escape from the hysterical and other disorders which often wait as well upon excess as upon too great denial of that passion , which claims satisfaction as a natural right . As men have made laws upon all subjects , we need not be surprised to learn that they have legislated upon this . History informs us that the legislators of ancient times have not failed to occupy themselves with this grave question of conjugal economy . The ordinances of Solon required that the married should acquit themselves of their duties at least three times a month ; those of Zoroaster prescribed once a week . Mohammed ordered that any wife neglected by her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not , however , in these , and other enactments which might be quoted , that guidance is to be sought . The principles derived from nature and experience are more valuable than human laws , however venerable ; for these too often serve only to reflect the profound ignorance of their makers . Moderation should here prevail . Health is thus preserved and strengthened , and the gratification doubled . The art of seasoning pleasures in general , consists in being avaricious with them . To abstain from enjoyment , is the philosophy of the sage , the epicurism of reason . Proper self-denial in the gratification of the wants of physical love is a source of good , not only to the individual practising it , but to the community , as we shall show hereafter . It may be observed for one 's own profit only , or for the benefit of another . The latter is in the end more conducive to self-interest than the former . A double advantage is derived therefrom ,  --  gratitude and sympathy returned , and increase of appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in the pain of surfeit and the extinction of affection . Earnest love , satisfying itself with small gratifications , is a more copious source of happiness than that frequently quenched by full gratification . What , then , is this moderation which both Hygeia and Venus command ? Here , again , invariable rules are not possible . Science rarely lays down laws so inflexible as those of the Medes and Persians . She designates limits . The passage between Scylla and Charybdis is often a wide one . The folly of the ancient statutes which have been referred to , consists mainly in their failure to recognise the diverse influence of age , temperament , seasons , etc . It almost appears as if there were but one season for generation , that in which the sun re-warms and vivifies the earth , trees dress in verdure , and animals respire the soft breath of spring . Then every living thing reanimates itself . The impulse of reproduction is excited . Now , also , its gratification is most beneficial to the individual and to the species . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less apt to die during infancy , than those conceived at any other time of the year . The statistics of many thousand cases , recently carefully collated in England , prove this beyond peradventure . It is well known that a late calf , or one born at the end of the summer , is not likely to become a well-developed and healthy animal . This has been attributed to the chilling influence of approaching winter ; but it is capable of another and , perhaps , a truer explanation . Nature 's impulses , therefore , in the spring of the year are for the good of the race , and may then be more frequently indulged without prejudice to the individual . Summer is the season which agrees the least with the exercise of the generative functions . The autumn months are the most unfruitful . Then , also , derangements of the economy are readily excited by marital intemperance . The temperaments exert over reproduction , as over all the other functions of the body , a powerful influence . Love is said to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bilious . There is also in some cases a peculiar condition of the nervous system which impels to , or diverts from , sexual indulgence . In some women , even in moderation , it acts as a poison , being followed by headache and prostration , lasting for days . With advancing years , the fading of sexual desire calls attention to the general law , that animals and plants , when they become old , are dead to reproduction . What in early life is followed by temporary languor , in matured years is succeeded by a train of symptoms much graver and more durable . Those who are in feeble health , and particularly those who have delicate chests , ought to be sober in the gratification of love . Sexual intercourse has proved mortal after severe haemorrhages . All organized beings are powerfully affected by propagation . Animals become depressed and dejected after it . The flower which shines so brilliantly at the moment of its amours , after the consummation of that act , withers and falls . It is wise , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorten one 's own existence . Nothing is more certain than that animals and plants lessen the duration of their lives by multiplied sexual enjoyments . The abuse of these pleasures produces lassitude and weakness . Beauty of feature and grace of movement are sacrificed . When the excess is long continued , it occasions spasmodic and convulsive affections , enfeeblement of the senses , particularly that of sight , deprivation of the mental functions , loss of memory , pulmonary consumption and death . One of the most eminent of living physiologists has asserted that ' development of the individual and the reproduction of the species stand in a reverse ratio to each other , ' and that ' the highest degree of bodily rigor is inconsistent with more than a very modest indulgence in sexual intercourse . ' The general principles we have just enunciated are of great importance in the regulation of the health . They are more suggestive and useful than the precise rules which have from time to time been laid down on this subject . TIMES WHEN MARITAL RELATIONS SHOULD BE SUSPENDED . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told , I Cor. vii . 3 , 4 , that neither husband nor wife has the power to refuse the conjugal obligation when the debt is demanded . But there are certain legitimate causes for denial by the wife . A condition of intoxication in the husband is a proper ground for refusal . Fecundation taking place while either parent has been in this state has produced idiots and epileptics . This has happened again and again . The cases on record are so numerous and well-authenticated , as to admit of no doubt in regard to the fatal effect upon the mind of the offspring of conception under such circumstances . Physical degeneracy is also often a consequence of procreation during the alcoholic intoxication of one or both parents . A peculiar arrest of growth and development of body and mind takes place , and , in some instances , the unfortunate children , although living to years of manhood , remain permanent infants , just able to stand by the side of a chair , to utter a few simple sounds , and to be amused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when there is any local or constitutional disease which would be aggravated by sexual intercourse , it should be abstained from . There is reason for believing that a being procreated at a period of ill-humour , bodily indisposition , or nervous debility , may carry with it , during its whole existence , some small particles of these evils . When there exists any contagious disease , refusals are of course valid , and often a duty to the unborn . Poverty , or the wish to have no more children , can only be exceptionally allowed as a reason for the denial of all conjugal privileges . The opinion that sexual relations practised during the time of the menses engender children liable to scrofulous disease , is a mere popular prejudice . But there are other and better-founded reasons for continence during these periods . The question of intercourse during pregnancy and suckling will come up for consideration when speaking of these conditions hereafter . CONDITIONS WHEN MARITAL RELATIONS ARE PAINFUL . Nature has not designed that a function of great moment to the human race  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The presence of pleasure is indicative of health , its absence of disease . But to a woman who has systematically displaced her womb by years of imprudence in conduct or dress , this act , which should be a physiological one , and free from any hurtful tendencies becomes a source of distress and even of illness . The diseases of the womb which sometimes follow matrimony are not to be traced to excessive indulgence in many cases , but to indulgence to any extent by those who have altered the natural relation of the parts before marriage . A prominent physician , Prof. T. Gaillard Thomas , of New York , has said that ' upon a woman who has enfeebled her system by habits of indulgence and luxury , pressed her uterus entirely out of its normal place , and who perhaps comes to the nuptial bed with some marked uterine disorder , the result of imprudence at menstrual epochs , sexual intercourse has a poisonous influence . The taking of food into the stomach exerts no hurtful influence on the digestive system ; but the taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured that organ , does so . ' When excessive pain exists , and every attempt occasions nervous trepidation and apprehension , it is absolutely certain that there is some diseased condition present , for which proper advice should be secured at once . Delay in doing so will not remove the necessity for medical interference in the end , while it will assuredly aggravate the trouble . Prompt intelligent aid , on the contrary , is usually followed by the happiest results in such cases . STERILITY . Wives who never become mothers are said to be sterile or barren . This condition is frequently a cause of much unhappiness . Fortune may favor the married couple in every other respect , yet if she refuse to accord the boon of even a single heir to heart and home , her smiles will bear the aspect of frowns . It is then of some interest to inquire into the causes of this condition , and how to prevent or remedy their operation . Dr. Duncan , of Edinburgh , has shown , by elaborate research , that in those wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the average , about seventeen months between the marriage ceremony and the birth of the first child , and that the question whether a woman will be sterile is decided in the first three years of married life . If she have no children in that time , the chances are thirteen to one against her ever having any . In those cases , therefore , in which the first three years of married life are fruitless , it is highly desirable for those wishing a family to ascertain whether or not the barrenness is dependent upon any defective condition capable of relief . The age of a wife at the time of marriage has much to do with the expectation of children . As the age increases over twenty-five years , the interval between the marriage and the birth of the first child is lengthened . For it has been ascertained that not only are women most fecund from twenty to twenty-four , but that they begin their career of child-bearing sooner after marriage than their younger or elder sisters . Early marriages ( those before the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those after twenty-four ) . The interesting result has further been arrived at in England , that about one in fourteen of all marriages of women between fifteen and nineteen are without offspring ; that wives married at ages from twenty to twenty-four inclusive , are almost all fertile ; and that after that age the chances of having no children gradually increases with the greater age at the time of marriage . There are two kinds of sterility which are physiological , natural to all women ,  --  that of young girls before puberty , and that of women who are past the epoch of the cessation of the menses . In some very rare cases , conception takes place after cessation . In one published case , it occurred nine months afterwards , and in another eighteen months . In some very rare cases , also , conception has taken place before the first menstruation . The older a woman is at the time of her marriage , the longer deferred is the age at which she naturally becomes sterile . She bears children later in life , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late commencement . But although she continues to have children until a more advanced age than the earlier married , yet her actual child-bearing period is shorter . Nature does not entirely make up at the end of life for the time lost from the duties of maternity in early womanhood ; for the younger married have really a longer era of fertility than the older , though it terminates at an earlier age . A wife who , having had children , has ceased for three years to conceive , will probably bear no more , and the probability increases as time elapses . After the first , births take place with an average interval , in those who continue to be fertile , of about twenty months . Nursing women are generally sterile , above all , during the first months which follow accouchement , because the vital forces are then concentrated on the secretion of the milk . In a majority of instances , when suckling is prolonged to even nineteen or twenty months , pregnancy does not take place at all until after weaning . Climate has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern regions more children are born , fewer in northern . The number of children is in inverse proportion to the amount of food in a country and in a season . In Belgium , the higher the price of bread the greater the number of children , and the greater the number of infant deaths . The seasons exert a power over the increase of population . The spring of the year , as has already been stated , is the most favourable to fecundity . It is not known whether day and night have any effect upon conception . The worldly condition seems to have much to do with the size of a family . Rich and fashionable women have fewer children than their poor and hard-worked neighbours . Wealth and pleasure seem to be often gladly exchanged for the title of mother . But it is our more particular object now to inquire into the causes of absolute sterility in individual cases , rather than to discuss the operation of general laws upon the fertility of the community at large , however inviting such a discussion may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always blamed . It is not to be supposed that she is always in fault . Many husbands are absolutely sterile ; for it is a mistake to consider that every man must be prolific who is vigorous and enjoys good health . Neither does it follow , because a woman has never given birth to a living child , that she has not conceived . About one marriage in eight is unproductive of living children , and therefore fails to add to the population . The seeds of life have , however , been more extensively sown among women than these figures would seem to indicate . If the life of an infant for a long time after birth is a frail one , before birth its existence is precarious in the extreme . It often perishes soon after conception . A sickness , unusually long and profuse , occurring in a young married woman a few days beyond the regular time , is often the only evidence she will ever have that a life she has communicated has been ended almost as soon as begun . A tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a family . This is generally remediable . It is a well-known fact that frigidity is a frequent cause of barrenness , as well as a barrier to matrimonial happiness . Its removal , so desirable , is in many cases possible by detecting and doing away with the cause . The causes are so various , that their enumeration here would be tedious and unprofitable , for most of them can only be discovered and remedied by a practical physician who has studied the particular case under consideration . So also in regard to the various displacements and diseases of the womb preventing conception . Proper medical treatment is usually followed by the best results . While the fact that pleasure is found in the marital relation is a favourable augury for impregnation , it has been long noticed that Messalinas are sterile . It was observed in Paris , that out of one thousand only six bore children in the course of a year , whereas the ordinary proportion in that city for that time is three and a half births for every one hundred of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense passion . Such cases are much more rare than instances of the opposite extreme producing the same effect . A condition of debility , or the presence of certain special poisons in the blood , may prevent conception , or , what is to all intents the same thing , cause miscarriage . Many apparently feeble women have large families . But in numerous instances a tonic and sometimes an alternative constitutional treatment is required before pregnancy will take place . On the contrary , there are well-authenticated cases of women who were stout and barren in opulence becoming thin and prolific in poverty . The stimulus of novelty to matrimonial intercourse imparted by a short separation of husband and wife , is often salutary in its influence upon fertility . To show upon what slight constitutional differences infertility often depends , it is merely necessary to allude to the fact , known to every one , that women who have not had children with one husband often have them with another . This condition of physiological incompatibility is evidently not altogether one of the emotional nature , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means rare to find certain males and females who will not breed together , although both are known to be perfectly fruitful with other females and males . The ancients , believing that sterility was more common with couples of the same temperament and condition , advised , with Hippocrates , that blonde women should unite with dark men , thin women with stout men , and vice versa . Barren women should not despair . They sometimes become fecund after a long lapse of years . In other words , they are sterile only during a certain period of their lives , and then , a change occurring in their temperament with age , they become fruitful . History affords a striking example of this eccentricity of generation , in the birth of Louis XIV. , whom Anne of Austria , Queen of France brought into the world after a sterility of twenty-two years . Catherine de Medicis , wife of Henry II. , became the mother of ten children after a sterility of ten years . Dr. Tilt , of London , mentions the case of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her husband enjoyed habitual good health , conception did not take place until she was forty-eight , when she bore a child . Another case is reported where a well-formed female married at nineteen , and did not bear a child until she had reached her fiftieth year . Families often suffer from the effects of sterility . Civilised nations never do . Recent researches have been carefully instituted in several countries to determine the exact power of the human race to preserve its numbers against the ravages of death . It has been ascertained that during periods of peace the population can be maintained to the same point by the additions made to it through the procreating capacity of only one-half of the women in the community . Nature , therefore , has made ample provision for preventing a decrease of population through failure of reproduction . She has also instituted laws to prevent its undue increase . It would seem as if the extension of material mental and social comfort and culture has a tendency to render marriage less prolific , and population stationary or nearly so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down as a maxim in sociology by Sismondi , that ' where the number of marriages is proportionally the greatest , where the greatest number of persons participate in the duties and the virtues and the happiness of marriage , the smaller number of children does each marriage produce . ' Thus , to a certain extent , does nature endorse the opinions of those political economists who assert that increase of population beyond certain limits is an evil happily averted by wars , famines , and pestilences , which hence become national blessings in disguise . She , however , points to the extension of mental and moral education and refinement as gentler and surer means of reducing plethoric population than those suggested by Malthus and Mill . Many causes of sterility , it will therefore be seen , are beyond the power of man to control . They operate on a large scale for the good of the whole . With these we have little concern . But there are others which may be influenced by intelligent endeavor . Some have been already alluded to , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific ADVICE TO WIVES WHO DESIRE TO HAVE CHILDREN . It has long been known that menstruation presents a group of phenomena closely allied to fecundity . The first eruption of the menses is an unequivocal sign of the awakening of the faculty of reproduction . The cessation of the menstrual epochs is a sign equally certain of the loss of the faculty of reproduction . When conception has taken place , the periodical flow is interrupted . Labor occurs at about the time in which the menses would have appeared . In short , it is a fact , now completely established , that the time immediately before , and particularly that after the monthly sickness , is the period the most favorable to fecundation . It is said that , by following the counsel to this effect given him by the celebrated Fernel , Henry II. , the King of France , secured to himself offspring after the long sterility of his wife before referred to . Professor Bedford , of New York , says that he can point to more than one instance in which , by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parties who for years had been vainly hoping for the accomplishment of their wishes . Repose of the woman , and , above all , sojourn on the bed after the act of generation , also facilitates conception . Hippocrates , the great father of medicine , was aware of this , and laid stress upon it in his advice to sterile wives . The womb and the breasts are bound together by very strong sympathies : that which excites the one will stimulate the other . Dr. Charles Loudon mentions that four out of seven patients , by acting on this hint , became mothers . A similar idea occurred to the illustrious Marshall Hall , who advised the application of a strong infant to the breast . Fomentations of warm milk to the breasts and the corresponding portion of the spinal column , and the use of the breast-pump two or three times a day , just before the menstrual period , have also been recommended by good medical authorities . Horseback exercise , carried to fatigue , seems occasionally to have conduced to pregnancy . The greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the constitution . But this can only be effected under suitable medical advice . The treatment of sterility  --  thanks to the recent researches of Dr. Marion Sims  --  is much more certain than formerly ; and the intelligent physician is now able to ascertain the cause , and point out the remedy , where before all was conjecture and experiment . The sterile wife should , herefore , be slow in abandoning all hope of ever becoming a mother . ON THE LIMITATION OF OFFSPRING . No part of our subject is more delicate than this . Very few people are willing to listen to a dispassionate discussion of the propriety or impropriety of limiting within certain bounds the number of children in a family . On the one side are many worthy physicians and pious clergymen , who , without listening to any arguments , condemn every effort to avoid large families ; on the other , are numberless wives and husbands , who turn a deaf ear to the warnings of doctors and the thunders of divines , and , eager to escape a responsibility they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous and immoral means to accomplish this end . We ask both parties to lay aside prejudice and prepossession , and examine with us this most important social question in all its bearings . Let us first inquire whether there is such a thing as over-production  --  having too many children . Unquestionably there is . Its disastrous effects on both mother and children are known to every intelligent physician . Two-thirds of all cases of womb disease , says Dr. Tilt , are traceable to child-bearing in feeble women . Hardly a day passes that a physician in large practice does not see instances of debility and disease resulting from over-much child-bearing . Even the lower animals illustrate this . Every farmer is aware of the necessity of limiting the offspring of his mares and cows . How much more severe are the injuries inflicted on the delicate organization of woman ! A very great mortality , says Dr. Duncan of Edinburgh , attends upon confinements when they become too frequent . The evils of a too rapid succession of pregnancies are likewise conspicuous in the children . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose authority in such matters none will dispute ,  --  of rickets than this . Puny , sickly , short-lived offspring follows over-production . Worse than this , the carefully compiled statistics of Scotland show that such children are peculiarly liable to idiocy . Adding to an already excessive number , they come to over-burden a mother already overwhelmed with progeny . They can not receive at her hands the attention they require . Weakly herself , she brings forth weakly infants . ' Thus , ' concludes Dr. Duncan , ' are the accumulated evils of an excessive family manifest . ' Apart from these considerations , there are certain social relations which have been thought by some to advise small families . When either parent suffers from a disease which is transmissible , and wishes to avoid inflicting misery on an unborn generation , it has been urged that they should avoid children . Such diseases not unfrequently manifest themselves after marriage , which is answer enough to the objection that if they did not wish children they should not marry . There are also women to whom pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it is nearly certain to prove fatal . Such a condition can not be discovered before marriage , and therefore can not be provided against by a single life . Can such women be asked to immolate themselves ? It is strange , says that distinguished writer , John Stuart Mill , that intemperance in drink , or in any other appetite , should be condemned so readily , but that incontinence in this respect should always meet not only with indulgence but praise . ' Little improvement ' he adds , ' can be expected in morality until the producing too large families is regarded with the same feeling as drunkenness , or any other physical excess . ' A well-known medical writer , Dr. Drysdale , in commenting on these words , adds : ' In this error , if error it be , I also humbly share . ' ' When dangerous prejudices , ' says Sismondi , the learned historian of southern Europe , ' have not become accredited , when our true duties towards those to whom we give life are not obscured in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more children than he can bring up properly . ' Such is the language of physicians and statesmen ; but a stronger appeal has been made for the sake of morality itself . The detestable crime of abortion is appallingly rife in our day ; it is abroad in our land to an extent which would have shocked the dissolute women of pagan Rome . Testimony from all quarters , especially from New England , has accumulated within the past few years to sap our faith in the morality and religion of American women . This wholesale , fashionable murder , how are we to stop it ? Hundreds of vile men and women in our large cities subsist by this slaughter of the innocents , and flaunt their ill-gotten gains  --  the price of blood  --  in our public thoroughfares . Their advertisements are seen in the newspapers ; their soul and body destroying means are hawked in every town . With such temptation strewn in her path , what will the woman threatened with an excessive family do ? Will she not yield to evil , and sear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! daily experience in the heart of a great city discloses to us only too frequently the fatal ease of such a course . In view of the injuries of excessive child-bearing on the one hand , and of this prevalent crime on the other , a man of genius and sympathy , Dr. Raciborski of Paris , took the position that the avoidance of offspring to a certain extent is not only legitimate , but should be recommended as a measure of public good . ' We know how bitterly we shall be attacked , ' he says , ' for promulgating this doctrine ; but if our ideas only render to society the services we expect of them , we shall have effaced from the list of crimes the one most atrocious without exception , that of child-murder , before or after birth , and we shall have poured a little happiness into the bosoms of despairing families , where poverty is allied to the knowledge that offspring can be born only to prostitution or mendicity . The realization of such hopes will console us under the attacks upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , that the wish to limit offspring arises most frequently from an inordinate desire of indulgence . We reply to such , that they do not know the human heart , and that they do it discredit . More frequently the wish springs from a love of children . The parents seek to avoid having more than they can properly nourish and educate . They do not wish to leave their sons and daughters in want . ' This , ' says a writer in The Nation ( of New York ) , in an article on this interesting subject ,  --  ' this is not the noblest motive of action , of course , but there is something finely human about it . ' ' Very much indeed is it to be wished , ' says Dr. Edward Reich , after reviewing the multitudinous evils which result to individuals and society from a too rapid increase in families , ' that the function of reproduction be placed under the dominion of the will . ' Men are very ready to find an excuse for self-indulgence ; and if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in religion . They tell the woman it is her duty to bear all the children she can . They refer her to the sturdy , strong-limbed women of early times , to the peasant women of northern Europe , who emigrate to America , and ask and expect their wives to rival them in fecundity . Such do not reflect that they have been brought up to light indoor employment , that their organization is more nervous and frail , that they absolutely have not the stamina required for many confinements . Moreover , they presume too much in asking her to bear them . ' If a woman has a right to decide on any question , ' said a genial physician in the Massachusetts Medical Society a few years since , ' it certainly is as to how many children she shall bear . ' ' Certainly , ' say the editors of a prominent medical journal , ' wives have a right to demand of their husbands at least the same consideration which a breeder extends to his stock . ' ' Whenever it becomes unwise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' justice and humanity require that the husband should impose on himself the same restraint which is submitted to by the unmarried . ' An eminent writer on medical statistics , Dr. Henry MacCormac , says : ' The brute yields to the generative impulse when it is experienced . He is troubled by no compunction about the matter . Now , a man ought not to act like a brute . He has reason to guide and control his appetites . Too many , however , forget , and act like brutes instead of as men . It would , in effect , prove very greatly conducive to man 's interests were the generative impulses placed absolutely under the sway of right reason , chastity , forecast , and justice . ' There is no lack of authorities , medical and non-medical , on this point . Few who weigh them well will deny that there is such a thing as too large a family ; that there does come a time when a mother can rightfully demand rest from her labours , in the interest of herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Here again the impossibility meets us of stating a definite number of children , and saying , ' This many and no more . ' As in every other department of medicine , averages are of no avail in guiding individuals . There are women who require no limitation whatever . They can bear healthy children with rapidity , and suffer no ill results . There are others  --  and they are the majority  --  who should use temperance in this as in every other function ; and there are a few who should bear no children at all . It is absurd for physicians or theologians to insist that it is either the physical or moral duty of the female to have as many children as she possibly can have . It is time that such an injurious prejudice was discarded , and the truth recognised , that while marriage looks to offspring as its natural sequence , there should be inculcated such a thing as marital continence , and that excess here as elsewhere is repugnant to morality , and is visited by the laws of physiology with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-control , a willingness to deny himself ,  --  that is what is required from the husband . But a thousand voices reach us from suffering women in all parts of our land that this will not suffice ; that men refuse thus to restrain themselves ; that it leads to a loss of domestic happiness and to illegal amours , or that it is injurious physically and mentally ,  --  that , in short , such advice is useless , because impracticable . To such sufferers we reply that Nature herself has provided to some extent against over-production , and that it is well to avail ourselves of her provisions . It is well known that women when nursing rarely become pregnant , and for this reason , if for no other , women should nurse their own children , and continue the period until the child is at least a year old . Be it remembered , however , that nursing , continued too long , weakens both mother and child , and , moreover , ceases to accomplish the end for which we now recommend it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period between her monthly illnesses every woman is sterile . The vesicle which matures in her ovaries , and is discharged from them by menstruation , remains some days in the womb before it is passed forth and lost . How long its stay is we do not definitely know , and probably it differs in individuals . From ten to twelve days at most are supposed to elapse after the cessation of the flow before the final ejection of the vesicle . For some days after this the female is incapable of reproduction . But for some days before her monthly illness she is liable to conception , as for that length of time the male element can survive . This period , therefore , becomes a variable and an undetermined one , and even when known , its observation demands a large amount of self-control . There is one method widely in use in this country for the limitation of offspring which deserves only the most unqualified condemnation , which is certain to bring upon the perpetrators swift and terrible retribution , and which is opposed to every sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABORTION . From the moment of conception a new life commences ; a new individual exists ; another child is added to the family . The mother who deliberately sets about to destroy this life , either by want of care , or by taking drugs , or using instruments , commits as great a crime , is just as guilty , as if she strangled her new-born infant , or as if she snatched from her own breast her six-months ' darling and dashed out its brains against the wall . Its blood is upon her head , and as sure as there is a God and a judgment , that blood will be required of her . The crime she commits is murder , child-murder ,  --  the slaughter of a speechless , helpless being , whom it is her duty , beyond all things else , to cherish and preserve . This crime is common ; it is fearfully prevalent . Hundreds of persons are devoted to its perpetration . It is their trade . In nearly every village its ministers stretch out their bloody hands to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who submit to their treatment are not generally unmarried women who have lost their virtue , but the mothers of families , respectable Christian matrons , members of churches , and walking in the better classes of society . We appeal to all such with earnest and with threatening words . If they have no feeling for the fruit of their womb , if maternal sentiment is so callous in their breasts , let them know that such produced abortions are the constant cause of violent and dangerous womb diseases , and frequently of early death ; that they bring on mental weakness , and often insanity ; that they are the most certain means to destroy domestic happiness which can be adopted . Better , far better , to bear a child every year for twenty years than to resort to such a wicked and injurious step ; better to die , if needs be , in the pangs of childbirth , than to live with such a weight of sin on the conscience . There is no need of either . By the moderation we have mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the evils of an excessive family , without injury and without criminality . We feel obliged to speak in plain language of this hidden sin , because so many are ignorant that it is a sin . Only within a few years have those who take in charge the public morals spoken of it in such terms that this excuse of ignorance is no longer admissible . Bishop Coxe , of New York , in a pastoral letter , the late Archbishop Spaulding , Catholic Primate of the United States , in an address at the close of a recent Provincial Council at Baltimore , the Old and New School Presbyterian Churches , at a meeting in Philadelphia , have all pronounced the severest judgments against those guilty of antenatal infanticide . Appeals through the press have been made by physicians of high standing , and by eminent divines , which should be in the hands of every one . The chiefest difficulty hitherto has been , that while women were warned against the evils of abortion , they were offered no escape from the exhaustion and dangers of excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met , and , we believe , in such a manner that neither the accuracy of our statements nor the purity of our motives can be doubted . Should our position be attacked , however , the medical man must know that in opposing our views , he opposes those of the most distinguished physicians in Europe and in America ; and the theologian should be warned that , when a neglect of physical laws leads to moral evil , the only way to correct this evil is to remedy the neglect . In this case the neglect is over-production ; the evil is abortion . NATURE OF CONCEPTION . The theories which have been advanced to explain the manner in which the human species is continued and reproduced are very numerous . Including the hypotheses of the ancient philosophers , some two hundred and fifty have been promulgated by the greatest thinkers of all times . The older ones do not deserve mention , as they are replete with absurdities . Such , for instance , is that of Pythagoras , which supposed that a vapor descended from the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the veins behind the ears to produce impotence and sterility . Modern science has shown the total error of this and many other views formerly entertained on this subject . Has galvanism or electricity any share in the mysterious function ? Some among the modern physiologists have supposed that there is an electrical or magnetic influence which effects generation . Even within a few months , Dr. Harvey L. Byrd , Professor of Obstetrics in the Medical Department of Washington University of Baltimore , has asserted that he has ' every reason for believing that fecundation or impregnation is always an electrical phenomenon ; ... it results from the completion of an electric circle ,  --  the union of positive and negative electricities . ' This , however , is not accepted by all as the dictum of modern science . Physiology has clearly established that the new being is the result of contact between the male element , an independent , living animal , on the one part , and the female element , a matured egg , on the other , involving the union of the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take place . The only matter of practical moment in connection with this most interesting function which we have to announce , is the influence of the mind on the offspring at the time of generation . This influence has long been remarked in regard to animals as well as men . Jacob was aware of it when he made his shrewd bargain with Laban for ' all the speckled and spotted cattle ' as his hire . For we are told that then ' Jacob took him rods of green poplar , and of the hazel and chestnut tree , and pilled white strakes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods . And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs , when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink . And the flocks conceived before the rods , and brought forth cattle ringstraked , speckled , and spotted . And Jacob did separate the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not unto Laban 's cattle . And it came to pass , whenever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods . But when the cattle were feeble , he put them not in : so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's . ' The impressions conveyed to the brain through the sense of sight are here asserted by the writer of Genesis to have influenced the system of the ewes so that they brought forth young marked in the same manner as the rods placed before their eyes . It is not said that there was any miraculous interposition ; but the whole account is given as if it were an everyday , natural , and well-known occurrence . The Greeks , a people renowned for their physical beauty , seemed to be aware of the value of mental impressions ; for in their apartments they were lavish of statues and paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best models of art . Dionysus , tyrant of Syracuse , caused the portrait of the beautiful Jason to be suspended before the nuptial bed , in order to obtain a handsome child . The following is related of the celebrated Galen :  --  A Roman magistrate , little , ugly , and hunch-backed , had by his wife a child exactly resembling the statue of AEsop . Frightened at the sight of this little monster , and fearful of becoming the father of a posterity so deformed , he went to consult Galen , the most distinguished physician of his time , who counseled him to place three statues of love around the conjugal bed , one at the foot , the others , one on each side , in order that the eyes of his young spouse might be constantly feasted on these charming figures . The magistrate followed strictly the advice of the physician , and it is recorded that his wife bore him a child surpassing in beauty all his hopes . The fact that the attributes of the child are determined to an important extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of conception , explains the marked difference almost constantly observed between children born to the same parents , however strong the family likeness may be among them . The changes constantly going on in the physical , intellectual , and emotional states of the parents , produce a corresponding alteration in offspring conceived at successive intervals . Twins generally resemble each other very closely in every respect . Inasmuch , therefore , as the moment of generation is of much more importance than is commonly believed in its effect upon the moral and physical life of the future being , it is to be wished that parents would pay some attention to this subject . It is the moment of creation ,  --  that in which the first vital power is communicated to the new creature . Not without reason has nature associated with it the highest sensual exaltation of our existence . Dr. Hufeland , the author of The Art of Prolonging Life , has said , ' In my opinion it is of the utmost importance that this moment should be confined to a period when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind cheerful and free from care , invite to it on both sides . ' SIGNS OF FRUITFUL CONJUNCTION . There are some women in whom the act of conception is attended with certain sympathetic affections , such as faintness , vertigo , etc. , by which they know that it has taken place . Swelling of the neck was regarded in ancient times as a sign of conception . Its truthfulness has been reaffirmed by modern authorities . It has also been asserted that impregnation generally excites a universal tremor in all parts of the body , and that it is associated with more than an ordinary degree of pleasure . It must not be supposed , however , that enjoyment and impregnation bear necessarily to each other the relation of cause and effect , although this is the popular opinion . From too implicit a reliance upon this current belief , wives are often incredulous as to their true condition . It is a fact that in some cases sickness at the stomach manifests itself almost simultaneously with the act of fecundation . Authentic instances are on record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nausea , without ever making a mistake . In conclusion , it may be said that peculiar sensations are often experienced , frequently of a character difficult to explain ; and many modern authors attach to them a marked value . In this manner it is possible for a woman to be satisfied at the moment as to the change which has taken place ; yet the evidence is often deceptive , and sometimes nothing peculiar is noticed . From the period of conception the mother has no direct knowledge of the process that is going on within , excepting by the effects of the increasing pressure upon other parts , until ' quickening ' takes place , which belongs to another part of our subject . The signs and symptoms of pregnancy will be explained in full when we come to treat of the pregnant condition in a future chapter . HOW TO RETAIN THE AFFECTIONS OF A HUSBAND . Ah ! this is a secret indeed !  --  worth the wand of the magician , the lamp of Aladdin , or the wishing-cap of the fairy . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a husband ? Yet this pearl of great price , how often is it treated as lightly and carelessly as if it was any bauble of Brummagem ! ' My husband , ' we have heard young wives say , ' why , it is his duty to love me . Why did he marry me if he is not going to love me , love me fondly , love me ever ? ' Yes , we all know Love the gift , is love the debt . But in this world of ours it is often hard to get one 's own ; and when got , our care must never cease , lest it be wrested from us . The plant you bought at the greenhouse , and that now blossoms on your window-sill , became yours by purchase , but it has required your daily care to keep it alive and persuade it to unfold its blossoms . Infinitely more delicate is this plant of love . It , too , you purchased . You gave in exchange for it your own heart . It too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wither and die . In this country , some women think that anything is good enough to wear at home . They go about in slatternly morning dresses , unkempt hair , and slippers down at heel . ' Nobody will see me , ' they say ' but my husband . ' Let them learn a lesson from the wives of the Orient . In those countries a married woman never goes abroad except in long sombre robes and thick veil . An English lady visiting the wife of one of the wealthy merchants , found her always in full dress , with toilet as carefully arranged as if she were going to a ball . ' Why ! ' exclaimed the visitor , at length , ' is it possible that you take all this trouble to dress for nobody but your husband ? ' ' Do , then , ' asked the lady in reply , ' the wives of Englishmen dress for the sake of pleasing other men ? ' The visitor was mute . Not that we would wish our women to be for ever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she who neglects neatness in attire , and , above all , cleanliness of person , runs a great danger of creating a sentiment of disgust in those around her . Nothing is more repugnant to the husband 's senses than bad odors , and , for reasons which every woman knows , women who neglect cleanliness are peculiarly liable to them . When simple means do not remove them , recourse should be promptly had to a medical adviser . So it is with bad breath . This sometimes arises from neglect of the teeth , sometimes from diseases of the stomach , lungs , etc . A man of delicate olfactories is almost forced to hold at arm 's length a wife with a fetid breath . There are some women  --  we have treated several  --  who are plagued with a most disagreeable perspiration , especially about the feet , the arms , etc . Such should not marry until this is cured . It is a rule among army surgeons , to be chary about giving men their discharge from military service on surgeon 's certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they are considered an allowable cause for discharge . No doubt , in some of our States they would be received as a valid ground for divorce !  --  certainly with quite as much reason as many of the grounds usually alleged . In short , the judicious employment of all the harmless arts of the toilet , and of those numerous and effective means which modern science offers , to acquire , to preserve , and to embellish beauty , is a duty which woman , whether married or single , should never neglect . With very little trouble , the good looks and freshness of youth can be guarded almost to old age ; and , even when hopelessly gone , simple and harmless means are at hand to repair the injuries of years , or at least to conceal them . But this is an art which would require a whole volume to treat of , and which we can not here touch upon . INHERITANCE . We now come to the consideration of a very wonderful subject ,  --  that of inheritance . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts it presents , and of the great practical bearing it has upon the welfare of every individual . In order to the better understanding of this matter , it is necessary at the outset to make a distinction between four kinds or varieties of inheritance . The most generally recognised is direct inheritance ,  --  that in which the children partake of the qualities of the father and mother . But a child may not resemble either parent , while it bears a striking likeness to an uncle or aunt . This constitutes indirect inheritance . Again , a child may be more like one of its grandparents than either its father or mother . Or , what is still more astonishing , it may display some of the characteristics possessed only by a remote ancestor . This form of inheritance is known by the scientific term atavism , derived from the Latin word atavus , meaning an ancestor . It is curious to note in this connection that sometimes a son resembles more closely his maternal than his paternal grandsire in some male attribute ,  --  as a peculiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . Though the mother can not possess or exhibit such male qualities , she has transmitted them through her blood , from her father to her son . The fourth variety of inheritance is that in which the child resembles neither parent , but the first husband of its mother . A woman contracting a second marriage , transmits to the offspring of that marriage the peculiarities she has received through the first union . Breeders of stock know this tendency , and prevent their brood-mares , cows , or sheep from running with males of an inferior stock . Thus the diseases of a man may be transmitted to children which are not his own . Even though dead , he continues to exert an influence over the future offspring of his wife , by means of the ineffaceable impress he had made in the conjugal relation upon her whole system , as we have previously mentioned . The mother finds in the children of her second marriage ' ... the touch of a vanished hand , And the sound of a voice that is still . ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inexorable law , for sins committed not by its own father , but by the first husband of its mother . What a serious matter , then , is that relation between the sexes called marriage ! How far-reaching are its responsibilities ! A distinction must here be drawn between hereditary transmission and the possession of qualities at birth , which have not been the result of any impression received from the system of father or mother , but due to mental influences or accidents operating through the mother . A child may be born idiotic or deformed , not because either parent or one of its ancestors was thus affected , but from the influence of some severe mental shock received by the mother during her pregnancy . This subject of maternal impressions will come up for separate consideration in the discussion of pregnancy . Again , a child may be epileptic , although there is no epilepsy in the family , simply because of the intoxication of the father or mother at the time of the intercourse resulting in conception . Such cases are not due to hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been possessed by neither the parents nor any other relatives . In considering the effects of inheritance , we will first pass in review those connected with the physical constitution . These are exceedingly common and universally known . Fortunately , not merely are evil qualities inherited , but beauty , health , vigor , and longevity also . BEAUTY . Good looks are characteristic of certain families . Alcibiades , the handsomest among the Grecians of his time , descended from ancestors remarkable for their beauty . So well and long has the desirable influence of inheritance in this respect been recognised , that there existed in Crete an ancient law which ordained that each year the most beautiful among the young men and women should be chosen and forced to marry , in order to perpetuate the type of their beauty . Irregularities of feature are transmitted from parent to child through many generations . The aquiline nose has existed some centuries , and is yet hereditary in the Bourbon family . The hereditary under-lip of the House of Hapsburg is another example . When the poet Savage speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he scarcely exaggerates what is often seen in families where some strongly-marked feature or expression is long predominant or reappears in successive generations . NECK AND LIMBS . The form and length of the neck and limbs are frequently hereditary , as is also the height of the body . The union of two tall persons engenders tall children . The father of Frederick the Great secured for himself a regiment of men of gigantic stature , by permitting the marriage of his guards only with women of similar height . A tendency to obesity often appears in generation after generation of a family . Yet such cases are within the reach of medical art . COMPLEXION . Even the complexion is not exempt from this influence . Blondes ordinarily procreate blondes , and dark parents have dark-skinned children . An union in marriage of fair and dark complexions results in an intermediate shade in the offspring . Not always , however ; for it has been asserted that the complexion chiefly follows that of the father . The offspring of a black father and a white mother is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark mother . In explanation of this fact , it has been said that the mother is not impressed by her own color , because she does not look upon herself , while the father 's complexion attracts her attention , and thus gives a darker tinge to the offspring . Black hens frequently lay dark eggs ; but the reverse is more generally found to be the case . PHYSICAL QUALITIES TRANSMITTED BY EACH PARENT . In general , it may be said that there exists a tendency on the part of the father to transmit the external appearance , the configuration of the head and limbs , the peculiarities of the senses and of the skin and the muscular condition ; while the size of the body , and the general temperament or constitution of the child , are derived from the mother . Among animals , the mule , which is the produce of the male ass and the mare , is essentially a modified ass having the general configuration of its sire , but the rounded trunk and larger size of its dam . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stallion and the she-ass , is essentially a modified horse , having the general configuration of the horse , but being a much smaller animal than its sire , and therefore approaching the dam in size as well as in the comparative narrowness of its trunk . The operation of this principle , though general , is not universal . Exceptions may easily be cited . In almost every large family it will be observed that the likeness to the father predominates in some children , while others most resemble the mother . It is rare to meet with instances in which some distinctive traits of both parents may not be traced in the offspring . HAIR . Peculiarities in the colour and structure of the hair are transmitted . Darwin mentions a family in which , for many generations , some of the members had a single lock differently coloured from the rest of the hair . TEMPERAMENT . The law of inheritance rules in regard to the production of the temperament . The crossing of one temperament with another in marriage , produces a modification in the offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sometimes hereditary . The children of prolific parents are themselves prolific . It is related that a French peasant woman was confined ten times in fifteen years . Her pregnancies , always multiple , produced twenty-eight children . At her last confinement she had three daughters , who all lived , married , and gave birth to children ,  --  the first to twenty-six , the second to thirty-one , and the third to twenty-seven . On the contrary , sometimes a tendency to sterility is found fixed upon certain families , from which they can only escape by the most assiduous care . LONGEVITY . In the vegetable kingdom , the oak inherits the power to live many years , while the peach-tree must die in a short time . In the animal kingdom , the robin becomes grey and old at ten years of age ; the rook caws lustily until a hundred . The ass is much longer-lived than the horse . The mule illustrates in a striking manner the hereditary tendency of longevity . It has the size of the horse , the long life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stronger , and the shorter-lived and more horse-like the mule . It is also a curious and instructive fact , that this animal is the toughest after it has passed the age of the horse : the inherited influence of the horse having been expended , the vitality and hardiness of the ass remain . It is universally conceded , that longevity is the privileged possession of some lineages . That famous instance of old age , Thomas Parr , the best authenticated on record , may be mentioned in illustration . It is vouched for by Harvey , the distinguished discoverer of the circulation of the blood . Parr died in the reign of Charles the First , at the age of 152 , after having lived under nine sovereigns of England . He left a daughter aged 127 . His father had attained to a great age , and his great-grandson died at Cork at the age of 103 . DEFORMITIES . Deformities are undoubtedly sometimes transmitted to the progeny . It is by no means rare to find that the immediate ancestors of those afflicted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also the subjects of these malformations . There are one or two families in Germany whose members pride themselves upon the possession of an extra thumb ; and there is an Arab chieftain whose ancestors have from time immemorial been distinguished by a double thumb upon the right hand . Darwin gives many similar instances . A case of curious displacement of the knee-pans is recorded , in which the father , sister , son , and the son of the half-brother by the same father , had all the same malformation . PERSONAL PECULIARITIES . Gait , gestures , voice , general bearing , are all inherited . Peculiar manners , passing into tricks , are often transmitted , as in the case , often quoted , of the father who generally slept on his back with his right leg crossed over the left , and whose daughter , whilst an infant in the cradle , followed exactly the same habit , though an attempt was made to cure her . Left-handedness is not unfrequently hereditary . It would be very easy to go on multiplying instances , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical question now naturally suggests itself . How can the vices of conformation be avoided , and beauty secured ? The art of having handsome children , known under the name of callipaedia , has received much attention , more , perhaps , in years gone by than of late . The noted Abbot Quillet wrote a book in Latin on the subject . Many other works , in which astrology plays a prominent part , were written on this art in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . We have already stated that well-formed parents will transmit these qualities to their children , with scarcely an exception . Like begets like . Unfortunately , all parents are not beautiful . Yet all desire beautiful offspring . The body of the child can be influenced by the mind of the parent , particularly of the mother . A mind habitually filled with pleasant fancies and charming images is not without its effect upon the offspring . The statues of Apollo , Castor and Pollux , Venus , Hebe , and the other gods and goddesses which were so numerous in the gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons and daughters of the passers-by . We know also that marriages contracted at an age too early or too late , are apt to give imperfectly-developed children . The crossing of temperaments and of nationalities beautifies the offspring . The custom which has prevailed , in many countries , among the nobility , of purchasing the handsomest girls they could find for their wives , has laid the foundation of a higher type of features among the ruling classes . To obtain this desired end , conception should take place only when both parents are in the best physical condition , at the proper season of the year , and with mutual passion . ( We have already hinted how this can be regulated . ) During pregnancy the mother should often have some painting or engraving representing cheerful and beautiful figures before her eyes , or often contemplate some graceful statue . She should avoid looking at , or thinking of ugly people , or those marked with disfiguring diseases . She should take every precaution to escape injury , fright , and disease of any kind , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the person . She should keep herself well nourished , as want of food nearly always injures the child . She should avoid ungraceful positions and awkward attitudes , as by some mysterious sympathy these are impressed on the child she carries . Let her cultivate grace and beauty in herself at such a time , and she will endow her child with them . As anger and irritability leave imprints on the features , she should maintain serenity and calmness . INHERITANCE OF TALENT AND GENIUS . The effects of inheritance are perhaps more marked upon the mind than upon the body . This need not surprise us . If the peculiar form of the brain can be transmitted , the mental attributes , the result of its organization , must necessarily also be transmitted . It is a matter of daily observation , that parents gifted with bright minds , cultivated by education , generally engender intelligent children ; while the offspring of those steeped in ignorance are stupid from birth . It may be objected , that men the most remarkable in ancient or modern times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Buffon , Cuvier , etc. , have not transmitted their vast intellectual powers to their progeny . In explanation , it has been stated that what is known as genius is not transmissible . The creation of a man of genius seems to require a special effort of Nature , after which , as if fatigued , she reposes a long time before again making a similar effort . But it may well be doubted whether even those complex mental attributes on which genius and talent depend are not inheritable , particularly when both parents are thus endowed . That distinguished men do not more frequently have distinguished sons , may readily be accounted for when it is recollected that the inherited character is due to the combined influence of both parents . The desirable qualities of the father may therefore be neutralized in the offspring by the opposite or defective qualities of the mother . That contrasts in the disposition of parents are rather the rule than the exception , we have already shown . Every one tends to unite himself in friendship or love with a different character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he feels his own nature to be deficient . The mother , therefore , may weaken , and perhaps obliterate , the qualities transmitted by the father . Again , the influence of some remote ancestors may make itself felt upon the offspring through the operation of the law of atavism , before alluded to , and thus prevent the children from equaling their parents in their natural endowments . Notwithstanding the workings of these opposing forces , and others which might be mentioned , we find abundant illustration of the hereditary nature of talent and character . Of six hundred and five names occurring in a biographical dictionary devoted to men distinguished as great founders and originators , between the years 1453 and 1853 , there were , as has been pointed out by Mr. Galton , no less than one hundred and two relationships , or one in six . Walford 's Men of the Time contains an account of the distinguished men in England , the Continent , and America , then living . Under the letter A there are eighty-five names , and no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , have relatives also in the list ; twelve of them are brothers , and eleven fathers and sons . In Bryan 's Dictionary of Painters , the letter A contains three hundred and ninety-one names of men , of whom sixty-five are near relatives , or one in six ; thirty-three of them are fathers and sons , and thirty are brothers . In Fetis 's Biographie Universelle des Musiciens , the letter A contains five hundred and fifteen names , of which fifty are near relatives , or one in ten . Confining ourselves to literature alone , it has been found that it is one to six and a half that a very distinguished literary man has a very distinguished literary relative ; and it is one to twenty-eight that the relation is father and son , or brother and brother , respectively . Among the thirty-nine Chancellors of England , sixteen had kinsmen of eminence ; thirteen of them had kinsmen of great eminence . These thirteen out of thirty-nine , or one in three , are certainly remarkable instances of the influence of inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , and other American States , with like results . The Greek poet AEschylus counted eight poets and four musicians among his ancestors . The greater part of the celebrated sculptors of ancient Greece descended from a family of sculptors . The same is true of the great painters . The sister of Mozart shared the musical talent of her brother . As there are reasons , to be detailed hereafter , for believing that the influence of the mother is even greater than that of the father , how vastly would the offspring be improved if distinguished men united themselves in marriage to distinguished women for generation after generation ! INFLUENCE OF FATHERS OVER DAUGHTERS ; OF MOTHERS OVER SONS . We have already called attention to the parts of the physical organization transmitted by the father and by the mother . It would seem , moreover , that each parent exercises a special influence over the child according to its sex . The father transmits to the daughters the form of the head , the framework of the chest and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the body and the inferior extremities is transmitted by the mother . With the sons this is reversed . They derive from the mother the shape of the head and of the superior extremities , and resemble the father in the trunk and inferior extremities . From this it therefore results , that boys procreated by intelligent women will be intelligent , and that girls procreated by fathers of talent will inherit their mental capacity . The mothers of a nation , though unseen and unacknowledged in the halls of legislation , determine in this subtle manner the character of the laws . History informs us that the greater part of the women who have been celebrated for their intelligence , reflected the genius of their fathers . Arete , the most celebrated woman of her time , on account of the extent of her knowledge , was the daughter of the distinguished philosopher Aristippus , disciple of Socrates . Cornelia , the mother of the Gracchi , was a daughter of Scipio . The daughter of the Roman emperor Caligula was as cruel as her father . Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vices of his . Charlemagne shut his eyes upon the faults of his daughters , because they recalled his own . Genghis-Khan , the renowned Asiatic conqueror , had for his mother a warlike woman . Tamerlane , the greatest warrior of the fourteenth century , was descended from Genghis-Khan by the female side . Catherine de Medicis was as crafty and deceitful as her father , and more superstitious and cruel . She had two sons worthy of herself ,  --  Charles IX. , who shot the Protestants , and Henry III. , who assassinated the Guises . Her daughter , Margaret of Valois , recalled her father by her gentle manners . The cruel deeds of Alexander VI. , the dark records of which will for ever stain the pages of history , are only rivaled in atrocity by those of his children , the infamous Borgias . Arete , Hypatia , Madame de Stael , and George Sand ,  --  all four had philosophers for their fathers . The mother of Bernardo Tasso had the gift of poetry . Buffon often speaks of the rich imagination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonson , ' Goethe , Walter Scott , Byron , and Lamartine ,  --  all were born of women remarkable for their vivacity and brilliancy of language . Byron , in his journal , attributes his hypochondria to a hereditary taint derived from his mother , who was its victim in its most furious form ; and her father ' was strongly suspected of suicide . ' He was said to have resembled more his maternal grandfather than any of his father 's family . The daughter of Moliere was like her father in her wit and humor . Beethoven had for a maternal grandmother an excellent musician . The mother of Mozart gave the first lessons to her son . A crowd of composers have descended from John Sebastian Bach , who long stood unrivaled as a performer on the organ , and composer for that instrument . It may be remarked here , that it is almost invariably true that the ability or inability to acquire a knowledge of music is derived from the ancestry . Parents who can not turn a tune or tell one note from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet sounds . ' Examples could easily be adduced at still greater length , illustrating the direct influence of the father over the daughter , and of the mother over the son . Those given will suffice . INFLUENCE Of EDUCATION OVER INHERITED QUALITIES . In correcting the evil effects of inheritance on the mind , education plays a very important part . A child born with a tendency to some vice or intellectual trait , may have this tendency entirely overcome , or at least modified , by training . So , also , virtues implanted by nature may be lost during the plastic days of youth , in consequence of bad associations and bad habits . Education can therefore do much to alter inherited mental and moral qualities . Can it be invoked to prevent the transmission of undesirable traits , and secure the good ? Everything that we have at birth is a heritage from our ancestors . Can virtuous habits be transmitted ? Can we secure virtues in our children by possessing them ourselves ? Science sadly says , through her latest votaries , that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , and which we have no power to modify . It is only after exposure during several generations to changed conditions or habits , that any modification in the offspring ensues . The son of an old soldier learns his drill no more quickly than the son of an artisan . We must therefore come to the conclusion with Mr. Galton , that to a great extent our own embryos have sprung immediately from the embryos whence our parents were developed , and these from the embryos of their parents , and so on for ever . Hence we are still barbarians in our nature . We show it in a thousand ways . Children , who love to dig and play in the dirt , have inherited that instinct from untold generations of ancestors . Our remote forefathers were barbarians , who dug with their nails to get at the roots on which they lived . The delicately-reared child reverts to primeval habits . In like manner , the silk-haired , parlor-nurtured spaniel springs from the caressing arms of its mistress , to revel in the filth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE . Perhaps the most important part of the subject of inheritance , is that which remains for us to consider in relation to the transmission of disease , or of a predisposition to it . Consumption ,  --  that dread foe of modern life ,  --  is the most frequently encountered of all affections as the result of inherited predisposition . Indeed some of the most eminent physicians have believed it is never produced in any other way . Heart disease , disease of the throat , excessive obesity , affections of the skin , asthma , disorders of the brain and nervous system , gout , rheumatism , and cancer , are all hereditary . A tendency to bleed frequently , profusely and uncontrollably , from trifling wounds , is often met with as a family affection . The inheritance of diseased conditions is also influenced by the sex . A parent may transmit disease exclusively to children of the same sex , or exclusively to those of the opposite sex . Thus , a horn-like projection on the skin peculiar to the Lambert family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So mothers have through several generations transmitted to their daughters alone supernumerary fingers , color-blindness , and other deformities and diseases . As a general rule , any disease acquired during the life of either parent , strongly tends to be inherited by the offspring of the same sex rather than the opposite . We have spoken of the apparently reverse tendency in regard to the transmission of genius and talent . ARE MUTILATIONS INHERITABLE ? How , it may be inquired , is it in regard to the inheritance of parts mutilated and altered by injuries and disease during the life of either parent ? In some cases mutilations have been practised for many generations , without any inherited result . Different races of men have knocked out their upper teeth , cut off the joints of their fingers , made immense holes through their ears and nostrils , and deep gashes in various parts of their bodies , and yet there is no reason for supposing that these mutilations have been inherited . The Comprachicos , a hideous and strange association of men and women , existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and make of them monsters . Victor Hugo , in a recent work , has graphically told how they took a face and made of it a snout , how they bent down growth , kneaded the physiognomy , distorted the eyes , and in other ways disfigured ' the human form divine , ' in order to make fantastic playthings for the amusement of the noble-born . But history does not state that these deformities were inherited ; certainly no race of monsters has resulted . The pits from small-pox are not inherited , though many successive generations must have been thus pitted by that disease before the beneficent discovery of the immortal Jenner . Children born with scars left by pustules have had small-pox in the womb , acquired through the system of the mother . On the other hand , the lower animals , cats , dogs , and horses , which have had their tails and legs artificially altered or injured , have produced offspring with the same condition of parts . A man who had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same finger on the same hand similarly crooked . The eminent physiologist Dr. Brown-Sequard mentions , that many young guinea-pigs inherited an epileptic tendency from parents which had been subjected to an operation at his hands resulting in the artificial production of fits ; while a large number of guinea-pigs bred from animals which had not been operated on were not thus affected . At any rate , it can not but be admitted that injuries and mutilations which cause disease , are occasionally inherited . But many cases of deformities existing at birth , as hare-lip , are not due to inheritance , although present in the father . They arise from a change effected in the child while in the womb , through an impression made upon the mind of the mother , as will be shown hereafter . LATE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF INHERITANCE . Not only are diseases inherited which make their appearance at birth , but those which defer their exhibition until a certain period of life corresponding with that at which they showed themselves in the parents . Thus in the Lambert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin began to grow in the father and sons at the same age , namely , about nine weeks after birth . In an extraordinary hairy family , which has been described , children were produced during three generations with hairy ears : in the father , the hair began to grow over his body at six years old ; in his daughter somewhat earlier , namely , at one year ; and in both generations the milk teeth appeared late in life , the permanent teeth being deficient . Greyness of hair at an unusually early age has been transmitted in some families . So , also , has the premature appearance of baldness . HOW TO AVOID THE TENDENCY OF INHERITANCE . These facts suggest the practical consideration , that in those diseases the predisposition to which alone is inherited , and which break out only after a lapse of time , it is often altogether possible to prevent the predisposition being developed into positive disease . Thus , for instance , the inherited tendency to consumption remains asleep in the system until about the age of puberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet in which animal food forms a large portion , properly regulated , and systematic exercise in the open air , the practice of the long inhalations before recommended , warm , comfortable clothing , together with a residence , if practicable , during the changeable and inclement seasons of the year , in an equable climate , we can often entirely arrest the development of the disease . Prevention here is not only better than cure , but often all that is possible . Those in whom the disease has become active , must too often , like those who entered Dante 's infernal regions , ' abandon hope . ' Let our words of caution therefore be heeded . When there is reason to believe that an individual possesses an inherent tendency to any disease , it is the duty of the medical adviser to study the constitution of the patient thoroughly , and after such study to recommend those measures of prevention best suited to avert the threatened disorder . Above all , let the physician look closely to the child at the period of life when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision should be carried into adult years , for there are instances on record of inherited diseases coming on at an advanced age , as in that of a grandfather , father , and son , who all became insane and committed suicide near their fiftieth year . Gout , apoplexy , insanity , chronic disease of the heart , epilepsy , consumption , asthma , and other diseases , are all more or less under the control of preventive measures . Some hereditary diseases , such as idiocy and cancer , we are impotent to prevent , in the present state of our knowledge . A singular fact in connection with the transmission of disease is the readiness with which a whole generation is passed over , the affection appearing in the next . A father or mother with consumption may in some instances have healthy children , but the grandchildren will die of the disease . Nature kindly favors one generation , but only at the expense of the next . Some diseases require , in addition to the general means of prevention to be found in a strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to effectually ward off their appearance . But the extent of this work will not admit of their discussion . Already , indeed , have we unduly , perhaps , extended our remarks upon inheritance . The interest and importance of the facts must be our justification . WHY ARE WOMEN REDUNDANT ? It can not be without interest to look into the relative proportion of men and women now living . It will interest us still more to inquire into the reason why one sex preponderates over the other in numbers . This done , we will answer the question ; Is the production of sex at all under the influence of the human will ? The female sex is the more numerous in all thickly populated parts of the world where we have trustworthy statistics . In Austria , England , and Wales , there are nearly one hundred and five women for every one hundred men . In Sweden they are as one hundred and nine to one hundred . In all cities the disproportion is greater than in the country . In London there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in the large towns of Sweden they stand as one hundred and sixteen to one hundred . This is not true , however , of newly-populated regions . The relative difference is reversed in recent and thinly-settled localities . In our Western States , for instance , the number of the men exceeds that of the women . In California they are as three to one ; in Nevada as eight to one ; in Colorado , twenty to one . In the State of Illinois there were , according to a recent United States census , ninety-three thousand more men than women . In Massachusetts , on the contrary , there are between fifty and sixty thousand more women than men . The disproportion of men to women in new countries is due to the disinclination of women to emigrate . They are also unfitted for the hardships of pioneer life . How is this general preponderance in the number of women produced ? Is it because there are more girls born than boys ? Not at all . The statistics of over fifty-eight millions of persons show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every one hundred girls . In the state of Rhode Island , for instance , the proportion for three years , from 1853 to 1855 , was one thousand and sixty-four boys born to one thousand girls . But now we meet with the wonderful arrangement of nature , that a larger proportional number of male infants die during the first year of their lives than of females . In the second year , the mortality , though less excessive , still remains far greater on the male side . It subsequently decreases , and at the age of four or five years is nearly equal for both sexes . In after life , from the age of fifteen to forty , the mortality is something greater among women , but not sufficiently so to make the number of the two sexes equal . The greater tendency of male offspring to die early is seen even before birth , for more male children are still-born than female ,  --  namely , as three to two . For this reason , the term ' the stronger sex , ' applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misnomer . They are physically weaker in early life , and succumb more readily to noxious influences . Having thus pointed out that there are more women actually living in the world than men , although a larger number of boys are born than girls , we will consider for a moment some of the laws of nature which determine the number of the sexes . Without giving the figures ,  --  which would make dry reading ,  --  we will state in brief the conclusions derived from many observations , extending over many years and many nationalities . The relative age of the parents has an especial influence upon the sex of the children . Seniority on the father 's side gives excess of male offspring . Equality in the parents ' age gives a slight preponderance of female offspring . Seniority on the mother 's side gives excess of female offspring . This tallies with the fact that in all civilized countries , as has been stated , the proportion of male births is greater than that of females ; for , in accordance with the customs of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A curious instance , in confirmation of this law , has recently come under our observation . A patient , married for the second time , is ten years older than her husband . She has two children by him , both girls . Singular to relate , her former husband was ten years older than herself , and by him she had four children , of whom three were boys , the fourth ( a girl ) having a twin brother . Still , the relative age is not the sole cause which fixes the sex of the child . Its operation is sometimes overruled by conflicting agencies . In some districts of Norway , for example , there has been a constant deficiency in boys , while in others the reverse has been the case . The circumstance is well known , that after great wars , and sometimes epidemics , in which a disproportionate number of men have died , more boys are born than usual . Men who pass a sedentary life , and especially scholars who exhaust their nervous force to a great extent , beget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very advanced age on the man 's side diminishes the number of males among the offspring . The quantity and the quality of the food ; the elevation of the abode ; the conditions of temperature ; the parents ' mode of life , rank , religious belief , frequency of sexual intercourse ,  --  have all been shown to be causes contributing to the disproportion of the sexes , besides the relative ages of the parents . Some writers have stated that a southerly or warm and humid constitution of the year is most favorable to the birth of female infants , while in cold and dry years most males are produced . This statement has not been supported by trustworthy statistics in regard to the human race , but in respect of domestic animals the agriculturists of France have long observed that the season has much to do with the sex . When the weather is dry and cold , and the wind northerly , mares , ewes , and heifers produce more males than when the opposite meteorological condition prevails . The saying among nurses , that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based upon the erroneous supposition that mothers bring forth more male infants in one year than in another . That , however , which concerns us the most in this connection , is the question : CAN THE SEXES BE PRODUCED AT WILL ? This question was asked many centuries ago . It was a hard one , and remained without a satisfactory answer until quite recently . Science has at last replied to it with authority . M. Thury , Professor in the Academy of Geneva , has shown how males and females may be produced in accordance with our wishes . Some families are most anxious for male offspring , others ardently desire daughters . And would it not often be a matter of national concern to control the percentage of sexes in the population ? Is it not a ' consummation most devoutly to be wished , ' to bring about that Utopian condition when there would be no sighing maids at home , nor want of warriors in the field ? The discussion of this subject is therefore important and allowable . It has been observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards . So with hens : the first-laid eggs give female , the last male products . Mares shown the stallion late in their periods , drop horse-colts rather than fillies . Professor Thury , from the consideration of these and other like facts , formed this law for stock-raisers : ' If you wish to produce females , give the male at the first signs of heat ; if you wish males , give him at the end of the heat . ' But it is easy to form a theory . How was this law sustained in practice ? We have now in our possession the certificate of a Swiss stock-grower , son of the President of the Swiss Agricultural Society , Canton de Vaud , under date of February 1867 , which says : ' In the first place , on twenty-two successive occasions I desired to have heifers . My cows were of Schurtz breed , and my bull a pure Durham . I succeeded in these cases . Having bought a pure Durham cow , it was very important for me to have a new bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense , without leaving to chance the production of a male . So I followed accordingly the prescription of Professor Thury , and the success has proved once more the truth of the law . I have obtained from my Durham bull six more bulls ( Schurtz-Durham cross ) for fieldwork ; and having chosen cows of the same color and height , I obtained perfect matches of oxen . My herd amounted to forty cows of every age . ' In short , I have made in all twenty-nine experiments after the new method , and in every one I succeeded in the production of what I was looking for  --  male and female . I had not one single failure . All the experiments have been made by myself , without any other person 's intervention ; consequently , I do declare that I consider as real and certainly perfect the method of Professor Thury . ' A perfectly trustworthy observer communicates by the Medical and Surgical Reporter of Philadelphia for May 2 , 1868 , the results of similar experiments on animals , with like conclusions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late Emperor of the French , with , it is asserted , the most unvarying success . What is the result of the application of this law to the human race ? Dr. F. J. W. Packman , of Wimborne , has stated in the Lancet , that , ' in the human female , conception in the first half of the time between menstrual periods produces female offspring , and male in the latter . When a female has gone beyond the time she calculated upon , it will generally turn out to be a boy . ' In the Philadelphia Medical and Surgical Reporter for February 8 , 1868 , a respectable physician writes that , in numerous instances that have come under his observation , Professor Thury 's theory has proved correct , ' Whenever intercourse has taken place in from two to six days after the cessation of the menses , girls have been produced ; and whenever intercourse has taken place in from nine to twelve days after the cessation of the menses , boys have been produced . In every case I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception , but also the time when the menses ceased , the date of the first and subsequent intercourse for a month or more after the cessation of the menses , ' etc . Again , a physician writes to the same journal for June 20 , 1868 , recording the result of his own experience . A farmer in Louisiana states , in the Turf , Field , and Farm , in support of this law , that ' I have already been able in many cases to guess with certainty the sex of a future infant . More than thirty times , among my friends , I have predicted the sex of a child before its birth , and the event proved nearly every time that I was right . ' The wife , therefore , who would wish , as Macbeth desired of his , to ' Bring forth men-children only , ' should avoid exposing herself to conception during the early part of the time between her menstrual periods . The prediction of the sex of the child before birth can now be with some accuracy made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so will be mentioned in treating of pregnancy . TWIN-BEARING . As a rule , a woman has one child at a time . Twins , when they occur , are looked upon with disfavor by most people . There is a popular notion that they are apt to be wanting in physical and mental vigor . This opinion is not without foundation . A careful scientific examination of the subject has shown , that of imbeciles and idiots a much larger proportion is actually found among the twins born than in the general community . In families where twinning is frequent , bodily deformities likewise occur with frequency . Among the relatives of imbeciles and idiots , twin-bearing is common . In fact , the whole history of twin-births is of an exceptional character , indicating imperfect development and feeble organization in the product , and leading us to regard twins in the human species as a departure from the physiological rule , and therefore injurious to all concerned . Monsters born without brains have rarely occurred except among twins . The birth of twins occurs once in about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no children than to have more than one at a time . In view of the increased danger to both mother and child , this rarity of a plural birth is fortunate . WHY ARE TWINS BORN ? What are the causes or favouring circumstances bringing about this abnormal child-bearing ? For it is brought about by the operation of laws . It is not an accident . There are no accidents in nature . By some it is supposed to be due to the mother , by some to the father . There are facts in favour of both opinions . Certain women married successively to several men have always had twins , while their husbands with other wives have determined single births . Certain men have presented the same phenomenon . We can scarcely cite an example more astonishing than that of a countryman who was presented to the Empress of Russia in 1755 . He had had two wives . The first had fifty-seven children in twenty-one confinements ; the second , thirty-three in thirteen . All the confinements had been quadruple , triple , or double . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bearing of twins has seemed to be due to a constitutional cause . The wife has nine children . The first was a single birth , a girl ; the others were all twin-births , and boys . It has been asserted that compound pregnancies are more frequent in certain years than in others . But that which seems to exert the greatest actual influence over the production of twins is the age of the mother . Very extensive statistics have demonstrated that , from the earliest child-bearing period until the age of forty is reached , the fertility of mothers in twins gradually increases . Between the ages of twenty and thirty , fewest wives have twins . The average age of the twin-bearer is older than the general run of bearers . It is well known that by far the greater number of twins are born of elderly women . While three-fifths of all births occur among women under thirty years of age , three-fifths of all the twins are born to those over thirty years of age . Newly-married women are more likely to have twins at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a young wife from fifteen to nineteen shall bear twins is only as one to one hundred and eighty-nine ; from thirty-five to thirty-nine the chance is as one to forty-five ,  --  that is , the wives married youngest have fewest twins ; and there is an increase as age advances , until forty is reached . Race seems to have some influence over plural births . They occur relatively oftener among the Irish than among the English . INFLUENCE OF TWIN-BEARING ON SIZE OF FAMILIES . Do women bearing twins have in the end larger families than those never having but one at a time ? Popular belief would answer this question in the affirmative . Such a reply would also seem to receive support from the fact , well established , that twins are more frequently additions to an already considerable family than they are either the first of a family or additional to a small family . But statistics have not answered this question as yet positively . They seem , however , in favour of the supposition that twin-bearing women have larger families than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first pregnancy than any other , but after the second confinement the bearing of twins increases in frequency with the number of the pregnancy . It becomes , therefore , an indication of an excessive family , and is to be deplored . MORE THAN TWO CHILDREN AT A BIRTH . Cases of the birth of more than two children at a time are still less frequently met with than twins . They are scarcely ever encountered , excepting in women who have passed their thirtieth year . Such cases are all more or less unfortunate both for the mother and the children . THREE AT A BIRTH . The births of triplets are not exclusively confined to women above thirty years , but in those younger they are so rare as to be great curiosities . Neither are they apt to occur in the first pregnancy . In this respect they differ from twins , who , as has just been said , are peculiarly prone to make their appearance at the first childbirth . Only four cases of treble births occurred among the 36,000 accouchements which have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined time . Out of 48,000 cases of labor in the Royal Maternity Charity in London , only three triplets occurred . History informs us that the three Roman brothers , the Horatii , were triplets . They fought and conquered the three Curiatii of Alba ( 667 B. C. ) who were likewise triplets . As an interesting fact in connection with this subject , we may mention that in the St. Petersburg Midwives ' Institute , between 1845-59 , there were three women admitted , who , in their fifteenth pregnancies , had triplets , and each had triplets three times in succession . Happily , the fifteenth pregnancy is not reached by most women . FOUR AT A BIRTH . Instances of quadruplets are fewer than triplets . But four vigorous infants have been born at one birth . FIVE AT A BIRTH . The birth of five living children at a time is very exceptional , and is usually fatal to the offspring . A remarkable case of this kind is reported in a late medical journal . A woman aged thirty , the wife of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in labor about the seventh month of her pregnancy . Five children , and all alive , were given birth to ,  --  three boys and two girls . Four of the children survived an hour , and died within a few moments of each other . The fifth , a female , and the last born , lived six hours , and was so vigorous that , notwithstanding its diminutive size , hopes were entertained of its surviving . Another case is reported in a recent French medical journal . The woman was forty years old . She had had twins once , and single children five times . On her seventh pregnancy , when five months gone , she was as large as women usually are at the end of their full term . At the close of the month she was delivered of five children . They were all born alive , and lived from four to seven minutes . All five children were males , well built and as well developed as foetuses of five and one-half months usually are in a single birth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a birth might be quoted . They are known to medical science as very singular and noteworthy occurrences . INCREDIBLE NUMBERS . Some books speak of seven , eight , nine , ten , and more , children at a birth . But these statements are so marvelous , so incredible , and unsupported by proper testimony , that they do not merit any degree of confidence . The climax of such extraordinary assertions is reached , and a good illustration of the credulity of the seventeenth century furnished , by a writer named Goftr . This traveller , in 1630 , saw a tablet in a church at Leusdown ( Lausdunum ) , about five miles from the Hague , with an inscription stating that a certain illustrious countess , whose name and family he records , brought forth at one birth , in the fortieth year of her age , in the year 1276 , 365 infants . They were all baptized by Guido , the Suffragan . The males were called John , and the females Elizabeth . They all , with their mother , died on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . This monstrous birth was said to have been caused by the sin of the countess in insulting a poor woman with twins in her arms , who prayed that her insulter might have at one birth the same number of children as there were days in the year . Of course , notwithstanding the story being attested by a tablet in a church , it must be placed among the many other instances of superstition afforded by an ignorant and credulous era . We may remark , in closing this subject , that fewer plural births come to maturity than pregnancies with single children . Miscarriages are comparatively more frequent in such pregnancies than in ordinary ones . PREGNANCY VENERATION FOR THE PREGNANT . We have been considering woman hitherto as maiden and wife . She now approaches the sacred threshold of maternity . She is with child . In no period of her life is she the subject of an interest so profound and general . The young virgin and the new wife have pleased by their grace , spirit , and beauty . The pregnant wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting to note how , at all times and in all countries , she has been treated with considerate kindness and great deference . She has been made the subject of public veneration , and sometimes even of religious worship . At Athens and at Carthage the murderer escaped from the sword of justice if he sought refuge in the house of a pregnant woman . The Jews allowed her to eat forbidden meats . The laws of Moses pronounced the penalty of death against all those who by bad treatment or any act of violence caused a woman to abort . Lycurgus compared women who died in pregnancy to the brave dead on the field of honour , and accorded to them sepulchral inscriptions . In ancient Rome , where all citizens were obliged to rise and stand during the passage of a magistrate , wives were excused from rendering this mark of respect , for the reason that the exertion and hurry of the movement might be injurious to them in the state in which they were supposed to be . In the kingdom of Pannonia all enceinte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the road was obliged , under penalty of a fine , to turn back and accompany and protect her to her place of destination . The Catholic Church has in all times exempted pregnant wives from fasts . The Egyptians decreed , and in most Christian countries the law at the present time obtains , that if a woman shall be convicted of an offence the punishment of which is death , the sentence shall not be executed if it be proved that she is pregnant . SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY . 1 . The sign most commonly relied upon is the cessation of the monthly sickness . The wife who misses the expected return of her illness , is apt to conclude that conception has taken place . This sign is far from being an infallible one . It should be borne in mind that young married women sometimes have a slight show for two or three periods after their first impregnation . Ignorance of this fact has very frequently led to a miscalculation of the time of confinement . On the other hand , the menses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for one or two months , without there existing any pregnancy . The temporary disappearance of the monthly sickness in such cases is due to the profound impression made upon the system by the new relations of the individual . It not unfrequently happens that menstruation continues with regularity during the whole period of pregnancy . Exceptional cases are given by distinguished writers on midwifery , of women menstruating during their pregnancy , and at no other time . As a general rule , when a healthy wife misses her monthly sickness , she is pregnant . But this symptom , though a strong one , must be supported by others before it can be regarded as establishing anything . 2 . Morning sickness is a very common , a very early , and , in the opinion of most mothers , a very conclusive symptom of pregnancy . We have already had occasion to remark that it sometimes makes its appearance almost simultaneously with conception . It usually comes on in the first few weeks , and continues until the third or fourth month or until quickening . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vomiting is slight , and immediately followed by relief . But it may produce violent and ineffectual straining for some time . It is , however , not to be called a disease : unless it proceeds to an exhausting degree , it must be looked upon as favorable and salutary . There is an old and true proverb , that ' a sick pregnancy is a safe one . ' The absence of nausea and vomiting is a source of danger to the mother and child . Women who habitually fail to experience them , are exceedingly apt to miscarry . In such cases medical skill should be invoked to bring about the return of these symptoms , of such importance to healthful pregnancy . Morning sickness is therefore a very general , almost constant , accompaniment of the pregnant condition ; and great dependence may be placed upon it as a sign . 3 . Changes in the breasts are valuable as symptoms . They become larger and firmer , and the seat of a pricking or stinging sensation . The nipples are swollen , prominent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear more conspicuous , and of a deeper blue than ordinary . The peculiar circles of rose-coloured skin which surround the nipples increase in extent , change to a darker color , and become covered with a number of little elevations . Subsequently , numerous mottled patches , or round spots of a whitish hue , scatter themselves over the outer part of this circle . The time at which these changes make their appearance is variable . They may begin to develope themselves in two or three weeks , oftener not until the second or third month , and in women of a delicate build , sometimes not until the latter end of pregnancy . Occasionally no alteration whatever occurs in the breasts until after confinement , in which cases the secretion of milk is delayed for several days after the birth of the child . In some rare instances the breasts never assume maternal proportions , and the mother is debarred from the pleasure and duty of nursing her own child . 4 . Quickening is the next symptom we will consider . By this term is meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the movements of the child of its presence . The ancients thought that then life was imparted to the new being . Modern physiology emphatically condemns this absurdity . The embryo is as much alive in the very earliest moments of pregnancy as at any future stage of its existence . Let every woman therefore remember that she who produces abortion is equally guilty in the eyes of science and of Heaven , whether the act be committed before or after the period of quickening . How is quickening produced ? Undoubtedly by the movements of the child . So soon as its nervous and muscular systems become sufficiently developed to enable it to move its limbs , the mother , if the movements be sufficiently active , is rendered sensible of her situation . But the muscular contractions may not be strong enough to impart any sensation to the mother . In many cases in which they are too feeble to be noticed by herself , the skilled accoucheur is capable of recognizing them . And the movements of the foetus may be excited in various ways known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the middle of pregnancy , near the eighteenth week . Some women feel the movements of the foetus as early as the third month of pregnancy , others not till the sixth month . Cases occur in which no movement whatever is felt until the eighth or ninth month , or even not at all . It has been suggested that a foetus which does not indicate its presence in this way is a kind of ' Lazy Lawrence , ' too indolent to move . Certainly , many of both sexes exhibit after birth such indomitable love of repose , that it can readily be supposed they were equally passive in foetal life . The non-occurrence of this sign may , however , be due to the debility of the young child , or to a want of sensibility in the walls of the womb itself . A woman may be deceived , and suppose she has quickened , when her sensations are to be traced to flatulence of the bowels , or perhaps a dropsical effusion . Many ludicrous instances of self-deception are on record . The historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have issue , so confidently asserted that she felt the movements of the child , that public proclamation was made of the interesting event . Despatches were sent to foreign courts ; national rejoicings were had ; the sex of the child was settled , for everybody was certain it was going to be a male ; and Bonner , Bishop of London , made public prayers , saying that Heaven would pledge to make him beautiful , vigorous , and witty . But all those high hopes and eager expectations were destined never to be realized . The future disclosed that the supposed quickening was merely a consequence of disordered health , and commencing dropsy . Some women possess the power of imitating the movements of a foetus , by voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles . A well-known colored woman of Charleston , ' Aunt Betty , ' had a great reputation as having ' been pregnant for fifteen years . ' She made a good deal of money , by exhibiting to physicians and medical students who were curious , the pretended movements of her unborn child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . No pregnancy existed , as was revealed by a post-mortem examination . She imposed upon the credulous by the habit she had acquired of jerking her muscles at pleasure , and thus closely simulating the movements of an embryo. 5 . Changes in the abdomen.  --  In the first two months of pregnancy the abdomen is less prominent than usual : it recedes , and presents a flat appearance . The navel is also drawn in and depressed . About the third month a swelling frequently shows itself in the lower part of the abdomen , and then diminishes , thus leading the wife to suppose that she was mistaken in her condition , for she finds herself at the fourth month smaller than at the third . After this , however , there is a gradual increase in the size and hardness of the abdomen . What is of more value , is the peculiar form of the swelling . It is pear-shaped , and is thus distinguished from the swelling of dropsy and other affections . The navel begins to come forward , and finally protrudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this connection it may be remarked that , towards the change of life , childless married women often think they perceive that ' hope deferred ' is about to be gratified . An enlargement of the abdomen takes place at this time , from a deposit of fatty matter . The nervous perturbations and the cessation of the menses , which are natural to this period , are looked upon as confirmations of the opinion that pregnancy exists . But the day of generation with them has passed . These symptoms herald the approach of the winter of life , which brings with it death to the reproductive system . 6 . Changes in the skin.  --  The alterations occurring in the skin are worth observing . Those women who have a delicate complexion and are naturally pale take a high color , and vice versa . In some cases a considerable quantity of hair appears on those parts of the face occupied by the beard in men ; it disappears after labor , and returns on every subsequent pregnancy . Oftentimes the skin becomes loose and wrinkled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoiling good looks . Women who ordinarily perspire freely , have now a dry , rough skin ; whereas those whose skin is not naturally moist , have copious perspiration , which may be of a peculiarly strong odor . Copper-colored or yellow blotches sometimes appear upon the skin , mole spots become darker and larger , and a dark ring developes itself beneath the eyes . The whole appearance is thus in many cases altered . On the other hand , obstinate , long-existing skin affections sometimes take their departure during pregnancy , perhaps never to return . These alterations do not occur in all women , nor in all pregnancies of the same woman . 7 . We may now group together a number of less important and less constant signs , such as depraved appetite , longings for unnatural food , excessive formation of saliva in the mouth , heartburn , loss of appetite in the first two or three months , succeeded by a voracious desire for food , which sometimes compels the woman to rise at night in order to eat , toothache , sleepiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right side , etc . These , when they occur singly , are of little value as evidence . Among these , that of depraved appetite is by far the most important , and may be regarded as quite significant . A married woman in her ordinary health , suddenly feeling this morbid taste for chalk , charcoal , slate pencil , and other unusual articles of food , may look upon it as a strong presumptive evidence of impregnation . When any or all of this group of symptoms accompany the ceasing to be ' regular , ' the morning sickness , the changes in the breasts and the other signs which have been enumerated , the wife may be quite sure that she is pregnant . 8 . Changes in the mind.  --  The most wonderful of all the changes which attend pregnancy are those in the nervous system . The woman is rendered more susceptible , more impressible . Her character is transformed . She is no longer pleasant , confiding , gentle , and gay . She becomes hasty , passionate , jealous , and bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change for the better is sometimes observed , so that the members of the household learn from experience to hail with delight the mother 's pregnancy as a period when clouds and storms give place to sunshine and quietness . In some rare cases , also , pregnancy confers increased force and elevation to the ideas , and augmented power to the intellect . As this book is written for women only , we do not mention any of the signs or symptoms of pregnancy which medical men alone can recognize . We will merely state that there are many other signs besides these referred to , of great value to the doctor . One , the sound of the heart of the child , which the practised ear can detect at about the fifth month , is positive and conclusive . MISCARRIAGE . Miscarriage is a fruitful source of disease , and often of danger , to wives . It also causes a frightful waste of human life . Unborn thousands annually die in this manner . Frequency.  --  Miscarriage is by no means a rare occurrence . Statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they attain the age of thirty years . But this accident is much more apt to occur during the latter than during the first half of the child-bearing period ; and therefore it is estimated that ninety out of one hundred of all women who continue in matrimony until the change of life , miscarry . Influence of age of mother.  --  A woman who marries at forty is very much disposed to miscarry ; whereas , had she married at thirty , she might have borne children when older than forty . As a mother approaches the end of her child-bearing period , it is likely that she will terminate her career of fertility with a premature birth . The last pregnancies are not only most commonly unsuccessful , but there is also reason to believe that the occurrence of idiocy in a child may be associated with the circumstance of its being the last-born of its mother . It has been asserted , in this connection , that men of genius are frequently the first-born . First pregnancies are also fraught with the danger of miscarriage , which occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest . A woman is particularly apt to miscarry with her first child , if she be either exceedingly nervous or full-blooded . Influence of period of pregnancy.  --  Miscarriage is most frequent in the earlier months of pregnancy  --  from the first to the third . It is also very prone to happen about the sixth month . Habit makes itself felt here ; for women who have many times experienced this sad accident , encounter it nearly always at the same epoch of their pregnancy . How early can the child live ?  --  The infant is incapable , as a rule , of an independent existence , if brought into the world before the end of the sixth month . The law of France regards a child born one hundred and eighty days after wedlock as not only capable of living , but as legitimate and worthy of all legal and civil rights . There are many cases mentioned , by the older medical writers , of children born previous to this period living . One of the most curious is that recorded by Van Swieten . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth month , in consequence of a fright his mother had at sea . When born , it is said , he was the size of a hand , and his father placed him in an oven , for the purpose , probably , it has been suggested , of making him rise . Although born prematurely , he died late , for we are told that he attained his seventy-ninth year . Professor Gunning S. Bedford of New York records the case of a woman in her fourth confinement , who , before she had completed her sixth month , was delivered of a female infant weighing two pounds nine ounces . The surface of the body was of a scarlet hue . It breathed , and in a short time after birth cried freely . After being wrapped in soft cotton , well lubricated with warm sweet-oil , it was fed with the mother 's milk , by having a few drops at a time put into its mouth . At first it had great difficulty in swallowing , but gradually it succeeded in taking sufficient nourishment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mother.  --  Wives are too much in the habit of making light of miscarriages . They are much more frequently followed by disease of the womb than are confinements at full terms . There is a greater amount of injury done to the parts than in natural labor . While after confinement ample time is afforded by a long period of repose for the bruised and lacerated parts to heal , after a miscarriage no such rest is obtained . Menstruation soon returns ; conception may quickly follow . Unhappily , there is no custom requiring husband and wife to sleep apart for a month after a miscarriage , as there is after a confinement . Hence , especially if there be any pre-existing uterine disease , or a predisposition thereto , miscarriage is a serious thing . Causes.  --  The irritation of hemorrhoids or straining at stool will sometimes provoke an early expulsion of a child . Excessive intercourse by the newly married is a very frequent cause . Bathing in the ocean has been known to produce it . Nursing is exceedingly apt to do so . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a given number of instances , miscarriage occurred in seventeen per cent . of cases in which the woman conceived while nursing , and in only ten per cent . where conception occurred at some other time . A wife , therefore , who suspects herself to be pregnant , should wean her child . The extraction of a tooth , over-exertion and over-excitement , a fall , a blow , any violent emotion , such as anger , sudden and excessive joy , or fright , running , dancing , horseback exercise , or riding in a badly-built carriage over a rough road , great fatigue , lifting heavy weights , the abuse of purgative medicines , disease or displacement of the womb , small-pox , or a general condition of ill-health , are all fruitful and well-known exciting causes of this unfortunate mishap , in addition to those which have been before mentioned . Prevention.  --  The eminent practitioner , Dr. Tilt , says , ' The way to prevent miscarriage is to lead a quiet life , particularly during those days of each successive month when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to abstain during those days not only from long walks and parties , but also from sexual intercourse . ' It is especially desirable to avoid a miscarriage in the first pregnancy , for fear that the habit of miscarrying shall then be set up , which it will be very difficult to eradicate . Therefore newly-married women should carefully avoid all causes which are known to induce the premature expulsion of the child . If it should take place in spite of all precautions , extraordinary care should be exercised in the subsequent pregnancy , to prevent its recurrence . Professor Bedford of New York has said he has found that an excellent expedient in such cases is , as soon as pregnancy is known to exist , ' to interdict sexual intercourse until after the fifth month ; for if the pregnancy pass beyond this period , the chances of miscarriage will be much diminished . ' If the symptoms of miscarriage , which may be expressed in the two words pain and flooding , should make their appearance , the doctor ought at once to be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . He may even then be able to avert the impending danger . At any rate , his services are as necessary , and often even more so , as in a labor at full term . MOTHER 'S MARKS . It is a popular belief that the imagination of the mother affects the child in the womb . It is asserted that infants are often born with various marks and deformities corresponding in character with objects which had made a vivid impression on the maternal mind during pregnancy . This is a subject of great practical interest . We shall therefore give it the careful attention which it deserves . We have already discussed the operation of the laws of inheritance . It was then stated that the whole story of maternal influence had not been told  --  that the mother could communicate qualities she never possessed . The potency of imagination at the time of conception over the child has been mentioned . It is now our design to consider its effects , during the period of pregnancy , upon the physical structure and the mental attributes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking of nursing , to illustrate the manner in which the child may be affected by maternal impressions acting through the mother 's milk . What can be more wonderful than this intimate union between the mother and her child ? It is only equaled by that mysterious influence of the husband over the wife , by which he so impresses her system that she often comes in time to resemble him both in mental and physical characteristics , and even transmits his peculiarities to her children by a second marriage . Father , mother , and child are one . We wish here to premise that our remarks will be based upon the conclusions of skilled and scientific observers only , whose position and experience no medical man will question . All the instances to be related are given upon unimpeachable authority . They are not the narrations of ignorant , credulous people ; they are all fully vouched for . We record here , as elsewhere , only the sober utterances of science . The great importance and utility of an acquaintance with them will be patent to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the body is well known . Strong , long-continued mental emotion may induce or cure disease . Heart disease may be produced by a morbid direction of the thoughts to that organ . Warts disappear under the operation of a strong belief in the efficacy of some nonsensical application . In olden time , scrofula , or the ' king 's evil ' , was cured by the touch of the king . The mind of the patient , of course , accomplished the cure . Under the influence of profound mental emotion , the hair of the beautiful Marie Antoinette became white in a short time . During the solitary voyage of Madame Condamine down the wild and lonely Amazon , a similar change took place . Many other instances might be adduced ; but those given are sufficient to show that strong and persistent mental impressions will exert a mysterious transforming power over the body . These facts will pave the way to the consideration of corresponding effects , through the mother 's mind , upon the development of the unborn child , forming a part of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and color of infant.  --  There are numerous facts on record which prove that habitual , long-continued mental conditions of the mother at an early period of pregnancy , induce deformity or other abnormal development of the infant . Professor William A. Hammond of New York relates the following striking case , which occurred in his own experience , and which scarcely admits of a doubt as to the influence of the maternal mind over the physical structure of the foetus . A lady in the third month of her pregnancy was very much horrified by her husband being brought home one evening with a severe wound of the face , from which the blood was streaming . The shock to her was so great that she fainted , and subsequently had a hysterical attack , during which she was under Dr. Hammond 's care . Soon after her recovery she told him that she was afraid her child would be affected in some way , and that even then she could not get rid of the impression the sight of her husband 's bloody face had made upon her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . She had a dark red mark upon the face , corresponding in situation and extent with that which had been upon her father 's face . She also proved to be idiotic . Professor Dalton of New York states that the wife of the janitor of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of that city , during her pregnancy , dreamed that she saw a man who had lost a part of the ear . The dream made a great impression upon her mind , and she mentioned it to her husband . When her child was born , a portion of one ear was deficient , and the organ was exactly like the defective ear she had seen in her dream . When Professor Dalton was lecturing upon the development of the foetus as affected by the mind of the mother , the janitor called his attention to the foregoing instance . The ear looks exactly as if a portion had been cut off with a sharp knife . Professor J. Lewis Smith of Bellevue Hospital Medical College , New York , has met with the following cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was passing along a street , in the first months of her pregnancy , when she was accosted by a beggar , who raised her hand , destitute of thumb and fingers , and in ' God 's name ' asked for alms . The woman passed on , but , reflecting in whose name money was asked , felt that she had committed a great sin in refusing assistance . She returned to the place where she had met the beggar , and on different days , but never afterwards saw her . Harassed by the thought of her imaginary sin , so that for weeks , according to her statement , she was distressed by it , she approached her confinement . A female infant was born , otherwise perfect , but lacking the fingers and thumb of one hand . The deformed limb was on the same side , and it seemed to the mother to resemble precisely that of the beggar . In another case which Professor Smith met , a very similar malformation was attributed by the mother of the child to an accident occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near relative , which necessitated amputation . He examined both of these children with defective limbs , and has no doubt of the truthfulness of the parents . In May , 1868 , he removed a supernumerary thumb from an infant , whose mother , a baker 's wife , gave the following history :  --  No one of the family , and no ancestor , to her knowledge , presented this deformity . In the early months of her pregnancy she sold bread from the counter , and nearly every day a child with a double thumb came in for a penny roll , presenting the penny between the thumb and the finger . After the third month she left the bakery , but the malformation was so impressed upon her mind , that she was not surprised to see it reproduced in her infant . In all these cases the impression was produced in the early months of pregnancy ; but many have been recorded in which malformations in the infant appeared distinctly traceable to strong mental emotions of the mother only a few months previous to confinement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pregnancy , and giving rise to a full expectation on the part of the mother that the child would be affected in the particular manner which actually occurred . Professor Carpenter , the distinguished physiologist , is personally cognisant of a very striking case of the kind which occurred in the family of a near connection of his own . All the above instances have been those of the effects of persistent mental emotion . But it is also true that violent and sudden emotion in the mother leaves sometimes its impress upon the unborn infant , although it may be quickly forgotten . It is related on good authority that a lady , who during her pregnancy was struck with the unpleasant view of leeches applied to a relative 's foot , gave birth to a child with the mark of a leech coiled up in the act of suction on the intended spot . Dr. Delacoux of Paris says that , in the month of January 1825 , he was called to attend a woman in the village of Batignoles , near Paris , who the evening before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horribly deformed . The upper lip was in a confused mass with the jaw and the gums , and the right leg was amputated at the middle , the stump having the form of a cone . The mother of this being , who was a cook , one morning , about the third month of her pregnancy , on entering the house where she was employed , was seized with horror at the sight of a porter with a hare-lip and an amputated leg . At a meeting of the Society of Physicians at Berlin , in August 1868 , Herr Dupre stated that a woman saw , in the first weeks of her third pregnancy , a boy with a hare-lip ; and not only was the child she then carried born with a frightful hare-lip , but also three children subsequently . Another one , a woman in the fifth week of pregnancy , saw a sheep wounded , and with its bowels protruding . She was greatly shocked , and did not recover her composure for several days . She was delivered at term of a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of the abdomen . Many remarkable instances have been collected of the power of imagination over the unborn offspring . Ambrose Pare , the illustrious French surgeon of the sixteenth century , in one of his treatises devotes a chapter to the subject of ' monsters which take their cause and shape from imagination , ' and was evidently a strong believer in this influence . A black child is generally believed to have been born to Marie Therese , the wife of Louis XIV. , in consequence of a little negro page in her service having started from a hiding-place and stumbled over her dress early in her pregnancy . This child was educated at the convent of Moret , near Fontainebleau , where she took the veil , and where , till the shock of the Revolution , her portrait was shown . Examples are given by authors of the force of desires in causing deformities in infants , and the formation upon them of fruits , such as apples , pears , grapes , and others , which the mother may have longed for . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave birth to a child with a large cluster of globular tumours growing from the tongue , and preventing the closure of the mouth , in color , shape , and size exactly resembling our common grapes ; and with a red excrescence from the chest , as exactly resembling in figure and appearance a turkey 's wattles . On being questioned before the child was shown to her , she answered , that while pregnant she had seen some grapes , longed intensely for them , and constantly thought of them ; and that she was also once attacked and much alarmed by a turkey-cock . Dr. Demangeon of Paris quotes , in his work on the Imagination , the Journal de Verdun , as mentioning the case of a child , born at Blois , in the eyes of which the face of a watch was distinctly seen . The image was situated around the pupil , and the figures representing the hours were plainly perceived . The mother had experienced a strong desire to see a watch while she was pregnant with this child . Professor Dalton says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now little room for doubt that various deformities and deficiencies of the foetus , conformably to the popular belief , do really originate in certain cases from nervous impressions , such as disgust , fear , or anger , experienced by the mother . ' We will now consider the Influence of the mind of the mother on the mind of the infant ; which subject we have not yet touched upon , having confined ourselves to the influence of the maternal mind over the form and color of the unborn child . It will not be necessary to illustrate at length this branch of our topic . Instances are sufficiently common and well known . Dr. Seguin of New York , in his work on Idiocy , gives several cases in which there was reason to believe that fright , anxiety , or other emotions in the mother , had produced idiocy in the offspring . As he remarks , ' Impressions will sometimes reach the foetus in its recess , cut off its legs or arms , or inflict large flesh wounds before birth ,  --  inexplicable as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds unknown though certain relations to maternal impressions . ' We have given many strong cases and most excellent authority for the doctrine that the purely mental influence of the mother may produce bodily and mental changes in the unborn infant . But the child is also affected by physical impressions made upon the mother . Dr. Russegger reports that a woman , who had already borne four healthy children , was , in the seventh month of her pregnancy , bitten in the right calf by a dog . The author saw the wound made by the animal 's teeth , which wound consisted of three small triangular depressions , by two of which the skin was only slightly ruffled ; a slight appearance of blood was perceptible in the third . The woman was at the moment of the accident somewhat alarmed , but neither then nor afterwards had any fear that her foetus would be affected by the occurrence . Ten weeks after she was bitten , the woman bore a healthy child , which , however , to the surprise of every person , had three marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog 's teeth in the mother 's leg , and consisting , like those , of one large and two smaller impressions . The two latter , which were pale , disappeared in five weeks ; the larger one had also become less , and was not so deep colored as it was at birth . At the time of writing , the child was four months old . Dr. S. P. Crawford of Greenville , Tennessee , reports in a recent number of the Nashville Journal of Medicine , the following sad case :  --  A lady , in the last stage of pregnancy , was burned by the explosion of a kerosene-oil can . She lived twelve hours after the accident . The face , legs , arms , and abdomen were badly burned . The movements of the child were felt three or four hours after the accident . A short time before the death of the mother she gave birth to the child at full maturity , but still-born . It bore the mark of the fire corresponding to that of the mother . Its legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of a recent burn . These instances of a decided influence exerted upon the body and mind of the child in the womb , by physical and mental impressions made upon the mother , might be doubled or trebled . They are as numerous as they are wonderful . Physiologists of the present day do not hesitate to admit the existence of the influence we have been discussing . Reason also comes to the support of facts , to demonstrate and establish its reality . For , if a sudden and powerful emotion of the mind can so disturb the stomach and heart as to cause vomiting and fainting , is it not probable that it can affect the womb and the impressible being within it ? Pregnancy is a function of the woman as much as digestion or pulsation of the heart ; and if the latter are controlled by moral and mental impressions , why should not the former be also ? In what manner does this influence of the maternal mind act ?  --  Through the blood of the mother . Only a very delicate membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infant in her womb . There is a constant interchange of the blood in its body with that in hers through this exceedingly thin membrane ; and thus all nervous impressions which have produced an alteration of either a temporary or permanent character in the circulating fluid of the mother , are communicated to the child . Since the mother , as has been shown , can transmit through her blood certain characteristics of mind and body not her own ,  --  for instance , a disease peculiar to a male from her father to her son , or the physical and mental traits of her first husband to the children by her second ,  --  it does not seem at all strange that she should through this same medium , her blood , impart other peculiarities which have made a strong impression upon her mind . Anatomy and physiology therefore fully explain and account for this seemingly mysterious influence . The view here stated , and indorsed by modern science , is one which ought to have great weight with the mother , her relatives and friends . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy there is unusual susceptibility to mental impressions , and as these impressions may operate on the fragile structure of the unborn being , this tendency should be well considered and constantly remembered , not only by the woman herself , but by all those who associate or are thrown in contact with her . Upon the care displayed in the management of the corporeal and mental health of the mother during the whole period of pregnancy , the ultimate constitution of the offspring greatly depends . All the surroundings and employments of the pregnant woman should be such as conduce to cheerfulness and equanimity . Above all , she should avoid the presence of disagreeable and unsightly objects . Vivid and unpleasant impressions should be removed as soon as possible by quiet diversion of the mind . All causes of excitement should be carefully guarded against . In leaving the subject of maternal impressions , we will call attention to the manifest difference in extent and degree between the influence of the father and that of the mother over the offspring . That of the father ceases with impregnation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy , and , as we shall shortly see , even during that of nursing . EDUCATION OF THE CHILD IN THE WOMB . The outlines drawn by the artist Flaxman are esteemed the most perfect and graceful in existence . From earliest childhood he manifested a delight in drawing . His mother , a woman of refined and artistic tastes , used to relate that for months previous to his birth she spent hours daily studying engravings , and fixing in her memory the most beautiful proportions of the human figure as portrayed by masters . She was convinced that the genius of her son was the fruit of her own self-culture . What a charming idea is this ! What an incentive to those about to become mothers , to cultivate refinement , high thoughts , pure emotions , elevated sentiments ! Thus they endow their children with what no after education can give them . The plastic brain of the foetus is prompt to receive all impressions . It retains them , and they become the characteristics of the child and the man . Low spirits , violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leave indelible marks on the unborn child . So do their contraries ; and thus it becomes of the utmost moment that during this period all that is cheerful , inspiring , and elevating should surround the woman . Such emotions educate the child : they form its disposition , they shape its faculties , they create its mental and intellectual traits . Of all education , this is the most momentous . CAN A WOMAN BECOME AGAIN PREGNANT DURING PREGNANCY ? Can a woman during pregnancy conceive , and add a second and younger child to that already in the womb ? It is not uncommon in the canine race for a mother to give birth at the same time to dogs of different species , showing conclusively the possibility , in these animals , of one conception closely following another . So a mare has been known to produce within a quarter of an hour , first a horse , and then a mule . And in the human race cases are on record in which women have had twins , of which the one was white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same day with men of those two races . Dr. Henry relates that in Brazil a Creole woman , a native , brought into the world at one birth three children of three different colors ,  --  white , brown , and black ,  --  each child exhibiting the features peculiar to the respective races . In all such instances the two conceptions followed each other very rapidly , the offspring arriving at maturity together , and being born at the same accouchement . But more curious and wonderful examples of second and concurrent pregnancies have been published than these  --  as , for instance , those in which a child bearing all the attributes of a foetus at full term is born two , three , four , and even five , months after the first , which appeared also to have been born at full term . Marie Anne Bigaud , aged thirty-seven , gave birth , April 30 , 1748 , to a living boy at full term , and on the ensuing September 16 , to a living girl , which was recognised , by the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been also carried until full term . This fact was observed by Professor Eisenman , and by Leriche , surgeon-major of the military hospital of Strasbourg . It will be noticed that there was an interval of four and a half months between the two accouchements . The first child lived two and a half months , and the second a year . In this instance there was not a double womb , as might perhaps be supposed , for after the mother 's death an examination proved that the uterus was single . Another case of this kind is the following :  --  Benoite Franquet of Lyons brought into the world a girl on January 20 , 1780 , and five months and six days afterwards a second girl , also apparently at term , and well nourished . Two years later these two children were presented , with their certificates of baptism , to two notaries of Lyons , MM . Caillot and Desurgey , in order that the fact might be placed on record and vouched for , because of its value in legal medicine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of fully developed children within from two to five months of each other , can leave no doubt as to the possibility of such an occurrence . The only question which remains is in regard to the periods of conception . Are the two children in such cases twins , conceived at the same time , but the growth of the last-born so retarded that it did not arrive at maturity until a number of months after its fellow ? or , Has a second conception taken place at an interval of several months after the first ? If this latter view be true , then , in the instance of Marie Anne Bigaud , above related , the second child must have been conceived after the first had quickened . Then , also , two children of different ages , the offspring of different fathers , may exist in the womb at the same time . The weight of scientific observation and authority has now established the fact that , in very rare instances , a second conception may take place during pregnancy . It must not be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are born at the same time ,  --  one fully developed , and the other small and apparently prematurely born ,  --  the two were conceived at different times . The smaller may have been blighted and its growth hindered by the same causes which bring about such effects in cases of single births of incompletely developed children . A similar supposition may account for the birth of a second child within a month or two after the first , for the first may have been prematurely born , and the second carried to full term . But no such supposition can explain the cases referred to , and others which might be mentioned , in which the interval has been five or six months , each child presenting every indication of perfect maturity . The only explanation possible in such instances , which , as has been said , are well authenticated , although few in number , is , that a second pregnancy has occurred during the first . The above facts would seem sufficiently wonderful . There are others , however , of the same nature still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second conception , instead of developing independently of the first , has become attached to it , and the phenomenon has been presented of the growth of a child within a child  --  a foetus within a foetus . Such a singular occurrence has been lately recorded in a German journal . A correspondent of the Dantzic Gazette states that on Sunday , February 1 , 1869 , at Schliewen , near Dirschau , ' a young and blooming shepherd 's wife was delivered of a girl , otherwise sound , but having on the lower part of her back , between the hips , a swelling as big as two good-sized fists , through the walls of which a well-developed foetus may be felt . Its limbs indicate a growth of from five to six months , and its movements are very lively . The father called in the health commissioner , Dr. Preuss , from Dirschau , and begged him to remove the swelling together with the foetus . The doctor , however , after a careful examination , declared that there was a possibility in this extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its existence and active motions were palpable to all present . No physician could be justified in destroying this marvelous being . It ought rather to be protected and cherished . The new-born girl , notwithstanding her strange burden , is of unusual strength and beauty , and takes the breast very cheerfully . ' We find something further in regard to this singular birth in the Weser Zeitung of February 20 , 1869 . It quotes from the Dantzic Gazette some remarks by the health commissioner , Dr. Preuss of Dirschau , in which the doctor declares the facts contained in the report given above to be correct . He was summoned on the 1st of February to the child , and saw the vigorous movements , and felt the members of a foetus within the swelling , as described . It was evidently a double creation . The case thus far , though rare , is not unique . ' But what is novel , and hitherto perfectly unnoticed in medical literature , is the fact that not only the girl , which has been carried its full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swelling has also , in the eleven days after birth , further developed , and palpably increased in size . The swelling is now four and a half inches long , three and a half inches wide , and high and pear-shaped ; the head lies underneath on the left , the body towards the right . ' Further particulars and the latest intelligence we have concerning the progress of this case are to the effect that the child was brought by special request before the Natural History Society of Dantzic , and thence the mother went to Berlin for medical advice . MORAL ASPECTS OF THIS QUESTION . Upon proper judgment and discrimination in the application of the facts we have just been dwelling upon , may depend a wife 's honor , and the happiness of the dearest social relations . We will suppose an example . A husband , immediately after the impregnation of his wife , is obliged to quit her , and remains absent a year . In the meanwhile she gives birth to two children , at an interval of a number of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under such circumstances , it is possible for her to do so consistently with conjugal purity . It will be recollected that , in speaking of twins , we remarked that it was not very uncommon for an interval of days or weeks to elapse between the births , and it has just been stated that impregnation during pregnancy is extremely rare . The presumption , therefore , in the case supposed , is as very many to one that the two births were the result of a twin pregnancy . In the absence of any other evidence against the wife 's chastity , it should not even be called in question . This decision receives the support of the maxim in law that a reasonable doubt is the property of the accused , and of the Christian principle that it is better that ninety-nine guilty should escape than that one innocent should be condemned . Hence the teachings of science and of human and divine law all coincide to protect the sacred rights and the precious interests at stake against an unjust suspicion , which even the doctrine of chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOMB ? There are some cases , recorded on undoubted authority , in which the child has been heard to cry while in the womb . These are very exceptional . Under ordinary circumstances , it is impossible for the child either to breathe or cry , because of the absence of air . It is only when the bag of membranes has been torn , and the mouth of the child is applied at or near the neck of the uterus , that this can take place . The infant is not unfrequently heard to cry just before birth , after labor has commenced , but before the extrusion of the head from the womb , in consequence of the penetration of air into the uterine cavity . IS IT A SON OR DAUGHTER ? It is a common saying among nurses , that there is a difference in the size and form of the pregnant woman , according to the sex she carries . This may well be doubted . Neither is it true that one sex is more active in its ' movements ' than the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the sex of the foetus , if she can tell about what time in her month conception took place . If it occurred directly after a monthly sickness , the child is a girl ; if directly before , it is a boy . When a woman is ' out ' in her reckoning , and goes beyond the period of her expected confinement , it will ordinarily turn out to be a boy . The skilful doctor can , in the later months of pregnancy , settle the question of sex in some cases . The beats of the foetal heart are more frequent in females than in males . The average frequency of pulsations of twenty-eight female foetuses has been found to be one hundred and forty-four in the minute , the lowest figure being one hundred and thirty-eight ; of twenty-two male foetuses , one hundred and twenty , the lowest figure being one hundred and twelve . Therefore , when the pulsations of the heart of the child in the womb are counted ,  --  as can easily be done by a practised medical ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be over one hundred and thirty in a minute , it is a daughter ; if under one hundred and thirty , a son . In this manner , the sex of an unborn child can be predicted with tolerable accuracy , excepting only when illness of the foetus has deranged the action of its heart . ARE THERE TWINS PRESENT ? Certain signs lead to the suspicion of twins , such as being unusually large , and the fact that the increase in size has been more than ordinarily rapid . Sometimes also the abdomen is divided into two distinct portions by a perpendicular fissure . In other cases the movements of a child can be felt on each side at the same time . And in twin pregnancies the morning sickness is apt to be more distressing , and all the other discomforts incident to this condition increased . But these signs and symptoms , when present in any given case , are not conclusive , for they may be noticed when there is only one child . The doctor has one characteristic and infallible sign by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins . It is furnished to him again by the art of listening ,  --  or auscultation , as it is technically called ,  --  the same that , as we have already seen , may enable him to determine the sex of the child . When the beatings of two foetal hearts are heard on opposite portions of the abdomen , the nature of the pregnancy is apparent . LENGTH OF PREGNANCY . What is the ordinary duration of pregnancy ? Almost every woman considers herself competent to make the answer  --  nine months . She may be surprised to learn , however , that such an answer is wanting in scientific precision . It is too indefinite , and is erroneous . There is a great difference between the calendar and the lunar month . Each lunar month having twenty-eight days , the period of nine lunar months is two hundred and fifty-two days . Nine calendar months , including February , represent , on the contrary , two hundred and seventy-three days . Now the average duration of pregnancy is two hundred and eighty days , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended observations have shown that as a general rule , forty weeks , or two hundred and eighty days , is the true period of pregnancy , are we justified in the conclusion that this is its invariable duration ? This important question , upon the answer to which so often depend the honor of families , the rights of individuals , and sometimes the interests of nationalities , has been in all times the subject of careful research by physicians , philosophers , and legislators . On the one side , have been those who contend that the laws of nature are invariable , and that the term of pregnancy is fixed and immutable . On the other side , have been those who assert that the epoch of accouchement can be greatly advanced or retarded by various causes , some of which are known , and others not yet appreciated . Abundant and satisfactory testimony has proved that the prolongation of pregnancy beyond the ordinary period of two hundred and eighty days , or forty weeks , is possible . Nor is this contrary to what is observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no process depending upon the laws of life which is absolutely invariable either as to the period of its appearance or duration . It is known , as we have already pointed out , that puberty may be advanced or retarded ; the time at which the change of life occurs in women , as we shall have occasion hereafter to show , is also subject to variation ; and it is a matter of common observation with mothers , that the period of teething is sometimes strangely hurried or delayed . A certain degree of variability , therefore , being frequently observed , and entirely compatible with health , in the various other natural processes , why should that of pregnancy form an exception , and be invariably fixed in its duration ? And observation upon the lower animals affords most convincing evidence that nature is not controlled by any uniform law in reference to the length of pregnancy . In the cow , the usual period of whose pregnancy is the same as in the human female , instances of calving six weeks beyond the ordinary term are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great interest sometimes attaching to the inquiry under discussion , we may cite the celebrated Gardner Peerage Case , tried by the House of Lords in 1825 . Allen Legge Gardner petitioned to have his name inscribed as a peer on the Parliament Roll . He was the son of Lord Gardner by his second wife . There was another claimant for the peerage , however ,  --  Henry Fenton Iadis ,  --  on the ground , as alleged , that he was the son of Lord Gardner by his first and subsequently divorced wife . Medical and moral evidence was adduced to establish that the latter was illegitimate . Lady Gardner , the mother of the alleged illegitimate child , parted from her husband on the 30th of January , 1802 , he going to the West Indies , and not again seeing his wife until the 11th of July following . The child whose legitimacy was called in question was born on the 8th of December of that year . The plain medical query therefore arose , Whether this child born either three hundred and eleven days after intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and fifty days ( from July 11th to December 8th ) , could be the son of Lord Gardner . As there was no pretence that there was a premature birth , the child having been well developed when born , the conception must have dated from January 30th . The medical question was therefore narrowed down to this : Was the alleged protracted pregnancy ( three hundred and eleven days ) consistent with experience ? Sixteen of the principal obstetric practitioners of Great Britain were examined on this point . Eleven concurred in the opinion that natural pregnancy might be protracted to a period which would cover the birth of the alleged illegitimate child . Because , however , of the moral evidence alone , which proved the adulterous intercourse of Lady Gardner with a Mr. Iadis , the House decided that the title should descend to the son of the second Lady Gardner . There is on record one fact , well observed , which establishes beyond cavil the possibility of the protraction of pregnancy beyond two hundred and eighty days , or forty weeks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and occurred under his own notice in the Hopital de Maternite of that city . A woman , the mother of three children , became insane . Her physician thought that a new pregnancy might re-establish her intellectual faculties . Her husband consented to enter on the register of the hospital each visit he was allowed to make her , which took place only every three months . So soon as evidence of pregnancy showed itself , the visits were discontinued . The woman was confined two hundred and ninety days after conception . The late distinguished Professor Charles D. Meigs of Philadelphia published a case , which he deems entirely trustworthy , of the prolongation of pregnancy to four hundred and twenty days , or sixty weeks . Dr. Atlee reports two cases , which nearly equaled three hundred and fifty-six days each . Professor Simpson of Edinburgh records , as having occurred in his own practice , cases in which the period reached three hundred and thirty-six , three hundred and thirty-two , three hundred and twenty-four , and three hundred and nineteen days . In the Dublin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is related by Dr. Joynt . The evidence is positive that the minimum duration must have been three hundred and seventeen days , or about six weeks more than the average . Dr. Elsaesser found , in one hundred and sixty cases of pregnancy , eleven protracted to periods varying from three hundred to three hundred and eighteen days . In treating of the subject of miscarriage , we mentioned instances , recorded by physicians of skill and probity , proving beyond a shade of doubt that a woman may give birth to a living child long before the expiration of the forty weeks . The Presbytery of Edinburgh , Scotland , some time since decided in favor of the legitimacy of an infant born alive , within twenty-five weeks after marriage , to the Rev. Fergus Jardine . One of the most enlightened countries in Europe has , in view of the facts in reference to the extreme limits of pregnancy , enacted , in the Code Napoleon , that a child born within three hundred days after the departure or death of the husband , or one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The law further states that a child born after more than three hundred days shall not be necessarily declared a bastard , but its legitimacy may be contested . The Scotch legislation on this subject is very similar to the French . CAUSES OF PROTRACTED PREGNANCY . It has been asserted by some that an infant is born at ten or eleven months because at nine months it has not acquired the growth which is necessary in order to induce the womb to dislodge it . The popular notion is , that a child carried beyond the usual term must necessarily be a large one . Rabelais has reflected this common opinion in his celebrated romance entitled ' Gargantua , ' in which he represents the royal giant of that name as having been carried by his mother , Gargamelle , eleven months . When born , the child was so vigorous that he sucked the milk from ten nurses . He lived for several centuries , and at last begot a son , Pantagruel , as wonderful as himself . Such reasoning can not , however , be seriously maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been more fully developed than some born a few weeks prematurely ; and the size of the child has nothing to do with the bringing on of labor , as we shall show hereafter . Protracted pregnancies are caused by a defect in the energy of the womb , induced by moral as well as physical influences . As a rule , a woman who leads a regular life , and observes the physiological laws of her being , which laws it has been our aim to point out , will be confined at the term that nature usually marks out , that is , at the expiration of two hundred and eighty days , or forty weeks , from conception . This brings us to the consideration of the question , HOW TO CALCULATE THE TIME OF EXPECTED LABOR . Many rules for this purpose have been laid down . We shall merely give one , the most satisfactory and the most easily applied . It was suggested by the celebrated Professor Naegele of Heidelberg , and is now generally recommended and employed by physicians . The point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearance of the last monthly sickness ; three months are subtracted , and seven days added . The result corresponds to the day on which labor will commence , and will be found to be two hundred and eighty days from the time of conception , if that event has occurred , as ordinarily , immediately after the last menstrual period . Suppose , for instance , the cessation of the last monthly sickness happened on the 14th day of January ; subtract three months , and we have October 14 ; then add seven days , and we obtain the 21st day of the ensuing October ( two hundred and eighty days from January 14 ) as the time of the expected confinement . This method of making the ' count ' may be relied upon with confidence , and only fails , by a few days , in those exceptional cases in which conception takes place just before the monthly period , or during the menstrual flow . CARE OF HEALTH DURING PREGNANCY . This subject , the proper management of the health from conception to childbirth , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not one of disease , calls for peculiar solicitude , lest it should lead to some affection in the mother or in the child . For it ought to be remembered that the welfare of a new being is now in the balance . The woman has no longer an independent existence . She has entered upon the circle of her maternal duties . She became a mother when she conceived . The child , though unborn , lives within her ; its life is a part of her own , and so frail , that any indiscretion on her part may destroy it . The danger to the child is not imaginary , as the large number of miscarriages and still-births proves . All mothers desire to have healthy , well-formed , intelligent children . How few conduct themselves in such a manner as to secure a happy development of their offspring ! Puny , deformed , and feeble-minded infants are daily ushered into the world because of a want of knowledge , or a sinful neglect of those special measures imperatively demanded in the ordering of the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon pregnancy . We shall therefore point out those laws which can not be infringed with impunity , and indicate the diet , exercise , dress , and , in general , the conduct most favorable to the mother and child during this critical period , in which the wife occupies , as it were , an intermediate state between health and sickness . FOOD . The nourishment taken during pregnancy should be abundant , but not , in the early months , larger in quantity than usual . Excess in eating or drinking ought to be most carefully avoided . The food is to be taken at shorter intervals than is common , and it should be plain , simple , and nutritious . Fatty articles , the coarser vegetables , highly salted and sweet food , if found to disagree , as is often the case , should be abstained from . The flesh of young animals  --  as lamb , veal , chicken , and fresh fish  --  is wholesome , and generally agrees with the stomach . Ripe fruits are beneficial . The diet should be varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craving which some women have in the night or early morning may be relieved by a biscuit , a little milk , or a cup of coffee . When taken a few hours before rising , this will generally be retained , and prove very grateful , even though the morning sickness be troublesome . Any food or medicine that will confine or derange the bowels is to be forbidden . The taste is , as a rule , a safe guide , and it may be reasonably indulged . But inordinate , capricious desires for improper , noxious articles , should of course , be opposed . Such longings , however , are not often experienced by those properly brought up . It is a curious fact , that the modification in the digestive system during pregnancy is sometimes so great that substances ordinarily the most indigestible are eaten , without any inconvenience , and even with benefit , while the most healthful articles become hurtful , and act like poison . As pregnancy advances , particularly after the sixth month , a larger amount of food , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The number of meals in the day should then be increased , rather than the quantity taken at each meal . CLOTHING . The dress during pregnancy should be loose and comfortable , nowhere pressing tightly or unequally . The word enceinte , by which a pregnant woman is designated , meant , originally , without a cincture ,  --  that is , unbound . The Roman matrons , so soon as they conceived , were obliged to remove their girdles . Lycurgus caused the enactment of the Spartan law , that pregnant women should wear large dresses , so as not to prejudice the free development of the precious charges of which nature had rendered them the momentary depositaries . Stays or corsets may be used , in a proper manner , during the first five or six months of pregnancy , but after that they should either be laid aside , or worn very loosely . Any attempt at concealing pregnancy , by tight lacing and the application of a stronger busk , can not be too severely condemned . By this false delicacy the mother is subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shape of the stays should be moulded to that of the changing figure , and great care should be taken that they do not depress the nipple or irritate the enlarging breasts . The amount of clothing should be suited to the season , but rather increased than diminished , owing to the great susceptibility of the system to the vicissitudes of the weather . It is especially important that flannel drawers should be worn during advanced pregnancy , as the loose dress favors the admission of cold air to the unprotected parts of the body . A neglect of this precaution sometimes leads to the establishment of the painful disease known as rheumatism of the womb . Pressure upon the lower limbs , in the neighborhood of the knee or the ankle joint , should be avoided , more particularly towards the last months . It is apt to produce enlargement and knotting of the vein , swelling and ulcers of the legs , by which many women are crippled during their pregnancies , and sometimes through life . Therefore the garters should not be tightly drawn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should firmly support the ankle . EXERCISE . Moderate exercise in the open air is proper and conducive to health during the whole period of pregnancy . It should never be so active nor so prolonged as to induce fatigue . Walking is the best form of exercise . Riding in a badly-constructed carriage , or over a rough road , or upon horseback , as well as running , dancing , and the lifting or carrying of heavy weights , should be scrupulously avoided , as liable to cause rupture , severe flooding , and miscarriage . During the early months , in particular , extraordinarily long walks and dancing ought not to be indulged in . Journeys are not to be taken while in the pregnant state . Railway travelling is decidedly objectionable . The vibratory motion of the cars is apt to produce headache , sickness at the stomach , faintness , and premature labor . All these precautions are especially to be observed in the first pregnancy . We must not be understood as condemning exercise and fresh air . They are of the greatest importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be regulated by the dictates of common sense and the woman 's own sensations . If she can only walk a short distance each day with comfort , let that suffice . She should not force herself to go to a certain place nor to promenade during a certain time in the twenty-four hours . So soon as fatigue is felt , the walk should cease . Let the walks be frequent and short , rather than few and long . They should also be made as pleasant as possible , by companionship and surroundings that will occupy the feelings and imagination in an agreeable manner with new and cheerful impressions . A tendency to indolence is to be combated . A gently active life is best calculated to preserve the health of the mother and her unborn child . But with even the most robust a moderation of the ordinary pursuits and avocations is called for . The nervous and delicate can not make with safety their customary daily exertions in the performance of their household or social duties and pleasures . Towards the end of pregnancy the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing or kneeling , nor sing in either of these postures . BATHING . Those who have not been accustomed to bathing should not begin the practice during pregnancy , and in any case great care should be exercised during the latter months . It is better to preserve cleanliness by sponging with tepid water than by entire baths . Foot-baths are always dangerous . Sea-bathing sometimes causes miscarriage , but sea air and the sponging of the body with salt water are beneficial . The shower-bath is of course too great a shock to the system , and a very warm bath is too relaxing . In some women of a nervous temperament , a lukewarm bath taken occasionally at night during pregnancy has a calming influence . This is especially the case in the first and last month . But women of a lymphatic temperament and of a relaxed habit of body are always injured by the bath . VENTILATION . We have spoken of the benefits of outdoor air during pregnancy . Attention should also be directed to keeping the atmosphere in the sitting and sleeping rooms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly changing it . The doors and windows of every room , while unoccupied , should be kept thrown open in the summer-time , and opened sufficiently often in the winter to wash out the apartments several times a day with fresh air . The extremes of heat and cold are to be , with equal care , avoided . The house should be kept light . Young plants will not grow well in the dark . Neither will the young child nor its mother flourish without sunlight . The ancients were so well aware of this , that they constructed on the top of each house a solarium , or solar air-bath , where they basked daily , in thin attire , in the direct rays of the sun . SLEEP . During pregnancy a large amount of sleep is required . It has a sedative influence upon the disturbed nervous system of the mother . It favors , by the calmness of all the functions which attends it , the growth of the foetus . Neither the pursuit of pleasure in the evening , nor the observance of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be allowed to curtail the hours devoted to slumber . Pregnant women have an instinctive desire to lie abed late , which , like the other promptings of nature during this period , should not be disregarded . At least eight hours out of the twenty-four can be profitably spent in bed . No night-watching ought ever to be undertaken during pregnancy . Feather beds should be avoided . The heat which they maintain about the body is inconvenient and dangerous , predisposing to flooding and exhausting perspirations . The hair or sponge mattress is to be preferred . The bed-clothing should not be too heavy . Blankets are to be employed rather than coverlids , as they are lighter and more permeable to perspiration . The mattress and cover should be well aired during the day . The sleeping-room should be capacious and well ventilated , and no curtains permitted about the bed . Occasional rest is also necessary in the daytime . A nap of an hour or two upon a sofa or lounge will then prove very refreshing . In the earlier months of pregnancy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to relieve the distress consequent upon the increased size of the womb . It is not unusual , as the close of pregnancy approaches , for a feeling of suffocation to ensue when the woman attempts to lie down . This may be overcome by supporting the back and shoulders with cushions and pillows . Or a bed-chair may be employed . This , if well constructed and covered , will often be found very grateful at night , in the last few weeks of pregnancy . THE MIND . A tranquil mind is of the first importance to the pregnant woman . Gloomy forebodings should not be encouraged . Pregnancy and labor are not , we repeat , diseased conditions . They are healthful processes , and should be looked upon as such by every woman . Bad labors are very infrequent . It is as foolish to dread them , as it is for the railway traveller to give way to misgivings in regard to his safety . Instead of desponding , science bids the woman to look forward with cheerfulness and hope to the joys of maternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind are illustrated by Plutarch , who , in his Life of Publicola , mentions that , ' at a time when a superstitious fear overran the city of Rome , all the women then pregnant brought forth imperfect children , and were prematurely delivered . ' But we have already spoken , in treating of mothers ' marks , of the influence of mental emotions over the unborn child , and the necessity of avoiding their exciting causes . Because of their deleterious tendency , severe study as well as arduous and protracted manual labor ought to be avoided . The nervous systems of many women are also injuriously affected during pregnancy by perfumes , which at other times are agreeable and innocuous . It is therefore prudent not only to exclude all offensive scents , but also to abstain from the strong odors of various strong perfumes , eau-de-cologne , and of flowers . Large bouquets often cause feelings of faintness , and sometimes temporary loss of consciousness . The extreme liability of the nervous system of the pregnant woman to be affected injuriously to herself and child by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful objects , can not be too strongly impressed upon every one . She should be protected from all that will disturb her , and should be constantly treated with soothing and encouraging kindness . Her manifestations of irritability , her caprices , her melancholy anticipations , are not to be scoffed at , but combated with a mixture of reasoning and patient forbearance . On her part , she should endeavour to co-operate with those around her , in sedulously shunning all injurious influences , and in banishing as quickly as possible all improper longings . She should remember that , although she herself may escape mischief from them , her child may suffer . She is the custodian of interests dearer to her than her own . RELATION OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DURING PREGNANCY . During those days when the wife , if she were not pregnant , would have been ' unwell , ' marital intercourse should be abstained from . It is then injurious to the mother , and dangerous to the life of the child , as it is liable to excite miscarriage . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no reason why passion should not be gratified in moderation and with caution during the whole period of pregnancy . There is one exception to be made to this general course of conduct . In those cases in which a miscarriage has occurred in the first pregnancy , every precaution should be employed  --  for reasons which have been dwelt upon in a previous article  --  to prevent its happening again after the second conception . Under such exceptional circumstances , therefore , the husband and wife should sleep apart during the first five months of pregnancy . After that period their ordinary relations may be resumed . When a miscarriage has taken place , intercourse should not be permitted within a month of the accident . The observance of this direction is of the utmost importance . Its neglect is the frequent cause of severe and intractable diseases of the womb . EFFECT OF PREGNANCY ON HEALTH . We have had occasion to remark that pregnancy is not a condition of disease . It is not only an evidence of health , but during its continuance it confers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys better health during her pregnancy than at any other time ; she is less liable to contagious and other maladies ; she is less apt to die than at any other period of her life ; and her general constitution seems also then to receive a favorable impress , for wives and mothers live longer than celibates . It is wisely decreed that when woman is engaged in this , to her , anxious stage of reproduction , she shall not be exposed to the pains and dangers of disease , and that those great covenants of nature  --  marriage and child-bearing  --  shall be rewarded by added strength and length of days . There are certain disorders incident , in exceptional cases , to pregnancy , of which we shall shortly speak . In general , however , we repeat that this condition is one of extraordinary health . More than this , in numerous instances it exerts an ameliorating influence upon pre-existing diseases , suspending their march , or bringing about a decidedly curative effect . Thus , various obstinate chronic affections of the skin , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , frequently get well during pregnancy ; and it is well known to every physician , that by the judicious management of this state , and of the lying-in period , troublesome displacements of the womb may be arrested . It should nevertheless ever be recollected that the condition of pregnancy is one of excitement and enhanced susceptibility to impressions of all kinds . For this reason a change in the habits of life is necessary ; and the importance of the directions laid down for the care of the health during this period , can not be too strongly insisted upon . The diseases to which the wife is exposed during pregnancy will be treated of in the chapter on ' Health in Marriage . ' CONFINEMENT . PREPARATIONS FOR CHILDBIRTH . Certain foolish preparations are sometimes made by wives , with the best intentions . Perhaps one of the most common and absurd of these is the local use of sweet oil , in order to facilitate the dilatation of the parts , for which purpose it is perfectly inert . There are , however , some wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ , to guard against unpleasant and dangerous complications in childbirth . In particular , the condition of the breasts towards the close of pregnancy demands attention . Scarcely any pain in the lying-in chamber is greater or more difficult to bear than that which the young mother suffers from excoriated nipples . This troublesome and often very intractable affection is nearly always the consequence of the want of care previous to confinement . During the latter part of pregnancy the nipples sometimes become sunken or flat , being retracted as the breasts increase in size , because of the want of elasticity on the part of the milk tubes . In order to remedy this fault , we have known a breast-pump or puppy to be applied . Such treatment is dangerous , as it may excite premature contraction of the womb , and miscarriage . Nipple-shields , with broad bases and openings , should always be obtained . They are safe , and effectually secure the prominence of the nipples , when worn constantly , day and night , during the last month or so of pregnancy . Wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascertain before labor whether this depressed condition of the nipples exists , and to correct it in the manner indicated . In the first pregnancy it is also important to harden the nipples . This may be done by occasionally gently rubbing them between the thumb and finger , and by bathing them twice a day during the last six weeks with tincture of myrrh , or with a mixture of equal parts of brandy and water , to which a little alum has been added . This procedure will render the surfaces less sensitive to the friction of the child 's mouth , and thus avert the distress so often occasioned in the first confinement by tenderness of the nipples . If the nipples be rough or nodulated in appearance , like a strawberry or a raspberry , they are more apt to become excoriated or fissured than if they present a smooth surface . Under such circumstances , make a solution of the sulphate of zinc , of the strength of one grain to the ounce of rose water , in a wide-mouthed bottle , then tilt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a few minutes several times a day . Simple tenderness of the nipples and slight fissures may be averted by the application either of a lotion of borax ( two scruples of borax in three ounces of water , and an ounce of glycerine ) , of the honey of borax , or of the tincture of catechu , and by protecting the parts from the pressure of the stays and the friction of the flannel vest . It is of the greatest moment to the comfort of the mother , that all affections of the nipples should be prevented or remedied before labor ; for the treatment of sore nipples when the child is at the breast is often unsatisfactory , while the suffering they occasion is very great , even sometimes giving rise to mammary abscess . There are certain articles of clothing and dressings for the bed which should be cared for in advance , in order that they may be ready when required . The mother should be provided with short-gowns , to be worn over the chemise instead of the ordinary night-gowns . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be made of heavy muslin , neither too coarse nor too fine ; an ordinarily good quality of unbleached muslin is the best . The material is to be cut bias , about one and a quarter yard in length , and from twelve to eighteen inches in breadth , varying , of course , with the size of the person . It should be just large enough to encircle the body after confinement , with a margin of a couple of inches , and to extend down below the fulness of the hips . The measurement should be taken , and the bandage made to fit , when four and a half months advanced . It should be narrow above , wider below , and gored in such a manner that it will be a little narrower at the lower extremity than a few inches above , so as to prevent it , when adjusted , from sliding upwards . A bandage constructed in this manner will be very comfortable ; and is not apt to become displaced , after application , as is invariably the case when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way in which it is to be applied will be detailed hereafter . The child 's clothing should consist first of a piece of flannel or some woollen material for a binder . This should be from four to six inches in width , and from twelve to sixteen inches in length ; that is to say , wide enough to extend from the armpits to the lower part of the abdomen , and long enough to go once and a half times around the child , having the double fold to come over the abdomen . There should be no embroidery about this . A shirt , which it is desirable should be woollen , is to be provided to place over the binder . It should be made to come up tolerably high in the neck , and to extend down the arm . Neither it nor any other portion of the child 's clothing should be starched . The petticoat , which may be open its whole length behind , is to be put over the shirt ; two may be used  --  a short and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or slip , and above this an apron to protect the dress from the frequent discharges from the stomach . Then a shawl , of flannel or any other warm material , is to be provided , to throw over the shoulders if the weather be cold . Socks , and pieces of old soft linen , free from stiffening , for napkins or diapers , complete the child 's outfit . For the permanent and temporary dressing of the bed there should be provided a piece of impervious cloth ( oiled silk is the neatest ) about a yard square ; a piece of ordinary table oil-cloth or rubber-cloth ; a number of old sheets and comfortables , and a piece of thick carpet . The manner in which these are to be used will be explained shortly . A pair of small rounded scissors ; a package of large pins , one and a half inches in length , for the bandage of the mother , and smaller ones for that of the child ; some good linen bobbin for the doctor to tie the navel-string ; good toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of soft linen or muslin for dressing the navel ; a box of unirritating powder ; and a pile of towels ,  --  should all be had and laid aside many weeks before they are wanted . These , together with the material for dressing the bed , the child 's clothing , and the mother 's bandage , ought to be placed together in a basket got for the purpose , in order that they may all be easily and certainly found at a time when perhaps the hurry and excitement of the moment would render it difficult otherwise to collect them all immediately . SIGNS OF APPROACHING LABOR . One of the earliest of the preliminary signs of the coming on of confinement occurs about two weeks before that event . It is a dropping or subsidence of the womb . The summit of that organ then descends , in most cases , from above to below the umbilicus , and the abdomen becomes smaller . The stomach and lungs are relieved from pressure , the woman breathes more freely , the sense of oppression which troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' very comfortable . ' This sensation of lightness and buoyancy increases , and a few days before the setting in of labor she feels so much better that she thinks she will take an extra amount of exercise . The mother of a number of children is acquainted with this sign , but the wife with her first child may exert herself unduly in the house or outdoors , and induce labor when in the street or away from home . Hence the importance of a knowledge of this premonitory symptom . A second precursory sign of labor is found in the increased fulness of the external parts , and an augmented mucous secretion , which may amount even to a discharge resembling whites , and requiring the wearing of a napkin . This symptom is a good one , indicating a disposition to relaxation , and promising an easy time . The third preliminary sign which we shall mention , is the change in the mental state of the pregnant woman . She has a feeling of anxiety and of fidgetiness , sometimes accompanied with depression of spirits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reason , self-control , and religion , may continue for several days , perhaps , when THE SYMPTOMS OF ACTUAL LABOR make their appearance . The first of these is generally the ' show . ' It is the discharge of the plug of mucus which has occupied the neck of the womb up to this time , and is ordinarily accompanied by a little blood . Perhaps before this , or perhaps not for some hours after , the ' pains ' will develope themselves . These recur periodically , at intervals of an hour or half an hour at the outset , and are ' grinding ' in character . True labor pains are distinguished from false by the fact that they are felt in the back , passing on to the thighs , while false pains are referred to the abdomen ; by their intermittent character , the spurious pains being more or less continuous ; and by the steady increase in their frequency and severity . In case of doubt as to their exact nature , the doctor should be summoned , who will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms which point to the actual commencement of labor are a frequent desire to empty the bowels and bladder , nausea and vomiting , which , in the early part of confinement , is a good sign ; shiverings , unattended with any sensation of cold ; and , finally , the rupture and discharge of the contents of the ' bag of waters . ' Before passing on to the consideration of the management of the confinement into which the wife has now entered , a few words may be appropriately said upon the CAUSE OF LABOR . Neither the size nor the vigor of the child has any influence in bringing about delivery at full term . The ancient theory  --  which received the support of the distinguished naturalist Buffon  --  that the infant was the active agent in causing its own expulsion , is an exploded one . It was asserted by some that hunger excited the foetus to struggle to free itself from the womb ; others were disposed to attribute its efforts to accomplish its entrance into the world , to the need of respiration which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presupposed the embryo to be actuated by the same feelings which would influence a grown person if shut up in such a confined abode , are unsatisfactory , and not tenable . It is well known that the child may die in the womb , without retarding or interfering in any way with the coming on of the process of labor . This fact alone shows that the foetus is , or at any rate may be , absolutely passive either in regard to the induction or advancement of delivery . The determining cause of labor is seated in the womb itself . The contractions of this organ occasion the ' pains ' and expel the child , assisted by the muscles of the abdomen and the diaphragm . That the assistance of the latter forces is not necessary , is conclusively proved by the occurrence of childbirth after the decease of the mother . For instance , a case is on record in which labor commenced and twins were born after the mother had been dead for three days . CARE DURING LABOR . We will suppose labor to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mother is now to be attended to . As she is to lie on the left side of the bed , this is the side , and the only one , which is to be dressed for the occasion . In order to do so , remove the outer bed-clothes one at a time , folding them neatly on the right side of the bed so that they can easily be drawn over when desired . The permanent dressing is to be placed beneath the lower sheet and upon the mattress . A soft impervious cloth  --  which , in speaking of the preparation for confinement , we directed to be procured  --  is placed next to the surface of the bed . The upper edge should be nearly as high as the margin of the bolster , and it should extend down to a distance at least a foot below the level of the hips , so as to certainly protect the bed from the discharges . Upon the top of this a blanket or sheet is laid , and the whole fastened by pins . The lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right side , to permit the application of the dressing , is now to be replaced . Over the position of this permanent dressing , on the top of the bed-sheet , a neatly-folded sheet , with the folded edge down , is adjusted and pinned in its place . It is upon this sheet that the patient is to be drawn up after her confinement , which will take place upon the temporary dressing of the bed now to be arranged . It consists of an oil-cloth , which should extend up beyond the lower edge of the permanent dressing , overlapping the folded sheet which has been placed above it , and should fall over the side and bottom of the bed . A comfortable or any soft absorbent material is placed over this impervious cloth and covered with a folded sheet , completing the temporary dressing . The bed-clothes may now be adjusted , concealing the dressings from view until they are wanted . The valances at the foot of the bed should be raised , and a piece of carpet placed on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low one . The dress of the mother.  --  Either a folded sheet should be adjusted around the waist as the only skirt , so as not to interfere with the walking , or a second chemise should be put on , with the arms outside the sleeves , to extend from the waist to the feet . Then the chemise next the body should be drawn up and folded high up around the breast . It should be plaited neatly along the back , and brought forward and fastened by pins . This should be thoroughly done , so that the linen may not be found wet nor soiled when it is drawn down after confinement . A wrapper or dressing-gown may be worn during the first stage of labor , before it is necessary to go to bed . When , however , that time comes , the wife will take her place on her left side on the temporary dressing , with a sheet thrown over her , her head on a pillow so situated that her body will be bent well forward , and her feet against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord and fastened to the foot of the bed , for her to seize with her hands during the accession of the ' bearing-down pains . ' Care should be taken to have a number of napkins , a pot of fresh lard , and the basket containing the scissors , ligature , bandage , etc.  --  which have been previously enumerated in the remarks on preparations for childbirth  --  at hand , for the use of the doctor . We have now noted all that it is useful for the wife to know in regard to the preparation for and management of confinement , when a physician is in attendance , as , for obvious reasons , he should always be . In some instances , however , the absence of the doctor is unavoidable , or the labor is completed before his arrival . As a guide to the performance of the necessary duties of the lying-in room under such circumstances , we give some HINTS TO ATTENDANTS . The room during confinement should be kept quiet . Too many persons must not be allowed in it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation to disturb the patient , either exciting or depressing her . So soon as the head is born , it should be immediately ascertained whether the neck is encircled by the cord ; if so , it should be removed or loosened . The neglect of this precaution may result fatally to the infant , as happened a short time since in our own practice ; the infant , born a few minutes before our arrival , being found strangled with the cord about its neck . It is also of importance at once to allow of the entrance of air to the face , to put the finger in the mouth to remove any obstruction which may interfere with respiration , and to lay the babe on its right side , with the head removed from the discharges . The cord should not be tied until the infant is heard to cry . The ligature is to be applied in the following manner :  --  A piece of bobbin is thrown around the navel-string , and tied with a double knot at the distance of three fingers ' breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch beyond the first , and the cord divided with the scissors between the two , care being taken not to clip off a finger or otherwise injure the unsuspecting little infant , as has occurred in careless hands more than once . When the child is separated from the mother , a warm blanket or a piece of flannel should be ready to receive it . In taking hold of the little stranger , it may slip out of the hands and be injured . To guard against this accident , which is very apt to occur with awkward or inexperienced persons , always seize the back portion of the neck in the space bounded by the thumb and first finger of one hand , and grasp the thighs with the other . In this way it may be safely carried . It should be transferred , wrapped up in its blanket , to some secure place , and never put in an arm-chair , where it may be crushed by some one who does not observe that the chair is already occupied . The head of the child should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocation . ATTENTION TO THE MOTHER . When the after-birth has come away , the mother should be drawn up a short distance  --  six or eight inches  --  in bed , and the sheet which has been pinned around her , together with the temporary dressing of the bed removed , a clean folded sheet being introduced under the hips . The parts should be gently washed with warm water and a soft sponge or a cloth , after which an application of equal parts of claret wine and water will prove pleasant and beneficial . We have also found the anointing of the external and internal parts with goose grease , which has been thoroughly washed in several hot waters , to be very soothing and efficient in speedily allaying all irritation . This ought all to be done under cover , to guard against the taking of cold . The chemise pinned up around the breast should now be loosened , and the woman is ready for the application of the bandage , which is to be put on next the skin . If properly and nicely adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it have already been given . In order to apply it , one half of its length should be folded up into plaits , and the mother should lie on her left side ; lay the plaited end of the bandage underneath the left side of the patient , carrying it as far under as possible , and draw the loose end over the abdomen ; then let the mother roll over on her back upon the bandage , and draw out the plaited end . If the abdominal muscles are much relaxed and the hip-bones prominent , a compress of two or three towels will be wanted . The bandage should be first tightened in the middle by a pin applied laterally , for strings should never be employed . The pins should be placed at intervals of about an inch . The lower portion of the bandage should be made quite tight , to prevent it slipping up . The mother is now ready to be drawn up in bed upon the permanent dressing : this should be done without any exertion on her part . A napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) , to receive the discharges . If she prefer to lie on her left side , place a pillow behind her back . ATTENTION TO THE CHILD . The baby may now be washed and dressed . Before beginning , everything that is wanted should be close at hand , namely a basin of warm water , a large quantity of lard or some other unctuous material , soap , fine sponge , and a basket containing the binder , shirt , and other articles of clothing . First rub the child 's body thoroughly with lard . The covering can only be removed in this way ; the use of soap alone will have no effect unless the friction be so great as to take off also the skin . The nurse should take a handful of lard and rub it in with the palm of the hand , particularly in the flexures of the joints . In anointing one part , the others should be covered , to prevent the child from taking cold . If the child is thus made perfectly clean , do not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a more healthful condition by the lard , and there is risk of the child 's taking cold from the evaporation of the water . But the face may be washed with soap and water , great care being taken not to let the soap get into the child 's eyes , which is one of the most frequent causes of sore eyes in infants . The navel-string is now to be dressed . This is done by wrapping it up in a circular piece of soft muslin , well oiled , with a hole in its centre . The bandage is next to be applied . The object of its use is to protect the child 's abdomen against cold , and to keep the dressing of the cord in its position . The nature , shape , and size of the binder have been described . It should be pinned in front , three pins being generally sufficient . The rest of the clothing before enumerated is then put on . The child is now to be applied to the breast at once . This is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often prevents flooding , which is apt otherwise to occur . Secondly , it tends to prevent milk fever , by averting the violent rush of the milk on the third day , and the consequent engorgement of the breast and constitutional disturbance . The third reason is , that there is always a secretion in the breast from the first , which it is desirable for the child to have ; for it acts as a cathartic , stimulating the liver , and cleansing the bowels from the secretions which fill them at the time of birth . There is generally sufficient nourishment in the breasts for the child for the first few days . The mother may lie on the one side or the other , and receive the child upon the arm of that upon which she is lying . If the nipple be not perfectly drawn out so that the child can grasp it in its mouth , the difficulty may be overcome by filling a porter-bottle with hot water , emptying it , and then placing the mouth of the bottle immediately over the nipple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient amount of suction to elevate the sunken nipple . The bottle should then be removed and the child substituted ,  --  a little sugar and water or sweetened milk being applied , if necessary , to tempt the child to take the breast . FURTHER ATTENTION TO THE MOTHER . The patient should be cleansed every four or five hours . A soft napkin , wet with warm soap and water , should for this purpose be passed underneath the bed-clothing , without exposing the surface to a draft of air . After using the soap and water , apply again the dilute claret wine and the goose grease . Much of the safety of the mother depends upon the observation of cleanliness . The napkin should not be allowed to remain so long as to become saturated with the discharges . The mother should maintain rigidly the recumbent position for the first few days , not raising her shoulders from the pillow for any purpose , and should abstain from receiving visitors , and from any social conversation for the first twenty-four hours . For the first three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk fever passed , the mother should live upon light food ,  --  oatmeal gruel , tea and toast , panada , or anything else of little bulk and unstimulating character . Afterwards the diet may be increased by the addition of chicken , lamb , mutton or oyster broth , buttered toast , and eggs . The object of light nourishment at first is to prevent the too rapid secretion of milk , which might be attended with evil local and constitutional effects . If , however , the mother be in feeble health , it will be necessary from the outset that she shall be supported with nourishing concentrated food . Beef-tea will then be found very serviceable , particularly if made according to the following recipe :  --  Take a pound of fresh beef from the loins or neck . Free it carefully from all fat . Cut it up into fine pieces , and add a very little salt and five grains of unbroken black pepper . Pour on it a pint of cold water , and simmer for forty minutes . Then pour off the liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after squeezing the juice from it into the tea , throw it aside . Return to the fire , and boil for ten minutes . After the first week , the diet of the lying-in woman should always be nutritious , though plain and simple . The development of the mammary glands , the production of the mammary secretion , and the reduction which takes place in the size of the womb , all require increased nourishment , that they may be properly performed . After the third or fourth day the dress should be changed . The dress worn during labor , if our directions have been carried out , will not have been soiled . The clothing should be changed without uncovering the person , and without raising the head from the pillow . Pull the bed-gown from over each arm , and draw it out from under the body . Then unfasten the chemise in front and draw it down underneath her so that it can be removed from below , as it should not be carried over the head . Place her arms in the sleeves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , without lifting her shoulders from the bed , draw it down . Then change the bed-gown in the same manner . In changing the upper sheet , it should be pulled off from below , and the clean one carried down in its place from above , underneath the other clothing , which can be readily accomplished by plaiting the lower half . In introducing a clean under-sheet , one side of it should be plaited and placed under the patient , lying on her left side ; when she turns on her back , the plaits can then be readily drawn out . These directions , though apparently trivial , are important . The object is to guard against the great danger to which the mother is exposed by sitting up in bed for even a few minutes during the first week . Cathartic medicine should not be administered the first , the third , or any other day after confinement , unless it is needed . If the patient is perfectly comfortable , has no pain in the abdomen , no headache , and is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if her bowels have not been moved . If a laxative be called for , citrate of magnesia is much pleasanter and equally as efficacious as the castor-oil so frequently administered on this occasion . TO HAVE LABOR WITHOUT PAIN . Is it possible to avoid the throes of labor , and have children without suffering ? This is a question which science answers in the affirmative . Medical art brings the waters of Lethe to the bedside of woman in her hour of trial . Of late years chloroform and ether have been employed to lessen or annul the pains of childbirth , with the same success that has attended their use in surgery . Their administration is never pushed so as to produce complete unconsciousness , unless some operation is necessary , but merely so as to diminish sensibility and render the pains endurable . These agents are thus given without injury to the child , and without retarding the labor or exposing the mother to any danger . When properly employed , they induce refreshing sleep , revive the drooping nervous system , and expedite the delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . He alone is competent to give them with safety . In natural , easy , and short labor , where the pains are readily borne , they are not required . But in those lingering cases in which the suffering is extreme , and , above all , in those instances where instruments have to be employed , ether and chloroform have a value beyond all price . MORTALITY OF CHILDBED . The number of the pregnancy affects the danger to be expected from lying-in . It has been declared by excellent authority , that the mortality of first labors , and of childbed fever following first labors is about twice the mortality attending all subsequent labors collectively . After the ninth labor the mortality increases with the number . A woman having a large family , therefore , comes into greater and increasing risk as she bears her ninth and successive children . The age of the woman also affects the mortality accompanying confinement . The age of least mortality is near twenty-five years . On either side of this , mortality increases with the diminution or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confinement therefore corresponds to the age of greatest fecundity . And during the whole of child-bearing life , safety in labor is directly as fecundity , and vice versa . Hence modern statistics prove the correctness of the saying of Aristotle , that ' to the female sex premature wedlock is peculiarly dangerous , since , in consequence of anticipating the demands of nature , many of them suffer greatly in childbirth , and many of them die . ' As the period from twenty to twenty-five is the least dangerous for childbirth , and as first labors are more hazardous than all others before the ninth , it is important that this term of least mortality be chosen for entering upon the duties of matrimony . This we have already pointed out in speaking of the age of nubility . The sex of the child is another circumstance affecting the mortality of labor . Professor Simpson of Edinburgh has shown that a greater proportion of deaths occurs in women who have brought forth male children . The duration of labor also influences the mortality of lying-in . The fatality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recollected , however , that the duration of labor is only an inconsiderable part of the many causes of mortality in childbirth . WEIGHT AND LENGTH OF NEW-BORN CHILDREN The average weight of infants of both sexes at the time of birth is about seven pounds . The average of male children is seven and one-third pounds ; of female , six and two-thirds pounds . Children which at full term weigh less than five pounds are not apt to thrive , and usually die in a short time . The average length at birth , without regard to sex , is about twenty inches , the male being about half an inch longer than the female . In regard to the relation between the size of the child and the age of the mother , the interesting conclusion has been arrived at , that the average weight and length of the mature child gradually increases with the age of the mother up to the twenty-fifth year . Mothers between the ages of twenty-five and twenty-nine have the largest children . From the thirtieth year they gradually diminish . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first egg of a fowl is smaller than those which follow . The new-born children in our Western States seem to be larger than the statistics show them to be in the various States of Europe , and apparently even than in our Eastern States . In the Report on Obstetrics of the Illinois State Medical Society for 1868 , it is stated that Quincy , Ill. , produced during the year six male children whose average weight at birth was thirteen and a quarter pounds , the smallest weighing twelve pounds , and the largest seventeen and a half , which was born at the end of four hours ' labor , without instrumental or other interference . A recent number of a Western medical journal reports the birth at Detroit , in February last , of a well-formed male infant twenty-four and a-half inches long , weighing sixteen pounds . The woman 's weight , after labor , is stated as only ninety-two pounds . An English physician delivered a child by the forceps which weighed seventeen pounds twelve ounces , and measured twenty-four inches . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF LABOR . The length of a natural labor may be said to vary between two and eighteen hours . The intervals between the pains are such , however , that the actual duration of suffering , even in the longest labor , is comparatively very short . The first confinement is much longer than subsequent ones . The sex of the child has some influence on the duration of labor . According to Dr. Collins of the Lying-in Hospital of Dublin , the average with male births is one hour and four minutes longer than with female . The weight of the child also affects the time of labor . Children weighing over eight pounds average four hours and eight minutes longer in birth than those of less than eight pounds weight . STILL-BIRTHS . The statistics of nearly fifty thousand deliveries which occurred at the Royal Maternity Charity , London , show a percentage of nearly five still-born , or one in twenty-seven . There are more boys still-born than girls . We have already spoken of the fact that male births are more tedious , and that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life than females . This series of misfortunes has been attributed to the large size which the male foetus at birth possesses over the female . IMPRUDENCE AFTER CHILDBIRTH . After the birth of the child at full term , or at any other period of pregnancy , the womb , which had attained such wonderful proportions in a few months , begins to resume its former size . This process requires at least six weeks after labor for its full accomplishment . Rest is essential during this period . A too early return to the ordinary active duties of life retards or checks this restoration to normal size , and the womb being heavier , exposes the woman to great danger of uterine displacements . Nor are these the only risks incurred by a too hasty renewal of active movements . The surface , the substance , and the lining membrane of the womb are all very liable , while this change from its increased to its ordinary bulk is occurring , to take on inflammation after slight exposure . The worst cases of uterine inflammation and ulceration are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debility , pain , and excessive discharge , are among the least penalties consequent upon imprudence after confinement . It is a mistake to suppose that hard-working women in the lower walks of life attend with impunity to their ordinary duties a few days after confinement . Those who suffer most from falling of the womb and other displacements are the poor , who are obliged to get up on the ninth day and remain upright , standing or walking for many hours with an over-weighted womb . Every physician who has practised much among the poor , has remarked upon the great frequency of diseases of the womb , which is to be attributed to the neglect of rest , so common among them , after childbirth . If this be true of vigorous women accustomed to a hardy life , how much more apt to suffer from this cause are the delicately nurtured , whose systems are already , perhaps , deteriorated , and little able to resist any deleterious influences ! A mother should remain in bed for at least two weeks after the birth of the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month ; she should also take great pains to protect herself from cold , so as to escape the rheumatic affections to which at this time she is particularly subject . If these directions were generally observed , there would be less employment for physicians with diseases peculiar to women , and fewer invalids in our homes . TO PRESERVE THE FORM AFTER CHILDBIRTH . This is a matter of great anxiety with many women ; and it is proper that it should be , for a flabby , pendulous abdomen is not only destructive to grace of movement and harmony of outline , but is a positive inconvenience . To avoid it , be careful not to leave the bed too early . If the walls of the abdomen are much relaxed , the bed should be kept from two to three weeks . Gentle frictions daily with spirits and water will give tone to the muscles . But the most important point is to wear for several months a well-fitting bandage  --  not a towel pinned around the person , but a body-case of strong linen , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerting unpleasant pressure . The pattern for this has already been given . THE MOTHER . MATERNAL DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES . It has been well said by Madame Sirey , that women who comprehend well their rights and duties as mothers of families , certainly can not complain of their destiny . If there exists any inequality in the means of pleasure accorded to the two sexes , it is in favor of the woman . The mother who lives in her children and her grandchildren has the peculiar privilege of not knowing the grief of becoming old . ' So low down in the scale of creation as we can go , ' says Professor Laycock of Edinburgh , ' wherever there is a discoverable distinction of sex , we find that maternity is the first and most fundamental duty of the female . The male never in a single instance , in any organism , whether plant or animal , contributes nutrient material . ' Among the Romans , it was enacted that married women who had borne three children , or if freed-women , four , had special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exempted from tutelage . Juvenal has recorded the reverence paid in Rome to the newly-made mother , and the sign by which her house was designated and protected from rude intruders , namely , by the suspension of wreaths over the door . At various times , and in different countries , legislators have made laws discriminating in favor of matrons , justly regarding the family as the source of the wealth and prosperity of the State . Louis XIV . granted , by the edict of 1666 , certain pensions to parents of ten children , with an increase for those who had twelve or more . NURSING . So soon as the infant is born , it ought to be placed at the breast . From this source it should receive its only nourishment during the first four or six months , and in many cases the first year , of its life . The child which the mother has carried for nine months and brought with suffering into the world , still depends upon her for its existence . At the moment of its birth her duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . The obligation is imposed upon her of nourishing it with her own milk , unless there are present physical conditions rendering nursing improper , of which we are about to speak . It is well known that the artificial feeding of infants is a prominent cause of mortality in early life . The foundlings of large cities furnish the most striking and convincing proof of the great advantages of nursing over the use of artificially-prepared food . On the continent of Europe , in Lyons and Parthenay , where foundlings are wet-nursed from the time they are received , the deaths are 33.7 and 35 per cent . In Paris , Rheims , and Aix , where they are wholly dry-nursed , their deaths are 50.3 , 63.9 , and 80 per cent . In New York city , the foundlings , numbering several hundred a year , were , until recently , dry-nursed , with the fearful and almost incredible mortality of nearly one hundred per cent . The employment of wet-nurses has produced a much more favorable result . Therefore , if for any reason the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be procured . This brings us to the consideration of HINDRANCES TO NURSING , AND WHEN IT IS IMPROPER . Women who have never suckled often experience difficulty in nursing , on account of the sunken and flat condition of the nipple . We have pointed out the causes of this depression , and how by early attention before the birth of the infant it may be prevented . If , however , these precautions have been neglected , and it is found that the nipple is not sufficiently prominent to be grasped by the child 's mouth , it may be drawn out by a common breast-pump , by suction with a tobacco-pipe , by the use of the hot-water bottle in the manner described , or by the application of an infant a little older . Neither the child nor the mother should be constantly fretted in such cases by frequent ineffectual attempts at nursing . Such unremitting attention and continual efforts produce nervousness and loss of sleep , and result in a diminution of the quantity of the milk . The child should not be put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half or two hours . By the use of the expedients mentioned , the whole difficulty will be overcome in a few days . Delay in applying the child to the breast is a common cause of trouble . After it has been fed for several days with the spoon or bottle , it will often refuse to suck . When nursing is deferred , the nipple also becomes tender . For these reasons , as well as the others detailed in our directions for the care of the new-born infant , the child should always , in say from two to three hours after labor , be placed at the breast . Ulcerated and fissured nipples should be treated by the doctor in attendance . As it is highly desirable , and nearly always possible , to avoid them , we would again call attention to the manner of doing so , indicated in a previous article . Fissured nipples sometimes do harm to the infant , by causing it to swallow blood , disturbing in this way the digestion . But all these local interferences with nursing can generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rarely entirely prevent the exercise of this maternal pleasure and duty . But there are certain physical conditions which necessitate the employment of a hired wet-nurse , or weaning . If the mother belongs to a consumptive family , and is herself pale , emaciated , harassed by a cough , and exhausted by suckling , wet-nursing is eminently improper . A temporary loss of strength under other circumstances should not induce a mother at once to wean her child ; for it is often possible , by the judicious use of tonics , nourishing food , and stimulants , to entirely restore the health with the child at the breast . It should always be recollected , however , that the milk of those in decidedly infirm health is incapable of properly nourishing the child . Professor J. Lewis Smith of New York quotes , in his recent work on Diseases of Children , several instructive cases which show the danger sometimes attending suckling , and which may imperatively demand its discontinuance . ' A very light-complexioned young mother , in very good health , and of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third time , and , as regarded the child , successfully . All at once this young woman experienced a feeling of exhaustion . Her skin became constantly hot ; there were cough , oppression , night-sweats ; her strength visibly declined , and in less than a fortnight she presented the ordinary symptoms of consumption . The nursing was immediately abandoned , and from the moment the secretion of milk had ceased , all the troubles disappeared . ' Again : ' A woman of forty years of age having lost , one after another , several children , all of which she had put out to nurse , determined to nurse the last one herself . This woman being vigorous and well built , was eager for the work , and , filled with devotion and spirit , she gave herself up to the nursing of her child with a sort of fury . At nine months she still nursed him from fifteen to twenty times a day . Having become extremely emaciated , she fell all at once into a state of weakness , from which nothing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of exhaustion . ' It does not always follow , that because the mother is sick the child should be taken from the breast . It is only necessary in those affections in which there is great depression of the vital powers , or in which there is danger of communicating the disease to the child . In the city , where artificially-fed infants run great risks , extreme caution should be exercised in early weaning . Inflammation of either of the breasts necessitates the removal of the infant from the affected side , and its restriction to the other . As the inflammation gets well and the milk reappears , the first of it should always be rejected , as it is apt to be thick and stringy , after which nursing may be resumed . RULES FOR NURSING . The new-born child should be nursed about every second hour during the day , and not more than once or twice at night . Too much ardor may be displayed by the young mother in the performance of her duties . Not knowing the fact that an infant quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourishment , she is apt to give it the breast at every cry , day and night . In this manner her health is broken down , and she is compelled perhaps to wean her child , which , with more prudence and knowledge , she might have continued to nurse without detriment to herself . It is particularly important that the child shall acquire the habit of not requiring the breast more than once or twice at night . This , with a little perseverance , can readily be accomplished , so that the hours for rest at night , so much needed by the mother , may not be interfered with . Indeed , if the mother does not enjoy good health , it is better for her not to nurse at all at night , but to have the child fed once or twice with a little cow 's milk . For this purpose , take the upper third of the milk which has stood for several hours and dilute it with water , in the proportion of one part of milk to two of water . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagrees with the infant , the attention of the doctor should at once be called to the circumstance . A microscopic examination will reveal to the intelligent practitioner the cause of the difficulty , and suggest the remedy . It may be well here to mention  --  as , judging from the practice of many nurses and mothers , it seems to be a fact not generally known or attended to  --  that human milk contains all that is required for the growth and repair of the various parts of the child 's body . It should therefore be the sole food in early infancy . INFLUENCE OF DIET ON THE MOTHER 'S MILK . Certain articles of food render the milk acid , and thus induce colicky pains and bowel complaints in the child . Such , therefore , as are found , in each individual case , to produce indigestion and an acid stomach in the mother , should be carefully avoided by her . Retention of the milk in the breasts alters its character . The longer it is retained , the weaker and more watery it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every mother ; for it follows from it , that the milk is richer the oftener it is removed from the breast . Therefore , if the digestion of the child is disordered by the milk being too rich , as sometimes happens , the remedy is to give it the breast less frequently by which not only is less taken , but the quality is also rendered poorer . On the contrary , in those instances in which the child is badly nourished and the milk is insufficient in quantity , it should be applied oftener , and the milk thus rendered richer . The milk which last flows is always the richest . Hence , when two children are nursed , the first is the worse served . INFLUENCE OF PREGNANCY ON THE MILK . Menstruation is ordinarily absent , and pregnancy therefore impossible , during the whole course of nursing , at least during the first nine months . Sometimes , however , mothers become unwell at the expiration of the sixth or seventh month ; in rare instances , within the first five or six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any constitutional or local disturbance , it is not apt to interfere with the welfare of the infant . When , on the contrary , the discharge is profuse , and attended with much pain , it may produce colic , vomiting , and diarrhoea in the nursling . The disturbance in the system of the child ordinarily resulting from pregnancy in the mother is such that , as a rule , it should be at once weaned so soon as it is certain that pregnancy exists . The only exceptions to this rule are those cases in the city , during the hot months , in which it is impossible either to procure a wet-nurse or to take the child to the country to be weaned . In cold weather an infant should certainly be weaned , if it has attained its fifth or sixth month , and the mother has become pregnant . INFLUENCE OF THE MOTHER 'S MIND OVER THE NURSING CHILD . We have spoken , in treating of mothers ' marks , of the influence of the mother 's mind upon her unborn offspring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of the child . The mother continues during the whole period of nursing powerfully to impress , through her milk , the babe at her breast . It is well established , that mental emotions are capable of changing the quantity and quality of the milk , and of thus rendering it hurtful , and even dangerous , to the infant . The secretion of milk may be entirely stopped by the action of the nervous system . Fear , excited on account of the child which is sick or exposed to accident , will check the flow of milk , which will not return until the little one is restored in safety to the mother 's arms . Apprehension felt in regard to a drunken husband , has been known to arrest the supply of this fluid . On the other hand , the secretion is often augmented , as every mother knows , by the sight of the child , nay , even by the thought of him , causing a sudden rush of blood to the breast known to nurses as the draught . Indeed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the child to the breast , has been effectual in bringing about its secretion in young girls , old women , and even men . Sir Astley Cooper states that ' those passions which are generally sources of pleasure , and which when moderately indulged are conducive to health , will , when carried to excess , alter , and even entirely check the secretion of milk . ' But the fact which it is most important to know is , that nervous agitation may so alter the quality of the milk as to make it poisonous . A fretful temper , fits of anger , grief , anxiety of mind , fear , and sudden terror , not only lessen the quantity of the milk , but render it thin and unhealthful , inducing disturbances of the child 's bowels , diarrhoea , griping , and fever . Intense mental emotion may even so alter the milk as to cause the death of the child . A physician states , in the Lancet , that , having removed a small tumour from behind the ear of a mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion . The child being suckled soon afterwards , it died in convulsions . Professor Carpenter records in his Physiology two other fatal instances : in one , the infant put to the breast immediately after the receipt of distressing news by the mother , died in her arms in the presence of the messenger of the ill-tidings ; in the other , the infant was seized with convulsions on the right side and paralysis on the left , on sucking directly after the mother had met with an agitating occurrence . Another case of similar character may be mentioned . A woman while nursing became violently excited on account of a loss she had just met with from a theft . She gave her child the breast while in an intense passion . The child first refused , but ultimately took it , when severe vomiting occurred . In the course of some hours the child took the other breast , was attacked at once with violent convulsions , and died in spite of all that could be done for it . The following cases are related by Professor Carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a warning to nursing mothers to avoid all exciting or depressing passions . A mother of several healthy children , of whom the youngest was a vigorous infant a few months old , heard of the death from convulsions of the infant child of an intimate friend at a distance , whose family had increased in the same manner as her own . The unfortunate circumstance made a strong impression on her mind , and being alone with her babe , separated from the rest of her family , she dwelt upon it more than she otherwise would have done . With her mind thus occupied , one morning , shortly after nursing her infant , she laid it in its cradle , asleep and apparently in perfect health . Her attention was soon attracted to it by a noise . On going to the cradle she found it in a convulsion , which lasted only a few moments , and left it dead . In the other case , the mother had lost several children in early infancy , from fits . One infant alone survived the usually fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly upon the fear of losing him also , although he appeared to be a very healthy child . The infant was transferred to the arms of the nurse . While the nurse was endeavouring to cheer the mother by calling her attention to the thriving appearance of her child , he was seized with a convulsion , and died almost instantly in her arms . Under similar circumstances , a child should not be nursed by its mother , but by one who has reared healthy children of her own and has a tranquil mind . An interesting illustration of the powerful sedative action of the mother 's milk  --  changed in consequence of great mental distress  --  upon the impressible nervous system of the infant , is furnished by a German physician . ' A carpenter fell into a quarrel with a soldier billeted in his house , and was set upon by the latter with his drawn sword . The wife of the carpenter at first trembled from fear and terror , and then suddenly threw herself furiously between the combatants , wrested the sword from the soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away . During the tumult , some neighbors came in and separated the men . While in this state of strong excitement , the mother took up her child from the cradle , where it lay playing and in the most perfect health , never having had a moment 's illness . She gave it the breast , and in so doing sealed its fate . In a few minutes the infant left off sucking , became restless , panted , and sank dead upon its mother 's bosom . The physician , who was instantly called in , found the child lying in the cradle as if asleep , and with its features undisturbed ; but all his resources were fruitless . It was irrevocably gone . ' Professor William A. Hammond of New York mentions , in a recent number of the Journal of Psychological Medicine , several instances , from his own practice , of affections in the child caused by the mother 's milk . ' A soldier 's wife , whilst nursing her child , was very much terrified by a sudden thunderstorm , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lightning . The infant , which had always been in excellent health , was immediately attacked with vomiting and convulsions , from which it recovered with difficulty . ' ' A lady , three weeks after delivery , was attacked with puerperal insanity . She nursed her child but once after the accession of the disease , and in two hours subsequently it was affected with general convulsions , from which it died during the night . Previous to this event it had been in robust health . ' Again , Dr. Seguin of New York relates , in his work on Idiocy , a number of cases of loss of mind produced by the altered state of the mother 's milk . ' Mrs. B. came out from a ball-room , gave the breast to her baby , three months old : he was taken with spasms two hours after , and since is a confirmed idiot and epileptic . ' ' In a moment of great anxiety Mrs. C. jumped into a carriage with her suckling , a girl of fifteen months , so far very intelligent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journey of twenty miles , but before arriving at destination she vomited several times , with no interruption but that of stupor , and after an acute fever the little girl settled down into the condition of a cripple and idiot . ' The celebrated physician Boerhaave mentions the milk of an angry nurse as among the causes of epilepsy . These facts show the importance of a placid mind and cheerful temper in the mother while nursing . POSITION OF THE MOTHER WHILE NURSING . The habit of nursing a child while sitting up in bed or half reclining upon a lounge is a wrong one . Such a position is injurious to the breasts , hurtful to the woman 's figure , and apt to cause backache . When in bed , the mother ought always to be recumbent while the child is at the breast , held upon the arm of the side upon which she lies . When out of bed , she should sit upright while nursing . QUANTITY OF MILK REQUIRED BY THE INFANT . The amount of milk furnished every day by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pints . An infant one or two months of age takes about two wine-glassfuls , or three ounces , every meal ; that is , as it sucks every two hours , excepting when asleep , about five half-pints during the twenty-four hours . When it attains the age of three months , it thrives well on five meals a day , the quantity taken at each meal then , the stomach being more capacious , amounting to about half a pint . A child above three months of age ordinarily requires three pints daily . A healthy mother is fully capable of furnishing this quantity of milk per day , and of affording the child all the nourishment it needs until four or six months after birth . The quantity of the mother 's milk varies according to many circumstances . It is most abundant and also most nutritious in nursing women between the ages of fifteen and thirty ; least so , in those from thirty-five to forty . There is likewise a great difference in different women in this respect ; and in the same woman varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD NURSING MOTHER are well described by Professor J. Lewis Smith . ' The best wet-nurses are usually robust , without being corpulent . Their appetite is good , and their breasts are distended , from the number and large size of the blood-vessels and milk-ducts . There is but a moderate amount of fat around the gland , and tortuous veins are observed passing over it . Such nurses do not experience a feeling of exhaustion , and do not suffer from lactation . The nutriment which they consume is equally expended on their own sustenance and the supply of milk . There are other good wet-nurses who have the physical condition described , but whose breasts are small . Still the infant continues to suck till it is satisfied , and it thrives . The milk is of good quality , and it appears to be secreted mainly during the time of suckling . Other mothers evidently decline in health during the time of nursing . They furnish milk of good quality and in abundance , and their infants thrive ; but it is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , that what they eat goes to milk . They become thinner and paler , are perhaps troubled with palpitation , and are easily exhausted . They often find it necessary to wean before the end of the usual period of lactation . There is another class whose health is habitually poor , but who furnish the usual quantity of milk without the exhaustion experienced by the class just described . The milk of these women is of poor quality . It is abundant , but watery . Their infants are pallid having soft and flabby fibre . ' OVER-ABUNDANCE OF MILK . An excessive amount of milk often distends the breasts of those women who are prone to have long and profuse monthly sickness . It is also apt to occur in those subject to bleeding piles . It may be produced by any excitement of the womb or ovaries , and by over-nursing . In these cases there is usually a constant oozing away and consequent loss of milk . The mother is troubled by this over-flow , because it keeps her clothing wet ; and the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk under such circumstances . This over-abundant supply may be moderated and the quality improved by diminishing the quantity of drink , and by the use of preparations of iron . Fifteen drops of the muriatic tincture of iron , taken three times a day in a little sweetened water , through a glass tube , will be useful . It will lessen the amount of the milk , and make it richer . So soon as these objects are accomplished , the medicine should be discontinued ; as , if taken too long , it may so much diminish the milk as to necessitate weaning . The application of a cloth , wrung out in cold water , around the nipples is also of value . It is to be removed so soon as it becomes warm , and reapplied . In those cases in which the trouble seems to be not so much an over-supply as an inability to retain the milk , the administration of tonics addressed to the nervous system , and the local use of astringents and of collodion around the nipples , will overcome the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the physician . And to him alone should be entrusted the use of those medicines which directly diminish the amount of milk secreted within the breasts . The expedients we have mentioned are the only ones which can be safely employed by the mother herself in this annoying affection . SCANTINESS OF MILK . Some mothers have habitually an insufficiency of milk . They are most numerous in large cities , and among working women whose daily occupations require a separation from the infant . Indigestion , and the want of a proper amount of nourishing food , cause a diminution in the quantity of milk . So also do over-feeding and gormandizing . Age lessens the secretion of milk , as has been already mentioned . Those who first bear children late in life , have less milk for them than they who begin earlier . In some cases want of milk in the breasts seems to be due to its reabsorption . In such instances it may make its appearance at distant parts . Thus , a case has been recorded of the coughing up of milk following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it presented itself as an exudation in the groins . In the treatment of a scanty formation of milk , one of the best measures which can be resorted to is the frequent application of the child to the breast . In addition , the flow may be increased by milking the breasts by means of the thumb and finger , suction through a tobacco-pipe , or the breast-pump , or by the use of another infant . Friction of the breasts , and forcible drawing upon the nipples , will make them sore , and so irritate them as to defeat the object in view . A change of scene , fresh air , and outdoor exercise , attention to personal cleanliness , and the improvement of the general health , all increase the quantity , and produce a favourable effect upon the quality , of the milk . A sojourn at the sea-side often promotes an abundant secretion of milk . The diet should be regulated by the condition of the constitution . By those who are weak and pale , a large proportion of meat is required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should restrict the amount of their animal food , and take more exercise in the open air . Oatmeal gruel enjoys a reputation for increasing the flow of milk . A basin of it sometimes produces an immediate effect . The same is true of cow 's milk . Porter or ale once or twice a day , in those with reduced systems and impaired digestion and appetite , will be found useful . Anise , fennel , and caraway-seeds , given in soup , act sometimes as stimulants upon the secretion of milk . The application of a poultice made from the pulverized leaves of the castor-oil plant is a most efficient remedy when milk fails to make its appearance in the breast in sufficient quantity after confinement . WET-NURSING BY VIRGINS , AGED WOMEN , AND MEN . As a rule , the secretion of milk is limited to one sex , and in that is confined to a short period after childbirth . But there are many cases on record of the flowing of milk in women not recently mothers , in girls before the age of puberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the male sex . In such instances , the secretion is induced by the combined influence , acting through the nervous system , of a strong desire for its occurrence , of a fixed attention towards the mammary glands , and of suction from the nipples . Travellers among savage nations report many examples of such unnatural nursing . Dr. Livingstone says he has frequently seen in Africa a grandchild suckled by a grandmother . Dr. Wm . A. Gillespie , of Virginia records , in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal , the case of a widow , aged about sixty , whose daughter having died , leaving a child two months old , took the child and tried to raise it by feeding . The child 's bowels became deranged , and being unable to procure a nurse , and her breasts being large and full , he advised her to apply the child , in hopes milk would come . She followed his advice perseveringly , and , to her astonishment , a plentiful secretion of milk was the result , with which she nourished the child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still more remarkable , is recorded of a woman at seventy years , who twenty years wet-nursed a grandchild after her last confinement . Cases of nursing in the opposite extreme of life are also well authenticated . The distinguished French physician Baudelocque has related that of a deaf and dumb girl , eight years old , who , by the repeated application to her breast of a young infant , which her mother was suckling , had sufficient milk to nourish the child for a month , while the mother was unable to nurse it on account of sore nipples . The little girl was shown to the Royal Academy of Surgery on the 16th of February , 1783 . The quantity of milk was such , that by simply pressing the breast it was made to flow out in the presence of the Academy , and on the same day , at the house of Baudelocque , before a large class of pupils . Again , an interesting case is known of a young woman , who , in consequence of the habit of applying the infant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caused a free secretion of milk . In the Cape de Verde Islands , it is stated that virgins , old women , and even men , are frequently employed as wet-nurses . Humboldt speaks of a man , thirty-two years old , who gave the breast to his child for five months . Captain Franklin saw a similar case in the Arctic regions . Professor Hall presented to his class in Baltimore a negro , fifty-five years old , who had been the wet-nurse of all the children of his mistress . Instances of powers of prolonged nursing in mothers are not uncommon . Indeed it is the habit among some nations to suckle children until they are three or four years of age , even though another pregnancy may intervene , so that immediately one child is succeeded at the breast by another . In those who have thus unnaturally excited the mammary glands , an irrepressible flow sometimes continues after the demand for it has ceased . Dr. Green published , some years ago , in the New York Journal of Medicine and Surgery , the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five children , who had had an abundant supply of milk for twenty-seven years consecutively . A period of exactly four years and a half occurred between each birth , and the children were permitted to take the breast until they were running about at play . At the time when Dr. G. wrote , she had been nine years a widow , and was obliged to have her breasts drawn daily , the secretion of milk being so copious . When , therefore , it is desirable , on account of the feebleness of the child , to protract the period of nursing , a wet-nurse should relieve the mother at the end of twelve or fifteen months . RULES FOR CARE OF HEALTH WHILE NURSING . From what we have previously said of the influence of the nervous system over the quantity and quality of the milk , and the instances we have adduced of the danger to the infant of all violent passions  --  such as anger , terror , anxiety , and grief  --  on the part of the mother , it will be apparent that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nursing , to maintain a tranquil state of mind . Pleasing and peaceful emotions favor the normal secretion of milk , and go far towards securing the health of the child . When strongly affected by any powerful feelings , mothers should not give the breast , but should wait until they have calmed down to their usual tenor of temper . A case is related of a woman who was always excited by a highly electrical state of the atmosphere , and particularly during stormy weather . If when thus influenced she nursed her child he was sure to fall into convulsions ; while , if she delayed doing so until this nervous excitement had passed , no unpleasant symptoms occurred . But we have already dwelt at length upon this subject in speaking of the influence of the mind of the mother over the child at her breast , and need not therefore recur to it . The food while nursing must be nutritious and varied , though simple and unstimulating ; and should consist both of meat and vegetables , soups , fish , flesh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestion requires stimulation and aid , a glass of mild ale twice a day will be useful . Wines , brandy , and whisky should not be taken without the advice of a physician . Moderate exercise in the open air and regular habits are necessary . A defective or excessive diet , fatigue , loss of rest at night , and irregularities and excesses of all kinds are unfavorable to mother and child . The proper methods of combating a tendency to over-abundance or to scantiness of milk have been alluded to . Medicines , unless prescribed by the medical attendant , should rarely or never be taken during this period , as many of them enter the milk and may thus affect the child . RELATIONS OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DURING NURSING . After a natural and healthful confinement , the nurse usually remains with the mother for a period of four weeks . During the whole of this time the husband should occupy a separate apartment , and , according to some physicians , this separation should be protracted during the entire period of nursing . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those women who are warned by the recurrence of their monthly illness that they are liable to another pregnancy immediately , should insist on such an ascetic rule as this . Unquestionably the quality of the milk is much deteriorated by a conception ; and therefore , both in the interest of the mother and child , the husband should renounce his usual privileges at such times . Most women do not have their periodical illness , and consequently are not liable to a second pregnancy , before seven months have elapsed after childbirth . There are , however , numerous exceptions to this rule , and it is impossible to foretell who will and who will not be the exception . Moreover , as any excitement of the passions alters to some extent the secretion of the breasts , often to the injury of the child , it is every way advisable that great temperance be exercised in all cases in the marital relations at these epochs . SIGNS OF OVER-NURSING . The symptoms of over-nursing may be enumerated as follows :  --  Aching pain in the back ; often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head or forehead ; marked paleness of the face ; inability to sleep ; frightful dreams when sleep does come ; great debility ; extreme depression of the spirits ; disorders of the sight , and mental disturbances , which take on the form of melancholia , the delusions relating mostly to subjects of a religious character , to the effect that the unpardonable sin has been committed , and the like . The headache is situated on the top of the head , and this spot may be noticed to be perceptibly hotter to the touch than other parts of the head . These symptoms indicate that the process of nursing is making too great a drain upon the system . A woman in ordinary health will generally be able to suckle her child for twelve months without experiencing any bad effects . When the child is kept at the breast much beyond this time , most mothers render themselves liable to the injurious consequences we have mentioned . Some , indeed , can not furnish the child all the nourishment it needs longer than three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by feeding the child two or three times a day , the mother may be relieved of the burden of its entire support , and may thus be enabled to continue nursing . The proper food for infants , under these circumstances , will be shortly mentioned . The prostrating effects of nursing upon the body and mind of the mother are in some , though comparatively rare , instances so marked , as to render it altogether improper from the commencement . The treatment of the condition of system described as resulting from over-nursing is , if it can not be remedied by partially feeding the infant and the use of tonics , to remove the child from the breast altogether , and either procure a wet-nurse for it , or wean it . The wet-nurse is greatly to be preferred ; and the preference is the stronger , the younger the child . We have already alluded to the great difficulty of rearing children from birth by the hand . But after the infant has attained the age of several months , the danger of artificial feeding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place during hot weather . This brings us to the consideration of the regimen of the mother who can not nurse her own child , of the rules for the selection of a wet-nurse , of the directions for bringing up by hand , and of the proper method of weaning . These subjects we will now take up in the order mentioned . DIRECTIONS FOR MOTHERS WHO CAN NOT NURSE THEIR OWN CHILDREN . There are many reasons why a mother should , if possible , nurse her own child . ' One of the principal is , ' says the distinguished Dr. Tilt , ' that as nursing , generally speaking , prevents conception up to the tenth month , so it prevents the ruin of the mother 's constitution by the too rapid bringing forth of children , and , we might even add , prevents a deterioration of the race , by the imperfect bringing up of this too-fast-got family . ' The same author appropriately adds : ' But while advocating maternal nursing , we must not forget that woman is not now the Eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now met , in barbarous tribes or in civilised communities , is frequently so deteriorated , so diseased or prone to disease , that , by nursing , a mother may sometimes undermine her own frail constitution for the sake of giving an imperfect sustenance , and perhaps a poisonous heritage , to her babe . ' Some mothers , however anxiously they may wish to do so , can not nurse their children . They are shut out from this charming and tender experience in the life of a woman . The milk that comes is not sufficient , and quickly disappears . Because of the influence of the mind of the mother over the child at her breast , to which we have before called attention , women who are very hysterical and nervous , subject to violent perturbations of the mind , should not , particularly if there be any family tendency to insanity , expose the child to the mischievous effects latent in their milk . So , also , the presence of certain diseases forbids wet-nursing . Thus it is ordinarily prohibited by consumption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In consumption , all efforts to suckle are frequently equally fatal to the mother and child . Even a strong hereditary predisposition to this disease may render it advisable , in the opinion of the family physician ,  --  who should always be consulted in such a case ,  --  to counteract the family taint by giving the milk of the healthiest nurse that can be procured . The condition of the nipples and of the breast may not permit of nursing . We have pointed out how best to guard against such an occurrence , in treating of the care of the nipples during pregnancy . She who is to be debarred from nursing her own child should take care that it is not allowed to approach her breasts , as sometimes the mental and physical excitement caused by such an approach is of an injurious and lasting character . Ordinarily , if this direction be followed out , the mother will have little trouble in regard to herself . Under such circumstances , the chief danger is to the child . Hence the importance of knowing HOW TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of great moment and responsibility . She should not be over thirty years of age , and should , if possible , be one who has previously suckled and had charge of children . Her own infant should be under the age of six months , for when above that age the milk sometimes disagrees with her new-born charge . One who has had several children should be preferred , because her milk is richer than after the first confinement . The doctor should always examine carefully into the condition of the nurse 's health , and into the quality and quantity of her milk . Various diseases and taints of the system are so hidden , while yet communicable to the child , that the knowledge and skill of a professional expert are required for their detection , and the protection of the nursling . In testing the quality of the milk , the experienced physician allows a little to rest on his finger nail , and by its examination readily decides as to its richness and fitness to nourish the little applicant for food . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of moderate size often furnish a sufficient amount of milk . But it is important that the nipples should be well developed . Those wet-nurses should be preferred in whom large blood-vessels are seen prominently passing in blue lines over the surface of the breasts . The possession of a vigorous , healthful infant is a good recommendation for a nurse , but care should be taken to ascertain that it is her own , as nurses have been known to borrow for such an occasion and so obtain credit not justly their due . The moral and mental as well as physical characteristics should be considered . Temperance and cleanliness are indispensable in a wet-nurse , and the want of either should be an imperative reason for rejection . Equanimity of temper , cheerfulness , and an open , frank , affectionate disposition , are of course greatly to be desired . If the nurse becomes ' unwell , ' shall the child be taken from her ? Should the monthly sickness reappear early , and both nurse and child be in good health , suckling may be continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth month , the child should be weaned or the nurse changed . There is no physiological reason for preventing the nurse from living matrimonially ; but if pregnancy occurs , the child should be taken from her . The same rules that we have laid down for the mother for the care of her health while nursing , are of course applicable to the hired wet-nurse , and should be insisted upon and enforced . Changing a nurse.  --  When it becomes necessary to change a nurse , for any of the reasons above mentioned , it may be done without injury to the child . For fear of the effect of the unwelcome tidings upon the mind of the nurse , and the possible influence upon the milk , she should not be informed of the projected change until a successor has been secured to take her place at once . In choosing the second nurse , the same precautions should be had as in the selection of the first . THE CHILD . THE CARE OF INFANCY . By infancy we mean that portion of the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  about two and a half years . The care of this period of human life is entrusted to the mother . It forms an important era in the physical life of woman . Its discussion is therefore germane to our subject . In order that the young mother may fully appreciate the responsibilities of her position , she should know something of the liability of infants to sickness and death . Out of one thousand children born , one hundred and fifty die within the first year , and one hundred and thirteen during the next four years . Thus two hundred and sixty-three , or more than one-fourth , die within five years after birth . Between the ages of five and ten , thirty-five die . During the next five years eighteen more are recorded on the death-list . Hence , at fifteen years of age only six hundred and eighty-five remain out of the one thousand born . When these figures are considered , and the additional fact that out of those who survive very many bear permanent marks of imperfect nourishment or of actual disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of our present inquiry  --  the care of infancy  --  will be apparent to all mothers . The younger the infant , the greater the danger of death . One-tenth of all children born die within the first month after birth , and four times as many as during the second month . The mortality is much larger in cities than in the country . In Dublin , during 1867 , very nearly one-third of all the persons who died were under five years of age . In the same year forty-three per cent . of those who died in the eight principal towns of Scotland were children below the age of five . In Philadelphia , during the same year , forty-five per cent . of all the deaths were of children under five years of age . In New York fifty-three per cent . of the total number of deaths occur under the age of five years , and twenty-six per cent . under the age of one year . The danger of death lessens as the period of puberty approaches . Yet , even in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a larger proportionate loss of life than during youth or middle age . CAUSES OF INFANT MORTALITY . What are the causes of this startling mortality of infant life ? Why does one child out of ten die in the first month , and only three out of four live to be five years old ? And what are the means of prevention ? Some of the causes which are active in producing this mortality among the little ones can not be successfully opposed after birth . Such , for instance , are imperfect and vicious developments of internal organs existing when born . These malformations often result from inflammation while in the womb , excited by some taint of the mother 's blood , or by some agitation of her nervous system . Means of prevention in those cases are therefore to be directed to the mother , in the manner indicated in treating of pregnancy . But other causes of death begin to act only after birth , and are to a greater or less extent avoidable . These are largely traceable to ignorance , negligence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly liable , and which alone is said to have destroyed forty thousand children in England between the years 1686 and 1799 , is being overlain by the parents . For this reason , some physicians caution the mother against having the infant in bed with her while she sleeps . Th//
