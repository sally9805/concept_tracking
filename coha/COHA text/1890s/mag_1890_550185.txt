NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE . APRIL , 1890 . VOL . II . No. 2 . WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE . By U iWia , ; z Clarke . MR . GLADSTONE is a well-worn subject , and I know not if there be anything new to say . I can not write as a partisan . Many people in England lose their beads the very instant Mr. Gladstone 's name is pronounced . The other day an Anglican clergyman had the kind politeness to suggest that the devil would release Judas Iscariot from his quarters in the infernal regions in order to make room for the venerable Liberal statesman ; and this generous sentiment the reverend gentleman embodied in some doggerel , which he recited to a Conservative meeting . On the other hand , the average Liberal speaks of his leader as a demigod . The very phrase , " grand old man , " bas caused the gradual evolution of a mythical hero quite removed from the real man , but devoutly believed in by many good Gladstonians . There was never in English history any instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man . Such a man , capable of inspiring such contradictorv feelings , must necessarily be at least a very striking character . I think I can understand both sets of feeling . That Mr. Gladstone should be intensely admired is not strange . That admiration is felt by many of bis opponents scarcely less than by his friends . Disraeli felt it , if we may believe many of the stories told , as did Macaulay fifty years ago , when be described young Gladstone as " the rising hope of the stern and unbending Tories . " Mr. Gladstone 's personality is the most interesting and charming of any English statesman since Charles James Fox . His presence is stately and dignified . The leonine head , the flashing , dark eyes , the firm mouth , the copyright , s Sgo , by New England Magazine company , Boston . All rights reserved . expressive , mobile countenance , the upright figure , almost as erect at eighty as it ever was , fascinate and compel homage . The long experience , the immense stores of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in speech , in management of men , are esteemed only less than the generous nature , the quick sympathy , the moral feeling , the humanitarian aims , which have endeared him to the multitude more than mere mental gifts . Others admire the gradual development of his mind , the almost imperceptible but sure expanse of his nature , broadening like freedom , according to Tennyson , " from precedent to precedent . " There are many persons to xvbom a sudden change in opinion , as in institutions , is distasteful and suspicious . The French revolutionary method of upsetting a throne in the morning , and drawing up a brand-new constitution in the afternoon , does not commend itself to their sentiment or their judgment . They may approve the end , but they dislike the means . Such lO* will admire the steady but gradual change of Mr. Gladstone 's mind in working from the 01 ( 1 loryism to the point at vehich he has arrived to-day . On the other hand , there are persons who , quite apart from Opinion , dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too subtle and too intellectually comprehensive for them . In England people of plain , simple natures and of strong but narrow minds are very numerous ; and such *rso* instinctively dislike the Gladstonian order of mind . I remember talking at the time of the general election of r88o with a very distinguished writer with a mind somewhat of this cast . NEV SERIES . // Mr. and Mrs. Gladstono . FROM A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN ON THEIR GOLDEN WEDDING DAY , JULY 25 , 1889 , BY BARRAUD OF LONDON . " Much as I disapprove of Lord Hartington 's general politics , " said he , " I think I should prefer him to Gladstone as prime minister , for you never know what Gladstone will do next . " This , I think , expresses a widespread feeling . " He has a great power of persuading himself , " said the late Mr. Forster concerning his former chief . And people do not know what Mr. Gladstone may not persuade himself to do next . His mind is so active and so subtle , he sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their limited range , that all the hard matter-of-fact , unimaginative people naturally distrust him . Sometimes they have reason for it . Statesmanship is after all a matter not of dialectical subtlety , but of practical judgment . The do facto state , especially the deficlo British Empire , is no ideal , but a very clumsy practical contrivance , and is not to be administered by the kind of person who can out-argue the schoolmen in determining how many angels can dance on the point of a needle . I do not say that Mr. Gladstone is that kind of person , but he certainly has some of its essential elements in his character . One day , for instance , he was asked a very simple question in the House of Commons , a question // which might have been answered in a dozen words . His reply took twenty minutes . In the lobby afterwards the inquiry went round , " What the deuce does he mean ? " Member asked member , but no one could say ; and the conundrum had to be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one had the ghost of an idea what he had meant by it . Compare such a subtle balancing of words with the blunt utterances of Palmerston or the simple , direct language of Bright . The cloud of words was not , however , in the least due to dishonesty or any conscious wish to deceive . It marked the inevitable process through which an extremely subtle and argumentative mind was going . Mr. Gladstone was simply arguing with himself aloud . This habit of mind has , however , been both to Mr. Gladstone and his party a source of disaster . Here is the ground of the opposition to him from plain people . The characteristic illustration of this is in Mr. Gladstone 's conduct of the Egyptian and Soudanese expeditions , in his second premiership . This is undoubtedly the great blot on his fame , whether one approves or disapproves of British intervention in Egypt . If British intervention was morally and politically wrong , then every step the Gladstone government took from first to last was utterly unjustifiable. 1f on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hesitating methods adopted by Mr. Gladstone must be severely condemned . This was manifest from the first to plain , simple people who never approved of what was done in Egypt and the Soudan , and some of whom have not yet forgiven Mr. Gladstone for his tergiversation , real or apparent . I happened to be at the House of Commons on the night when the vote for the foolish and abortive Souakim-Berber railway was taken - a vote , I have been told , for which we may thank the obstinacy of Lord Hartington . The state of affairs was critical . Radical after Radical rose to condemn this new outlay , and to express his desire that the country were well out of its Soudanese pickle . The government bench was evidently ill at ease , the vote was defended in a very half-hearted manner , and things generally were looking ugly . Happening to go to the public counter for refreshment , I found my path blocked by two tall figures , whom I was obliged to follow slowly as there was not room in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-known cabinet minister , and I could not help hearing the conversation . They were talking of Gladstone 's attitude towards the unhappy Soudan war . " What is his idea to-day ? " asked the friend of the minister . " Well , " replied the latter , " he is for getting out of the Soudan to-day ; but no one knows what he will think tomorrow . " That one sentence , thus accidentally overheard , indicates in a word the source of the undoubted failure and muddle of the second Gladstone ministry . Its chief could not make up his mind to any definite policy . Mr. Gladstone could not only , as Mr. Foster said , persuade himself ; he has possessed a rare power of persuading other people . He would have made a capital physician , and would have induced his patients to believe themselves worse or better according as he xvished . I have seen him quell an incipient mutiny among his Radical followers with the most charming ease . During Mr. Gladstone 's two first premierships , there were constantly Radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when actually in office , although he relied on the Radicals to get him in . Rumors of some Radical t*meu/e would be noised abroad . The malcontents would come down to the House looking very determined ; it seemed as though there must be a split . But the Grand Old Man would rise , pour forth a flood of words , turn to his Radical friends and treat them to some timely flattery , wave his hand deprecatingly , smile his sweetest ( and his smile is very charming ) , modulate his voice , appeal for party unity - and the trick was done . Serious opposition had literally been charmed away . Mr. Gladstone 's remarkable success in life has been due in no small degree to his health , his capacity for work , and his prodigious memory . When one sees him now one sees a venerable figure bearing the marks of age . The outer skin of the face is almost like parchment , so pale is it and finely lined . But twenty years ago when I first saw him he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ounce of superfluous flesh or fat on his body ; all well-preserved and in perfect condition . From his earliest days his health // has been marvellous . He could sleep at any moment , casting aside easily the weight of public cares , and slumbering as softly as a little child . Like Sir Walter Raleigh , he could " toil terribly " ; and like all firstrate statesmen , he has been endowed with a good memory . A friend told me that at a dinner-party a few years ago at Oxford , at which Mr. Gladstone was present , the conversation happened to turn upon some obscure matter connected with the incomes of some of the Oxford colleges , about which none but an expert could be expected to know . The experts present , however , knew nothing , while Mr. Gladstone came out with the desired information . The same informant told me that a friend happened to call in on Mr. Gladstone two or three days after the Revised Version of the New Testament came out . Mr. Gladstone had been through the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spoke learnedly on the subject . Yet he was then in his sixty-third or sixty-fourth year , and held the double office of Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer , and was holding the threads of debate in the House of Commons every night . Even now he can repeat much of Homer and Dante by heart . He has recently given a French speech in Paris and several Italian speeches in Italy , and in every case without previous preparation . For a leisured man to do this at all is not easy . For a busy man with the affairs of the great globe in his mind , a man arrived at fourscore years , to do it well , is little short of the marvellous . Mr. Gladstone was asked some time ago to name the writers or thinkers who had most influenced him . He named four : Aristotle , Augustine , Dante , and Butler . Certainly the man who chose these as his principal guides did not choose badly . The " master of those who know , " " leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture ; and Mr. Gladstone can never have forgotten the debt he owed to the " Ethics " and " Politics " which he studied as a youth at Oxford . From Augustine he derived probably his almost too powerful conception of the great fabric of Catholic theology and of ecclesiastical authority , which many of his admirers think his chief weakness . Dante , the voice of the medkeval world and the great poet of the mystery of the soul of man , with his art and history and philosophy and political thought , has had an immense fascination over Mr. Gladstone 's mind . And from Butler , inferior to the others and yet greatest of modern Anglican divines , Mr. Gladstone probably learned clearness of thought . Had not Mr. Gladstone been a great statesman , what an admirable professor in his own beloved University would he have made ! I believe some learned scholars do not think very much of his Homeric criticism . But I will undertake to say his lecture rooms would have been more crowded than all the others put together . Mr. Gladstone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The history of the Soudan policy in 1884-85 would seem to indicate that , so far as that series of unhappy incidents was concerned , Mr. Gladstone was not imperious enough . The truth probably is that Mr. Gladstone is somewhat imperious in matters in which he takes a profound interest . Foreign affairs have never had much fascination for him , and he has been accustomed to leave them largely in the hands of specialists . Where he feels at home is in preparing a great measure of domestic policy , like his budget of 1853 , his Reform Bill of i866 , his Irish Church Bill of 1869 , or his Home Rule Bill of r886 . Especially in the last case there is little doubt that he wished to settle a very complicated question almost by himself , with as little outside assistance or interference as possible . He had the same feeling , probably , that animated Clive , who determined to risk the battle of Plassey against the advice of his council of war and on his own judgment . Turning from Mr. Gladstone 's personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it he has done ? Wherein has his action been of significance , and to what has it tended ? Professor Tyndall , who is as egregious a charlatan in politics as he is eminent in physics , and who seems to have been born to illustrate the maxim , ne sutor ultra crepidam , recently told a meeting of Orangemen and landlords in Belfast that , judged objectively ( whatever that may mean ) , Mr. Gladstone was " the wickedest man of his day and generation . " I must apologize for referring to such nonsense as this , but it shows the animus against the Liberal leader . Now , if instead of repeating these absurd charges stimulated by hatred on the one hand , and the meaningless // flattery of Liberal clubs and associations on the other hand , we try to find out what it is that Mr. Gladstone has been and accomplished , we may find it useful . I have been told that , in a private conversation with a distinguished business man in the north of England , Mr. Gladstone said several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial statesman . " In this I believe Mr. Gladstone to have taken a sound estimate of himself and his achievements . The expansion of English commerce and capital has been the main fact of English history during the last sixty years , i.e. during the period , roughly speaking , of Mr. Gladstone 's public life . He started in public life as a follower of Peel , and he changed with his leader . Just as Peel 's mind became convinced by the arguments of Cobden and his associates , so did Gladstone 's . When Peel flung overboard protection , his disciple did so too . And when the small Peelite group finally went over to the Liberal party , Mr. Gladstone naturally went with them ; and being by far the ablest man in the group , he naturally rose to be , next to Palmerston , the most important figure in the House of Commons on the Liberal side . Now so much nonsense has been talked on both sides about free trade , that it is necessary to say just why England adopted it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great act of philanthropy ; to hear others , you might think England had been seriously injured by it . Both notions are absurdly fallacious . England has without question benefited enormously by free trade . She can not maintain her position without it , and any serious revival of protection is impossible , although probably half the Tory party in England is still protectionist at heart . But free trade was not adopted because Lancashire weavers and Irish peasants were starving . They had starved many times without anything being done for them . Statesmen are not usually philanthropists ; and when they pose as such they are usually simply talking cant to catch votes . A statesman is one who obeys the most powerful social force acting in his country at the time . Now for the last two centuries in England the most powerful social force has been that of the wealthy middle class . Not the aristocracy : the mere fact that titled people carried on the government blinds superficial persons to the essence of that government . The rising moneyed class allowed the Whig and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes they allied themselves with the aristocratic houses by marriage . But the aristocracy were merely the agents of the moneyed class . In the last century this new-rich class was protectionist . It strangled Irish manufactures , it thwarted colonial trade , and it invented the huge and elaborate commercial code . The struggle between England and her American colonies grew out of attempts by the English commercial class to restrict American trade . The English manufacturers adopted this protectionist policy because it suited their interests then ; and under it they built up a vast system of manufacturing industry whose growth was aided by the new markets obtained by war and by the backward industrial condition of the Continent . Down to the first quarter of the present century , the manufacturing class believed this protectionist system to be for their advantage , just as the iron-masters of Pennsylvania uphold , in their own interests , the American tariff at the present time . But when the English manufacturing class had become so firmly established as to have no serious rivals , they proposed to fling away the tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They began to see that cheap food and abundant raw material were necessary to maintain the position they had acquired . And just as they had previously supported a tariff for business reasons , so now they proposed to do without one for the same reasons . Again it was not a matter of sentiment , but of solid material interest . And the foresight of the English capitalists has been justified by the results . With the great movement for free trade are associated the names of Huskisson , Cobden , Bright , Peel , Villiers , and Gladstone ; and the greatest of these undoubtedly is the last . For it was Mr. Gladstone who , in his budget of 1853 , as it were , summed up the results of tariff abolition and laid the foundations of the modern English financial system . That work Mr. Gladstone properly regards as among the most important achievements of his life ; and , taken in conjunction with his budget of r 86o and his subsequent financial meas // ures , it may almost count as the most important . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irish questions that we are apt to forget that it is as England 's greatest finance minister of modern times that history will take special note of him . In the next place , Mr. Gladstone is a great administrator , and herein presents a strong contrast to most of the younger English public men . He had the advantage of entering public life younger than most men can to-day , and he held important office at a comparatively early age . Since that time Mr. Gladstone has held office after office under different administrations , and has so gained a wonderful mastery of the complex details of many public departments . Nowadays a man is lucky if he becomes a cabinet minister very much before fifty , and he has not time to make himself familiar with a department before he is forced out of office . But Mr. Gladstone , like Pitt and Fox , like Grey and Canning , like Russell and Palmerston , knows all about the British administrative system , and can feel " the very pulse of the machine . " When Mr. Gladstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he speaks with a vast weight of experience , due not merely to age , but to exceptional opportunity . Mr. Gladstone is also a great Parliamentary leader - one of the greatest of our time . When Palmerston was told of some one that he would always support him when right , the old man broke forth with an oath , " I want men who will support me when I am wrong . " I will not go into the delicate ethical question of party allegiance ; but its test is what Palmerston here indicated . Judged by this test , Mr. Gladstone is undoubtedly a great party leader . It is nothing to say that he was occasionally deserted and defeated by his followers . So were Palmerston , Thiers , Gambetta , and yet no one doubts their pre-eminence as party leaders . The wonder really is , not that he was two or three times deserted , but that he should have compelled so many of his followers to swallow so much that was distasteful to them . In 1876 and 1877 , spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own party to abandon the traditional policy of upholding the Turkish Empire . On the other hand , when the dispute about the franchise question agitated the public mind in 1884 , and when the House of Lords appeared to set itself in opposition to the popular will , all the active Radicals on whom Mr. Gladstone depended for support desired that the opportunity should be taken for striking a blow at the hereditary chamber . The time was propitious , the Lords had no friends outside , the Radicals were clamorous for action , and yet Mr. Gladstone held back and kept his party back too . Some persons may imagine that Mr. Gladstone 's Irish measure of i886 is conclusive proof of his incapacity for leading a great party . It can not be denied that the Liberal leader did not go the happiest way to work in his method of dealing with the crisis that had arisen . He flung himself too suddenly , too palpably , into the arms of the Irish party . He should have disarmed any Liberal opposition by attempting to carry some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural laborers who had helped him into office ; whereas , by his precipitate action , he conveyed the impression of caring less for English laborers than for the Irish vote , and thus furnished his enemies with a handle that was effectually used against him . Then he should have proceeded on the Irish question first by resolution rather than by bill , as he did on the Irish Church question in i868 . And then , thirdly , he should never have weighted Home Rule with the enormous bribe to the Irish landlords , guaranteed out of British public funds . It was this last proposal which really did more than anything else to secure his defeat . And yet , admitting all this and more , do the facts really indicate such poor leadership on Mr. Gladstone 's part ? This question can not be answered till it is understood that Home Rule was the occasion , not the cause , of the Liberal split . That split had already shown itself in the 1885 elections , and indeed long before . It was a split between Whigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold . Had there been no Irish question , the split would have occurred just the same . Supposing Mr. Joseph Chamberlain 's so-called " unauthorized programme " of 1885 had been adopted by Mr. Gladstone at the behest of that shallow egotist , what would have happened ? The Liberal party , in that case , // would not merely have been split ; it would have been utterly smashed beyond possibility of repair . No one acquainted with the inner movements of that critical period but will wonder that Mr. Gladstone carried so many of his followers with him as he actually did . The result was really a triumphant testimony to Mr. Gladstone 's art as a Parliamentary leader . As Mr. Gladstone is a great Parliamentary leader , so is he a powerful popular tribune . It is safe to say that no man in our century has exercised such an influence over the public mind in Great Britain as he . The only approach to it has been the influence of the late Mr. John Bright . It is absurd , however , to compare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would take a hundred Brights to make a Gladstone . Mr. Bright was merely an average Englishman , endowed in a singular degree with the gift of speech . His culture , his habit of mind , his intellectual limitations , his essentially commonplace ideals , were all of the great Philistine middle class to which he belonged . There are hundreds of business men in the north of England , who , except for their lack of eloquence , are Mr. Bright 's equals in every respect . But Mr. Gladstone , like Lassalle , is equipped with all the culture of his time . He knows the best that has been thought and felt by the human mind in all ages . He is equally at home in Greek poetry and Catholic theology , in the Shakespenan drama as in modern politics . And in all his studies he brings the same comprehensive intellect to bear . And while it is true that the average English people know little or nothing of all this mass of learning , they feel the immense spiritual superiority of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , cast in a mightier mould than the ordinary run of politicians . In short , his greater manhood tells on the public mind , his genius attracts and fascinates , as did the genius of Chatham and of Webster . What has been called personal magnetism never has been and never can be a quantit* neg/igeable in politics , and of this quality Mr. Gladstone possesses a most unusual share . Mr. Gladstone 's admirers claim for him , among his other endowments , the highest oratorical power . Having heard him speak probably fifty times during the last twenty years , I differ entirely from this verdict . In my humble judgment , Mr. Gladstone can scarcely be called a true orator at all , certainly not an orator of the highest rank . I fully admit the power of many of his speeches , and the art of nearly all . I admit that he is a great master of the English vocabulary , and that no man can express the different shades of meaning more nicely than he ; but if you search through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in it the characteristic qualities of Mr. Gladstone 's manner of speaking . Milton declares that great poetry must be simple , sensuous , and impassioned ; and I venture to say that great oratory which is an art should present similar features . The really great orators have been terse , epigrammatic , simple in construction , impassioned in spirit . A good example of this is Lincoln 's famous speech on the field of Gettysburg . How simple , yet how deeply affecting ! Its art is that it has no art . It came perfect in form out of the deep , brooding mind of the speaker . Or read the sharp , vehement , passionate declamation of Charles James Fox in his speeches on the peace proposals of 1803 , or on the Westminster scrutiny . Or turn over the volumes of Gambetta 's speeches , and read his denunciations of the MacMahon rt*gime , or his withering scorn of the second empire . Or turn to Mr. Bright 's speeches on the Crimean War or the American Civil War , and note the ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentences . From these turn to any speech of Mr. Gladstone , and mark the contrast . Long , involved sentences , constant saving clauses , and formidable reservations , an utter absence of simplicity , picturesque imagery , or abandon . You think that you have before you a piece of very fine special pleading , a monument of political ingenuity , a skilful word-structure ; but you have not oratory . Of course Mr. Gladstone 's very fine and striking presence counts for much in the actual delivery . But though I never saw Charles James Fox , yet after the lapse of a century , I can read his speeches with the same kind - I do not say the same degree - of pleasure that I can read the poetry of his epoch . But with Mr. Gladstone 's speech of yesterday , though dealing with the topic of the hour , it is not so . Its wordiness and artificiality tire me . There is nothing in it which arouses , inspires , appeals ; nothing which // either kindles ardor or compels me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud or a kind of elaborate or ingenious casuistry than oratory . I allow for occasional instances where the speaker permitted himself to be carried away for a moment by the spirit . In such few cases , his memorable utterances will be found ; but for the rest , I feel certain that posterity will not spend very much time over the speeches of Mr. Gladstone . I pass now to consider xvhat is the nature of the influence which Mr. Gladstone has exerted in English politics . Spite of the judgment of the distinguished man quoted above , that you never could tell what Mr. Gladstone would do next , I maintain that he has been a great conservative force in politics . If I wanted an illustration of the short-sighted and superficial character of the English Conservative party , I should be inclined to cite its treatment of Mr. Gladstone . The difference between his Conservatism and that of the ordinary Tory is , that one is intelligent , the other not . The intelligent Conservative is surely he who has discovered that the world can not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eternal , and who , seeing this , is prepared at the right moment to yield a little , in order to preserve a great deal . The sn-called Conservative is often a very stupid and clumsy agent of revolution by his obstinate adhesion to something that has become untenable . From this point of view , Eldon and Sidmouth were stupid Conservatives when they tried to maintain the old tottering edifice of privilege and corruption against the attacks of the early Radicals . Wellington and Peel , on the other hand , were intelligent Conservatives , when , to avert civil war , they conceded the claims of the Irish Catholics . Peel relapsed into stupidity in his opposition to Parliamentary reform , but showed that he had recovered his intelligence when he capitulated to the Anti-Corn Law League . Had he resisted , he would have brought the whole British social fabric about his ears . One of the most striking instances of stupid Conservatism in modern times was MacMahon 's attempt to deliver France over to the clericals . He did not perceive that the evolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hopeless . Much more dangerous was the Boulangist attempt on the French Republic , because based on a profession of progressist principles . Another signal instance of folly was the jingo policy of Lord Beaconsfield , because determined by an entirely false estimate of the actual social and moral forces at work in contemporary England . We must not be misled by names . On the other hand , the widespread belief that Mr. Gladstone is a really advanced and even Radical politician does not say very much for the intelligence of the English Liberal party . The average Gladstonian conjures up a vision of an ideal Gladstone , which he persists in cherishing , spite of the accumulated mass of evidence against him . Such a person will applaud Mr. Labouchere when that clever and sparkling personage is laying down democratic doctrines to which Mr. Gladstone would not only not adhere , but against which he would vote in Parliament . And yet when Mr. Labouchere in the same breath talks about " our great leader , " the Gladstonian will applaud as loudly as he did before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonest ; it is merely that his intelligence is very imperfectly developed , as the brilliant Mr. Labouchere knows perfectly well . If we follow Mr. Gladstone 's career with attention , we shall see that he generally managed to discover just the right time when some question was ripe for practical settlement . He has nearly always worked along the line of least resistance . He leaves to other men the disagreeable work of initiating new movements ; he has generally opposed such men , but opposed them in such a way as to leave for himself a loophole of escape if he finds his position untenable . Then , when the hour has struck , when the mind of the average party man has been sufficiently developed , when it is safe , or at least not very risky to make the plunge , he comes forward as the leader of the hosts of reform and carries the sentiment of the country with him . He has shown a marvellous faculty for estimating just how much real force there is behind any movement , and reckoning with it accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed in his conduct of affairs during the Civil War . I take it that Lincoln , while himself sympathizing with the cause of abolition , saw that the dominant sentiment in the North was the preservation of the Union ; and therefore he // never allowed himself to be governed by the feeling which actuated such a pure idealist as Wendell Phillips , to whom the maintenance of the Union was a small matter as compared with the destruction of slavery . Mr. Gladstone has never had entrusted to him such a mighty task as that of Lincoln , - a task such as is given to few in history . But his principle of action has been essentially similar . He has estimated aright in the main the resultant of popular forces . I do not mean by this the counting of heads . The mass of people have no opinions worth listening to , and never will , until leisure , education , and opportunity are the lot of all . XVhat I mean is the estimate of those forces which really move the great inert mass - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can do this may not be the highest type of humanity , but most assuredly he must be a pretty high type , with large knowledge , powerful imagination , wide sympathies , practical judgment , skill , and resource . Personally , I admire a pure idealist more than I do this kind of man . All the arts of management and the resources of statecraft are not , in my humble judgment , to be weighed for an instant against the lightest breath of moral idealism . But so long as the political state exists , so long will the politician be a necessity , and indeed a great moral factor in a nation s life . Now the statesman , in the sense in which I have used the word , will always be intelligently conservative . He is distinguished from the stupid conservative by seeing that to conserve it is often necessary to destroy or to largely modify . Conservative stupidity exclaims against this as revolutionary . It is exactly the opposite , thoroughly conservative . And in this sense I claim for Peel and Gladstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen of the century . Let us look at Mr. Gladstone 's actual performances , and we shall see how really conservative he has been , and how utterly fallacious are the estimates of him made both by too ardent friends and too bitter foes . In i866 Mr. Gladstone perceived that the development of the English people had rendered the constitutional settlement of 1832 obsolete , and that the suffrage must be extended . A really advanced and democratic politician would at once have gone for registered manhood suffrage , or at least for such household suffrage as England now possesses . Not so the Russell-Gladstone administration . Mr. Gladstone spoke of the working-classes as being " our own flesh and blood , " used the language of democracy , but introduced a trumpery little bill that conceded just enough to prevent an explosion and just as little as was consistent with the integrity of the semi-aristocratic fabric of government . It was Disraeli who , by declaring definitely for household suffrage and flinging aside the petty Whig compromises , proclaimed himself a very much more revolutionary politician than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish Church , not because it was theoretically an indispensable institution , but in order to remove a real Irish grievance , and so to strengthen the forces of content and conservatism in Ireland . And he did his work in such a way as to make the best terms he possibly could for the disestablished church , - terms scandalously unjust to Ireland and lenient to the Irish state clergy . His English education policy of the following year was similar . It was a patchwork of compromise . Given the need of compulsory education and of a public elementary school system , and this was the kind of measure which accomplished that result with the least injury and at the least cost to sectarian schools . I do not mean to say that the Education Act of I870 was not an important and essentially democratic measure : no such act could possibly help being that . I merely mean that , like all the Gladstonian legislation , it was as little democratic and as thoroughly conservative as any such policy could well be . The Anglican clergy have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladstone was perhaps seen at his worst at the elections of 1874 . He had offended and alienated his Radical allies , and he came before the country practically as a pure Conservative , with one of the lamest and most halting manifestoes ever issued . The truth is , the temper of the country had become conservative , and Mr. Gladstone knew it , so sensitive is he to the public moods . For two years nearly he was comparatively quiet , absorbed in ecclesiastical questions . Then , in the autumn of // 1876 , he blazed out on the Bulgarian atrocities , and in the next year he executed his new departure by denouncing the old Anglo-Turkish alliance . Many people whose own heads were not very securely fastened thought he had lost his . I heard at the time serious discussions as to his sanity . But he was really the European political barometer ; he saw that the Turkish Empire must go , that it was condemned politically and morally , and that England must be saved any participation in its crimes and disasters . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purblind clubmen in Pall Mall were questioning his sanity and predicting his annihilation , he was sweeping all before him throughout the country . When the Irish Land League rose in i 88o to formidable proportions , Mr. Gladstone saw that an agrarian crisis had arisen in Ireland . His act of i88i was designed to aid the tenants at the smallest expense to the landlords . It was no democratic measure in any sense . It was hand-tomouth legislation . It was designed not to settle the land question , but to give the Irish landlords a further chance , to prop up landlordism . I have alluded to the franchise crisis of 1884 , and the attack to which the House of Lords laid itself open . Any real democratic leader would have welcomed that opportunity to crush the House of Lords . The people were ready , or at any rate very good judges thought so ; certainly the effective fighting force of the Radical party was ready . The only possible explanation of Mr. Gladstone 's refusal to challenge the peers to combat was that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Lords destroyed . This is confirmed by two facts : ( r ) He has persistently refused to vote for the successive resolutions moved by Mr. Labouchere against hereditary legislation . ( 2 ) He has created more peers than any other premier of our time , and has thereby done all he could to buttress and fortify the House of Lords . Some critics would admit all the foregoing instances , but would contend that when he took up the Home Rule cause Mr. Gladstone ceased to be conservative , and became for once revolutionary . Now let us consider this , for I am of opinion that Mr. Gladstone 's essential conservatism never stood out more clearly than when he determined to do what he could to put an end to the Anglo-Irish quarrel . The case probably presented itself to his mind somewhat in this way : The Act of Union has been tried for eighty-five years , and has been a failure . The two countries are as wide apart as ever , and exceptional laws must constantly be enacted for Ireland . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The longer this state of things goes on , the more difficult will be the settlement . The elections in Ireland have shown what is the real feeling there . In Mr. Parnell we have to deal with the most conservative Irish leader we are ever likely to see ; can we not make terms with him ? Parliament is burdened with Irish work , and its efficiency is threatened by the existence there of a large Irish party thoroughly disaffected , and offering permanent opposition to every successive English ministry . There is dead-lock ahead , and it must be prevented . That can only be done by satisfying the reasonable demands of Ireland for the restoration , under new conditions , of its national legislative body . This is how Mr. Gladstone , with his vast experience and keen insight , may have argued . Some superficial people come forward with trite objections which they seem to suppose never occurred to Mr. Gladstone 's mind . It is only rational to suppose that he turned over objection after objection in his mind , weighed each and disposed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may not bring objections . Take some of those Mr. Gladstone dealt with . The bogy of foreign invasion : An Irish Parliament may make Ireland a base of operations for a possible French invasion of England . True , she may . But , contends Mr. Gladstone , Ireland could not be a greater source of danger under Home Rule than she is now , especially since , as under the bill of i886 , the Irish Parliament has no military or naval force at its disposal . At present , if England and France went to war , the first thing the English government would be compelled to do would be to double the English army in Ireland . How can you speak of that as a condition of security ? The real danger exists now ; while there is the possibility ( to use no stronger term ) that genuine confidence in the Irish democracy would be repaid by cheerful and // cordial alliance . The policy of suspicion and hate has done little : why not try the opposite policy of conciliation and respect ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly . But the Irish are not fit for self-government . Will they ever be fit , Mr. Gladstone may be conceived as replying , till they have fitted themselves by actual use ? It is the old argument that you should ever go into the water till you have learnt to swim . To make the Irish leaders responsible for their own country 's order will render them conservative and orderloving as nothing else can . But under a Home Rule Parliament the Catholics will persecute the Protestants . To this Mr. Gladstone can reply , out of the abundant evidence at his disposal , that the facts are all the other way . These are some of the considerations , all , be it noted , of a purely conservative character , that may Mr. Gladstone and his Grandchild . // have suggested themselves to Mr. Gladstone 's mind . The actual bill of 1886 was a most able piece of constructive statesmanship , to which justice has never been done . And if Home Rule in any form is to be carried , it will be carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement for converting the United Kingdom into a federal union assumes more solid character . In especial the conservative character of the bill has never been fully recognized . It provided for a legislative body dominated over by property - by the gentry and rich people of Ireland . It is true that the course of events would have turned this body into a democratic one , but the obvious intention of those who framed it was to hand over the government of Ireland to the Irish landlords and their friends . And the accompanying land bill proposed to give /150,000,000 on British guarantee to this landlord class And these were the measures which the Irish landlords rejected I venture to assert that greater folly was never displayed by any class than by those stupid conservatives who deliberately rejected such an offer . It will certainly never be repeated , and conservatism of the stupid sort will long have cause to regret that it did not close with the bargain . Mr. Gladstone 's inherent conservatism came out very clearly in his attitude towards the royal grants , when he voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with singular unction a devoted servant of the monarchy . It came out also as clearly when , in a recent speech at Hawarden , Mr. Gladstone went out of his way to eulogize the present system of English land tenure in a passage which must have caused to many of his Radical supporters no little disgust . And it comes out most sharply in his attitude to the New Radicalism , as it is called , i.e. quasisocialism . Not only does Mr. Gladstone not sympathize with the new movement , he evidently does not even understand it . To him the mere freedom of trade achieved forty or fifty years ago marked finality in the relations of labor to the state . He is obviously not a little pained and puzzled by the enormous aggregations of wealth on the one hand and the poverty and struggle for bare existence on the other . XVere he twenty years younger , his mind might open to the new ideas concerning land and labor . But as it is , there is no chance . Trained in the old , decaying political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedded to the commercial idea of half a century ago , it would be idle to expect him to share in the new ideas which have taken hold of nearly all the younger men in the party of which he is rather the nominal than the actual leader . He has had a great career , and he may fairly repose on his laurels now .
