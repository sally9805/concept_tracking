txt The opposition to the removal of the duty on iron ore has no reasonable or decent basis , even from the point of view of the protectionist . It is kept alive only by the desire of certain American producers of iron to handicap certain other American producers less favorably situated so far as nearness to domestic supplies of raw material is concerned , and by the desire of Republican politicians to mislead ignorant voters employed in the Western mines . It is admitted even by those persons in Alabama who demand that the duty shall be retained , that iron can be and is made in Northern Alabama at a cost lower than the cost of production in any other part of the world . We have heretofore pointed out the admission . Within a few days there has been published . in Southern trade journals and elsewhere the evidence and the admission that pig iron is now being produced in Alabama at a cost of only ; 6.60 per ton . This showing can not be equaled in Europe or in the Northern furnaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for an argument on the part of the Alabama ore miners and iron makers in support of a duty on ore . When the hill was pending in Congress , four years ago , reference was frequently made to the fact that the price at Cleveland of Bessemer iron ore from the Lake Superior mines was $6 per ton . The price at that port is now , and for some time has been , only $2.75 . This great reduction has been caused chiefly by the discovery and development of the enormous surface deposits in the Mesaba district , where ore is taken out and placed upon freight cars with steam shovels , at a cost of production amounting to only a few cents per ton . The mines of the Lake Superior district need no tariff protection , even from the protectionist 's point of view . The old deep mines in that region do need to be protected against the competition of the new surface deposits , but tariff duties can not help them . Owing to the general industrial depression caused by the silver panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines , the miners in the Lake Superior district have suffered from a reduction of wages or a loss of work , and Republican demagogues have undertaken , with deplorable success , to convince them that their unsatisfactory condition is due to pending tariff legislation and the proposed removal of the duty on iron ore . This is not the cause , and these demagogues know ' it . Added to the senseless opposition from Alabama , and the opposition fomented in the Lake Superior district by Republican politicians , is the opposition  --  possibly more influential ? of the manufacturers west of the Alleghenies , who procure their ore from the Lake Superior region . The reduction of the cost of ore has given them a great advantage over other manufacturers between the Alleghenies and the Atlantic , who must import ; ore because the cost of transportation from Lake Superior prevents them from using the domestic product . So far as the opposition of these men is concerned , the contest over the iron ore duty is wholly an American and sectional or geographical one . The manufacturers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never before have needed it , but they are not to have it if their . rivals in the Pittsburg and Ohio and Illinois iron districts can withhold it from them .
