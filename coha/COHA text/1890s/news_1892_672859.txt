txt The early call of the New-York State Democratic Convention to choose delegates to the National Convention is In a measure having the efteet it Was intended to have in Connecticut . The call for the State Convention here has not been issued , but the Hill men are as industriously at work all over the State as if the Connecticut Convention was to be coincident with the one in Albany . They have picked out their candidates for delegates to the National Convention in every county in the State , and are strengthening their lines in all directions . Little thus far has been done in opposition to the Hill men . The Democrats who , from character and influence , might be expected to oppose the building up of a Hill machine in Connecticut , have been more Interested in the long-drawn-out fight over the result of the last State election . They do not like Hill , but in their eyes the State Issue has for the time being been greater than . the Presidential one . The shrewd Hill manipulators have taken advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . He and his lieutenants believe and say that they are sure of the delegations from New-York and New-Jersey . If they can add to those the Connecticut delegation , they oan be able to say to the convention that their candidate has the backing of three doubtful States , three States whose Electoral votes are needed for Democratic success . More than a year ago Hill began his efforts to secure Connecticut , when he impudently denied the right of the Acting Governor of the State to issue a requisition on New-York for a fugitive criminal The work for Hill since then has been persistent . He has secured many of the most active Deniooratio workers in the State , men who admire his kind of politico , and who believe . as he does , that etealing is legitimate means in politics when other means fail Here in New-Haven the candidate for county delegate who represents Hill and nillism is Alexander Troup , who has more than once been repudiated by the Democrats of his own town , and who will be repudiated again . In published communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps he does n't since William H. Barnum died ) and that if chosen as a delegate he will act for the best interests of the party . He dare not say that he is opposed to Cleveland ? he filled a Federal office under Cleveland  --  and he is careful not to say that he is opposed to HIM But it is not necessary that he should announce his preference . Everybody knows that he is working for Hill . He believes in and practices the Hill kind of politics . He is a spoilsman of the spoilsmen , holding rigidly to the motto " to the victors belong the spoils . " He publicly scoffed at President Cleveland 's civil service reform declarations while holding an office in the Cleveland Administration which Chairman Barnum demanded for him . And if he can not have all the spoils he is willing to divide . A few years ago when there was a movement on foot to secure a consolidation of the ' 3 . ? TcwHaven Town and City Government , Mr. Troup 's newspaper opposed the effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation disclosed the fact that $250 of a sum of money illegally appropriated from the town 's Treasury by the Selectmen to be used in lobbying against the Consolidation bill found its way into Troup 's hands . That is a matter of recordTroup does not deny it . Rather , he justifies it as a retaining fee . While absolutely honest in private dealings , Troup applies a different code of ethics to politics . The strongest supporters of Troup 's candidacy here are the two Democratic members of . a local " Big Four " of unsavory notoriety . What a Republican legislative majority termed a nonpartisan. board , when they were tinkering the Now-Haven charter with a political purpose , is the local Board of Pablo Works . It is composed of three . Republicans and three Democrats , chosen by the Board of Aldermen . After several fights and consequent dead-locks over an equitable distribution of the spoils , four members of the board , two Republicans and two Democrats , formed a combination . That is the Big Four . " The Democratic end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas H. Sullivan . The former is an officer of the Consolidated Railroad Company , who once represented this Senatorial district , or rather his employers , the railroad company , in the Legislature at a critical period in the light against the " parallel " Sullivan is a saloon keeper , who at a recent city election was repudiated by his own ward . He got into the Board of Public Works by an unholy combination between Republican and Democratic Aldermen , by which the Democratic caucus nominee was traitorously defeated . Sullivan 's saloon is the headquarters of the Hill forces here ' and Troup is a frequent caller there . For other reasons than the spoils Troup is a Hill man . He has never had any ardent sympathy with tariff reform . It is a subject which Is beyond him . And on the silver question he would be opposed to a man with Cleveland 's views , while having hopes of Hill . Troup wants more silver . He wanted more greenbacks a few years ago , and was a prominent member of the Greenback Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . More greenbacks then and more silver now might , he thinks , help him to coax better fortune in the newspaper business , which he follows as an incident to politics . Like Hill , he is a Democrat , but a heavy mortgage on one of the papers in which he is interested is held by a Republican , while the other paper which he assumes to run is owned by a Republican syndicate . He is in politics , as he is in the newspaper business , for what lie can get out of it . That a majority of the Democrats of NewHaven County will deliberately choose Troup as their representative to the Chicago Convention is preposterous . He can only succeed through political manipulation and the apathy of the voters . The sentiment of the county is undoubtedly opposed to Hill and in favor of Cleveland or of some one who represents the broad issues of tariff reform and a safe finance . All that is necessary is to wake that , sentiment up to - what is being attempted , and the work of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended upon to send two men to Chicago who will not be selooted in advance of caucus nominations at David B. Hill 's headquarters in Albany .
