NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE . JULY , 1897 . VOL . XVI . No.5 . THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLEGE ARCHITECTURE IN AMERICA . By As/zto ; i B. Willard . I THINK we all occasionally feel a certain regret that our Puritan ancestors should have carried their Puritanism into their ideas of art and architecture and so rigidly excluded from their first attempts at making a home for their higher school of learning the severe , calm and tranquil idea of the cloistered college built around its quadrangles . On the most superficial examination of the subject we are compelled to concede that American college architecture was from the beginning Congregational , and not Anglican . The idea of the dormitory building , the class room building a n d the officebuilding as units in t h e m s elves , and not as united m e m - bers of one whole is the idea which we see applied from the start . The Oxford College brings all its members t o g e t h e r in serried array around its quadrangle ; there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and the dormitory ; they stand united like a group of Anglican communities under a bishop . In the American idea there is no such union . Take that primitive group at Harvard , of which two buildings , Massachusetts and Harvard Halls , still remain , and upon examining the angles of these several elements of the approximate quadrangle we find not the slightest indication of any intention ever to join them together . They stood as separate as the Congrega 513 NEW SERIES . HARVARD COLLEGE , 1726. // tional churches under the early ecclesiastical polity of New England . A simple glance at the Oxford quadrangles gives us a pretty clear idea of the source from which the original idea there so charmingly applied was derived . The obviousness of the derivation directly from the cloister is made all the more clear and logical when we reflect that when the university originated learning was the province of ecclesiastics ; the young men went when the ideas of a higher education were in their infancy to the monastery , and afterward to something w h i c h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can well resemble another . Put a Benedictine monk of the fifteenth century in the midst of the cloistered quadrangle of Magdalen College today , and he would find little to marvel at ; the grouping and massing of the buildings would seem to him extremely natural . In the first group of buildings at Harvard , Massachusetts Hall was simply an enlargement of the form of building then used in Boston and the neighboring towns for t h e dwelling house , for the warehouse and for almost every possible purpose except the church . The o 1 d Cradock house at Medford is a good example of the style . The Cradock house was a double square on the ground plan ; it was two stories high , and it had a gambrel roof ; it was built of brick , with a projecting horizontal course between the first and second story windows ; the chimneys were at the ends . These identical features were carried over into Massachusetts Hall , with only such changes as the difference in the conditions demanded . The gambrel roof was repeated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ornamental courses of brickwork ; and , furthermore , the proportions of the building were closely similar . The only material differences were that the WEST COLLEGE , WILLIAMS COLLEGE . KING 'S ( COLUMBIA ) COLLEGE , 1790. // Harvard College building was given three stories instead of two , and two entrances instead of one , because it was intended to furnish space for many more rooms , and needed an additional entrance to make the rooms more easily accessible . Very few of the other American colleges have any gambrel-roofed buildings , for the reason that a more elegant style speedily came into vogue . Strange as it may seem , the more refined ideas of the late Italian renaissance , which found their way to England , and were applied in ordinary domestic and semi-domestic architecture , also struggled over here to our remote New England settlements and rendered the gambrel roof unpopular . Pailadio began to be adapted early in the eighteenth century for English use . His pillared and balustraded buildings were revised and corrected so as to be applicable to English rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a high roof , with an awkward bend in the middle , was a deformity . The gable , if introduced at all , was admitted only as a decorative feature in the form of a pediment with very flat inclines , introduced at the centre of the front , sometimes with and sometimes without columns or pilasters . The original buildings of Kings ( now Columbia ) College , in New York , as shown by a print published in 1790 , had no less than four low , flat gables on the front , one over the centre of each entry to the building . The idea of a portico was suggested by bringing the front of the building beneath each gable slightly forward , but there were no columns or pilasters . The roof sloped upward at a very low incline , and the balustrade was placed at the summit of this slope against the sky . At Harvard we have as examples of the same style the old dormitories inside of the enlarged quadrangle ,  --  the quadrangle which was mapped out when the original building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removed , and which is now much more appropriately called the " Yard , " the term quadrangle having been from the first inappropriate . Hollis ( 1763 ) , Stoughton ( 1805 ) and Holworthy ( 1812 ) are the more ancient of this group , and Hollis the most thoroughly characteristic . It has the low , sloping roof , without any gable at the ends , and with nothing of the gable THE OLD BUILDINGS , AMHERST COLLEGE . // description about it except the low , ornamental pediments in the middle of the long sides . It also has the projecting horizontal courses of brickwork , like those of Massachusetts Hall , which are intended to represent the entablatures dividing the different stories in classic architecture ; and these relief courses stop short before they reach the end of the building , as if the builders had had some idea of placing pilasters at the corners , and had then left their purpose unexecuted . These three old halls have another feature which is almost invariably present in college structures in England , the feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls with no longitudinal halls ; so that the lodging rooms are arranged almost like houses on a city street . This same system impresses everyone who goes from college to college at Oxford to note the peculiarities of their design , the longitudinal halls being almost invariably omitted , and no provision being made for reaching the apartments in one entry from the apartments in another except by going out into the court . The earliest of the college buildings at Yale was a wooden structure built in 1717-18 , standing near where the Osborn recitation hall now stands , and removed some time before the beginning of the present century . An engraving of it is preserved in the Chittenden library building . The oldest of the existing college buildings at Yale is the hall known as South Middle , constructed in 1750-52 , and at present entirely surrounded by more modern buildings . It was originally built in the form of Massachusetts Hall at Harvard , and was expressly intended by its designers to repeat the lines of that structure , which , it seems , had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is an old engraving of this hall , as it stood in 1786 , in the Chittenden library . Like Massachusetts Hall , it has three stories and a gambrel roof , two entrances , twin chimneys at each end and projecting horizontal bands of brick at the level of each story . South Middle , as it stands to-day , does not very closely resemble Massachusetts Hall , because it has been two or three times made over . In 1797 the gambrel roof was removed and the brick walls were carried up another story ; and the roof which was constructed above this additional story did not preserve the old form . A glance at the end of the building reveals the fact that the gables were not always constructed as at present . The space between the original slope of the brickwork in the old gambrel-gable and the present vertical line of the corner , which it was necessary to fill up when the front and rear walls were carried up another story , is constructed of rather clumsily laid brickwork , which still shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball at Yale seems never to TRINITY COLLEGE , HARTFORD . // have been built quite as solidly as its Harvard model , for the levels are today much more broken and the whole building is in a decidedly more advanced state of decay . The original builders of the college at New Haven and those who continued their work between 1750 and 1850 seem to have distinctly discarded the idea of building anything like a quadrangle . What they preferred was a straight line ; and for nearly a hundred years after the construction of South Middle everything was placed in a row ; so that at the end of the century the buildings in which the college was housed resembled nothing so much as a train of cars . To make the application of this simile more wholly accurate , I should say that they resembled a train of cars with three locomotives placed crosswise between the first and second , second and third , and third and fourth cars of the train . These locomotives were the Athenaeum , built in 1761-63 , the Lyceum , built to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel , completed in 1824 . The Athenaeum , Lyceum and Chapel had their long axes east and west , and fronted toward College Street ; all the other buildings had their long axes north and south parallel with College Street . Several prints of the old " row** are now preserved . One of them , dated 1807 , hangs in the entrance hall of the Chittenden library , and shows the sequence of buildings as they stood before the chapel of 1824 and North College were built . The print possesses an additional interest for undergraduates of to-day from the circumstances that the draftsman saw fit to introduce in the foreground a party of young gentlemen , probably collegians , playing football . It must be conceded that they go at it in a rather languid way , and that their bell-crowned silk hats and long-tailed coats seem rather unprofessional when compared with the football costume at present in vogue . A later view of the row , inserted as the frontispiece of a small book about Yale College printed in 1843 , shows the sequence of old buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their places . South Middle was the only hall built at Yale with a gambrel roof . Before the date of the construction of THE COMPLETE PLAN FOR TRINITY COLLEGE . // the next building in the row ( South College ) , which was built in * the style had changed ; and not only was this new hall given a plain triangular gable , but it was thought necessary to alter the roof of South Middle so as to correspond to it . Of the seven buildings which constituted the old row at Yale only three now remain . South College had to be removed to clear the ground for the construction of Vanderbilt Hall in 1893 , and the old Chapel which stood just north of it had also to come down at about the same time . South Middle and the Lyceum still stand ; then there comes a gap where North Middle once stood ; and finally we reach North College , the last of the remaining buildings of the old group . These weather-beaten relics of the old institution are now surrounded by a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing before 1840 ; so that in the course of fifty years the entire outward aspect of Yale College has been changed . In several other American colleges the plan was adopted of constructing the college buildings in a row and not in the form of a quadrangle . One thinks of Amherst and Williams and Princeton and Bowdoin , of Brown University and Wesleyan University , the University of Vermont at Burlington , the old Western Reserve College in Ohio , of Andover Theological Seminary and many other institutions . At Dartmouth College , founded in 1769 , the first three buildings were placed in a row , but the fourth buildlug broke through this system of arrangement , and was placed so as to form a second side of an anticipated three-sided square . The three-sided square , that is to say , a square with three sides , formed of buildings not coming together at the corners and with the fourth side formed of a fence , seems to have been the farthest that our ancestors ever thought of advancing toward the English quadrangle idea of college construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importation of ultra-classical ideas of art into this country in the second quarter of the present century and the influence exerted upon college archi GIRARI ) COLLEGE , MAIN BUILDING . // tecture by the new aesthetic movement which produced the Sub-Treasury building in New York , the granite Custom House in Boston and other buildings in other parts of the country , with pillars , porticoes and pediments . All this architecture was in the day of it commonly called " Grecian . " We regard it now simply as one phase of the comprehensive movement toward a revival of the forms of Greek and Roman art , which goes back for its origin to the discovery of the buried treasures of Pompeii about the middle of the last century . The architects of this classical revival contented themselves at first with imitating the ancient monuments standing at Rome . After the publication of Stuart and Revett 's book on Athens , it was discovered that Roman architecture was merely a pale reflection of Greek architecture , and that if the modern designer wished to go to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must not stop at the Pantheon , but must go back to the Parthenon . Thomas Jefferson appears to be entitled to rank as one of the pioneer architects of this country by virtue of the influence which he exerted on the form of the buildings of the University of Virginia , a college which was provided between 1819 and 1826 with a set of buildings in the first phase of the classical style , with a reduced copy of the Pantheon as the principal feature of the group . Jefferson , as is well known , spent certain very impressionable years of his life at Paris , and although he cultivated certain democratic airs , he was at heart an aristocrat , and loved to surround himself with what was stately and beautiful . All the illustrated histories of the United States have woodcuts of his home at Monticello , which , with its classical architecture , shows the ambitious and aristocratic character of his tastes ; and when , after having served his term as President , he tried to find occupation and distraction in creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains upon the architectural design , and determined that it should be in accord with the advanced aesthetic ideas which he had imbibed in Europe . It is apparent that their artistic aspect ARCADE , LELAND STANFORD UNIVERSITY . // was the foremost consideration and utility a secondary one . The reduced model of the Pantheon , with its portico , its pediment and its low , saucershaped dome , stood at the centre of one end of a long , open square called " the lawn , " and on either side of this square was a continuous colonnade , broken by five porticoes ; the five porticoes representing the fronts of the professors ' houses , and the colonnades forming a covered gallery to connect them and place them all in communication with each other . A design like this , executed in marble , would have been sumptuous ; executed in wood , or at best in brick and plaster , its grandeur could hardly have been more than theatrical . Subsequent generations have been rather disposed to laugh at Jefferson for his naive overlooking of certain primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain trait in his make-up which was rather uncommon among Americans of his time , namely a perception of the beauty of harmonious lines ; and the ALEXANDER HALL , PRINCETON UNIVERSITY . present generation will be disposed to pardon him his utilitarian oversights in view of the service which he rendered in slightly turning the general trend of American thought from the ultra-practical , in holding up before them in an authoritative way the idea that " looks " had at least some title to be considered , and that utility was not the sole thing which should enter into the builder 's mind . The Grecian idea had its day of popularity also in New England , and while the pillared style was in vogue a number of college halls were built , some of which are still standing . Of the two first college buildings of Trinity College at Hartford , constructed in 1824 and called respectively Jarvis and Seabury Halls , the latter was in this style . Seabury Hall , which had an Ionic portico , was designed by S. F. B. Morse , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sort of work , the invention of the electric telegraph . Both Seabury and Jarvis Halls at Trinity were pulled down some time before i88o to clear the site for the present state capitol . Grecian architecture enjoyed for twenty years great favor in New England . Every old country town has its two or three w h it e pillared mansions in this style , with their pediments a n d their low pitched roofs , from which the snow has to be laboriously shoveled after every snow-storm by " hired men , " or persons of superior station in t h e household , who no doubt accompany t h i s disagreeable // COLLEGE ARCHITECTURE . work with many an inward malediction on Greek ideas in art and all who were concerned in their importation into this country . The most conspicuous example of college building in the ultra-classical style is the central building of Girard College at Philadelphia , a marble structure erected between 1833 and 1847 , and made to conform very closely upon the exterior to the model of the Parthenon , saving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinthian instead of Doric . Girard College was the first example of a college building in this country erected at a cost of over a million dollars . The expenditure ( $1,933,821.78 ) was something enormous for the times ; and when the Greek temple was completed , the college itself , which was to be housed within its marble walls , had hardly any means with which to meet its running expenses without going outside of the funds originally reserved for its support . Since that day the tendency of college trustees to put too much money into architecture has been frequently made a reproach against them ; but in this particular case it appears that the builders of the remarkable structure were simply obeying the directions given by its founder . Girard left in his will most minute directions as to how the college was to be constructed . Certain paragraphs of that instrument read precisely like an architect 's specifications to a contractor . One of the things upon which he was most insistent was that the building should be absolutely fireproof . Not a particle of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors or in the roof ; everything was required to be built in the most substantial way ; and in those days building substantially meant building at a tremendous expense . Those who have inspected the building remember the peculiar impression made by the interior . The whole edifice is simply a case of bank vaults , and seems meant to serve as a treasury building for a government which has millions in gold and silver to be stored away in some edifice of colossal strength , where moth and rust can not corrupt nor thieves break through or steal . I do not find that Girard definitely prescribed the use of columns on the exterior , but the expense incurred in setting up this row of Corinthian shafts was not alone the cause of the lavish expenditure . After 1840 architecture at American colleges was almost wholly given over to the Gothic style . The romantic NEW D0RMi'i'UKIt* , *i'dVERS1TY OF PENNSYLVANIA . // movement which had begun to definitely affect all literary and artistic production in Europe as early as 1820 , began at length to make itself felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading features of the romantic movement was a renewed interest in the life of the middle ages , an interest which concerned not merely its substance , but its outward aspects . Indeed , its concern with the substance of mediaeval life was relatively slight , and it was its picturesque trappings which really fascinated the public mind and gave the movement its success . The first of the Gothic buildings at Yale was the old library , which still exists , although supplanted in practical usefulness by the recently constructed Chittenden library . The Gothic library was built between 1843 and 1846 , and was placed upon High Street , forming the first of the circuit of modern buildings , which have since entirely surrounded the college square and shut out the old row from view . The library , which was built of brown stone , was followed by Alumni Hall , constructed of the same material , in 1852 , and made to conform also to the principles of Gothic architecture , as they were then understood . Alumni Hall has only one very serious disfigurement , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step removed from the canvas architecture of the stage . They might easily be replaced by stone battlements of the same design ; and this I conceive would be regarded by any architect as a perfectly legitimate piece of restoration . From 1852 down to the present time every one of the halls which have been built inside the college square at Yale ,  --  Farnham Hall ( 1864-69 ) , the Art School ( 1864-66 ) , Durfee Hall ( 1870 ) , IBattell Chapel ( 1874-76 ) , Dwight Hall ( i886 ) , Lawrance Hall ( 1887 ) , Osborn Hall ( 1889 ) , Chittenden library ( 1890 ) , Welch Hall ( 1891 ) , Vanderbilt Hall ( 1894 ) , and Phelps Hall ( I896 ) ,  --  have been built in a Gothic or mediaeval style , and the primitive architectural character of the college has been virtually effaced . Having once commenced to build according to a different principle , how- // ever , it was judicious to continue upon the same line . The newer buildings may differ considerably among themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic and others romantic ; and such divergence as exists will disappear in the course of time . Vanderbilt Hall , built by Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt in memory of their son , W. H. Vanderbilt , which is one of the most recent of the Yale buildings in the mediaeval style , is entirely constructed of brown stone , and is honest and solid in construction to a point of which the early New England builders formed no conception . To take a single example , none of the primitive Gothic builders in this country , except the architect of Trinity Church and one or two buildings in or near New York , thought of constructing a vaultof solidstonework . Their Gothic was only skin deep ; it had to do simply with exteriors and facades ; and even in their faqades they contented themselves with using wood in many cases where the simplest principles of honesty in construction would have required the use of stone . In the case of Vanderbilt Hall , not only is the whole visible exterior from turret to foundation stone constructed of solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the heart of the building and serves as one of the entrances of the larger quadrangle beyond . The interior of this passageway is entirely lined with stone , and the honesty of the masonry exhibits no flaw anywhere . The same solidity of construction is a notable feature of the new Phelps Hall , bridging the only space left open between the older buildings on the side toward College Street , this structure also ( which is more a tower than a " hall , " in the old-fashioned sense of the term ) being pierced by a broad passageway which is vaulted in stone through its entire length . Side by side with this consistent return to the essential principles of Gothic construction , it is interesting to note a piece of extra-modernness . Phelps Hall is provided with an elevator , and ALPHA DELTA PHI HOUSE , AMHERST. 5CROLL AND KEY HALL , YALE . // the approach to this contrivance of yesterday is directly from this vaulted passageway which smacks so strongly of the middle ages . The project of the new group of buildiugs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest attempt in this country to realize what so many have always wished to see realized , the application of the quadrangle system to American college building . The old president of Trinity College , Dr. Jackson , who managed , or assisted to manage , the sale of the old college property to the city of Hartford as a site for the proposed new state capitol , made a journey to England to talk over plans for the new building , and was quite fascinatedbythe magnificent project which the English architect William Burges traced out before him . Mr. Burges , finding that he had a hopeAHMER5T COLLEGE CHAPEL . COLLEGE ARCHITECTURE . ful client in Dr. Jackson , went further with the plan and had it executed in water color with all its cleverly composed masses and details set out in the appropriate colors until the picture was something which it made one s mouth water to look at . When brought over to this country it captivated not only Dr. Jackson , but the other persons in whose hands lay the authority to determine upon plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions an American architect was sent over to London to confer with the author of the design and to reduce the general idea to specific form . Architecture is not like music ; the project which the architect prepares for some vast composition is not like the score for some grand opera , written in hieroglyphics interpretable only by experts and meaningless to the average mind until so interpreted . Mr. Burges ' picture could , when it was fresh , be seen and appreciated without any interpreter to make its meaning clear ; and the reproduction of it can still be seen and appreciated and the harmonies and leading motives enjoyed even though they have never been rendered as their projector intended they should be . Upon the first glance at the ambitious plan one is reminded of another group of buildings , mapped out on quite as ex WALKER ART BUILDING , BOWDOIN COLLEGE . // qwq is composed of the western side of the central quadrangle , appropriated in the original design principally to students ' rooms and halls for recitations and lectures . Except for one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does not too obviously force upon the observer the fact that it is a mere limb of a body of which the trunk is lacking . Abandoning , for the time at least , the attempt to go on with the original project , the authorities at Trinity College have admitted other buildings detached from the nucleus of the original group and differing from it in architecture . In short , the quadrangle plan , planted with great hope , has failed to take root in the soil of Hartford , and the more normal form of American college building , that of the detached structure , has grown up in SAYLES MEMORIAL HALL , BROWN UNIvERsITY . its stead . We are compelled , therefore , to look elsewhere for more successful experiments in quadranglebuilding ; and we find a strikingly original application of the idea in the building of the Leland Stanford , Jr. , University in California . The quadrangle at Leland Stanford , Jr. , was developed in the form of a great hollow square , suggesting far more than it suggests the traditional English college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded with low arcades as a shelter from the heat of the sun . Around this quadrangle and on the side farthest from the court are placed a number of semidetached buildings of the same style of architecture as the inner arcade ; and beyond these it was intended to build still another arcade of larger circuit which should embrace the whole group . This last phase of the project remains at present unrealized . The architecture of the great inner quadrangle is Richardsonian . At Palo Alto the belief has taken root that Richardson himself originated the design ; but in the list of works designed in whole or in part by Richardson , appended to his biography by Mrs. Van Rensselaer , no mention is SCHERMERHORN HALL , COi*uiv1n1A U INI v ftK*1 I // made of the California college . It may have been one of those inchoate designs talked of but not put upon paper by the great man , defined , perhaps in conversation with his associates who went on with the work after his death , but which never received visible form from his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps of assistants who have come to understand thoroughly his processes and his methods , can almost dictate his work stenographically , as Dora used to dictate his pictures , the work remaining in the end substantially authographic , despite the assistance rendered by others in carrying it out . The Leland Stanford , Jr. , plan is not likely to be repeated anywhere else for several reasons , the two most obvious ones being the utilitarian and aesthetic drawbacks of the system . The American mind loves , in architecture , something which will stand up high , something with a touch at least of the soaring and aspiring character about it , and something which shall have , if it can be by any possibility introduced , a broken sky line . The Palo Alto buildings are as far as possible removed from this ideal ; they cling to the ground , and their sky line is virtually fiat . On the utilitarian side , the drawbacks are at least sufficient to create a further discouragement in the way of reproducing the same arrangement of buildings elsewhere . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command the space requisite for carrying out such a plan ; and if they could , the loss in compactness and in convenience of access between the buildings would tend to prevent the adoption of the Palo Alto system . On the whole , it is no matter of regret that the Leland Stanford , Jr. , University should have been constructed as it is , because it furnishes such a wholly strange and novel term in the American vocabulary of college architecture . It stands unique , almost as if one of the great Carthusian convents of Italy , with its vast cloister , encircled by its row of little houses for the monks , had been imported to this country and dropped down on the fiat soil of California ; and it is destined , with little doubt , to retain this unique position as long as the buildings stand . One further partial application of the quadrangle plan may be alluded to ,  --  the court of St. John 's at Cambridge . St. John 's , as is well known , is a divinity school of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but having no organic connection with it . It was founded in 1867 , and the various buildings in which it is now housed , lying on Brattle Street , not far from the Longfellow house , have all sprung up since that date . A long dormitory building constructed of yellowish brown stone , a recitation and library building , and a dining hall , all of the same material and designed substantially in the same style , are so put together as to form three sides of a square . Looking in at them from the street , one has somewhat the impression of a quadrangle as it would be arranged on the stage , with the fourth side cut away to make it possible for the spectator to look into the interior . Something of the sense of seclusion , of tranquillity , of protection from the rush and hurry of coming and going , something , in short , of the effect of an eddy setting back from the current of the stream , has been produced by this fashion of building . Three other structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dean 's house and a second dormitory , built comparatively recently , have not been annexed to the quadrangle , but occupy positions entirely detached . I do not know whether it is the intention to carry the quadrangle idea any further , but it is evident from the way in which the buildings of the older group have been left that they have assumed their definite form on the side toward Brattle Street , and will retain their present shape of a compromise between the quadrangle // PLAN OF THE NEW BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS , COLUMBIA COLLEGE . plan and the detached plan of college building . A more recent and more successful attempt at constructing college buildings on the quadrangle plan is the one which is in process of realization at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia . This institution had , down to 1890 , no cloistered buildings ; the various college halls were constructed according to the New England idea of detached buildings , and differed quite materially in architecture one from another . In 1894 announcements were made public of an intention to built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the process of constructing the quadrangles according to these designs has since then advanced to partial completion . Owing to the fact that the university was situated in a great city , with the area which it was possible for it to occupy controlled and limited by the location of the streets , it became necessary to plan one of the new courts in the form of a triangle . In English college architecture a courtyard of this form would be something difficult to find . The cloister of the monastery , which had so much to do with determining later the form of the coll*ge court , was always square , and had been so from the earliest times . The triangular court at the Pennsylvania University seems destined therefore to hold an almost unique place in college architecture , owing its peculiar shape not to the mere desire to produce a picturesque effect , but to a more legitimate cause  --  a controlling condition in the circumstances under which the plan was evolved . Worked into the designs for the buildings surrounding the courtyards , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dining hall , the dining hall bearing evidence upon its exterior of having been designed according to the English collegiate model , with traceried Gothic windows filling all the interval between the buttresses . The exterior architectural details of the whole group of buildings are of English Gothic , of the same style which is encountered in a number of the college buildings at Oxford . The design of one of the entrance gates , // by Cope and Stewardso.n of Philadelphia , was exhibited at the Arts and Crafts exhibition in Boston last April , and was much admired . The tower with its gateway beneath had the same solid and substantial qualities as the Phelps tower and gateway at Yale . The problem of providing suitable quarters for a university in the heart of a great city has been studied and again solved , though after a different fashion , by the architects of the new buildings for Columbia University in New York . Perhaps I commit a physiological error in locating the heart of the city of New York so far north as the square between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pulsation is at present further down town , it will not be long before it will move far enough toward the Harlem River to make the statement relatively correct . In the design for the new colleges , it is very evident that the builders had no such spaces to dispose of as those who erected the great quadrangle of Leland Stanford , Jr. , University ; but the various structures have been arranged with great ingenuity so as to place the greatest possible number of buildings on the area which the architect could command , with the least possible appearance of crowding . All of the buildings in the group have at least one frontage either toward the streets which bound the university property or toward the large central court . The general plan adopted is the American plan , and not the English plan  --  to this extent , namely , that all the buildings are isolated . In other particulars the group will bear as a whole no resemblance to any existing American university , with the possible exception of the University of Virginia as designed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is limited to the parallelism between the architectural style of the library and of Jefferson 's rotunda , and to the harmony of design between the different buildings composing the group . Mr. McKim is a rather more gifted artist than Mr. Jefferson , and his management of the classical styles is decidedly less childlike and naive . In the group as a whole there is a faint and distant flavor of the World 's Fair , something which makes it seem vaguely like a second Columbian exposition . Schermerhorn and Havemeyer Halls , the two outer buildings fronting toward the open space at the north of the colleges , have certain points of resemblance to the old halls at Harvard , more particularly to Hollis and Stoughton . They are much more elegant in detail , but in their general contour there is something about them which would be apt to suggest to a person familiar with the Harvard group the lines of those venerable structures . One of the things which one notes in wandering about among the Oxford colleges is that the chapel is almost invariably a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is regarded as being as essential an element in the functional parts of the institution as the dormitories or the dining hall . In American colleges a separate building for a chapel has not always been considered as a necessity ; indeed , very few American colleges have been able to call themselves the proud possessors of separate chapel buildings until within the last fifty years . Harvard , as usual , took the lead in providing itself with this luxury , the 1-lolden Chapel-which still stands and which , although it has nearly survived its usefulness , is still looked upon with the same kindly veneration with which stalwart youth looks upon the greatgrandfather in the chimney corner-having been built in i744 . One regrets that the original Holdens , who thought that their Georgian dovecote would hold all the students who might ever have occasion to assemble within it , could not see the whole student body of the present day and witness the attempt to crowd them all within its four walls . // At Yale the religious exercises which the students were required to attend were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the corner of Chapel and College Streets , and which was removed near the close of the last century . The original place of assembling was supplanted in 1763 by the construction of the first separate chapel building , known afterward as the Athenaeum , standing next south of South Middle in the original brick row , and removed within the last five years . After 1824 the daily religious exercises were transferred to another building , the New Chapel , destined in its turn to become the Old Chapel , which was erected north of North Middle , but still somewhat in the old traditional New England church style , with a projecting tower on the front and a belfry ; and this chapel of 1824 continued to be used until the Gothic Battell Chapel was dedicated in 1876 . Almost all the college chapels constructed within the last fifty years have been built in some one of the Gothic or mediaeval styles . Wesleyan University had , I believe , no separate chapel building until its Gothic chapel was constructed in 1868-71 . Dartmouth had no separate chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , was built a few years ago . In chapel building , the architectural movement in this country has not developed anything distinctly novel or anything which can be set over against the ordinary form of church edifice and distinguished from it ; but in one other sort of building designed to furnish a meeting place for students something more original has been devised . Since the secret society movement in American colleges has gained sufficient strength to provide something more than temporary and shifting quarters for its members , a number of buildings or " Society Halls , " as they are called , have been designed and erected which have a character all their own . I say " character all their own , " but I should limit this by saying that they have a sort of kinship with funereal and sepulchral architecture . The original designers of these structures wished to have them declare their purpose distinctly and to proclaim to everyone in unmistakable terms that they were intended to veil something from the vulgar gaze ; and not only from the vulgar gaze , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected few , who alone were to be permitted to cross the threshold . The most singular and freaky forms of this new genus in building are probably to be found at Yale , in the Skull and Bones Hall , built in 1856 , with a double padlocked door and not an opening in its exterior wall except some narrow slits in the small receding wing at the back ; the Delta Kappa Epsilon Hall , a more audacious form of this same sphinx-like architecture , and the Scroll and Key Hall . In this last the resemblance to a mausoleum is very close ; a foreigner unacquainted with American college customs might easily mistake it for *a tomb which , owing to some whim of the family to which it belonged , had been constructed outside of the limits of the not very distant cemetery . The Yale model of the secret society hall was for a certain period extensively adopted at other colleges ; that is , the idea of constructing the building so that it would obviously proclaim on the outside what it was to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building has come into vogue . It does not look in the least like a tomb , but much more like what the real estate agents term a " desirable country residence . " The building contains not only a meeting room for the society , but suites of lodging rooms , studies with bedrooms attached , for the use of the students who happen to be members of the society . The students who belong to these organizations have close social relationship with each other , and find it agreeable to be quartered under // 53 ' the same roof . This new form of society ' ' life and society ' ' building has come to play a great part in many of the country colleges , like Amherst and Williams . I shall not go into it here in detail , as it is to be made the theme of a special article in the magazine . In a future number of the magazine I hope myself to discuss the development of college libraries in America , and shall therefore say nothing here touching that special field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Memorial Hall at Harvard* University we have a somewhat remarkable experiment in college architecture . The architects , Messrs . Ware and Van Brunt , were not a little restricted in making their plan for their unique combination by their desire to bring its exterior into approximate correspondence with the well established lines of the European Cathedral ; and to do this it was imperative that the semi-circular auditorium of Sanders Theatre , which was to be a part of the building , should be turned outward so as to form an apse . Despite embarrassments , the interior of the auditorium is a remarkable success . Comparing the work with its historic prototype , the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford , we find that the modern architects have improved upon their model in many particulars . Their interior is not only roomy and capable of holding a large audience , but it is beautiful , and its beauty is a beauty of its own and not the borrowed beauty of a playhouse . There are not a few churches in the country whose interiors much more strongly suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the avoidance of the horseshoe curve of the gallery , by the introduction of substantial parapets of oak instead of the traditional iron and plaster balcony fronts , and by the rigid exclusion of paint and stucco from the decoration , the architects Note-See illustrations of Memorial hall in article on " Harvard College During the War of the Hebelilon. " in the New England Magazine , March , 1891. succeeded in creating something which they could frankly call a theatre without for an instant suggesting a haunt of Melpomene , Thalia or Terpsichore , and which would furnish an appropriate environment for any university function , however serious or solemn . Certainly the combination of ideas in this building designated comprehensively as Memorial Hall is the most singular presented in any college edifice . The Memorial Hall is precisely the smallest part of the mass , merely the transept , merely a corridor or vestibule by which one enters the theatre on one side and the dining hall on the other . Still the architects , besides leaving room for inscribing on the marble panels on the walls the names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to give a semi-sacred and unsecular air to the memorial space by vaulting it overhead and by placing great cathedral windows at the ends . The dining-hall would impress a European familiar with similar halls at Oxford and Cambridge principally by its size . The hall of Christ Church at Oxford is regarded by English university men as a stately room , but the area on the floor is less than half that of the hall at Harvard . On the whole , the idea of eating in this gregarious fashion does not seem an altogether happy one . Admitting , however , the defects inseparable from the plan , the hall where Harvard eats is by no means a badly designed room . In essentials it obeys the old traditions . It is made clear that it is not the nave of a cathedral by the circumstance that the windows do not come down to the floor , but are stopped by a wainscot which rises to a height of fifteen or twen , ty feet along the whole length of each side of the hall . This follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these follow the precedent of the refectories in the abbeys and monasteries of the middle ages ; in this fundamental type of the collective // dining-room the high wainscot was made necessary by the fact that the tables were arranged in a hollow square around the room , with seats only on the wall side , and with a high panelling of wood to serve as a back to the benches . Memorial halls exist at many of the other colleges , and serve a variety of purposes . The memorial hall at Wesleyan University is the chapel ; the persons of whom it is a memorial are , as at Harvard , the members of the university who took part in the Civil War . There is a memorial hall in prospect at Dartmouth , which is to contain college offices and a large auditorium . At Union College there is a memorial haJl , which was erected at large expense in 1876 as a monument to Bishop Alouzo Potter and to Eliphalet Nott , the latter having held for sixty-two years the post of president of the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the institution an honorable standing among American colleges . I am informed that the original design was traced by a French architect by the name of Ram*e , in 1812 ; but Ram*e , who lived in an age of classicism , could not possibly have given it its present Gothic details . The Nott Memorial Hall suggests , dimly and ' distantly , a number of circular or polygonal buildings scattered over Europe , and among others the Church of S. Vitale at Ravenna . Geometrically this form of construction is generated by taking a cross section of the nave of a cathedral and revolving it about its central vertical axis . The building at Union College is surrounded , on the interior , by two balconies , and is used as an art gallery to contain the pictures , the bronzes and the casts of the antique belonging to the institution . The architect who converted the sketch of Ram&amp; into the working plans for the present structure was Edward T. Potter , brother of Howard Potter and of Clarkson Nott Potter , who together contributed one-half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said nothing thus far about Richardsonian architecture as an entity in itself , but only referred to its application to one form of college building , the library . A dissertation on Richardsonianism would be out of place here , and has come to be out of place anywhere , because the subject is , at least temporarily , exhausted . Richardson was a phenomenon , and everyone has reached the point of conceding it , and is consequently contented to let the matter drop . Richardson was the inVentor of the only style of architecture which was not imported into this country from outside , but which grew up here and spread all over the United States from Boston to San Francisco without any propulsion from Europe . There is not a city of any size in the country where important public buildings have been erected in the last twenty years in which architectural forms and details and ideas of ornament distinctly traceable to Richardson are not to be found . Richardsonism has permeated ecclesiastical architecture and commercial architecture , and naturally its influence has not been lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Sever Hall , used for recitations , and the Law School . Yale has the Osburne recitation hall , which , though not by Richardson , wears the garment of his thought ; and the Chittenden library , also at Yale , presents a number of recognizable Richardsonian features . Alexander Hall at Princeton , although not built until after the death of the Boston architect , would not be what it is if he had not lived . Besides the various species of college buildings to which I have referred , there is a long list of others of which I have made no mention . Among them is the gymnasium , always an important element in the college equipment from the point of view of the student ; the laboratory and // other buildings intended to facilitate scientific research ; and the museum and other structures of that class intended to do duty as warehouses for storing away the valuable collections of objects of every description of which our colleges and universities have become the possessors . Yale has had an art gallery since 1831 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadrangle and originally intended to contain the Trumbull collection was built ; and other colleges are gradually being provided , by the generosity of their alumni , with 1*uildings intended to serve a similar purpose . Among the more recently erected structures of this class is the Walker Art Building at Bowdoin College , where we see again the low , fiat dome which seems to have been given a new hold on the public favor by the success with which it was used at the Columbian Exposition . I must at least make a passing allusion to the fine old gate-old in spirit if new in construction-designed by Mr. McKim a few years ago to protect the principal entrance to the grounds at Harvard and create a visible bond of connection between Massachusetts and Harvard Halls . The pleasure which this work gives to everyone seems to be due to its perfect harmony with its surroundings . The way in which it fits into its place reminds one of Dr. Waldstein 's discovering in the Louvre , among the fragments of ancient sculpture , a marble head which he surmised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metopes of the Parthenon preserved at the British Museum , and which upon being applied in the form of a plaster cast to the headless trunk was found exactly to complete the figure in the spirit of the original design . The McKim gate , extracted out of the architect 's mind two centuries after the designing of the buildings which it was intended to accompany , fits in the same way , with the same flawless adaptation of every line and contour to the other structures which have been so long waiting this completing touch . If the other gate on Cambridge Street seems any less beautiful , it is largely because there is not the same harmony in its surroundings . Thayer Hall , which backgrounds it from the street , is not by any means a Colonial edifice ; and the new art museum which has recently stepped into a position beside it wears an architectural dress which is as far removed from that of the older Harvard building as a Greek toga from the round coat and top boots of Miles Standish . I have tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successively come into vogue in our colleges . So far as the development of unique and individual forms , or of any one definite form for any one class of buildings , is concerned , we have accomplished in this country relatively little . The chapel is not distinguishable from the church . In library building a unique form has been developed and then partially lost . In the building of gymnasiums , laboratories and museums we still allow individual architects to develop their individual ideas and are obliged to say that little unity has made itself obvious in what they have produced , though they have designed many buildings of great practical utility . Finally , as between separate buildings and quadrangles , we stand wavering . The reason for this state of affairs is obvious ; and as the reason is destined to continue , the situation which it creates is likely to continue also . Three-fourths of the college buildings at institutions unsupported by the state have been built by funds contributed by private individuals . In the case of great institutions like the University of Pennsylvania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pays the cost of the college buikings , great quadrangles can be constructed at an expense of millions ; in other colleges where in*lividuals contribute from " F* // their own private purses the sums which are to build a chapel , a library or a dormitory , we must expect to see a continuation of the practice of erecting separate buildings . No one who does a noble and generous act of this kind wishes to merge his giving in the mass or to have his own personal share in the matter wholly lost , sight of , as it would be if he poured his contribution into the reservoir of a gen eral building fund . And if the private donor wishes to affix , in some way , his own personality to his gift , who can blame him ? His instincts are as old as human nature . As a well known classical author observed nearly two thousand years ago : " Even those philosophers who write books on the contempt of fame take pains to have their names inscribed on the title pages of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
