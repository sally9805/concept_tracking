txt THERE is no institution in the Catholic Church to which the average Protestant , whether he be an American or an Englishman , has a more deeply rooted antipathy than to the practice of auricular confession . He regards it as an unwarrantable invasion of the privacy of the individual conscience , an intrusion into the sacred domain of domestic life ; as dangerous , demoralizing , a source of weakness to the will , and destructive of the habit of independence and mental self-reliance . I know that I am advocating an unpopular cause in undertaking to plead in its behalf , and that the very name carries with it an unpleasant sound in the ears of a majority of my readers . At the same time , I feel sure that they will accede me a fair hearing . I ask them to listen to me , as far as they can , with minds unprejudiced , while I speak , from my own knowledge , of a system of which I have had a long and intimate experience , and which I have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years , during which I have myself been to confession at least once a week , and have , as a priest , heard many thousand confessions in various English-speaking countries . I do not propose to enter on the thorny paths of religious controversy . I am no controversialist , and I doubt not that most of my readers share my dislike to controversy . My object in the present paper will be to state , as fairly and impartially as I can , the manifold advantages to the individual and to society which are the result of habitual confession , and to try to remove , if I can , some of the misconceptions which prevail respecting it , even among honorable and educated men . I need scarcely say that I // do not propose to enter the lists against the anti-Popery lecturer , or the professional declaimer against the " abominations of Rome . " These unfortunate products of modern bigotry and intolerance I shall leave entirely alone . The class to whom they appeal are , for the most part , impervious to reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself sufficient to condemn them . The history of confession is too wide a field for me to attempt to enter upon . I will only say that Christians , from the very beginning , taking in their literal and obvious sense our Lord 's words to His Apostles- " As my Father hath sent me , even so I send you . Whose sins you forgive , they are forgiven to them , and whose sins you retain , they are retained " - have always seen in the ministers of the Church the delegates and representatives of Christ , and have , in obedience to His command , made confession of their sins to them . The early literature on the subject is , indeed , scanty and imperfect ; but it is sufficient to show that the practice of confession prevailed from the very first . Whether , in the first fervor of primitive Christianity , this confession was in all cases made in public , or whether this severe ordeal was confined to grave sins which gave serious scandal ( the rest being confessed privately ) , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that , even in the earliest times , private sins were privately confessed . Be this as it may , the writings of the Fathers and the decrees of local synods bear ample witness to the general custom of annular confession as prevailing in East and West alike . The Lateran Council , in 1215 , did not impose the practice on the faithful , but simply determined the minimum that the Church required . To argue from the decree of this Council , ordering that all shall confess their sins at least once a year , that confession was never previously enforced , is an utterly unwarrantable inference . It would be just as reasonable to conclude that if a Government were to order a mathematical examination of boys in all public schools to be held once a year , no mathematical examination had ever been previously exacted ; or that if a State Legislature were to direct that all the children in its industrial schools were to have a bath at least once a month , the children in them had never been made to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had hitherto been undefined , to determine what was the minimum of obligation for the faithful all the world over . I // 831 merely notice this in passing , for I am now considering auricular confession , not historically , but in its relation to the needs of men in modern society , and as affecting for good or evil those who habitually practise it. * The natural origin and fountain-head of confession is to be found in an instinct of human nature , which leads us to communicate to others any strong emotion present to the soul , any powerful influence engendering in us joy or sorrow , hope or fear , self-approbation or self-reproach . If some counter motive render concealment necessary , the suppression will be painful to us , and will aggravate our suffering , where the influence present to the soul is one unfavorable to its happiness . Now , a sense of guilt is , of all emotions which affect the soul , the one which causes the most deeply rooted misery , and is the most destructive of all true peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of the past , and despondency at the prospect of the future , all combine to make life almost intolerable . The desire to exterminate that which is the source of our mental suffering sometimes becomes irresistible . The story of Eugene Aram is an instance in point , as is that of the murderer who approached the cradle of his victim 's infant in order that he might whisper to a human ear the crime that he could no longer bear in silence . Probably most of my readers have , in the course of their lives , listened to the confidences of some friend or acquaintance who poured forth , in the gloaming or by the dull fire-light , the honest and self-accusing story of his past misdeeds . I am not concerned with the source of this curious instinct of self-revelation , but the fact of the relief that it affords to the heavily burdened soul is undeniable . It certainly is much stronger among Christians than among those who belong to other religions ; and the reason of this is that the sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in the Incarnation and death of the Son of God . Almost every revival of religion , outside the Catholic Church , has been accompanied with some form or other of public or private confession . The early Wesleyans related in public their religious " experiences , " and the leaders of the evangelical movement at the beginning of the present century received *A valuable bit of evidence on the practice of Confession in England in AngloSaxon times is found in the " Dialogue of Egbert " *A D. 766-91 . ) " Haec . Deo *n'atias , a temporibu8 Vitaliani Papa et Theodori Dorobernensis Atckiepiscopi ino* le*it in Ecelesia Anglorum consuetudo , ut etiam Zaici cum conjugibus et liberis auja ad confessores suos pervenirent , et se. . . . cum eleemosunarum largitione munciarent , quatentss nurwres T ) ominicce ( lommunionis perceptionem in Natale Domini perczperent . ( Haddan &amp; Stubbe ; Councils , 111.413. ) // from their disciples a " manifestation of conscience " that was little else than a confession of their sins . The rapid growth of the practice of confession among the iRitualists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural outcome of their religious earnestness and sincerity . All this proves the necessity of providing some carefully guarded and recognized outlet for that instinct of human nature which leads a man to give relief to his sense of personal guilt by some external manifestation of his evil deeds . The more intense his sense of guilt , the more unbearable does it become , unless he has the opportunity of getting rid of , or at all events of lightening , his burden , by revealing the source of his misery to some one or more of his fellow-creatures in whose prudence and sympathy he can confide . I have myself known several instances in which the sense of sin made life so intolerable as to lead to an attempt , and in one or two cases a successful attempt , to commit suicide . Our lunatic asylums contain patients not a few who have lost their reason from the same cause . All of these , or most of them , would certainly have been saved if they could have had recourse to the Catholic confessional and poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of the confessor . I have myself often heard from the lips of those who had told some sad tale of wilful and long-continued sin the joyful exclamation , " Now , father , I begin to feel better . " The inexpressible relief was due , in great measure , to the mere outpouring of their sad story . They were employing what was the natural , as well as the supernatural , means of escaping from the crushing and intolerable burden . But there is a further provision for the needs of human nature that confession , and confession only , can supply . Every one who goes astray has an undefined and vague intention of beginning , at some time or other , a new and a better life . He wants to give up the evil which in his heart he hates , and he means to do so when a convenient season comes . But the difficulty is to determine the time when that happy moment shall arrive . We are all procrastinators , especially where immediate action means a struggle with ourselves and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put off and put off , until the chain that binds us down becomes so strong that it is a moral impossibility to shake ourselves free of it . Men sometimes fix for themselves a special day which is to be the beginning of a new life-their next birthday , // for instance , or the first day of the coming year . But , in point of fact , the promised reformation very rarely takes place when the appointed day arrives , or if , for a short time , there is a change for the better , the improvement , unsupported as it is by any fresh influences for good appertaining to the new era , soon fades away and disappears . Now , this need of a turning point for good , of a special date and limit from which the old things shall have passed away , and all things shall have become new , is supplied by the confessional as nothing else in the world can supply it . The Catholic who is desirous of turning over a new leaf and of overcoming his past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conscious of his own weakness , turns instinctively to that wholesome tribunal , where he knows that he will find a kind and attentive listener , a man who has had long experience of the various snares and pitfalls that beset our path through life , and who can , therefore , sympathize with all the difficulties that have to be encountered by one who is entering on a struggle with evil , and on the serious pursuit of what is good . The sinner who has learned to hate himself , and who feels himself unable , by his own unaided efforts , to free himself from the yoke of sin , will there find a prudent , patient and skilful counsellor , who will have a hundred devices to suggest for meeting the force of temptation , and a hundred means by which he may strengthen himself in the practice of virtue . The confessor will make for him " the crooked ways straight , and the rough places plain . " He will encourage him where encouragement is needed , and warn him where there are dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trembling , but still with a hope long unknown to him and a confidence to which he has long been a stranger  --  to that fountain provided for the washing away of sin and uncleanliness , and for the strengthening of good resolutions and aspirations after a new and better life , which is to be found in every Catholic church . In the priest in the confessional he knows that he will have a father , a friend and a guide . In him he sees God 's own representative , and there rise to his lips , instinctively and naturally , the words of the prodigal in the Gospel , " I will arise and go to my father , and will say to him , Father , I have sinned . ' " In this way the tribunal of penance , quite apart from the grace of the sacrament , with which I avi not now concerned , is simply an invaluable instrument of reformation . // How valuable and how effective it is , is of course better known to priests than to any other class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sacred ministry to think of the hundreds whom they have thus helped over the rough places that beset the first struggle after virtue , and who will one day tender them their grateful thanks for the help that they have received from them in their sore time of need . In close connection with this " ministry of reconciliation " is a further and a scarcely less important advantage attaching to the confessional , that it affords a sure and a safe resort to all who are in any kind of moral or intellectual perplexity or distress . I imagine that very few of my readers have not , at some time or other in their lives , found themselves in some harassing doubt Or difficulty from which they knew not how to extricate themselves . Their trouble may have arisen from their own fault , or it may have been entirely independent of any action of their own . It may have arisen from within , or it may have been the result of exterior circumstances which have hedged them in with embarrassment that for the time made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously interfered with their happiness and peace of mind . Those who have delicate consciences , men with a naturally high sense of honor or justice , are especially liable to these storms of mental suffering . Their very anxiety to do what is right aggravates their trouble ; they are torn asunder by a number of opposing motives and influences , and sometimes do not know which way to turn . Let me take one or two instances such as often occur in modern life . A man in a position of responsibility has , under stress of some pressing need , borrowed ( or embezzled ) some of his emp*oyer s money . He has tided over the difficulty by some dishonest falsification of his accounts . There is every chance of his escaping undetected , for he is a man whose character stands high , and in whom his employer placed the most implicit confidence . But his conscience will not let him rest . He is simply miserable at the thought of his betrayal of his trust . He is bound to confess his misdeeds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to drag down to misery those near and dear to him , his loving wife and his innocent children . Another man is in business for himself , say as a picture dealer , and he is much troubled in conscience as to certain misrepresentations which he has made with regard to the antiquity or the origin of the pictures that he // wishes to sell . These misrepresentations are not actually false , but they are of a nature to mislead the intending purchaser . They are in line with the universal practice of the trade in the city where he dwells , and without them his business would be liable to be ruined . What is he to do under these difficult circumstances ? Or , to take a very different ease . A girl is living at home with her mother and sister . She is not necessary to her mother 's hap-. piness or comfort , but , without doubt , she adds much to it . She has , however , for some time felt strongly drawn toward consecrating her life to God among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor has made their white caps and gray dress dear even to non-Catholics . What ought she to do ? Is she bound to obey the voice within and to leave those dear to her , in order to follow out at any cost what she believes to be her vocation ? Or is it all a delusion , her real duty being to be the solace of her mother 's advancing years ? How conducive , how necessary , to her peace of mind that some wise counsellor should help her in deciding the question she can not decide for herself ! Children , too , have their own difficulties . Every confessor of boys has been asked , " Father , is it a sin to go out of bounds without leave ? Is it a sin to use a crib ? Is it a sin to have a fight with another boy ? " Even little girls are sometimes perplexed in conscience . " Father , is it a sin to slap my little sister when she is naughty ? Is it a sin to take chocolates out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on matters of more serious import , for the voice within does not always clearly promulgate even the precepts of the natural law . In all these questions , great and small , it is of incalculable benefit to young and old to be able to resort to one who will clearly draw the line between right and wrong and set at rest the troubled conscience . In all such cases the confessional furnishes a counsellor who is perfectly unprejudiced , whose one and only desire is to promote the happiness and well-being of his penitent , who speaks with the authority belonging to his office , whose long experience gives weight to his words , and who , above all , knows the severe account that Almighty God will exact of him , and the awful responsibility of the task entrusted to him . He knows that if he swerves one hair's-breadth from the law of God in the advice given , out of any human respect , or desire to please , or any other inferior motive , he will be guilty of a great sin before God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for giving peace to troubled souls , or for settling doubts and difficulties that , to those who are entangled in them , often seem insoluble ? I do not mean to say that the confessor is infallible , or may not judge the case wrongly . But there is every possible chance that his judgment will be the right one , and that he will be able to give such advice as may release the perplexed conscience from its difficulties and dangers . My own experience is that seldom have I encountered any problem as to future action , however apparently hopeless , which did not admit of a solution that was not only practically possible , but that could be carried out without any very serious difficulty by the person asking advice . Another benefit attaching to the practice of confession is one that , I think , can not fail to be appreciated by any one who calls himself , even in the widest sense , a Christian . One of the great dangers of the present day is a want of a sufficient appreciation of the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds a pernicious sway over the opinion of modern society respecting right and wrong . If the law of God forbids any course of conduct which utilitarianism declares to be beneficial to society , well , so much the worse for the law of God . I do not mean to say that any except an extreme school of modern theorists would put the matter in this crude form ; but it underlies a great deal of the opinion now prevalent respecting right and wrong . This or that course of action can not be bad , because it does no possible harm to others ; it must be good , because it can be shown to be advantageous to society . Why should we regret any of our actions in the past if neither we , nor any one else , are , as far as we can judge , a whit the worse for them ? This habit of mind is one that is fostered by a career of prosperity and success . It is all very well to say that we all have within us the dread tribunal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be silenced , the guilt of sin and its hatefulness in the sight of God , apart from any evil results that may proceed from it . This is true ; but conscience , if it be disregarded , soon ceases to speak with the same distinctness , or else the deafened ears fail to hear its sentence of condemnation . It needs an external sanction , a human voice without , that shall be the echo of the voice of God within . It needs , moreover , the help of some authoritative tribunal , outside of him , which shall compel the wrongdoer to // take counsel of his conscience and reckon up with its help the different occasions on which he has disobeyed its voice , in order that he may obtain forgiveness by a full and frank confession of them all to one who must , as God 's representative , take cognizance of them all , and pass on the guilty accuser of himself a sentence of punishment which shall in some way correspond to the heinousness of his sin . One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily precedes it . It brings a man face to face with his sins as nothing else can . He knows that if they are to be forgiven , not one must be concealed ; and he knows , too , that he must use all care and diligence to see that none is , through any negligence on his part , omitted from the black list . They must all be told , the number however great , and the kind of sin however disgraceful and humiliating . I can scarcely imagine anything that has a greater power to quicken the sense of the heinousness of sin than this necessity of first coming face to face with it in careful self-examination , and then putting into words the results which that self-examination has revealed . And here I may remind my readers that this advantage is altogether lost unless the integrity of confession is strictly enforced . Once allow the penitent to tell what seems good to him , and to omit whatever he is reluctant to confess , and the value of confession , as enforcing a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all the details of the offenses committed , else how can he pass a just sentence ? Nothing must be hidden from him , inasmuch as he is God 's representative . It is the telling of this humbling tale which keeps alive in the heart of the Catholic that keen appreciation of the evil of sin , the fading away of which is an irreparable loss to Protestant society . And it is the fact that the tale is such a humbling one that furnishes the tribunal of penance with another most potent weapon for the encounter with evil and for the salvation of souls . Of all sins there is none so deadly and so hateful to God as pride , and , on the other hand , there is no virtue more indispensable to all those who desire to follow in the footsteps of Christ than the virtue of humility . Without humility every other virtue is a mere pretense and counterfeit ; with it every good and perfect gift can be obtained from the Most High . Nothing is more prominent in the teaching of Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pharisees were liberal in their // alms , mortified in their lives , lengthy in their prayers ; but their pride spoilt it all . The publican beating his breast was humble , and therefore was forgiven . While God has compassion on sinners , we are told that He hates the proud . But there is no need to dwell on the truism that , of all Christian duties , the most essential is that we " humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God . " Now , of all Christian practices I think that there is none so humbling , so humiliating , as the practice of confession . To tell to a fellow-creature the evil thoughts that we have indulged , the mean , selfish , disgraceful acts that we have done , and to tell them in all their naked hideousness , is a process which knocks the pride out of a man better than any other that I know of in the whole world . It is this which makes the confessional so unpopular with average Englishmen in the present day . Cardinal Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the besetting sin of England . Drunkenness is bad enough , God knows , not only in itself , but because of the other sins which follow in its train . Nevertheless , I do not agree with His Eminence . I am quite certain that pride is far more subtle , more dangerous , more deadly , more ruinous to the souls of men , than drunkenness . It is a respectable vice , a vice which breeds no remorse in the soul , a vice which is often accompanied with a great show of virtue , and even of piety , a vice which carries with it a fatal blindness and hardness of heart , a vice that renders a man impervious to the sweet influences of God 's grace . Now , a true , heartfelt confession of sin is incompatible with pride . This is why the tribunal of penance has always been one of the most cherished institutions in the Catholic Church . This too is the reason why it never can take root and flourish in any of those forms of religion which have thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of private judgment and the autocracy of the individual conscience . To confess one 's sins to God , Who knows them all already , requires no exercise of humility , such as is involved in confessing them to a human being , who knows nothing of them beforehand . It would be simply an intolerable abasement of self , at least fo the ordinary Christian , unless he saw in that human being God 's delegate and representative , and unless he knew that this abasement of himself is a necessary condition to the salvation of his soul . I must add yet another advantage of confession of a very different kind . It has probably often occurred to the mind of // most Catholics , as it has often occurred to my own , that if there were no other proof of the paramount claims of the Catholic Church , we should find a sufficient one in the elaborate care with which she watches over the innocence of the young . To guard from evil and corruption the lambs of the fold is one of her chief duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine Founder , Who was the friend and lover of little children . Now , I do not think that it is possible for any unprejudiced and well-informed person , who compares the practical working of the Catholic system with that of any other religious system in the world , to deny her unrivalled and unapproachable superiority in this respect . She shields her little ones in their early childhood with all the jealous care of the most tender mother , and when the time comes for the safe seclusion of the parental roof to be exchanged for a freer intercourse with their fellows , she provides safeguards for their purity that are unknown , or almost unknown , outside her fold . For the due education of boys , large schools , and for those of the upper class , large boarding-schools , are a practical necessity . Then comes the dangerous time , and how great the dangers of that time are is well known to every one who has had an experience of the inner working of English public schools . To keep boys safe from a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sin , is a problem which has exercised the mind and troubled the conscience of every one who has taken part in the managemcut of any of our large schools and colleges ; and those among Protestant educators who have studied the subject most deeply , and who have had long experience to guide them , have had to admit , with sorrow and grief , that the task was a hopeless one . They have had to submit to what they considered an inevitable evil , and their best hope has been by personal influence to mitigate to some extent that which they knew they were powerless to prevent . But is the evil one for which no remedy can be provided ? God forbid ! The Catholic Church provides an effective remedy for this , as for every other evil incident to human life . Here I can speak from a large experience , and with a full knowledge of the subject . Again and again I have been assured by boys who have passed through Catholic colleges , from the lowest to the highest form , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one immodest word , or came into contact with any sort of temptation to evil from those with whom they associated . I have // known some who at the end of their school course were as innocent of moral evil as on the day they entered , and were utterly shocked and disgusted when they were thrown into the vortex of the world outside , and had to listen to the kind of talk that too often forms the common staple of conversation among those who have had a Protestant education . I shall , perhaps , be told that the Catholic system is a " hothouse system , " and I accept the simile . Does the prudent gardener expose his tender plants , during their early growth , to the cold east wind and the nipping frosts ? If he wants them to be strong and sturdy , he watches over them and shelters them from the fatal influences that will blight their growth and leave traces of evil that can never be wholly removed . In like manner does the Catholic Church . She , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself of the means with which Christ has provided her , to train them up to habits of virtue and to a hatred of sin , fostering their moral strength and their love of all that is pure and of good report , that so she may send them forth , when their manhood shall have come , armed in full panoply , to do battle with all the perils which they will then have to encounter and with the evils which will then beset their path . I do not say that the Church is always successful in her endeavors . It is quite possible that , even in a Catholic school , evil may for a time run riot . One sinner may destroy much good . But the evil never lasts long , and the Catholic system brings about a speedy recovery . What I do assert is that the moral perils to which a boy is exposed in a Catholic school are infinitesimal as compared with those which will surround him in any of the Protestant public schools and colleges . In all this the chief engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , many others . There is the personal influence , and the keen sense of responsibility , of those who are in authority ; there is the close and intimate friendship existing between the teacher and the taught , which is something utterly different from the comparatively cold relations and official reserve which make the Protestant master far more of a stranger to his boys . But it is the weekly or fortnightly confession that is the real safeguard . It is in the confessor that he has his trusted friend , to whom he freely talks of all his dangers and temptations ; it is confession that keeps the moral atmosphere healthy and pure ; // it is confession that maintains the high standard of life and conversation prevailing , through God 's mercy , in our Catholic schools and colleges ; it is confession which enables the Catholic parent to entrust his boy to the good priests , whether secular or regular , who devote themselves to the work of education , without any of those qualms or fears , that anxiety and foreboding about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he bids farewell to his innocent child on his first plunge into the vortex of a Protestant public school . But there is one charge , one false and cruel charge , which some Protestant writers bring against confession . They say that it introduces the young and innocent to a knowledge of subjects which are sacro digna silcntio , and even suggests to them evil of which they would otherwise be ignorant . I can only assure my readers ( in answer to this gratuitous calumny ) , on the word of an honest man , that during the twenty years and more that I have been constantly hearing confessions of men and women , boys and girls , of every class and in various countries , I have never once known of a single instance of any knowledge of evil having been imparted in the confessional . I am sure that I may speak for all my fellow-priests all over the world , when I say that I would , with God 's help , far rather be torn in a thousand pieces than say one word in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or impart a knowledge of evil to one previously ignorant of it . But if there should be any of my readers who are not willing to accept my own personal assurance , there is another consideration which ought to convince them . If there were in this accusation the smallest element of truth , every good mother would , in her tender care for her children 's innocence , have the greatest horror of seeing her little ones kneeling before the priest , and every careful father would forbid his boys and girls from incurring the risk of such contamination . Is this the case ? Do we find good Catholic parents dreading the influence of the confessional for their children ? On the contrary , there is nothing that gives them more hearty satisfaction than to know that their sons and daughters are , from their earliest years , regular in making their confession month by month or week by week . They regard it as the best possible safeguard for their innocence and virtue . They are alarmed and anxious if , when boyhood merges into youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penance . They fear there must be something wrong . They urge and entreat them not to fall away from the practice of confession . Joy fills the mother 's heart when she sees her son once more returning , it may be after long absence , to that fount of mercy and of grace , where she knows he will obtain pardon for the past , and strength and help for the struggles of the future . Ask any of the heads of those Catholic families whose names are a household word for all that is noble and honorable and of good report , what is their opinion of the institution which is thus maligned , and they will tell you , one and all , that it is for themselves a continual source of comfort and happiness and consolation and peace , and that their best wish for all those dear to them is that they shall share the incalculable benefits that they know by their own experience it confers . They will tell you that it is their stay and support , that it binds together the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teaches children to be obedient to their parents , and parents to be gentle and patient and forbearing with their children ; the wife to obey her husband , and the husband to love and cherish his wife ; in a word , that it teaches all to fulfil the duties of their station , to observe the laws of God and of the Church , to live a chaste , sober , honest , godly life , and to die a holy and happy death . I have said little or nothing of the supernatural benefits attaching to the confessional , or of the sacramental grace that flows into the souls of those who avail themselves of it . My object has been to dwell chiefly on the natural advantages of the confessional . And I have been speaking of the Catholic confessional , and of it alone . For confession , like every other great instrument for good , has its dangers , and very sei*ious ones . Against these dangers the Catholic Church takes the most careful precautions ; but I do not see how they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist ; where the confessor has no recognized training for his difficult and responsible duties ; where the practice is discouraged and discountenanced by those in authority , and is regarded with suspicion and dislike by the mass of those who are invited to avail themselves of it.
