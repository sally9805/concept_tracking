txt The ruffian who shot Robert Ross because he protested against corruption at a ballot box Tuesday will meet swift justice if the decent men in Troy can secure that end . If his blood can make so hideous a stain on the Murphy system of carrying an election that it is forever wiped out , all that is decent and honest in Troy will rejoice . While the body , of Robert Ross was being prepared for burial to-day , and while the knots of idlers on the street corners were guessing if " Bat " Shea and John , who figured in the murderous proceedings , would be made to suffer , thirty of the most prominent men in the city met at the Troy House and discussed plans for avenging the death of Ross . They were men of both political patties . With resolute faces they listened while one of them quoted the words of the dead man 's brother : " If there is an American citizen here that man will not escape . " These were the words of the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday . Among the thirty who met to-day were Norman B. Squires , Charles A. , Frank S. Black , J. A. Leggett , L. M. S. Haynes , W. H. Quigley , J. H. Harrington , Charles S. Francis , T. Lee Benedict , D. C. Woodcock , C. V. Collins , George B. Wellington , C. Whitney Tillinghast , Esek Bussey , and Seymour Van Santvoord . They called a mass meeting , to be held to-morrow night , to express indignation at the crime of Tuesday , and to consider what may be done " to bring the guilty parties , whoever they may be , to speedy justice . " Meantime , John H. Boland , the Republican who was arrested and put in jail Tuesday on the charge of murder , was taken before Justice Donohue and held for one week . Boland was an intimate friend of the murdered man . When he was taken to jail he was told that he was wanted for murder , " having been within three feet of the victim when the shot was tired . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incarceration of Boland as an outrage , and a part of a conspiracy of the Murphy men to protect themselves . " It may require all our efforts to prevent an innocent man from being convicted of the crime of murder , " said one of this committee to a correspondent of The New-York Times , to-day . " The political machinery of the city will exert itself to do this . We have great odds to contend against , but we shall hope , at least , to see that no innocent man is made to suffer for the work of a hired repeater  --  a thug armed for murder . " " Bat ' Shea is surrounded by congenial influences . With an effrontery which is said to be without a parallel even in the most corrupt ward of Troy , he went yesterday , after his part in the row which resulted in murder , to the First District of the Thirteenth Ward , where he was allowed to cast one more ballot for the Murphy ticket , He was not arrested until more than three hours after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , the Murphy officials about the jail are very kind to him . The notorlous man was in the corridor of the jail this morning dressed in a neat suit of clothes , and with his head bandaged . He was allowed the freedom of the ? corridor , and was admired and envied by numerous unfortunates who had committed the crime of getting drunk , and were incarcerated behind iron , bars . Shea 's nose and ear were cut . He affirmed that he knew nothing of the begihning of the quarrel . During Tuesday 's battle John , one of Shea 's " pals , " was seriously shot . A mystery hangs about his doings after the shots were fired . He is not at home . The police claim to know where he is , but they will not tell . Senator Murphy went to Washington this morning . He expressed regret that there had been any killing at the polling place , and hurried away in response , it is said , to a telegram from Senator Hill , saying thet his presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about so much in a day as he has been to-day . His political methods , which have made it possible for a gang of corrupt assassins to throttle decent citizens who attempted to hold an honest election have been rehearsed a hundred times . His domination was never so odious as it is to-day , for to it the people trace the crime of yesterday . The murder was inevitable so long as such methods were in force . The gun that shot Robert Ross has been loaded on election day in Troy ever since " Boss " Murphy 's gang began their systematic frauds , a dozen years ago . That it remained until yesterday before its murderous bullet was discharged is due to no fault of the man that held it . Submission heretofore by law-abiding people has saved the shedding of blood . The first show of effort to resist the criminal proceedings brought the blow . The men who carry elections for " Boss " Murphy allow nothing to stop them . Murder , if necessary , is a part of the system . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
