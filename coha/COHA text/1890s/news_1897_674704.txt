txt The favorable decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upon the report of the Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners still leaves in doubt the project of building the subway , because of two difficulties presented by the decision itself . Contractors who contemplate bidding for the construction and operation of the road say that the enormous bond of e15,000,000 which apparently must be continued fur half a century is practically a bar to any company undertaking the work . On the other hand , counsel for the Commissioners say that the contention that the greater city 's debt limit will be exceeded if the work is carried out would , if sustained , not only put an end to rapid transit , but abrogate the consolidation of the several cities into Greater New York . The question of the bond may be adjusted early this week , but the question as to exceeding the borrowing capacity or debt limit of the Greater New York can not be settled so readily , as it is largely a matter of interpretation and point of view . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certain , the contractors , commissioners , and counsel say , that the construction of the road will be begun at once , under a contract that will protect the City 's interests and preserve the sanctity of debt limit . Both Edward M. Shepard and Albert B. Boardman say that such a contract can be drawn , and the Commissioners say that they have drawn It . In the meanwhile vne project awaits the further action of the Supreme Court . The Burden of Indebtedness . " The question of the debt limit of the Greater New York , " said Edward M. Shepard yesterday , in speaking of the objection raised by the opponents of rapid transit , " is a big one , but not necessarily a complicated one . Viewed in one way , the greater city has not exceeded its debt limit ; viewed in another way , it has . Unfortunately , if the second view is right , we have no consolidated city . Mr. Van Wyck has not been elected Mayor . We are either within the debt limit , or we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond that limitation and become a greater city on Jan. 1 , 1898 . " There is some unnecessary contusion about the indebtedness of the cities and counte-s that will soon compose the new city . This is especially true as regards Brooklyn and Kings County . We have several kinds of debt over there , which adds to the confusion . Part of this indebtedness of Brooklyn and part of the so-called debt of New York are not , however , properly within the class of debts had in mind when the debt limit is discussed . This part , as I shall show , should not be included in the indebtedness of the Greater New York in the sense of reducing the debt limit of the new city . The debts of the Greater New York have been compiled by Mr. Zabriskie , counsel for the opponents of the subway . Debt of Greater New York . " As put together by him , and as , too , generally conceived , the debt of Greater New York will be as follows : Boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,549,010 County of Kings 14,831,502 Borough of Richmond 3,082,0,0 Borough of Queens 11,328,754 Total 8205,803,045 " The debt of the County of Kings is properly separated from that of the City of Brooklyn , as it falls in a different class . " Now , to offset this debt we have , according to Mr. Zabriskie 's figures , the following assessed valuation of real estate in the different parts of Greater New York : Boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx M787,186,791 Borough of Brooklyn ? 569,810,762 Borough of Richmond 20,540,133 Borough of Queens 70,603,088 Total $2,448,140,794 " As the debt limit is 10 per cent . of the valuation , the borrowing capacity of the greater city on Jan. 1 , 1898 , will be $244 , - 814,97J . Now , according to Mr. Zabriskie , we shall have awaiting us a debt , already prepared for us , of *265,863,045 . By his calculation we shall be in excess of our Constitutional debt limit by $21,048,060 . " Before considering the correction of this estimate of the debts and assets of the Greater N2W York it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition of affairs . The assumption that we are already beyond our borrowing capacity goes too far , because , as I have said , it would not only kill off rapid transit , but put an end to consolidation . The Limit Can not Be Exceeded . " Judge George L. Ingraham , in his dissenting opinion , called attention to this . He said : " ' If the act of the Legislature imposing a liability for these obligations upon the new municipal corporation because of the fact that such liabilities exceed 10 per cent . of the value of real estate as assessed for taxation , is void , a situation is created which certainly is most serious , the consequences of which it is impossible to conceive . Just what effect it would have upon the new charter , upon the validity of the whole scheme consolidating these cities , upon the liability of the several cities , towns , and villages embraced within it , or upon the rights of creditors and bondholders , is most uncertain . ' " I think it is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt in excess of its limit , it will immediately cease to be a city , and the component parts will again become as they were prior to Jan. 1 , 1898 . The Constitution expressly prohibits such a condition , and Greater . New York could not start its career with an excess of indebtedness . " But I do not think that this estimate- of the debt of Greater New York is correct . It includes a number of things that are not debts in this sense , and which are not subject to the constitutional limitation . If examined carefully , the debt limit of the greater city will be found to be perfectly safe , and that we still have a margin left . A Margin of *4S,000,000 . " The Greater New York , when it starts as a municipality on Jan. 1 , and gathers up and assumes the debts of all the counties , cities , towns , and villages that compose it , will have a margin of borrowing capacity of about $48,000,000 . I think this is clear to any one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . while Brooklyn , when it annexed the remaining portion of Kings County on Jan. 1 , 1805 , assumed the debt of the county , amounting to $14 , - 851,892 , this debt can not be used to reduce the debt limit . The Constitution has this provision : Whenever hereafter the boundaries of any city shall become the same as those of a county , the power of the county to become indebted shall cease , but the debt of the county at that time existing shall not be Included as a part of the city debt . " New York will , of course , assume this debt , just as Brooklyn assumed It , but it is not to be considered as affecting in any way the borrowing limitation of the city . " Other items are to come out of the debt table given above . Among them is the sum of about $10,000,000 in cash realized on bonds which had been estimated as part of the outstanding obligations . Then $40,000 , - 000 to $45,000,000 more should be taken off toe debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , such as street and park improvements , condemnation of property . Rte . Altogett er the apparent indebtedness of the Greater New York is Lois reduced far below the limit , and we find that we have a margin of borrowing capacity of $48,207,547.49 . There is , therefore , more than enough for the present . And the additional and . assured provisions for the next five years would build two rapid transit roads ; such provisions for the next ten years would build four of tnem . Debt Limit to be Increased . " There is still another consideration . The debt limit , or the borrowing capacity of New York , will necessarily be very greatly increased next year by the increased valuation of real estate . This will not be done for the purpose of borrowing money or otherwise incurring debt , but it will be an inevitable effect of consolidation . " All of the territory in a city must necessarily be assessed at about the same rate of valuation .. The rate in New York and the Bronx is very much lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate will be lowered in Brooklyn . It is more than probable  --  it is practically certain ? that the rate in New York will be raised . If this is done , the increase in valuation will be at least 25 per cent . This will add about $450,000,001 ) to the assessed valuation in New York City as it is now constituted . This would mean a corresponding increase In the debt limit of $45,000,000 . " There is no doubt that we are safe within the debt limit , and will be just as safe when the contract for constructing the subway is let . New York will assume a great burden of debt that has been piled up in the various counties and cities ; but the corstitutional margin of its borrowing capacity is in no danger . The counties can no longer incur debts . The only power within the limits of New York tha ' can do this hereafter is the greater city itself . It has ample resources , and an ample limit of indebtedness to undertake this enterprise . especially as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single cent . " The contract can be so drawn , and is , in fact , so drawn , that it will not endanger the debt limit . This can be arranged by Issuing bond e as the road is built , so that only part of the debt will be incurred at a time A special provision would be made that would fully cover this , and protect the city from any obligation for work not completed .. If the bond matter is adjusted . I think we shall have no ferther difficulty in constructing the ispid transit subway. "
