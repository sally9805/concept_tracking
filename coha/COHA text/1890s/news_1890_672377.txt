txt The rumors that have been in eirottlatiOn for some time to the effect that Mr. Robert D. Benedict would make another attempt next Fall to become the Republican candidate for Congress from the Third Diitrict , Brooklyn , now represented by William C. Wallace . are fully corroborated by the publication of a letter from Mr. Benedict . It was written to a local paper and was as follows : " The use of my name in some items in the daily papers in connection with the next election in the Third Congressional District . and inquiries which . Some of my friends have made , seem to justify me in making a public announcement ( for which I ask room in your columns ) that I am a candidate for the nomination for member of Congress for that district . - Desiring to bo the nominee of the Republicans of that district . I propose to use all honorable means in my power to obtain that nomination at their hands . I therefore matte this public announcement at this early day in order that the situation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have abundant time to express their wish in the matter and to take such measures that the will of the majority shall be carried into effect . " This means a fight , and a long and bitte/ fight at that . Many very shrewd politicians thought yesterday that they saw in it an in.diess than of a battle-royal between Thomas C. Platt and Secretary of the Navy Tracy . Those whit have recently returned from Washington . are fall of information in regard to a sudden determination on the part of Gen. Tracy to plunge into big polities and so forget his recent affliction . His first move , they say , will be to assume control of his home county , and , in so doing , to drive Platt out . The naming of the next Representative from the Third Discrlet will decide a great deal in this matter . But it is not a new thing to see a fight in title district ; it is merely a new figure in that light in the person of the Secretary of the Navy . Two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced Robert D. Benedict to take a back seat Me Benedict was the nominee of his party assoe ? ates up to the very morning of the day on withal the convention met His selection was regarded as a certainty . It was not until the Chair . man took his seat that the delegates learned that Platt had sent for Mr. Benedict and de man dad that ne put his nead through the ma. chine collar , but that the demand had been spurned . Platt then sent John A. Nichols to the convention , and that statesman eat in the gallery and watched his tools , Warehouseman Bartlett and Ernst Nathan , do las dirty work . Notwithstanding the fact that the Twentieth Ward , where Mr. Benedict lived , was pledged to him , Nlohols was able to cast its solid vote for Wet lace , a man whose name was on a circular urging Mr. Benedict 's nomination . The refusal of Mr. Benedict to run on a stump ticket  --  a re ? fusel based on the fact that a national election was in progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that prevented the district from returning a Democratic Congressman . As it was , Darwin B. James 's old plurality of 5,000 was cut down more than one-half . But the bitterness then engendered has not passed away . it anything , the taming fight will be the hottest one Brooklyn nes ever seen . Wallaee , backed by Platt and Nichols , announces that he will ask for a renominationHe will have in tee convention the votes of the Nineteenth and Twenty-third Wards certainly . Mr. Benedict will as surely have the Thirteenth and the Twenty-first . The Seventh Is regarded as doubtfuL The Twentieth Ward . where both men live , will settle the light . Mr. Benedict is now President of the Republican Ward Association , and is tile mwc popular man in the district . Two years agU he carried the primary , and the delegates refused to vote for Wallace until the other delegates had elected him and it was merely a question of making it unanimous . That the ward will again support Bents diet is thought to be certain .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
