txt THE economic theory which forms for millions the basis of the views and feelings which they hold and cherish with regard to social problems , is that all wealth is produced by those kinds of toil or exertion of which all healthy men are capable , and to which the great majority of men , in every community , must and do devote themselves , and that consequently all private fortunes , or the exceptional riches of a minority , are simply an abstraction from the social product of the majority . Some of those who hold this theory look on this abstraction as mere legalized fraud or robbery . Others consider that for some reason , never sufficiently explained , the rich man has somehow a right to possess his riches , though he generally deserves to be denounced for the maniier in which he uses them . But at all events they , all of them , consider that the wealth of which great private fortunes are composed can not possibly have been produced by the men who , fairly or unfairly , acquire it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means necessarily the possession by one man of things that have been produced by many men . This theory is at the bottom of nearly all the social agitation of to-day , creating confusion and misunderstanding amongst men who ought to understand each other , rendering futile and mischievous much practical effort , and turning much generous and genuine feeling into absurdity . For , although when looked at superficially , it has the air of a truism , it embodies in reality the gravest of all speculative errors which , in our day , have affected any practical problem ; and it is high time that the exponents of economic science should rouse themselves , should expose its true character in clear and precise language , and should once for all expel it from the popular mind by establishing in its place the antagonistic truth that corresponds to it . For the political economists are mainly to blame for its prevalence ; and though it // may not be correct to say that they themselves are guilty of it , it could never have spread itself as it has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of their thought and their terminology with regard to a certain fundamental part of their subject . My aim , in the present paper , is to point out exactly what this inaccuracy and this incompleteness are ; but first let me state briefly what the truth is , by which the error I have just indicated requires to be displaced . If the error has at first sight the air of a truism , the truth at first sight will have the air of a paradox ; for it is this-that instead of the riches of the few being taken from the products of the many , the present competence of the many is taken from the products of the few ; and that not only do the few as a body produce the whole of the wealth which they enjoy , but that they produce as a body every increase of wealth which is year by year enjoyed by the many also . Great fortunes of certain kinds-such as those of stockbrokers-are no doubt abstractions ; they represent the capture of wealth , not the actual creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured is principally , if not entirely , wealth produced by the few , and captured from the few ; and even were this not so , it could make no difference to the main fact I am asserting . For before wealth can be captured , it must have been produced by some one ; and what I assert is that in all modern countries-in such at least as have been enriched by modern industrial progress  --  a minority produces more wealth than the majority ; that it produces the entire wealth of the richer classes , and a part , that is yearly larger , of the wealth of the poorer classes ; and that so far are the few from being the plunderers of the many , that the many , economically speaking , are the mere pensioners of the few . I said that at first sight such a statement has the air of a paradox ; but it will appear in a different light when its real meaning is considered . In the United States the same number of men who in the year 1840 produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year produce at the present day wealth to the value of two thousand three hundred millions . That is to say , in proportion to the number of producers , the product in fifty years has increased fifty-three per cent. , whilst if we carry back our inquiries to the beginning of the present century we shall find that it has increased by at least sixty-six per cent . Now this increase in the // productivity of the producers must be due to some cause or causes which are in operation now , and were not in operation then . In other words , for every hundred million dollars produced in the United States in the year 1893 sixty-six millions are due to causes which were not in operation in the year 1800 ; and as to what these causes are , there can , of course , be no doubt . They are scientific invention and discovery , and improved methods of dividing and applying labor . But these improvements have not been the work of chance , or of nature . They have been brought about by the deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just now said to be due to the improvements have been really due to the men by whom the improvements were made . Let me pause for a moment to insist on this last point . When it happens-as happens in all modern production-that single products are produced by the action of great numbers of men , we can not say , as we could under simpler conditions of industry , that in a literal sense any one man produced any one thing . Accordingly , unless we maintain that the products are produced by nobody , we are obliged to say that each man produces so much of the product as is added to the total when he joins in the process of production , or so much as would disappear from the total if he withdrew from the process of production . Thus , if we found that at any given period a thousand men produced cloth to the value of two thousand dollars a day , and another man arrived on the scene , who by controlling and directing them , enabled a thousand and one men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , we would say that this thousand-and-first man produced every day cloth to the value of four thousand dollars . This thousand-and-first man may be taken to represent all those men by whose action industrial productivity has increased during the present century ; and they , like that one man , must be held to be the actual producers of whatever additional wealth is , through their action , produced by the same number of men . These men who , as will appear presently , are a very small minority , correspond , broadly speaking , with the wealthier classes ; and out of every hundred million dollars produced in the United States to-day , these men produce at least sixty-six millions . When the truth on which I am insisting is explained in this // way , the paradoxical aspect which it at first wears disappears . In the eyes even of those who are most inclined to dispute it , it ceases to be an absurdity which they van ignore ; it appcars ill the light of a fallacy which it is necessary to refute ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes at once apparent . That ground is as follows : It may be urged  --  and indeed it constantly is urged-that all kinds of industrial action are to be classed together , as alike depending on social conditions in which we all share . No invention , no discovery , it is said , however new and important , is the work of any one man . The man who nominally makes it has used the inventions and the discoveries of others ; and he could never have made it if those others had not gone before him , and if society in general had not cooperated with them in bringing their ideas to a practical issue . Hence , it is argued that , however great may have been the effect of the action of a few men , their power of acting was derived entirely from society , and that society has a right to whatever wealth may result from it ; in fact , that society as a whole has virtually produced the wealth-that the wealth is a social product . I shall show presently that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would be to say of an anthem which Handel had just composed , and was himself playing on an organ , that it was the social product of the musician and the man who blew the bellows ; or to say of a portrait by Sir Joshua IReynolds , that it was the social product of the painter and the man who prepared the canvas . But though the argument is really absurd , it is to a certain extent plausible ; and it can be properly refuted only by examining it with some care . And this brings me back to what I said about the political economists : for here is the point with regard to which I taxed them with inaccuracy and incom* pleteness ; and it is to these deficiencies on their part , both in analysis and language , that the plausibility of the above argument is due . In the accepted language of political economy all industrial action is classed under the head of labor , and if any economist is asked.by what kind of action these improvements were brought about which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain special kinds-by the labor of invention , the labor of scientific discovery , or the labor of superintendence . These are the phrases employed by J. S. Mill . and though later writers have // attacked and amended many of his doctrines they have all of them to this day adhered rigidly to his analysis and terminology , by regarding and treating all kinds of industrial exertion as so many manifestations of the same force which is exerted when a man ploughs a field , carries a sack , builds a wall , or employs a tool at a turning lathe . They are one and all classed under the common heading of labor , and the higher kinds , which are particularized by the term ability , are regarded as nothing but labor that is highly skilled . Now if this were merely a question of scientific terms , such an inclusive use of the term labor might he possibly quite admissible , and might in itself lead to no misapprehensions . Political economy , however , is a science that can be of no value , except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally ; and it happens that the term labor , as used by practical men , has a widely different meaning from that which the economists give to it . The economists use it so as to include ability . Practical men use it so as to specifically exclude ability . There can be about this no manner of doubt . Let us , for instance , take the case of the sewing-machine . The production of every sewing-machine in existence must , if we use the language of the economists , be said to be largely due to the labor of the principal inventor , namely , the late Mr. Singer , who , by this so-called labor , produced for himself one of the largest fortunes in America ; but no politician who in any industrial dispute were to give himself out as representing the claims of labor would be understood , in any quarter of the civilized world , as professing to represent the claims of such persons as Mr. Singer . As soon as the ability of such persons succeeds and enriches them with its proper fruit-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows itself-it is at once excluded in the thought of the world generally from the kinds of cxertion which the world generally means by labor . And the world in general is perfectly right . If the term labor is used in the sense which , for all practical purposes , is universally attached to it , labor and ability are two distinct things . But here comes in the mischief produced by the error of the economists . Sii*ee the economists persist in speaking and conceiving of labor as including all kinds of industrial exertion , and since what the world means by labor does not include ability , it has come about that , in the thought of the world generally , ability is not regarded as // any kind of industrial exertion , or as forming any factor in the production of the " social product . " The error to which more immediately this misconception is due is an error in economic language ; but the real source of it is an error in economic analysis-an overlooking of the real difference between the faculties exercised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , and the mechanic , the ploughman , or " the toiler , " on the other . The difference is not one of greater or less skill . The invention of a new machine does not represent a development of the faculties employed in giving a perfect finish to its parts . Nor does the difference consist , except in an accidental way , in the fact that one kind of exertion is mainly mental , and the other muscular ; for there are many kinds of exertion recognized by everybody as labor ( such for instance as that of a pointsman on a railway ) in which the mind is the principal thing employed . The real difference is this Labor is the industrial exertion of a single man on some single piece of work , and on that single piece of work only , no matter what this may be  --  the carrying of a sack or the wheeling of a barrow , which requires no training at all ; or the finishing of a chronometer , which requires the training of half a life-time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which affects simultaneously the labor of many men ; multiplying or improving the results of it in each case . This is the fundamental distinction-entirely neglected by the economists-between the two great forces which , in the modern world , produce wealth ; and nearly all the confusion which prevails to-day with regard to economic questions is due to the fact that this distinction has been overlooked , and that the two forces have been treated as varieties of one . Unless this distinction , and the exact nature of it , are recoguized , and these two forces are separated in thought and name , it is as impossible without confusion or self-contradiction to either explain the phenomenon of modern industrial progress as a whole , or to discuss the problems to which it has given rise , as it would be to discuss or explain the theories of modern chemistry on the assumption that the universe was composed of the traditional four elements . But the moment we recognize that there are involved not one force but two , and that they differ from one another in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . We can at // once see and understand the force which represents the element of change in industrial productivity , and to which all the increase of wealth in the modern world has been due ; which is at the present day producing the greater part of it ; and which , being the natural monopoly of a small class , explains how the minority are creators not of their own wealth only , but of a large portion of the wealth of the majority besides . To establish this point fully , as against hostile criticism , would require a book  --  and I hope to devote one to this subject-instead of a short article ; for industrial ability is of various kinds , and unless these are all fully considered the nature of their operations can not be made clear , nor the extent to which , and the exact sense in which , each is a natural monopoly . But enough can be said , even in the course of a few pages , to indicate the principal facts which such an examination would bring home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will become evideut to us that industrial ability  --  or the faculty by which one man assists the labor of an indefinite number of men-may be either the genius of the scientific discoverer , the ingenuity of the inventor , the critical shrewdness of the man who discriminates a useful invention from useless ones and supplies or procures capital for putting it into use ; or it may be the enterprise or tenacity of purpose that pnshes a business and overcomes difficulties ; or the gift of managing men by which labor is economized ; or it may be the gift of constructive imagination by which labor is directed to the accomplishment of new ends . This is a rough classification , but it is sufficient for our present purpose , and it will enable the reader to realize the following truth-that all the various kinds of ability indicated are fundamentally gifts of character , not the results of education . Let a hundred men from childhood be brought up in the same school , let them all be devoted to the came branch of knowledge , let them enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and it will be found that not only is there no equality in the amount of knowledge they acquire , but that there is hardly any resemblance in the practical uses to which they will be able to put it . Two men may have worked together in one laboratory . One will never do more than understand the discoveries of others . The other will discover , like Columbus , some new world of mysteries . And as in discov*ry , so in action-so in the management of men-education does noth // ing to equalize differences of men 's powers . Rather it tends to show them , whilst , as for invention , some of the greatest inventors of the world have been men who can hardly be said to have had any education at all . Arkwright , for instance , had not even the education that might have come from being apprenticed to the industry which his genius revolutionized . And here let us ns notice how skill is something entirely different . Skill is entirely an acquisition  --  the result of training or education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual product - as may be seen if we look back to the earlier conditions of industry , when each craft was a " mystery , " and when , in the case of trades localized in the same place for generations , each worker was familiarized from childhood with methods , and tricks of dexterity , not known elsewhere . The hardware industries in certain English towns afford remarkable examples of this . Mere skill in such industries was perhaps greater at the beginning of the present century than it is now . And yet such are the limits of skill that the development of the steam engine was for a long time retarded by the difficulty experienced in making the cylinders of engines with anything like sufficient accuracy ; and if the world had had to depend upon skill alone the steam engine as we now know it would be still an utter impossibility . What made it possible was the ability of a small number of men , among whom may be mentioned Maudslay  --  the inventor or introducer of the sliderest . These men , by the improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly endowed thousands of skilled laborers with a power of accurate workmanship which was never before attainable . This power descended on them from the inventors like the fires of an industrial pentecost , and their efficiency , which was the slowly-matured social product of centuries , was by a force acting outside themselves multiplied a hundred fold within a few years . Now when once an invention , such as that of Maudslay , is made , it becomes , unless it is patented , public property , and this fact introduces us to another set of considerations . We shall find if we analyze the results of ability , that they divide themselves into three classes first , those which the author can keep to himself by means of a patent or otherwise , but which if not protected can be made use ot by other people ; secondly , those which are not susceptible of being patented or otherwise monopolized , but // which as soon as they are achieved necessarily become common property , such as the discovery of some new natural principle , or some exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only can not be protected , but do not require protection , because they can never become common property , or be separated from the able man , such as the results on a business of an able man 's management or enterprise . It is only when we deal with the second of these classes of results that we find any plausibility remaining in the so , cialistic argument which merges the functions of ability in those of social labor . A savant who discovers some new natural principle , and publishes the fact in a scientific treatise , can hardly claim to be the producer of any portion of the products which result from the application of this principle to industry . But the reason is that a discoverer of this kind rarely sees or cares to see farther than the natural principle itself , leaving it to others to make a practical application of it ; * and the moment we come to consider the practical applications of a discovery we shall find that these are the monopoly of ability of other kinds  --  the ability that invents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities and the ability that manages men . There can , it is true , be no monopoly of knowledge ; but the wider and more complex knowledge becomes , the more marked is the monopoly of the powers that enable men to command and use it . The two kinds of ability then that directly affect industry we may call , for the sake of brevity , inventive ability and the ability of eiterprise and it will be seen that neither of these can , in any practical sense , be regarded as merged in the common social exertion of the community , but that they are both of them the natural monopoly of a small and distinct class . The electric light , for ivstance , or the telephon*e , are no more the social products of the present age than " Hamlet 's was the social product of the whole population of England at the time of Elizabeth ; and a community can no more be said to be the author of what the man of ability invents than it can be said to enjoy the income which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carefully worked out ; but their * The effect , for instance , of Maudslay 's slide rest was the same on all mechani-. cal labor of a certain kind . Every workman of a certain grade received equal help from it ; whilst a new natural principle may be known by everybody but no workman will be assisted by it in any way till it is seized on and utilized by some one able man , or a few able men . // general bearings can be perceived from even this brief mention of them . It will be perceived how distinct ability is from labor , at once in the nature of its operation and in the class of persons possessing it ; how the ability of one man is , in productive power , out of all proportion to the labor of one man ; and how it may , without any greater effort being involved , produce results which are a thousand times as great . Perhaps the best means by which , in a short space , I can elucidate the subject will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interesting illustration , which will throw a yet further light on the various kinds of ability involved in the production of commodities , and the relation they bear to labor , and to each other . The illustration I refer to is that afforded by the business of the publisher . A publisher may publish books which will either be bought by nobody , or by very few people , or by many people , and not only the value of his business to himself , but the extent to which it enriches the community , will depeiid on how many people wish for the books , and on how much they wish for them . If it cost a thousand dollars to produce an edition of a book , and no one would buy a copy , all the exertion involved in producing it would be Wasted . The edition would have no exchange value . If only five people wanted to buy copies the exchange value of the whole edition would be only the exchange value of those five copies ; whilst if on the other hand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these had been priced at two hundred dollars each , it might well happeu that even this small demand would be destroyed . There are certainly not many books , which if one copy only were wanted , it would be worth while to print ; for few customers would pay for the cost of producing them . Ia order to make a publishing business possible , the exchange value of the books must at all events equal the cost of producing them ; and as they will possess no exchange value at all unless they can be sold at a sufficiently moderate price , and as the price will not cover the cost unless there is a demand for a sufficient number of them , it is easy to see the faculties on which the economic production of books depends . It depends-as do all kinds of production-on labor in the first place , much of it being skilled labor ; for without this , type could not be made or set , nor could the paper or the binding be produced . But the best paper aud the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book that nobody cares to read ; and the very foundation of every publisher 's business is the ability which selects such books as at any given moment will be appreciated by the public-that is to say , will possess a sufficient exchange value . It depends entirely on the exertion by him of this ability whether the contents of his warehouse are worth thousands of dollars , or are merely so much waste paper . So far as the amount and quality of the labor is concerned which is employed in their production , they might be either the one thing or the other. * It remains , however , to take account of the ability of the author , without which the ability of the publisher would be useless . It is not necessary to comment on so obvious a fact as that the value of the labor of the compositor depends on what the author has written ; but attention may be called to the connection between the two kinds of ability-that of the author , and that of the publisher , and to their different character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its results must be classed with those which , if not artificially protected , cease , when once they are produced , to be the monopoly of the producer ; for any book as soon as the copyright expires becomes the property of any or every publisher who chooses to appropriate it . But the ability of the publisher , which consists in the power of selection and judgment , produces results which remain of necessity his own ; for they consist of the salable qualities-or , in other words , the exchange value-of the editions which he offers to the public . The way in which these two kinds of ability coöperate in giving these editions their value-that is to say , in turning a book into a commodity which economically has any value at allmay be left to the consideration of the reader . I will only point out in the briefest way possible how the production of a book , as an economic commodity , illustrates the parts played by ability in all modern products . It involves , as we have seen , both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows how the results of the ability of the inventor-that is to say , the author-even were they secured to him by the artificial monopoly of copyright * is impossible to even mention here all the economic points which the above example illustrates with a singular clearness . But special attention may be called to the luminous way in which the case of a printed book shows the difference between cost of production and value-labor determining one , and ability of the various kinds the other , Labor would produce no value at all , except as the servant of ability , // must , before they can be invested with economic value , be for the time being monopolized by the selective ability of the publisher . It will show also the fallacy of the idea that , because certain results of ability can be monopolized by their authors , only through artificial means , they properly belong to the community ; and that men of business ability who utilize these results rob the community of the wealth which this use of them produces . If such men rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but some few individuals whose ability is of another kind . For if the publisher of a popular novel should increase his own receipts by paying nothing , or an insufficient sum , to the author , it is plain that the author is robbed of what is due to him , not the reader . And this suggests the mention of yet another point , which can be here indicated in the most cursory way only . In the popular language of the day , when the men who represent ability are spoken of they are spoken of generally as representing capital . A little reflection will show anybody that capital assists production only in so far as it represents ability and is utilized by ability ; that it is , in fact , to ability what hands are to labor . It will be seen also that capital  --  or at least the larger part of it-is the creation of past ability , not the creation of labor ; and that thus , if interest on capital-which is the sum paid by ability for the use of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often called , robbery , it is a robbery committed not by ability on labor , but by the inheritors of the results of past ability ou the monopolists of present ability . It is , in fact , a question between author and publisher , not a question between publisher and public . There is yet another point which the production of books may suggest to us . It is this-that in maintaining that labor plays a subordinate part in production , we are in no way casting a slur on the general qualities of the laborer . The author of the noblest poem , or the most profound philosophic treatise , may contribute less to the exchangeable wealth of a country during a given year than the author of such a book as The Mystery of a Hansom Cab . And thus many a laborer may be far superior as a man to the man on whose industrial ability he is absolutely dependent as a laborer . In dealing with the production of wealth we have simply got to consider what qualities , as a fact , play most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to the question // of whether such qualities do not often belong to men who , in point both of disposition and culture , are very inferior persons . It can in the long mn be to the interest of nobody to disguise the truth ; and an accurate study of economics will teach us this , that the few , however inferior morally , produce the larger part of the wealth of the modern world ; that wealth is not , as is commonly said , the result of social labor but the result of social labor multiplied by ability ; and that whatever claims the public may have on the wealth of the minority , that claim can not be sustained on the ground that the public has produced this wealth ; for the minority as a body have not only produced the whole of it , but a vast amount besides , which the public has already appropriated.
