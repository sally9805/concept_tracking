txt The News and Courier to-morrow , apropos of the Speakership contest , will Say : " In our opinion , and for purely politiOal rea ? sons , the Speakership should not be conferred on any Southern man , but it appears that the ratio is narrowing down to Mille and Crisp , with Mills in the lead . We could be entirely content with either , were the other out of the way , but if we had to make a choice between the two we should unhesitatingly vote for Mills ; not because Mr. Crisp is unfitted for the place , but because he does not so nearly represent the overwhelming sentiment of the Democratic Party of the country as his distinguished competitor . " There is also another and controlling reason why we should vote against Mr. Crisp . Unfortunately for him , as we think , and without his solicitation , as we believe , he has been made the special favorite of the utterly corrupt and treacherous faction of the Democratic Party represented by the New-York Sun . If Mr. Crisp possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects the most able and accomplished statesman this country has ever produced . it would be the duty of every Democrat in the House who takes a patriotic interest in the future welfare of the party to vote against him , on the ground that he has been made the representative of the Ben Butler wing of the Democracy . It will be a sad day for the party when it shall permit the SIn to shape its policy and to name its candidates . " We do not believe that Mr. Crisp is proud o/ the support which has come to him from thld quarter . But if ho should be elected under such auspices , it would be a misfortune to the party and the country . It is to be hoped that the Democrats will nominate Springer or Bynum or some other representative Northern Democrat , bat that if it mast be Mills or Crisp , the statesman from Texas will be chosen and not the representative of the Sun Democracy . ' It la better to be este than sorry . ' " THE CHRISTMAS " HARPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive than It is this year . From the change in the cover , made for the occasion , down to the end of the contents are things for eye and mind to linger over and enjoy . Especially rich is the number in illustrations , of which there are more than seventy , and several of them are interesting as specimens of the excellence of engraving In this country . Only two articles in the entire number are lacking in illustrations . Among the authors represented are Lowell , Aldrieh , Ilowells , Warner , thirtis , Androw Lang , Mark Twain , F. D. Millet Walter Besant , Henry Van Dyke , and Richard Harding Davis . Harper 's , as usual , is early In the Christmas field . An advantage of this is that one has ample time to read it before . his mind is overweighted with responsibilities of a similar kind in the periodical world . With this number Harper 's begins its eighty-fourth volume .                    @
