txt A scheme has been devised by somebody within the Farmers ' ' Alliance by which it Is proposed ' CO withhold this year 's crop from market until the farmers can get their own price , or at least a price considerably above the average . The plan is unfolded in a circular of , advice issued through accredited official channels to all members of farmers ' organizations in the United States . It suggests a great combination of the six thousand farmers ' organizations , and has the relative importance and force of an official order for a strike in the Federation of Labor or the Knights of Labor . The circular , which is presumed to be a secret document , is now ready for mailing , and will be sent to the members of all the farmers ' organizations in the country . The chief points in the circular , which is very long , are the following : This year seems especially designed by Providence to help farming interests . The wheat crop promises to be good , the European crops are worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted . As the harvest of 1884 , the largest we ever had , was 512,000,000 bushels , the , Government report Would indicate a ctoz of 494,000,000 bushels , say 500,000,000 in round numbers . The home consumption has in -- creased with the population , and is certainly 350,000,000 bushels , probably 380,000,000 , which leaves us 140,000,000 for export . Daring the last ten years we exported 127,000,000 yearly on an average which Europe received 107,000,000 , and the West Indies and South America 20,000,000 . This year we may have 13,000,000 more to spare , which will go to South America On account of the realpros treaties , and Europe will receive the average quantity of about 107,000,000 bushels and no more , as we have no reserves to draw upon . This would make both ends meet there if Europe had a good average crop , but Europe has not a good average crop ; in fact , it has the worst crop failure of the century . Under such circumstances it is Certain that the true value of wheat is greater than ever before , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . It is , however , more than probable , that after the bulk of the farmer 's harvests is in the elevators the speculator would come to the conclusion that , in view of the situation , wheat should be considered cheap at $2 a bushel , and he would earn the money which the farmer is entitled to . The way of legislation is too slow to save this crop from being sacrificed at ridiculously low prices . There isanother remedy , airaple , effective , and en- tirely within the farmer 's controL ? The stocks of wheat and flour are hardly large enough to supply the wants of this country until the new crop comes in . The temporary safety of the speculator depends on an early crop and a rash into market . If for some reason , wet weather for instance , the rush of new wheat should not come as early as anticipated . the market for this crop would start in with double the prices obtained during the last few years . But if wet weather should not prevent an early harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculator to rob him of half the valub of his crop 7 Could he not act as if rain had really prevented an early harvest , and for once avoid undue haste in supplying the speculator with the means of keeping down prices I Resolve , for instance , that in view of the condition of the world 's orop , a minimum price of $L35 for wheat in New.York is moderate and conservative , and that members of the Alliance pledge themselves not to market their wheat at lower prices , unless they are under contract , and that they will use their best efforts with friends and neighbors outside of the organization also , to act on the same resolution . Resolve also that the State Alliance form a committee which shall keep itself posted about the state of the world 's markets , and from time to time notify the farmers of changes taking place , and advise them upon the minimumprices that they may reasonably insist upon This action would be similar to a strike , but with this difference : The workingman loses money every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , and if some should be inconvenienced for a few weeks for ready cash , they will surely not be poorer by it . The workingman can not tell whether he will be successful and how long it will take him to enforce his demands , but the farmer will know that in a year like this he must be successful , for nothing can bs substituted for his product , and that a few weeks must decide the war .
