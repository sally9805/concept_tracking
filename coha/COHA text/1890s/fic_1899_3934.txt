THE INDIAN ON THE TRAIL *** Produced by David Widger THE INDIAN ON THE TRAIL From " Mackinac And Lake Stories " , 1899 By Mary Hartwell Catherwood Maurice Barrett sat waiting in the old lime-kiln built by the British in the war of 1812  --  a white ruin like much-scattered marble , which stands bowered in trees on a high part of the island . He had , to the amusement of the commissioner , hired this place for a summer study , and paid a carpenter to put a temporary roof over it , with skylight , and to make a door which could be fastened . Here on the uneven floor of stone were set his desk , his chair , and a bench on which he could stretch himself to think when undertaking to make up arrears in literary work . But the days were becoming nothing but trysts with her for whom he waited . First came the heavenly morning walk and the opening of his study , then the short half-hour of labor , which ravelled off to delicious suspense . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any girl 's , then the long exquisite outline which could be nobody 's in the world but hers , her face under its sailor hat , the blown blond hair , the blue eyes . Then her little hands met his outstretched hands at the door , and her whole violet-breathing self yielded to his arms . They sat down on the bench , still in awe of each other and of the swift miracle of their love and engagement . Maurice had passed his fiftieth year , so clean from dissipation , so full of vitality and the beauty of a long race of strong men , that he did not look forty , and in all out-door activities rivalled the boys in their early twenties . He was an expert mountain-climber and explorer of regions from which he brought his own literary material ; inured to fatigue , patient in hardship , and resourceful in danger . Money and reputation and the power which attends them he had wrung from fate as his right , and felt himself fit to match with the best blood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social equal , and had grown up next door , while his unsatisfied nature searched the universe for its mate  --  a wild sweetbrier-rose of a child , pink and golden , breathing a daring , fragrant personality . He hearkened back to some recognition of her charm from the day she ran out bareheaded and slim-legged on her father 's lawn and turned on the hose for her play . Yet he barely missed her when she went to an Eastern school , and only thrilled vaguely when she came back like one of Gibson 's pictures , carrying herself with state-liness . There was something in her blue eyes not to be found in any other blue eyes . He was housed with her family in the same hotel at the island before he completely understood the magnitude of what had befallen him . " I am awfully set up because you have chosen me , " she admitted at first . He liked to have her proud as of a conquest , and he was conscious of that general favor which stamped him a good match , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you done this morning ? " she inquired , looking at his desk . " Enough to tide over the time until you came . Determination and execution are not one with me now . " Her hands were cold , and he warmed them against his face . " It was during your married life that determination and execution were one ? " " Decidedly . For that was my plodding age . Sometimes when I am tingling with impatience here I look back in wonder on the dogged drive of those days . Work is an unhappy man 's best friend . I have no concealments from you , Lily . You know I never loved my wife  --  not this way  --  though I made her happy ; I did my duty . She told me when she died that I had made her happy . People can not help their limitations . " " Do you love me ? " she asked , her lips close to his ear . " I am you ! Your blood flows through my veins . I feel you rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love like that , do you ? " She shook her head . " When you are out of my sight I do not live ; I simply wait . What is the weird power in you that creates such gigantic passion ? " " The power is all in your imagination . You simply do n't know me . You think I am a prize . Why , I  --  flirt  --  and I 've  --  kissed men ! " He laughed . " You would be a queer girl , at your age , if you had n't  --  kissed men  --  a little . Whatever your terrible past has been , it has made you the infinite darling that you are ! " She moved her eyes to watch the leaves twinkling in front of the lime-kiln . " I must go , " she said . " ' I must go ' ! " he mocked . " You are no sooner here than  --  ' I must go ' ! " " I ca n't be with you all the time . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Appearances are nothing . This is the only real thing in the universe . " " But I really must go . " She lifted her wilful chin and sat still . They stared at each other in the silence of lovers . Though the girl 's face was without a line , she was more skilled in the play of love than he . " Indeed I must go . Your eyes are half shut , like a gentian . " " When you are living intensely you do n't look at the world through wide-open eyes , " said Maurice . " I never let myself go before . Repression has been the law of my life . Think of it ! In a long life-time I have loved but two persons  --  the woman I told you of , and you . Twenty years ago I found out what life meant . For the first time , I knew ! But I was already married . I took that beautiful love by the throat and choked it down . Afterwards , when I was free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had to wait for you to bloom , lotos flower ! This is living ! All the other years were preparation . " " Do you never see her ? " inquired the girl . " Who ? That first one ? I have avoided her . " " She loved you ? " " With the blameless passion that we both at first thought was the most perfect friendship . " " Would n't you marry her now if she were free ? " " No . It is ended . We have grown apart in renunciation for twenty years . I am not one that changes easily , you see . You have taken what I could not withhold from you , and it is yours . I am in your power . " They heard a great steamer blowing upon the strait . Its voice reverberated through the woods . The girl 's beautiful face was full of a tender wistfulness , half maternal . Neither jealousy nor pique marred its exquisite sympathy . It was such an expression as an untamed wood-nymph might have worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sad , " she breathed . Vague terror shot through Maurice 's gaze . " That is a strange thing for you to say to me , Lily . Is it all you can say  --  when I love you so ? " " I was thinking of the other woman . Did she suffer ? " " At any rate , she has the whole world now  --  beauty , talent , wealth , social prestige . She is one of the most successful women in this country . " " Do I know her name ? " " Quite well . She has been a person of consequence since you were a child . " " I could n't capture the whole world , " mused Lily . Maurice kissed her small fingers . " Some one else will put it in your lap , to keep or throw away as you choose . " The hurried tink-tank of an approaching cow-bell suggested passers . Then a whir of wheels could be heard through tangled wilderness . The girl met his lips with a lingering which trembled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going . Are you coming down the trail with me ? " Maurice shut the lime-kiln door , and crossed with her a grassy avenue to find among birches the ravelled ends of a path called the White Islander 's Trail . You may know it first by a triangle of roots at the foot of an oak . Thence a thread , barely visible to expert eyes , winds to some mossy dead pines and crosses a rotten log . There it becomes a trail cleaving the heights , and plunging boldly up and down evergreen glooms to a road parallel with the cliff . Once , when the island was freshly drenched in rain , Lily breathed deeply , gazing down the tunnel floored with rock and pine-needles , a flask of incense . " It is like the violins ! " In that seclusion of heaven Maurice could draw her slim shape to him , for the way is so narrow that two are obliged to walk close . They parted near the wider entrance , where a stump reared itself against the open sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a crouching figure . " There is the Indian on the trail , " said Lily . " You must go back now . " " He looks so formidable , " said Maurice ; " especially in twilight , and , except at noon , it is always twilight here . But when you reach him he is nothing but a stump . " " He is more than a stump , " she insisted . " He is a real Indian , and some day will get up and take a scalp ! It gives me a shiver every time I come in sight of him crouched on the trail ! " " Do you know , " complained her lover , " that you have n't told me once to-day ? " " Well  --  I do . " " How much ? " " Oh  --  a little ! " " A little will not do ! " " Then  --  a great deal . " " I want all  --  all ! " Her eyes wandered towards the Indian on the trail , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve . " I have told you I love you . Why does n't that satisfy you ? " " It is n't enough ! " " Perhaps I ca n't satisfy you . I love you all I can . " " All you can ? " " Yes . Maybe I ca n't love you as much as you want me to . I am shallow ! " " For God 's sake , do n't say you are shallow ! There is deep under deep in you ! I could n't have staked my life on you , I could n't have loved you , if there had n't been ! Say I have only touched the surface yet , but do n't say you are shallow ! " The girl shook her head . " There is n't enough of me . Do you know , " she exclaimed , whimsically , " that 's the Indian on the trail ! You 'll never feel quite sure of me , will you ? " Maurice 's lips moved . " You are my own ! " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled slowly with tears . " I ama child of the devil ! " exclaimed Lily , with vehemence . " I give people trouble and make them suffer ! " " She classes me with ' people ' ! " Maurice thought . He said , " Have I ever blamed you for anything ? " " No . " " Then do n't blame yourself . I will simply take what you can give me . That is all I could take . Forgive me for loving you too much . I will try to love you less . " " No , " the girl demurred . " I do n't want you to do that . " " I am very unreasonable , " he said , humbly . " But the rest of the world is a shadow . You are my one reality . There is nothing in the universe but you . " She brushed her eyes fiercely . " I must n't cry . I 'll have to explain it if I do , and the lids will be red all day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lava , with the conviction that he had staked his all late in life on what could never be really his . She would diffuse herself through many . He was concentrated in her . His passion had its lips burned shut . " I am Providence 's favorite bag-holder , " was his bitter thought . " The game is never for me . " " Good-bye , " said Lily . " Good-bye , " said Maurice . " Are you coming into the casino to-night ? " " If you will be there . " " I have promised a lot of dances . Good-bye . Go back and work . " " Yes , I must work , " said Maurice . She gave him a defiant , radiant smile , and ran towards the Indian on the trail . He turned in the opposite direction , and tramped the woods until nightfall . At first he mocked himself . " Oh yes , she loves me ! I 'm glad , at any rate , that she loves me ! There will be enough to moisten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean that is not her fault . " Why had a woman been made who could inspire such passion without returning it ? He reminded himself that she was of a later , a gayer , lighter , less strenuous generation than his own . Thousands of men had waded blood for a principle and a lost cause in his day . In hers the gigantic republic stood up a menace to nations . The struggle for existence was over before she was born . Yet women seemed more in earnest now than ever before . He said to himself , " I have always picked out natures as fatal to me as a death-warrant , and fastened my life to them . " The thought stabbed him that perhaps his wife , whom he had believed satisfied , had carried such hopeless anguish as he now carried . Tardy remorse for what he could not help gave him the feeling of a murderer . And since he knew himself how little may be given under the bond of marriage , he could not look forward and say , " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , have society on his side ; and children  --  he drew his breath hard at that . Her ways with children were divine . He had often watched her instinctive mothering of , and drawing them around her . And it should be much to him that he might look at and , touch her . There was life in her mere presence . He felt the curse of the artistic temperament , which creates in man the exquisite sensitiveness of woman . Taking the longest and hardest path home around the eastern beach , Maurice turned once on impulse , parted a screen of birches , and stepped into an amphitheatre of the cliff , moss-clothed and cedar-walled . It sloped downward in three terraces . A balcony or high parapet of stone hung on one side , a rock low and broad stood in the centre , and an unmistakable chair of rock , cushioned with vividly green-branched moss , waited an occupant . Maurice sat down , wondering if any other human being , perplexed and tortured , had ever domiciled there for a brief time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their waists . The spacious open was darkened by dense shade overhead . Bois Blanc was plainly in view from the beach . But the eastern islands stretched a line of foliage in growing dusk . Maurice felt the cooling benediction of the place . This world is such a good world to be happy in , if you have the happiness . When the light faded he went on , climbing low headlands which jutted into the water , and sliding down on the other side ; so that he reached the hotel physically exhausted , and had his dinner sent to his room . But a vitality constantly renewing itself swept away every trace of his hard day when he entered the gayly lighted casino . He no longer danced , not because dancing ceased to delight him , but because the serious business of life had left no room for it . He walked along the waxed floor , avoiding the circling procession of waltzers , and bowing to a bank of pretty faces , but thinking his own thought , in growing bitterness : " They who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had it to do over again , I would take what I wanted in spite of everything , and let the consequences fall where they would ! " Looking up , he met in the eyes the woman of his early love . She was holding court , for a person of such consequence became the centre of the caravansary from the instant of her arrival ; and she gave him her hand with the conventional frankness and self-command that set her apart from the weak . Once more he knew she was a woman to be worshipped , whose presence rebuked the baseness he had just thought . " Perhaps it was she who kept me from being worse , " Maurice recognized in a flash ; " not I myself ! " " Why , Mrs. Carstang , I did n't know you were here ! " he spoke , with warmth around the heart . " We came at noon . " " And I was in the woods all day . " Maurice greeted the red-cheeked , elderly Mr. Carstang , whom , according to half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other half , she simply endured . At any rate , he looked pleased with his lot . While Maurice stood talking with Mrs. Carstang , the new grief and the old strangely neutralized each other . It was as if they met and grappled , and he had numb peace . The woman of his first love made him proud of that early bond . She was more than she had been then . But Lily moved past him with a smile . Her dancing was visible music . It had a penetrating grace  --  hers , and no other person 's in the world . The floating of a slim nymph down a forest avenue , now separating from her partner , and now joining him at caprice , it rushed through Maurice like some recollection of the Golden Age , when he had stood imprisoned in a tree . There was little opportunity to do anything but watch her , for she was more in demand than any other girl in the casino . Hop nights were her unconscious ovations . He took a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist to the core , it separated her from her lover and gave her to other men . Next morning he waited for her in the study with a restlessness which would not let him sit still . More than once he went as far as the oak-tree to watch for a glimmer . But when Lily finally appeared at the door he pretended to be very busy with papers on his desk , and looked up , saying , " Oh ! " The morning was chill , and she seemed a fair Russian in fur-edged cloth as she put her cold fingers teasingly against his neck . " Are you working hard ? " " Trying to . I am behind . " " But if there is a good wind this afternoon you are not to forget the Carstangs ' sail . They will be here only a day or two , and you must n't neglect them . Mrs. Carstang told me if I saw you first to invite you . " Maurice met the girl 's smiling eyes , and the ice of her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As soon as I saw you come in last night , I knew she was  --  the other woman . " " You did n't look at me . " " I can see with my eyelashes . Do you know , I have often thought I should love her if I were a man ! " There was not a trace of jealousy in Lily 's gentle and perfect manner . " You resemble her , " said Maurice . " You have the blond head , and the same features  --  only a little more delicate . " " I have been in her parlor all morning , " said Lily . " We talked about you . I am certain , Maurice , Mrs. Carstang is in her heart still faithful to you . " That she should thrust the old love on him as a kind of solace seemed the cruelest of all . There was no cognizance of anything except this one maddening girl . She absorbed him . She wrung the strength of his manhood from him as tribute , such tribute as everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock , tranced by the strong control which he kept over himself . " I must go , " - said Lily . She had not sat down at all . Maurice shuffled his papers . " Good-bye , " she spoke . " Good-bye , " he answered . She did not ask , " Are you coming down the trail with me ? " but ebbed softly away , the swish of her silken petticoat subsiding on the grassy avenue . Her lover stretched his arms across the desk and sobbed upon them with heart-broken gasps . " It is killing me ! It is killing me ! And there is no escape . If I took my life my disembodied ghost would follow her , less able to make itself felt than now ! I can not live without her , and she is not for me  --  not for me ! " He cursed the necessity which drove him out with the sailing party , and the prodigal waste of life on neutral , trivial doings which can not be called living . He could see Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping down a wild beast in him which desired to toss overboard the men who crowded around her . She was more deliciously droll than any comedienne , full of music and wit , the kind of spirit that rises flood-tide with occasion . He was himself hilarious also during this experience of sailing with two queens surrounded by courtiers and playing the deep game of fascination , as if men were created for the amusement of their lighter moments . Lily 's defiant , inscrutable eyes mocked him . But Mrs. Carstang gave him sweet friendship , and he sat by her with the unchanging loyalty of a devotee to an altar from which the sacrament has been removed . Next morning Lily did not come to the lime-kiln . Maurice worked furiously all day , and corrected proof in his room at night , though tableaux were shown in the casino , both Mrs. Carstang and Lily being head and front of the undertaking . The second day Lily did not come to the limekiln . But he saw her pass along the grassy avenue in front of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . They waved their hands to him . Maurice sat with his head on his desk all the afternoon , beaten and broken-hearted . He told himself he was a poltroon ; that he was losing his manhood ; that the one he loved despised him , and did well to despise him ; that a man of his age who gave way to such weakness must be entering senility . The habit of rectitude would cover him like armor , and proclaim him still of a chivalry to which he felt recreant . But it came upon him like revelation that many a man had died of what doctors had called disease , when the report to the health-officer should have read : " This man loved a woman with a great passion , and she slew him . " The sigh of the woods around , and the sunlight searching for him through his door , were lonelier than illimitable space . It was what the natives call a " real Mackinac day , " with infinite splendor of sky and water . Maurice heard the rustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came through the white waste of stones . She stopped and gazed at him with large hunted eyes , and submitted to his taking and kissing her hands . It was so blessed to have her at all that half his trouble fled before her . They sat down together on the bench . Much of his life Maurice had been in the attitude of judging whether other people pleased him or not . Lily reversed this habit of mind , and made him humbly solicitous to know whether he pleased her or not . He silently thanked God for the mere privilege of having her near him . Passionate selfishness was chastened out of him . One can say much behind the lips and make no sound at all . " If I drench her with my love and she does not know it , " thought Maurice , " it can not annoy her . Let me take what she is willing to give , and ask no more . " " The Carstangs are gone , " said Lily . " Yes ; I bade them good-bye this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't say you regret their going . " " I never seek Mrs. Carstang . " He sat holding the girl 's hands and never swerving a glance from her face , which was weirdly pallid  --  the face of her spirit . He felt himself enveloped and possessed by her , his will subject to her will . He said within himself , voicelessly : " I love you . I love the firm chin , the wilful lower lip , and the Cupid 's bow of the upper lip . I love the oval of your cheeks , the curve of your ears , the etched eyebrows , and all the little curls on your temples . I love the proud nose and most beautiful forehead . Every blond hair on that dear head is mine ! Its upward tilt on the long throat is adorable ! Have you any gesture or personal trait which does not thrill me ? But best of all , because through them you yourself look at me , revealing more than you think , I adore your blue eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of a man who lay face downward far out in the desert , and had not a drop of water to moisten his lips . " " Is he in your story ? " " Yes , he is in my story . " " I thought perhaps you did n't want me to come here any more , " she said . " You did n't think so ! " flashed Maurice . " But you turned your cheek to me the last time I was here . You were too busy to do more than speak . " Voicelessly he said : " I lay under your feet , my life , my love ! You walked on me and never knew it . " Aloud he answered : " Was I so detestable ? Forgive me . I am trying to learn self-control . " " You are all self-control ! If you have feeling , you manage very well to conceal it . " " God grant it ! " he said , in silence , behind his lips . " For the touch of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to love so much and be still ! " Aloud he said , " Do n't you know the great mass of human beings are obliged to conceal their feelings because they have not the gift of expression ? " " Yes , I know , " answered Lily , defiantly . " But that can never be said of you , " Maurice went on . " For you are so richly endowed with expression that your problem is how to mask it . " " Are you coming down the trail with me ? It is sunset , and time to shut the study for the day . " He prepared at once to leave his den , and they went out together on the trail , lingering step by step . Though it was the heart of the island summer , the maples still had tender pink leaves at the extremities of branches ; and the trail looked wild and fresh as if that hour tunnelled through the wilderness . Sunset tried to penetrate western stretches with level shafts , but none reached the darkening path where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like respite after burning pain . Maurice wondered how close he might draw this changeful girl to him without again losing her . He had compared her to a wild sweetbrier-rose . She was a hundred-leaved rose , hiding innumerable natures in her depths . They passed the dead pines , crossed the rotten log , and came silently within sight of the Indian on the trail , but neither of them noted it . The Indian stood stencilled against a background of primrose light , his bow magnified . It was here that Maurice felt the slight elastic body sag upon his arm . " I am tired , " said Lily . " I have been working so hard to amuse your friends ! " " Would that I were my friends ! " responded Maurice . He said , silently : " I love you ! I wonder if I shall ever learn to love you less ? " The unspoken appeal of her swaying figure put him off his guard , and he found himself holding her , the very depths of his passion rushing out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want !  --  the you that is not any other person on earth or in the universe ! Whatever it is  --  the identity  --  the spirit  --  that is you  --  the you that was mated with me in other lives  --  that I have sought  --  will seek  --  must have , whatever the price in time and anguish !  --  understand !  --  there is nobody but you ! " Tears oozed from under her closed lids . She lay in his arms passive , as in a half-swoon . " You do the talking , " she breathed . " I do the loving ! " Without opening her eyes she met him with her perfect mouth , and gave herself to him in a kiss . He understood a spirit so passionately reticent that it denied to itself its own inward motions . The wilfulness of a solitary exalted nature melted in that kiss . All the soft curves of her face concealed and belied the woman who opened " her wild blue eyes and looked at him , passionately adoring , fierce for her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that I loved you all I do , you would tire of me ! " " How can you say I could ever tire of you ? " " I know it ! When you are not quite sure of me , you love me best ! " Maurice laughed against her lips . " You said that was the Indian on the trail  --  my never being quite sure of you ! Will you take an oath with me ? " " Yes . " " This is the oath : I swear before God that I love you more than any one else on earth ; more than any one else in the universe . " She repeated : " I swear before God that I love you more than any one else on earth ; more than any one else in the universe ! " Maurice held her blond head against his breast , quivering through flesh and spirit . That was the moment of life . What was conquering the dense resistance of material things , or coming off victor in bouts with men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the lover . The heart of the island held them like the heart of Allah . The pines sang around them . " We must go on , " spoke Lily . " It is so dark we ca n't see the Indian on the trail . " " There is n't any Indian on the trail now , " laughed Maurice . " You can never frighten me with him again . " Illustration : That was the moment of life 222
