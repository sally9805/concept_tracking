txt The indefatigable wool-tariff crank of Ohio , ex-Controller LAWRENCE , who wrote the absurd resolution concerning wool in the platform recently adopted by the Republicans of that State , has now held a meeting of his Wool Growers ' Association and promulgated a series of resolutions , in which it is asserted that " free wool and mutton would be the colossal political crime of the age , " and that " all the wool needed for consumption in this country 's ' amid and would be produced here if the " protection " were " full and adequate . " If LAWRENCE could have his way , the duties on all kinds of wool would be so high that no one could afford to import a pound , and we presume he would also make any attempt to import wool a penitentiary offense . Tho absurdity of the attitude of LAWRENCE and of those who permit themselves to be led by him is shown most clearly by the facts with reference to carpet wool , or wool of the third class . This kind of wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that wool growers who have common sense will not raise sheep whose fleeces are worth only 50 or 60 cents apiece when by the same expenditure of time and labor they can raise sheep whose fleeces are worth three or four times as much . They are willing to let the inhabitants of Asia ? have a monopoly of that branch of the wool industry . Last year , out of 168 , - 000,000 pounds of wool imported into this country , 118,000,000 pounds , or 70 per cent. , were of this kind , the average value being about 9 cents a pound . Manufacturers of carpets must have it . LAWRENCE would compel them to make carpets of fine clothing wool or shut up their factories . Carpets , he says , are " luxuries , " and the people can get along without them . Certain prominent authorities on the side of are at variance with LAWRENCE as to the expediency of imposing duties on this coarse and cheap carpet wool . When the Allison Tariff bill was before the Senate , in oppositionz:to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Manufacturer , which-is the organ of Mr. DOLAN 'S high-tariff association in Philadelphia and of protectionists generally in Pennsylvania , complained of the proposed duties on carpet wool , and ' asserted that such wool would not be grown in this country . It offered the following explanation : " The reason for this . of course , is that no enlightened American is going to feed and care for a sheep whose fleece is *worth 50 cents when the same amount of food and care will produce a sheep with a fleece worth $1.50 . Nor is it desirable that he should do so . The success of the Senate bill as it stands will raise the price of carpet wool . and also the prices of carpets , and will do good to nobody . " The Anitricart Wool Reporter , a protectionist journal , which is an authority in the wool and woolens industries , said : " The production of third-olass ( carpet ) wools throughout the world is sure to diminish in the future , because few aheepowners deliberately breed backward , any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likeness and characteristics of their cave-dwelling aneestora . " And even the American Protective Tariff League , of which LAWRENCE is an officer , said with reference to the silly proclamations of LAWRENCE 'S Wool Growers ' Association : " The assertion is again advanced that the United States is capable of producing the bulk of the carpet wools used in this country . We think this is an unfortunate position for the wool growers to take . It is well Known that the lowest grades of carpet wools are from wild sheep , and could never be produced in this country except at a cost for production which would require from 500 to 1,000 per cent . of protection . it would be far better to concede this truth . " But when MCKINLEY and his Ways and Means Committee began the preparation of a tariff bill . the wool schedule was turned over to LAWRENCE , who not only increased the duties on carpet wools as they were openly shown in the bill , but also provided for still greater additions in obscure and tricky clauses relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no more serviceable allies than this man LAWRENCE and his Ohio Wool Growers ' Association , and they should rejoice at the evidence that he is still in business at the old stand . Ways that it is not necessary to dilate upon to ' our readers . It is a matter , if not of ? public knowledge , at least of publics suspicion , that there are persons involved in the Commercial Bank case who could command all the resources of the local machine to protect them from exposure , and still more from the embarrassment of trial and conviction under the criminal law . Yet it remains the duty of each Grand Jury to take up just such inquiries , and the power to get at the truth , if nothing more , is very great . This power should be used , because it is very salutary for the public to know the truth . Then , if nothing more comes of it , the responsibility is fairly definite . The people can tell with a good deal of certainty who blocks the path of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the people can have their way and when the machine is powerless to ' resist them . By all means , if a properkind and amount of evidence be produced , let the Grand Jury act , and , according to their oath , without fear or favor . A CASE FOR INVESTIGATION . The probability that the affairs of the Commercial Bank of Brooklyn may be ex- ? amined by the Grand Jury of the county is reassuring , because it is a reminder that there is a practical relation between the criminal law and the banking business . That business in many of its features is essentially fiduciary , and the criminal law has for one of its chief principles that a betrayal of trust for gain is an offense against society and exposes the offender to the penalties of crime . It certainly should be so , because , in the nature of things , a large portion of depositors have no protection save what the honor - of bank officers or the fear of the law may give them . If the former be dull , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example whenever the facts warrant . We do not wish to prejudge this case , but it is no exaggeration to say that , on the face of it , it is precisely such a one as the Grand Jury is justified and required to take up . It may as well be remembered , however that the Grand Jury in Kings County is an institution , excellent in itself .
