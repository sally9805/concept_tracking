txt IT has been said about business corporations that " upon the &gt;character of their future , more than upon anything else , depends the nature of the conclusion of the industrial revolution " that is in progress . It is my belief that the selfish and dishonest management of business corporations has been the chief cause of the great inequality in the distribution of wealth during the past forty years ; whereas , if they were honestly and safely conducted , they would afford a safe and satisfactory investment for small sums and thus tend to equalize the wealth of the people . A railway president , by bearing or bulling the stock of his railway company , of whose interests he is the chief trustee , can in a few days and without any consideration transfer to his own pockets a million dollars from the pockets of the little holders of stock who stand shivering on the outside of the management . By prostituting his position of trust to his own ends , the director or officer can readily enrich himself at the expense of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he desires he can paralyze the company for the benefit of another company in which he has a greater interest . Stock can be watered , assets diverted , stockholders-frozen out , the management put in control of nearly all the stock , a huge sham structure can be reared upon a really invisible and infinitesimal base , often to do a business that needs no corporation at all , whereby creditors are peaceably robbed and the holdings of the poor are confiscated . The directors and officers , who are actual trustees of a legal trust fund , are not in most *3tates required to hold more than one share of stock , or to be worth sex en cents , or to have any skill for the business , or to give a bond or other // security for honest management of the trust , unlike any other trustee in the whole scope of the law . Two or three men at the head of the management of a combination or trust can , at will , abolish the law of supply and demand , set aside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of commerce , close factories , tell thousands at a time whether they can work or not , determine who shall and who shall not do business , and dictate to the public both their market and also the price they shall pay . The foregoing are but a few of the many injurious things that corporation managers can do in the present state of the law . At the same time , th' corporation is a mighty agency for good . It is a necessity of a highly civilized people . It is the only practical means for carrying on a gigantic enterprise or a business where a large number of people are interested . It enables enterprises , that are of great public importance but involve a large element of risk , to be undertaken . It affords the only means for persons with small sums of money to invest them . A vast increase in working capital has been brought to commerce and industry by corporations . They have proven a *Aessing for the race and their continued existence is assured . But , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wealth , and influence , the State must have better control of them . Their newness to the law has rendered it difficult to l*gislate well regarding them . The time , however , is now ripe for reform and revision of the corporate laws of the States . Ex* perience has taught ns the defects of such laws and the nature of corporate activity . Now we can contrive a remedy . The people who have suffered , actually or fancifully , from the dishonest conduct of corporations are clamoring for reform . Our statesmen and students of economics are calling attention to the need . In fact , there is a demand from all sides to reform business corporations so as to make them less injurious and more useful . In this era of industrialism the people are compelled to look to the state for help . It is idle longer to expect , as did the economists of the past , that the selfish interests of men will so operate against one another as to force competition in mannfacture when entrenched behind corporate bulwarks to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest privileges , and the fullest justice . The law of competition , while // sufficient by itself for individuals , can not execute itself in the face of the modern means for combination . The telegraph , telephone , quick postal and transportation service , and daily newspapers make it now easy to combine , and to work effectually in combination , whether incorporated or not . Hence , the state must assist in upholding the law of competition by the exercise of a wise , effectual , yet just control . Since corporations can be created only by the state , there is no reason why the latter can not and should not dictate such terms and conditions for the privilege as are best fitted to make corporations more useful and less harmful . Such reforms , however , should be carefully considered ; moderate and not revolutionary ; based upon the experience of civilized countries during the past forty years , so as not to defeat the usefulness of corporations that is so patent to all . The most advanced systems of corporation laws in Europe are found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Massachusetts is quite in advance , with the District of Columbia close behind . The National Bank act is considered , from the standpoint of corporation law , the best type in this country of a single act . Several States are very far behind Massachusetts and some of the other States and nations , and if they do nothing more in the near future they should at least move abreast of Massachusetts . In doing that it can not be charged that they are experimenting or theorizing . Let us examine the reforms which experience and the laws of some States and nations suggest . The first step to protect innocent stockholders , as well as creditors , is to throw greater safeguards about the incorporation and the commencement of business . The raisom d ' *1re of corporations aggregate at common law was to avoid the inconvenience of partnerships comprising a large number of members . If so many enter the business that they can not well conduct it by reason of numbers , a corporation is proper ; otherwise not . Therefore , no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporation . A less number should be forced into partnership action and liability . This is the law in France and some of the States . All the capital stock should be not only subscribed but actually paid up at par value , so that the real assets of the company when incorporated will equal the capital stock . All the stock // must be subscribed before incorporation in Belgium , France , Germany , and Massachusetts , and by the National Bank act . The purpose is to prevent a company from imposing on the public by representing that they have $1,000,000 capital when only $1,000 has been subscribed . If the stock is not all subscribed , corporations should be prevented from advertising more than what has been subscribed . Better than this would be a requirement that they print on their stationery , etc. , the amount paid in cash , or better still , the true excess of assets over liabilities , as shown by their last report . All the stock subscribed should be actually and fully paid up before incorporation . Upon this proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States great diversity exists . In Massachusetts no corporation can transact business until the whole amount of its capital stock has been paid in , and a certificate of that fact , and of the manner in which it has been paid , signed and sworn to by the president , treasurer , and a majority of the directors , has been filed in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth . The National Bank act requires fifty per cent . to be paid in before a charter is granted and ten per cent . per month thereafter . In Washington State three-fifths must be paid in before incorporation is complete ; in the District of Columbia and Missouri , one-half ; in France and Vermont , one-fourth ; in Alabama , Connecticut , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Pennsylvania , and West Virginia , ten per cent. ; in New York , $500 ; in several of the States , nothing . The purpose of requiring the stock subscribed to be fully paid in before proceeding to do business is to secure creditors , and to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I protect the stockholders . Experience has shown that the rock on which most corporations have foundered was lack of sufficient working capital at the beginning . It is as absurd to permit a $1,000,000 corporation to begin business with $100 as to do the reverse . It indicates fraud and too feverish a speculative spirit , both of which should be prevented by our corporation laws . In paying for stock the full value thereof should in all cases be required to be paid in cash or its full equivalent in property or labor done . The statutes of many States already have this provision , but provide no effectual mode of enforcing it . The // worl of the promoters or officers is taken , but their doctrine is that the stock is paid up when the management is satisfied . Business men know that a large part of corporate stock is transferred for a song andi most of the remainder for teu or twenty per cent . of the face value . A patent of doubtful validity and value , or an oil well or equally dangerous asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this child 's play should be prevented . In France , when anything besides cash is offered in payment of stock , its value must be determined by a special meeting of all the stockholders . The persons interested can not vote . At such meeting a committee must be appointed to determine the value and report to the stockholders at another special meeting where the value is fixed by a vote . The resolutions at all these meetings must be signed by all the stockholders . In Massachusetts a statement that the valuation of the property offered is fair and reasonable must be made , signed , and sworn to by the president , treasurer , and a majority of the directors , and endorsed by the State Commissioner of Corporations and filed with the Secretary of State . Of these two methods the latter is the better . The French method is clumsy , and if all the stockholders at the time are promoters , as is often tbe case , it would be no safeguard . Under the Massachusetts rule the only reliable check is the Commissioner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law to forbid any stock to be issued until the Commissioner of Corporations , if there be one , or the County Auditor , or some other proper official , bas examined the payment or property offered and has certified on the back of the certificate that tbe stock has been fully paid up at par in cash or its actual equivalent . And an officer of the corporation violating this provision should be imprisoned , not fined . Such provision would also prevent the watering of stock after the corporation has begun business . It is needless to point out the harm of this habit of corporation managers . Especially is it harmful in quasi-public corporations . It should be stopped and would be by the above method . Most of the States have already enacted that stock shall not be sold below par , or that fictitious stock shall not be issued , or that stock shall not be issued for anything but money or property received or labor done . But these statutes provide no sufficient means of enforcing the provisions . // After a charter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its management for the benefit of both stockholders and creditors . It is my opinion that the law rather overlooks the officers and directors . The directors of a corpora tion are nothing but trustees . It would have been better to retain that name . They have charge of a trust fund for th' benefit of the stockholders who are not in the management , and for creditors . The trust is as sacred a that of a receiver , assignee , or administrator . Yet these are not only required to give bond or good security for honest management of the trust , but are always under the eye of the court , and can take no important step without a prior order of the court . Directors of corporations have exclusive charge of larger assets , and a more varied and difficult business usually , without the supervision of a court or other public official and without bond or other security . The directors and officers often look upon the trust funds with the eyes*of a thief , and proceed by various well-known methods to put as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this notorious and wholesale plunder is done under form of law . Therefore , if we can , we should alter the law to suppress this indirect , insidious , legalized transfer of wealth without consideration , usually without consent or by fraud ; for , as said above , in this way more than any other has wealth in the last foity years been unequally distributed . I am aware that these directors and officers are the agents of the stockholders , who should select good directors and secure themselves . But forty years ' experience has shown that they do not or can not do it . The management hold a majority of the stock often , and the scattering minority of stockholders are helpless . I am aware , too , that creditors should investigate the financial ability of the corporation and the character of the men in charge before giving credit , but the means of corporation officials for misleading creditors and then diverting assets to defraud them are so varied and inscrutable that creditors are likewise helpless . There are two methods of preventing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One consists in requiring security of the directors and officers for their faithful discharge of their duties and subjecting them to greater liability for the corporate debts ; and the other in supervision by strangers to the management . The latter has been successfully employed . // In Belgium and France a separate Board of Auditors must be selected by the stockholders to make au examination every six months of all the details of the management as well as of the business , and report at the stockholders ' meetings . In Germany three supervisors are elected for the same purpose . In Massachusetts there are commissioners , inspectors , and examiners for all special classes of corporations . For general corporations a State officer , called the Commissioner of Corporations , is in control . He refuses to grant the charter until all the stock is subscribed and paid np at par in money or its equivalent , and all other legal requirements are . complied with and he has certified the same . He is required to make examinations and reports of the same and to bring instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Attorney General . He shall also prescribe the schedule for the annual reports . Under the National Bank act the Comptroller of the Currency through examiners keeps a close watch over their transactions . Therefore , it is believed to be well to provide for the examination of corporations by suitable public officers at least once a year . In addition , an annual report , by a schedule that would clearly and truly disclose the amount of real assets over real liabilities , should be filed in the offices of the Secretary of State and County Recorder . The penalties for failure to make such reports according to law should be severe and easy to enforce . At present annual reports are required under penalty in Arkansas , Colorado , Connecticut , Florida , Massachuse tts , Michigan , Montana , New Hampshire , New York , except monied and railway companies , Rhode Island , South Dakota , Tennessee , and Belgium . In Iowa a similar statement must be kept posted in a public place . In Indiana manufacturing and mining companies are required to publish such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as to cause any satisfactory observance of the law . A heavy fine should be imposed on the officers who fail to make such report or falsely make it , and the management should be personally liable for all debts created during such laches . It is , however , of greater importance that the directors furnish security for the honest discharge of their duties , and also be held personally liable for the debts of the corporation with certain exceptions . Either a bond should be required from every director and officer , or he should cbposit stock in the corporation , as se // curity . A public officer should determine the amount of the bond or stock required , and both should be deposited with him for the security of the creditors and stockholders . I think this is not required in any State , but in Belgium the directors must deposit one-fifth of the capital stock , or at least stock of 50,000 francs par value . Ju France they must deposit all the stock they have and mark it unalienable during their term of office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers is drawn from the analogy of limited liability partnerships with silent or dormant partners , and from the history of corporations . Under the old law all stockholders were fully liable , like active partners . That was wrong , for the stockholders outside of the management are but silent partners , who usually can not know the facts about the management , and , if they knew , would be powerless to remedy the difficulty . Furthermore , full liability of all stockholders misleads creditors . They think the vague and indefinite security far greater than it practically is . Under the new law all stockholders are limited in their liability . This is again a wrong to the outside stockholders as well as the creditors , for the active directors and officers are active partners in entire charge , and they can build up or wreck a business as they see fit . They should always lose and never profit from a wreckage . The South Sea Company , of London , in 1720 , was selling its stock at 1,000 per cent . guaranteeing 50 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud was discovered , the estates of all the directors were confiscated for the benefit of its victims . In France , in one species of corporation , the directors are personally liable as partners . Under the National Bank Act and in some States they are liable for twice the amount of their stock . In many of the States they are fully liable in case of violation of some statute . It is believed that their liability should be made general , at least where sufficient bond or other security is not required . How to prevent directors and officers in control of a corporation from speculating in its stock to their own advantage , or otherwise nsing their position for selfish purposes , is an important problem as yet unsolved . All agree that a great amount of robbing , peacefully and legally , is done in this manner . The evil is the same as that which is // provided against by the law in the ease of other trustees , by forbidding them to deal with the trust estate . In this direction , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire*or or officer should not be permitted , directly or indirectly , to buy or sell the stock of the corporation during his term of office . A further safeguard lies in giving small stockholders a preference in voting for directors . In England one vote is allowed for each share held by a person up to ten , one additional vote for every five shares from ten up to one hundred , and one additional vote for each ten shares above one hundred . In the United States the chief modification of the old share voting system is the cumulative system . It has been adopted in California , Idaho , Illinois , Kansas , Mississippi , Missouri , New York ( if so stated in the articles of association ) , Pennsylvania , South Dakota , and West Virginia . The cumulative system is to be recommended , for while it leaves the owners of the majority of the stock in control , it places behind the scenes one or more directors in sympathy with the minority . Finally , a very important change of policy needed in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeal the charters of corporations as expressed in the general corporation laws of the State . This is the law in Alabama , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Delaware , Iowa , Kansas , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Nebraska , New Mexico , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Nevada , Oregon , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Dakota , T'innessee , and Wisconsin . It is favored by Professor Cooley and many others qualified to judge wisely of the matter . In Massachnsetts it is enacted that every act of incorporation passed after 1834 shall be subject to amendment , alteration , or repeal at the pleasure of the legislature , except that full power to wind up the business in case of repeal shall always exist . Such is the law in the other States named , except Oregon , where it is provided that general corporation laws are snbject to amendment , alteration , and repeal , " but not so as to impair or destroy any vested corporate right . " To some of these suggested reforms there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have no effect on existing corporations unless they subject themselves to // the new act , taking privileges under it , which would be a matter of choice . Such legislation is only for corporations hereafter organized . The incorporators would in such case understand the conditions on which their privileges are granted . It would in no case affect honestly conducted corporations , and persons proposing to conduct corporations otherwise have no standing in the discussion . However , it might be well to provide that some of these requirements should not be employed except when requested at any time by the holders of 20 per cent . of the stock . The choice should never be left to the majority or confined to the time when the company is being incorporated . The most difficult problem that must be solved in corporation reform is the proper handling of trusts or combinations to control the production and price of an article . This may be done by a central corporation formed by managers of a score of establishments or without such corporation by a trust agreement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition in trade to increase the price of the product . Having fixed the prices , by fair or foul means , if necessary by threats , by the freezing out process , or by force and violence , they endeavor to maintain the prices fixed . It is needless here to discuss their methods , for they are well known . They are contrary to the spirit of the common law , and hence have been vigorously assailed by all courts when acting upon the common law . From their beginning trusts have constantly increased , amid various vicissitudes , until now nearly all articles of general manufacture are controlled or influenced by them . At the beginning of the craze for them it was prophesied that they would fail because of conflicting interests of members , the looseness of the organization , and the disfavor of the law . They were consequently expected to go out of style . But such has not been the case , and it is not seen how such combinations can be wholly prevented in view of their advantages to members and the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they seem to be a natural development of modern industrialism , and anything natural in its development should not be checked . They assert that the government should by law recognize trusts and eliminate what is injurious , to bend them to the benefaction of the public . This is a very plausible plan , but it means for us to // abandon the law of competition and to embrace socialism . For the logical concinsion would be the assimilation of all business by the state , the state being the ultimate combination beyond which we can not go . We can not yet afford to abandon the law of competition and individual liberty , hence legislatures and courts should continue , as heretofore , to suppress and discourage trusts . The courts should treat the contracts of trusts , as Judge Thompson says , like gambling debts and counterfeit bills , and the legislatures should reinforce the common law by defining illegal combinations , declaring their acts and contracts void , and providing severe penalties for violations of the law . Anti-trust laws now exist in Alabama , Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tennessee , Texas , Washington , and Wisconsin . Not only should contracts forming trusts be made void , but trusts should be prohibited from enforcing any kind of contract . They should have no standing in court . In any action brought by them . the defense that the party is a trust , or acting in behalf of a trust , should bar recovery . They should be consistently treated as outlaws . Without ability , directly or indirectly , to come into court or to enforce any right or contract , coupled with the power of courts to dissolve them on the action of the Attorney-General , and with severe penalties on all parties participating in the formation and business of trusts , they will , it is believed , be rendered almost harmless . But in this all the States should act in concert . One or a few States can not do much in this direction . Nor has Congress much power in the premises.
