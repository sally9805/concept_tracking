txt Cornelius Vanderbilt made it plain in a statement which he gave out last evening that he did not think he had received anything more than was justly due him as the result of the action of his brother Alfred in transferring to him about $6,000,000 of their father 's estate . ' He also declared distinctly that the arrangement was brought about by the intervention a his lawyers , Carter &; Ledyard , and that the sum which he is to receive , over and above the amount of the two bequests contained in the will , is regarded by hini not as a gift , but rather as the fruit of a compromise . The statement which he dictated follows : " The agreement has been made to appear as a mere gift . It is really a family settlement or adjustment of the situation , which , I am glad to say , my brother met with fairness . I have nothing further to say . All the negotiations and arrangements were made by my lawyers , Messrs . Carter &; Ledyard of 54 Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " . Mr. Vanderbilt was asked if the manner in which the settlement had been reached , involving the employment of counsel by him to protect his interests , would make any difference in his relations with the New York Central Railroad Company , by which he is employed . He replied : " As to that , I have nothing whatever to say . " Richard T. Wilson denied himself to reporters yesterday and no information as to how the settlement in favor of his son-inlaw , Cornelius Vanderbilt , was brought about could be obtained from him . Lewis Cass Ledyard of Carter &; Ledyard , attorneys for Cornelius Vanderbilt , said that any settlement arranged through his firm was of a confidential nature and would not be made public . Henry B. Anderson gave almost the same reason for his reticence on the subject . Ile said that the family and the attorneys had naturally expected inquiries on the subject of the will and the subsequent settlements , and so had agreed to let the matter rest so far as they were concerned on the statement given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any hand his firm may have had in the settlement was a matter between attorney and client and so of a closely confidential nature . WILL FILED FOR PROBATE . The will was filed for probate in the office of the Surrogate at a quarter to 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon . It was handed to Probate Clerk Washburn by Henry B. Anderson , one of the attorneys for the estate . With the original were three official copies for filing and attestation . Previous to the arrival of the will itself , a waiver of citation was received by the Surrogate from Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney , wife of Harry Payne Whitney . This makes three of these waivers that have been filed . Unless each of the six principal heirs signs a waiver , the will can not be probated until Nov. 8 , when they are made returnable . It is understood , however , that the waivers have all been secured and that tho  --  remaining three , from Mrs. Vanderbilt . Rinald C. and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt , will be recorded to-day . This will leave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testament , as filed , contains little of importance that was not included in the official summary , prepared by Chauncey M. Depew and published yesterday . The interesting points in the original that were not referred to in the published ver-. sion were as follows : In the third paragraph the family pew in St. Bartholomew 's Church is left to Mrs. Vanderbilt , in addition to that in Trinity Church . Newport . In the eighth paragraph , providing for the distribution after Mrs. Vanderbilt 's death of the principal a the trust fund , which is to yield her $250,000 a year , the will adds a clause to the effect that " any child born to us after my death shall be entitled to share in this division . " In Paragraph 12 , where the testator authorizes the executors to invest trust funds , change investments , and the like , the will contains this language : I direct that they ( the executors ) shall at all times keep the same invested in stocks and bonds of the ' United States or the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central and Hudson River Railroad Company , the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad Company , the Michigan Central Railroad Company , the New York and Harlem Railroad Company , and the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company , or in bonds guaranteed by zume one ur more of these railroad companies ; also , in bonds secured by mortgage on improved real estate in the City of New York ; and I expressly authorize them to invest any of said trust funds in the mortgage bonds of any railroad company which may be approved for that purpose by all of my executors who may qualify . MUST APPOINT GUARDIANS . Among the individual bequests in the original will is one of $100,000 " to my mother , as a mark of affection . " This was nullified by the death of Mrs. W. H. Vanderbilt in 1S07 . Although the will provides that Alfred Vanderbilt shall come into only half the residuary estate at the age of thirty , and of all of it at the age of thirty-five , it is ordered that the accumulated surplus income thereof shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are two minor heirs under the will , Reginald C. and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt , for whom the Surrogate will be called on to designate guardians . Estimates as to the amount of transfer tax the estate will have to pay vary considerably . All the bequests are subject to taxation at the hands of both the State and Federal Governments . The State inheritance tax , which will be collected by Controller Coler , is 1 per cent . on bequests to blood relations and lineal descendants and 5 per cent . on gifts to strangers ha blood and corporations , excepting charitable institutions . As all the corporate heirs are of this character , and the great bulk of the estate goes to lineal heirs , it is computed that the State tax will approximate $700,000 or $800,000 . On this , the Controller will receive a 1 per cent . fee for collection . The Federal war revenue tax is 82.25 for each $100 of bequests of over $1,000.000 to lineal descendants , and 815 for each $100 bequeathed to strangers in blood or a corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Vanderbilt , fixed the total cost of transferring the estate at about $1.500,000 . It now seems that that figure is likely to be exceeded , and that the war tax alone will run to V , 000,000 . Although Senator Depew denied that there was any threat of a contest by Cornelius Vanderbilt and insisted that the settlement was purely voluntary and amicable on all sides . it : vas pointed out yesterday that Mr. Depe.fr 's own language , in announcing the arrangement , indicated that there had been danger of a family split on the subject . Mr. Depew said that Alfred had given his brother enough to even up his share not only from " brotherly affection . " but for " family harmony . " From this . it was urged , the inference was fair that there had been danger of a disturbance of harmony in case young Alfred had not made up his brother 's share out of his own . SETTLEMENT PREDETERMINED . From these considerations the conclusion was very generally drawn yesterday that the settlement by which the wish of Con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share equally with his other brothers and . sisters , was the result of a definite determination on the part of young Cornelius to get more than his father had left him . It was alleged that the $6,000,000 required to equalize Cornelius 's portion was turned over to him In actual cash before he signed the waiver of citation which took away his right to contest the will . There was no proof , however , of this statement . Alfred , the chief heir of Cornelius Vanderbilt , who bears his mother 's patronymic Gwynn as his middle name , is a young man of modest manner and retiring habits . He was graduated from Yale University in June last , and i.as but recently attained his maj or iltfyr e Alfred Vanderbilt 's college record was notable chiefly for its lack of ostentation . He took no interest in athletics , and had few intimate friends , his closest associates being William Fitzhugh Whitehouse- of New York and R. F. Forrest of Washington . While at Yale , young Vanderbilt occupied the rooms in Vanderbilt Hall , erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cornelius 's eldest son , who died while a student at Yale . After his graduation , young Vanderbilt started on a ' round-the-world tour , accompanied by three others , sons of wealthy men ? William F. Burden , Douglas Cochran , and Ernest Iselin . It was from this tour that he was recalled by a cablegram announcing his father 's death , which reached him in Japan . The new head of the Vanderbilt family is a well-built , healthy specimen of the American young man of birth and breeding , some 5 feet 8 inches in height , and weighing 150 pounds . His features resemble those of his father and his complexion is dark . His most pronounced liking is said to be for the theatre .
