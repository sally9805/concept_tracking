txt The Senate today received a. notification of the disposition of the House toward the pending negotiations over the Tariff bill in the Senate . Intimations were thrown out while the " conservatives " of the Senate were fixing up the schedules so as to make the bill acceptable to the protection Democrats that the House was not disposed to look with patience upon a course that was frittering away all that the other branch had carefully built up . So long as the modifie.ation of the bill was limited to sugar or to two or three items , the reduction of the duty on which might work some special hardship to certain sections , there was only dissatisfaction , but in the last fortnight there has been outspoken objection in the House , not only to the reported changes in the sugar and woolen schedules , but to the reports that the responsiveness of the stock market was attributable to what were called the " concessions " to the sugar producers and the refiners . A prominent New-York Democrat , after the publication of the statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule as he understood it was given , declared that the Secretary must have been misquoted , or , if he had been correctly quoted , his resignation was " tao days overdue . " The New-Yorker did not really expect that the resignation would follow this opinion , but he revealed his feeling and reflected the popular feeling toward the interest that had secured all that it had demanded . The resolution of Representative Breckinridge of Arkansas , offered to-day in the House , directing the Committee on Rules to report a rule allowing an amendment to be offered to any appropriation bill to repeal the bounty on sugar and also to repeal the duty on sugar , is a serious menace against the compromise that has been made . There can be no doubt that should the Senate pass its bill , as it has been accepted by the conferees in the past three weeks , it would be subject to a great deal of denunciation if it should go to the House . It Is almost certain that if the Senate should reject the income tax the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disposition of the House , the temper of that body is not at all likely to suggest to it the acceptance of the greatly changed bill fixed up by Mr. Gorman , Mr. Smith . and Mr. Jones . If the Senate should go too far to please a few Senators it is as sure as that to-morrow morning will follow to-day that the House will return to the provisions of the Wilson bill in so far as it shall be possible to do so , and that the average line , if there shall , be an average line , of compromise will be struck in the conference committee . If advancing prices on the stock market have marked the progress of the Tariff bill in the hands of the Senate " fixers " falling prices should mark the progress of the bill in the House and In the conference committee . The House will begin , It is certain , by refusing to accept many of the advances . Whatever shall be yielded must be yielded to them .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
