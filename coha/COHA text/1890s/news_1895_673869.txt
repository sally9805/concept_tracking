txt The support of the Police Commission bill before the Mayor at yesterday 's hearing was embodied chiefly in Mr. Lauterbach , who was present as a citizen and represented no organization , according to his own amusing avowal , but Mr. Lauterbach made one remark of much significance . He said that no bill would be necessary with the present Mayor in the chair , but that this bill was for the future . There has been a general disposition to overlook the fact that legislation is for the future and not for a passing emergency , and the very strongest ground for opposition to this bill and in favor of sound reform measures lies in . that fact . If Mayor Strong would show himself what the people who voted for him took him to be , he could make even this bill harmless . Under it he would not have to appoint partisan Commissioners or even make the commission bi-partisan . He could appoint able and upright men and take the department out of politics . He can do the same thing just as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands . On the other hand , under such a.law , either he or any other Mayor could make the commission partisan , put the department into politics all over , with all the evil consequences , and nobody could be held responsible . The very reason why this bill should not be accepted is because the legislation is for the future , and its opponents might have retorted upon Mr. Lauterbach with thanks " for that word . " The whole vice of the pernicious paltering of the Republicans of the Senate with the reform measures has been that they try to use a passing emergency for immediate partisan gain rather than for permanent public benefit .
