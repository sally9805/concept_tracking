txt The steamer Saturn , Capt . J. M. Lewis , bound from Newport News , Va. , for Boston with coal , put in at Quarantine late yesterday afternoon with three of her crew badly injured as the result of the blowing out of a water column valve on one of her boilers . The Saturn , owned by the Tea Wharf Towboat Company of Boston , left Newport News last Tuesday morning with 8,000 tons of coal on board . and having in tow the barge P. C. Merriman , with 1,300 tons . At 5 o'clock yesterday morning , while the Saturn was off the Jersey coast , between Barnegat and Absecon , the attention of Chief Engineer James A. Gilkey , who was on watch at the time , was called to a gauge glass on one of the four Scotch tubular boilers that had blown out . The engineer grasped the valve on the water column to shut off the steam , when he felt the valve giving way . The only other man in the fire room at the time was Fireman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight on the cock , and sang out to the fireman to run for his life . That veteran responded that he would stay as long as his chief did . Both men then took their bearings for a quick rush for safety , and , ducking their heads , Gilkey released his hold on the cock . It immediately blew out with a loud report , and in an instant the fireroom was filled with steam and water . The two men crawled on their hands and knees under the boiler , and , although badly scalded , groped their way to the engine room and escaped up the hatch . Capt . Lewis heard the explosion . and immediately ordered the towline connected with the barge cast off and turned his vessel 's head to the wind in order to force the escaping steam astern of the boilers as much as possible . First Assistant Engineer A M. Rowen , who had been aroused from his bunk by the hissing of the escaping steam , came forward , and , wrapping a blanket about his head and face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the disabled one . He was lowered by means of a rope in the hands of two firemen down through a ventilator , and had succeeded in partly shutting off the steam from the other boilers , when a cloud of hot vapor. escaping through the ventilator into the faces of the assistants , caused them to let go of the rope , and Rowen was precipitated into the fireroom . With rare presence of mind he grasped the fireroom ladder , and escaped to the deck where he fell exhausted . An oiler was next lowered through the ventilator and succeeded in closing the stop valves . The vessel then proceeded to this port for medical aid as quickly as possible under three boilers . The wounded men were removed to the Marine Hospital on Staten Island . Chief Engineer Gilkey , First Assistant Engineer Rowen , and Fireman Bennett are all badly scalded about the hands , arms , face , legs , and neck . Rowen is the most seriously injured , and may die . Several firemen and deck hands were burned about the face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandoned barge , which has a crew of eight on board .
