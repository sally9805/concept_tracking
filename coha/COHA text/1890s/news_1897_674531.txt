txt The usual peace of the Brooklyn Navy Yard was disturbed by a fire which started shortly after 9:30 o'clock last night in the Ordnance Building ; known as No. 13 . The flames spread with great rapidity , and before the firemen gained control the building was completely gutted , with a total loss estimated at about $80.000 to $100,000 . The building is a three-story brick structure built about forty years ago . It occupies nearly the entire block in the yard between Second and Third Streets and Perry and Cha.uncy Avenues . It had been used over since it was erected as a storage house for small arms ordnance , rapid-fire guns . whitebead torpedoes , and accoutremeats of all kinds used on the various ships fitted out at the yard . It also contained a paint and joiner shop , ordnance machinery , and a boiler room , On the third floor were 300 stands of the new navy pattern Lee six millimeter rifles , with their accoutrements , and on this floor also were stored about 1,000 stand of the various old pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . These , with old ordnance paraphernalia of every description , took up all the available space of the two upper floors , and included powder cases , ammunition boxes , scabbards , canteens , and the like . On the first floor was the ordnance machinery , several Whitehead torpedoes , and a number of the new six-pounder rapid-fire guns used in the equipment for secondary batteries . Everything on the two upper floors was completely destroyed , the loss being estimated at $40,000 on material alone . Scene of Exeftement . When the fire started a scene of the greatest excitement prevailed in the neighborhood , but the discipline among the ships crews and marines was perfect . It was about 9:30 and three bells had just sounded on all the ships . Officer Hugh F. Conroy of the Twenty-second Precinct was standing at the corner of York Street and Hudson Avenue . Suddenly he saw a thin , curling flame break out from under the eaves of one of the buildings . He turned in an alarm from the nearest box and then he ran to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At about the same time Capt . Sperry , Captain of the yard , saw the flames , and reached the gate at about the same time as the officer . Just then a tongue of flame shot through the roof , and seemed to spread from the centre a the third floor , where the fire is said to have originated , for 100 feet on either side . The fire attracted the attention of the watches on the Puritan , Terror , Maine , Indiana , Detroit , and the receiving ship Vermont , and almoSt simultaneously the fire bells were rung and the crews piped to quarters as in fire drill . In fact , most of the men , who had been frequently roused up after taps on . fire drills , thought it was a mere disciplinary act , but as soon as they reached the decks , the glare of the flames which were then bursting through a dozen places in the roof told them that there was real work at hand . Quickly each fire crew yeas marshaled until 600 men , in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , were running at double-quick to the burning building . While this was going on the Marine barracks was a scene of excitement . The three hundred odd men on duty , under command of Capt . Elliott , were forming and coming under a double-quick down Flushing Avenue , to aid the guard on duty . When the men reached the yard they were posted'on all the streets and avenues , and strict naval discipline prevailed . Nine Engines on the Scene . In the meantime three alarms had been turned in , and nine engines , three trucks , and the fireboats Seth Low and David A. Boody , under Chief Dale , were on their way . When the engines got inside of the yard an unlooked-for difficulty confronted them . The hydrants proved to be wofully deflciert in number , and of the nino engines sent only six were of use . The fireboats steamed up to the channel along the cob dock , and ran their hose to the building , a distance of several hundred feet . Then the engines in the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the yard mains are but 8 inches in diameter , and proved themselves totally inadequate for anything like a great conflagration . While the firemen were getting to work , an element of humor was injected into the seriousness of the situation by the arrival of the Navy Department 's antiquated hand engine , which came tearing up with one of the old-fashioned hosecarts in tow . All this took place within ten minutes , but considerably before that time the 900 sailors and marines were distributed around the tire , working like beavers to save the Government property . The Jack Tars proved themselves equal to the emergency . The flames rapidly ate their way through the two upper floors , consumed the roof and left nothing of the new rifles but twisted and shapeless steel . It burned with unwonted fierceness and great glowing embers carried by the breeze toward the river dropped on the roofs of the buildings and threatened half a dozen or more with destruction . The danger was seen by Chief Dale and the naval men , and a hundred or more sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This action undoubtedly saved hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of property . The next building to No. 13 on the river side is the oil storage house . It was filled last night with thousands of gallons of oil , and had it caught there would have been an explosion that would have wrecked half the yard . Sailors Carry Out Torpedoes . The greatest excitement occurred when over 100 sailors were ordered into the burning building to drag out the machinery , torpedoes , and heavy ordnance . The men swarmed in and out one of the great doors like eats and at a time when the heat drove the glass from the upper-story windows and the stone coping in small pieces , and the red hot slate from the roof in every direction . It was like a fusillade . They did not mind the danger of cut heads or the danger of failing floors . In they went , and out they came , with a merry " Yo-heave 0 " and ropes attached to the heavy objects , which shot out with a rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearly all the valuable material on the lower floor was saved . The only man hurt was B. F. Shay , a sailor on board of the Vermont . He was cut in the hand by a piece of slate from the roof . Nearly every officer of the yard and those who are stationed at the yard with their families stood back at a respectful distance and watched the fire until the flames had gutted the interior of the building to a smoking mass of charred timbers and twisted iron and steel . Despite the loss to the Government , it was great fun for the feminine portion , and two young women , " navy girls , " who have no respect for Uncle Sam , declared it to be the best pyrotechnic display they had ever seen . The fire proved , as has been said before , the inadequacy of the water supply at the yard . Chief Dale is authority for the statement that had it not been for the fireboats he would not have been able to control the flames . Several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . The authorities had just finished putting in a new and elaborate fire apparatus , and yesterday the painters were putting on the finishing touches . It was a fortunate circumstance for the Government that there were so few Lee rifles stored . A week ago , the Ordnance Department had a stock of 3,000 or 4,000 on hand , valued at about $35.000 , but these have been gradually issued to the ships in the yard and to the marines . Only yesterday Capt . Elliott , at the barracks , was given 325 stand . The fire was the first serious conflagration which has occurred at the4yard since Feb. 17 , 1888. when Building No. 6 was destroyed , entailing a large loss . -
