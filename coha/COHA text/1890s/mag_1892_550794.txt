TRUE science , bound by no fetters , its theories tenable only so long as they are useful in connecting facts , its progress limited only by the life of the race on the earth , and its field unbounded , - is not only vastly enlarging the mental horizon , but is , at the same time , conferring incalculable practical benefits . Did this statement need emphasis , it is found in the growth of no particular branch of science more than in electricity . While in the near past the extension of its industrial applications has been phenomenal , we must not forget that during the same period its theories have become equally expanded and shorn of crudity . With the vast accumulation of new facts , electricity has come to be understood as intimately related in its nature and actions to that necessary something which has been called the universal ether , filling all space and permeating the most solid objects . By the electrical vibrations of this medium , the stars not only declare their very presence , but transmit to us indications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even the kind of matter which composes them . The beam of light is an electrical phenomenon , it is an electrical oscillation or vibration of such extraordinary rapidity , hundreds of trillions per second , as to become unrealizable in thought . It is conveyed in the ether at the rate of nearly two hundred thousand miles per second . So are also other electrical actions . It would be outside the scope of an article like the present to dwell upon the possible directions of development of electrical theories in so far as they may include other phenomena than light , so recently demonstrated to be electrical in its nature . The fact that electrical action is so intimately related to the phenomena of heat , chemical energy , and crystallization leads us to think that future discoveries can but tend towards further harmonies of these great forces . Electrical attraction and repulsion , magnetism , light , and radiant heat are now known to be dependent in some way on the properties of the ether of space . Gravitational force must be similarly dependent . Cohesion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same medium . The future scientific investigator will find his field of work gradually expanding . The growth of electricity as a branch of science must be at least commensurate with that of the broader science of physics . But let us turn to a brief consideration of the possible advances in the practical applications of electric energy in the arts and industries . Let us examine the subject from the standpoint of effect on our methods of work and conditions of life . By E/i/zu Thomson . // There is required no special scientific taste or training to enable people to appreciate immediately practical aspects . As a swift messenger , as a conveyer of intelligence , electricity has in the telegraph been familiarly known for about half a century . So far as appears from the present outlook , future telegraphic prog* ress promises no great revolutions . Methods and means will , no doubt , become more and more refined , and greater speeds be attained . The more general introduction of multiplex systems will increase the capacity of the lines and decrease the costs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to securing in-imunity from extended interruptions due to storms . It may be remarked here , however , that electricians are not without some hope that signalling or telegraphing for moderate distances without wires , and even through dense fog may be an accomplished fact soon . Had we the means of obtaining electric oscillations of several millions per second , or waves similar to light waves , but of vastly lower rate of vibration , it might be possible by suitable reflectors to cause them to be carried a mile or so through a fog , and to recognize their presence by instruments constructed for the purpose . Many of the difficulties and dangers which now beset the navigator would , at least , be lessened , if not removed . Signalling or telegraphing without wires is no new proposal , and there have been many such proposals which are extravagant and impracticable . The fact is , however , the essential means are not yet forthcoming . In telephonic transmission the past few years have permitted us to witness extensions from communication over restricted areas and moderate distances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count as one of the wonders of the century . The telephone itself , even when first brought out , was a marvel of simplicity and effectiveness . When we consider that by its means we may converse with and even recognize the voice of a person distant from us a considerable fraction of the earth 's circumference , we can not fail to be impressed with the wonder of it . Can we , however , anticipate such an extension of the power of the telephone , that we may at some time use an ocean cable as the line over which speech is to be conveyed ? To answer this question in the negative would be to set a limit to the capacity of the human intellect to make future advances ; ne ' *ertheless , there are reasons which are cogent enough tending to point to the impracticability of telephonic transmission through cables of great length . In such cases a retardation and an obliteration of the delicate pulses of current which characterize electrical speech serve to prevent the reception of speech at the far end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or impulses , the difficulty would be , in a measure , overcome , but to do this introduces other grave difficuilties , the solution of which is not easy to foresee . The idea of lighting by wire or carrying electric current from its source to lamps in which the electric energy is transformed into light , long preceded the invention of the telephone , and many notable efforts were long ago made in the field of electric lighting . But to be able to speak over miles of wire was a feat well calculated to impress upon the public the possibility that so wonderful an agent as electricity might possess other capabilities perhaps only suspected by some of the more sanguine inventors and scientific students . We need not wonder that electric lighting as an industry sprang into existence quickly and gained public favor soon after the birth of the telephone . Much of the preliminary work had been done long before . It only needed inventive genius to adapt to the present needs the information which had been accumulated . It is not to be denied that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an actual fact that the groundwork for the development of the art of lighting by the electric arc and by incandescence had been laid many years before these became a part of the industries . What shall we say of the future of an art which in the past ten years has so firmly rooted itself as a factor in our civilization ? Can we predict for it a proportionate expansion in the // future ? Will electric light replace gas and kerosene oil lighting ? These are questions which naturally suggest themselves and which can be answered only in a general way , because the advent of some new discovery , perhaps unanticipated , or perhaps among those things for which we are looking may change the whole face of matters . That electric lighting will grow at an increased and increasing pace can not be doubted . There were many in the early days of lighting by the arc who were ready to pronounce the field of its application very limited , and some there were , even among electricians , who were credited with the prediction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I3ut the enormous number of arc lights now in use and the constant rapid extension are but indications of a future of not less importance than the past . So also in the field of lighting by the use of incandescent lamps , the growth has in the immediate past been very great . A few years ago machinery for supplying electricity to work the lamps would have been considered as of quite large capacity if able to supply five hundred to one thousand lamps of ordinary power , but to-day machines of five thousand to ten thousand lamps capacity are constructed , the larger sizes requiring about a thousand horse-power to drive them . Electricity for lighting is now almost altogether produced by the expenditure of steam-power or xvater-power . Its cost , therefore , outside of the interest , wear , and tear , and running expense , is largely dependent on the cost of power . The steam-engine itself has undergone many improvements and refinements , in response to the needs of the electrical engineer , and has to-day reached a fairly perfect state . Its most economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in which the steam at high pressure undergoes successive expansions Electric Signal operating through Fog and Darkness . IC ' // in yielding its power . When the pressure is thus very greatly reduced , the steam is finally condensed , and is thus relieved of the burden , so to speak , of overcoming the pressure of the atmosphere in escaping from the engine . The best type of triple expansion condensing engines will yield power at a consumption of less than two pounds of good fuel per horsepower for an hour , ordinary engines requiring from three to five or more pounds for the same work . It is not to be wondered at , then , that much attention is being drawn to the use of such perfect engines in electric stations . The future will see many of the large stations remodelled to secure the advantages of economy only obtainable with the best type of engines . Cheaper power means cheaper light . Hence , also , much attention has been directed to the use of water-power for driving electric machinery ; and it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city accomplished by the use of water-power , in some cases ten to fifteen miles distant . Our means or methods of distribution and transmission of the electricity will in the future doubtless undergo improvements which will permit the economical use of power at much greater distances than is now attempted . Our great giant power , Niagara , having spent its energies for ages in useless pulverizing of rock masses , will be lower Station at Niagara. 626 // 627 made to exert its strength to turn great dynamos for lighting and power transmission to greater and greater distances . Other great water-powers are gradually being taken up for investigation with the same object in view . The electricity generated in such cases is not , of course , limited to eiiiployment for lighting , but , through that almost perfect machine , the electric motor or reversed dynamo , it may be turned back into power with but small lose . Let us inquire what the loss in such cases may be . It varies in accordance with the scale of operations . j Dynamos of two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work up to about ninety-four or ninety-five per cent efficiency . This means that out of every roo horse power used in driving , there will be an equivalent of 94 to 95 horse power given out as electric current and pressure , or 94 to 95 electrical horse power . In transmitting this to a distance it will undergo a further loss , depending on the size of conducting wire used . Assuming 10 per cent thus lost in transmission for a distance of 10 to r 5 miles ; we have 94 - 9.4 = 84.6 remaining , which may now be converted back into mechanical power with abQut the same efficiency as in the dynamo , or 94 per cent of 84.6 = 7*.5 per cent of power returned , or 79.5 horse power recovered out of roo expended . In practice the figures fall somewhat below those given , but the showing of economy may still be excellent . Since in obtaining power from fuel by means of steam engines , upwards of 90 per cent is wasted in unused heat , while the power Distributing Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely more than ten per cent of the real value of the fuel under the very best conditions , the question arises whether there may not be discoverable a plan whereby a much larger percentage of the real value of the fuel may be turned to account as electricity , and through the latter as heat , light , or power . This question has at present no answer . The subject has been alive in the minds of our most able engineers and inventors for years , and some have striven hard to find a solution to the problem . Records of scientific discovery have been earnestly ransacked to find some clue ; or , as it were , a guiding post to point the way C for the uncertain explorer . It now appears that we may be compelled to await some new discovery , some new adaptation , or some new generalization before the way to the much desired solution may be found . The effect on the general industrial and economic development in electricity which would follow the discovery of some not too complex means for realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy value of fuel is indeed almost incalculable . Then truly would electricity become the almost universal agent in the production as well as the transmission of power . The steam-engine would go out of use almost entirely . We should burn our coal , not under steam boilers ; it would be consumed in electric generators . Our steamships would have their machinery replaced by such // generators , and their propellors would be turned by gigantic electric motors , connected with the generators . The speed would be increased so as to still further shorten the time of an ocean voyage . The uses of electricity as a heating agent would be vastly extended , and it goes without saying that our lighting would be accomplished at much less cost , or , what is the same thing , we should be able to use much more light without increase of expenditure . Even if it were possible to conceive of them , our limited space does not permit us to enumerate , the various ways in which the assumed discovery would enlarge our field and alter our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imaginative , will readily suggest very many possibilities and probabilities . But can we hope for such a discovery as is indicated ? It can only be said that many seemingly more improbable things have come to pass , and there is no principle of nature which would negative the possibility of such discovery ; - but that for the present it is impossible to assert anything in re events of the year 1891 has been the successful transmission of power on a High-speed Electric Locomotive . lation thereto . Our information is as yet too meagre . We may be compelled for a long time to rely largely on the steam engine , though in many cases the great water powers will be called into service . One of the notable Lighting , Ancient and Modern . // considerable scale from a water power at Lauffen to the Frankfort Electrical Exhibition , a distance of over a hundred miles . While this event may have partaken somewhat of the nature of an experiment ; still , the feasibility of carrying currents of electricity at high pressures to great distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , though electrical engineers have had no reason to doubt the possibility of such transmission . There is a very great field for future enterprises of this general character . In our day we can not , even with effort , realize how great a change was wrought in means and methods of transportation by the introduction of the steam locomotive . To do so we must make a journey through a country where the railroads have not yet gone . How vast has been their influence on the development and prosperity of a country ! Even with no other means of propulsion than horses , the strips of iron or steel called rails , have had an incalculable influence on the growth of cities . The horse car system , the introduction of which is within the memory of persons of middle age , is however being rapidly revolutionized . To realize this fully , one has only to stand in or near Boston Common and to notice that on Tremont Street , which at one time was covered with poor horses struggling with their heavily loaded cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or , as Dr. Holmes has quaintly called them in his charming poem , " broomstick trains . " What witchery is here ? Simply a great exhibition of transmission of power by electricity as applied to moving vehicles . But it is certainly more . It is a grand example of organized human effort in the solution of difficult problems . In one of its aspects it signalizes a victory even over prejudice and conservatism . It is a living testimonial of the wisdom and energy of the men who have stood back of the work and have been able in a sense to move mountains . From the engineering standpoint it has shown that even under conditions the most exacting , the electric motor has proven its merit . But those who are not familiar with such work can not realize how much of strenuous battling with obstacles and difficulties is involved in effecting such a revolution . Back of the visible expenditure of mechanical energy in moving the cars , we Electric Mine Locomotive . // shall find for generating and supplying the current a gigantic power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , switches , together with a huge steam boiler plant , the whole constituting the largest electrical generating station in the world to-day and aggregating over 20 ,  - -  000 horse power when in full work . All of this energy is put into the lines leading from the station in the form of electric current under a moderate pressure . The revolution thus exemplified in Boston is going on extensively in other places , and will constitute , without doubt , one of the most active of enterprises for a considerable time to come . In a modified form , railways in factories and mines are already being run by electricity . In such cases electric trucks or electric locomotives do the haulage work . The time is probably not far distant when there will exist electrically operated railways connecting different cities and towns whereever the traffic is considerable . The steam locomotive itself will on some roads be replaced by the electric locomotive , where the conditions are such as to warrant it . Water powers may thus be rendered available for the operation of the railways , and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as skirt along rivers having a sufficient fall . But it is not at all likely that the lines of road which have but a very few trains per day passing over them will be operated electrically by generating current at a station and conveying it to the moving trains . In such cases the problem is like that of the steamship , which will become an electrical ship when means are found for cheaply generating electricity from fuel carried on board . Or perhaps this and many other such problems may receive another solution . Could we , for example , consume our fuel efficiently in setting free from combina- , tion two chemical elements or substances which could afterwards be combined in a compact battery and give out an equivalent electrical energy , and were it also possible to again use fuel in decomposing for a second time , and so on , the two substances , the result would be attained indirectly . Were the processes required // simple and unattended with great wastes , our much to be desired cheap supply of electricity , either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might become a realization . We shall suggest this solution of the problem , without daring to prophesy that it will come to pass . Among the comparatively recent applications of electricity is that of electric metal working , including the welding , shaping , and forging of metal pieces subjected to heating by the passage of large currents of electricity . These applications are among the most recent , and have already received a considerable extension . Many operations of welding metals and metal forging or shaping were for the first time rendered feasible and practicable by electric heating . The use of electricity of low pressure and great flow of current for such operations is extending constantly , and the indications are that a wide field exists for future work . Electric welding has hitherto worked great changes in methods of manufacture and given rise to new industries , such as in electric pipe coiling , metal wheels made by welding , electrically xvelded projectiles , etc . Other industries based upon the application of the same principles will doubtless arise from time to time . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out the directions in which electrical progress seems likely to be observed in the future , without entering into the details of any special application . A number of electric plants are now in operation in which electric currents are applied to the refining of metals on a large scale . This industry is akin to the older one of electro-depositing or plating fr o m baths , and involves the same principles . For example , plates of crude c o p p e r containing small amounts of silver , lead , gold , and other impurities ( ? ) are dissolved in baths , and pure copper deposited at another point by the passage of the plating currents . The gold and silver may thus be recovered , and sometimes in sufficient amount to cover the cost of the process , while the copper Electric Iron . Electric Gardening . // obtained is of high quality . The art of electric metallurgy includes , besides refining processes , electro-plating and electrotyping , arts which have received such extended applications . These arts will extend in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials than those now common . It is not long ago that the electro - metallurgic processes were first applied on the large scale to the extraction of the metal aluminium from its ores or compounds , and the production of its alloys with other metals . There resulted a remarkable fall in the price of this remarkable metal . It now sells for less than a dollar a pound , whereas a few years ago it was only obtainable at about two dollars an ounce . It is now comparable in price , bulk for bulk , with such metals as copper , brass , and German silver . The aluminium industry promises in- time to become of vast proportions , and electrical forces seem destined to employment in performing many such difficult chemical operations as are involved in aluminium reduction . Our little known metals , equally difficult of extraction by chemical means , may yet yield to electrical persuasion and come out from their hiding-places to take part in the various industries . Imagine for a moment the silent passage of an electric current of large amount through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or compounds , and the steady accumulation of the extracted metal therein , to be ladled out and cast into ingots , and an outline of these processes of extraction is had . Replace the vat of melted ore by a nearly cold vat of chemical salts and pass the current as before , and we have an outline of the application of electricity to the manufacture of chemicals , a branch of the electrical industry which appears to be capable of enormous development . Quite recently , in fact , a large plant has been established in Europe , using water-power and producing electricity for manufacturing a well-known chemical , - chlorate of potassium . Electric current is , so to speak , the most powerful chemical agent in existence , and as*such it is destined to be applied on a larger and larger scale . Even in the process of tanning hides for leather , it is claimed that electric current passed through the vats hastens the process to a remarkable degree . This may well be true , though the writer has not investigated the matter fully enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to the use of electricity in furthering chemical operations are the recently reported experiments on passing currents through . the soil in which plants were growing . The reported results are that plants so treated developed much more rapidly than others similarly placed , but which did not receive the effect of current . Future tests will undoubtedly be made on this important subject , and should the results be confirmed and prove to be economically obtained , the outcome may be the establishment of electrical farms and we may yet partake of early electrical vegetables , even if we do not find pommes de terre d la dynamo or asperges elec/riques on our bill of fare . If electricity may be found useful in favoring the growth of plants under suitable conditions , may it not also be found useful in limiting the number of insect pests ? XVho is there that , in enjoying the cool evening air on a comfortable piazza in summer , has not been driven to shelter indoors and behind wire netting by the bloodthirsty mosquito ? How powerless we have felt in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished that the nuisance of the omnipresent house-fly might be abolished or mitigated . Worthy people of generous motives have even tried to attribute a certain usefulness to such pests , but others have given them bad names as spreaders of disease germs . They are certainly not to be classed as moral agents , but rather the reverse . Now let us assume that we make a netting of a warp of fine metal wires and a weft of silk threads , arranging it so that every alternate wire is respectively connected to the positive and negative pole of a small induction coil capable of giving a small spark and yet of insufficient force to pass from wire to wire in the fabric .. It is safe to say that an insect , such as a fly or mosquito , alighting on such a surface would receive his quietus , or be electro-cuted strictly in accordance with // New York methods . To go farther than this it may be suggested that electricity applied in some proper way may eventually be found capable of destroying bacteria or microbes , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal and even to vegetable life . It is not intended by this to give countenance to any of the numerous so-called " electric " curative appliances , such as electric insoles , brushes , corsets , belts , etc. , so well advertised , and which are only electric in name and only effective in curing by the abundance of faith of the patient . Electricity is to a certain extent scientifically applied by skilled physicians in the treatment of certain forms of disease , and with success in numerous instances . There is much work yet to be done in examining the effects of vigor6us currents of varying character upon the life structure . It would seem that there may be many surprises in store , and it is to be hoped that many benefits may arise when this field is fully explored . Attention has frequently been called to the possible use of electricity as an agent in warfare , in place of missies and the ordinary weapons of offence and defence . It must be confessed that in the writer 's opinion there seems little probability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used . For supplying the motive-power in the training of heavy guns , in the working of automatic aiming , range - finding , and fi r i n g mechanisms , controlled fr o m a well - sheltered part of a ship or fortress , and in the movement and control of torpedoes and similar contrivances , electricity will doubtless take a more and more important position . Modern naval vessels are not complete without a full equipment of very powerful electric search lights ; and the use of smaller search lights is becoming at least a great convenience for river and ocean steamers . Allusion has before been made to the use of electric mining locomotives as a growing application . The application of electricity to mining opens up a large field . Electric energy may draw the laden trains which bring the valuable products into the light of day . It may operate the hoists which lift the cage with its human or mineral freight from the depths of pits which seem bottomless . It may drive the fans to ventilate the galleries of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the mine . Yes , and more , it may even work the coal cutters or the rock iT Electric Cooking . // drills whereby the sought-for mineral is dislodged and made ready for transport to regions of sunshine . During last November , for the first time , electric rock drilling on a considerable scale was attempted at Rock Island , Illinois , in blasting outa channel in the Mississippi River there , and proved to be practical even when working under unfavorable conditions . Reciprocating electric drills are used for delivering rapid blows on the rock , and they receive current by means of a small cable from a dynamo at a distance . In the future the application of electricity to the transmission and delivery of power in various ways in mining and other work will receive a very great extension . Enough has been said , however , in the foregoing brief outline of future possibilities to prove the difficulties that beset one who attempts to prophesy in a field in which developments are so rapid . What is talked of to-day is accomplished to-morrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that the industry founded thereon is destined to become one of the most gigantic in the world . Where , in the past few years , there have been so many 1*eginnings in the new fields of electrical applications , there will be found in the next few years extended and active development . In the Centennial Exposition of 1876 , there were but two small exhibits of dynamos running arc lights . The telephone became an accomplished fact during the progress of the exhibition . There were a few electrical exhibits , chiefly of telegraphic appliances , shocking machines , and medical batteries . The electricity building of the World 's Fair at Chicago in 1893 , will constitute a monument to the great strides made during the sixteen years intervening . Most of the progress has , however , taken place in the past seven or eight years . Who shall say what the progress of another equal period will be ? We may not know any better than we do now what electricity is , l ) ut we shall certainly know more of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field is merely an indication that the world in its evolution has become ripe for it . The future is but the unfolding of the effects of the myriad agencies of the past . It may , in the broadest sense even , be but the repetition , more or less closely , of what has already become a part of the past , a result of a universal evolution which has repeated itself again and again . With millions and millions of suns and their darker attendant satellites , with boundless space , with limitless past and endless future time , a universe such as that of which we are a part must have approximately repeated itself , even though the series of changes or succession of events be as unbroken as the time for their unfolding is infinitely extended . The thought forces itself upon us , when we attempt to speak of the future development or achievements in any art , that our vision will be blurred , mistaken ; that our surmises , our prophecy , will at best be partial , colored by our own experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of our present achievements , we need only to be reminded that our little world rolls through space , perhaps unheeded , unseen , invisible in fact , from mightier worlds possessing more highly developed intelligence , more perfectly refined arts , more humane humanity , but removed from us by distances incalculable . Compared with many of them we are , without doubt , very backward in the solution of social problems , in the perfection of the economic arts , yea , in everything that pertains to our existence here . The scientific method , however , which has accomplished so much , is gradually coming to be understood at its true value . Accordingly , men are gradually ceasing their efforts to convince their brothers of that which was thought true but is not . By intelligently directing the forces of nature , what can not man accomplish , outside of inherent impossibi-lities ?
