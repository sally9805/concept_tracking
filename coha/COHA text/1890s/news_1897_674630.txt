txt It is very desirable that the question at issue in the matter of the Botanical Garden in Bronx Park should be settled soon and decisively . It is a pity that it should not have been settled by the acquiescence of the managers of the garden in the report of the landscape architects . If they had modified their scheme so as to make it acceptable to the men who were invoked to prevent any needless diminution of the attractiveness of the park as a park , work might now be going on to the satisfaction of everybody concerned . And everybody concerned means the whole population of the city , which has an interest in the preservation of Bronx Park from needless injury , and which will have a very much stronger interest in it a decade or a generation hence , when the city shall be built up solidly to its borders . A radical mistake made now will then be both manifest and irreparable . It is evident that the members of the Board of Estimate are by no means clear about their duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the one hand , there is the urgency of the projectors of the garden , whose public spirit and munificence are unquestioned . This is increased by the fact , pointed out by the Mayor , that subscriptions to a considerable amount will lapse and have to be renewed If the work is not soon begun . On the other hand , there is the consideration that the first experts in the country have given their opinions that the plan in accordance with which it is proposed to go to work is not the best disposition to make of the large sum of public money appropriated for the garden . Their report also in effect sets forth that the execution of that plan would diminish the value of the very much larger and more important investment which the city has made in Bronx Park . More light is needed by the members of the Board of Estimate , who are not , and do not profess to be , experts in the making either of botanical gardens or of parks . It seems that the best way to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will give every one who has a right to an opinion an opportunity to express it . Such a hearing could not fail to enlighten , not only the board but the public upon what is an important question of what are properly to be called " municipal politics
