txt Something must usually be pardoned to the necessities of a writer with strong feelings and a somewhat weak case , and Mr. PHELPS 'S rather sneering allusion to arbitration in his article on the Bering Sea controversy may not have been intended . very seriously . Certainly whatever of haste or perversity there may have been in it is sufficiently punished by the annoyance of having this despised policy proposed by the Secretary of State . And we should say that the not expensive appeal to patriotism in the following sentence can now hardly be read with satisfaction by its distinguished author : " How far the arbitration of such a question is consistent with the honor and dignity of our country is an inquiry more consonant with the traditions of earlier days than with the ideas of the present . " But Mr. PHELPS is not an ordinary writer , not one of the irresponsible contributors to the daily press whose ineptitude distresses him so much . He is an eminent lawyer and teacher of law , and . has had at least some opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will carry a corresponding weight with that numerous , and therefore important , class whom he calls " the unlearned. readers . " What he has to say of arbitration generally , then , is worth noting : " Arbitration is just now the panacea through which all swords are to become plowshares . In time it will be seen whether it is a universal remedy , or whether , like numerous other panaceas which have from time to time engaged the attention of the world , it is only an alleviation useful in certain eases . present instance certainly ? goes to show that it is a resource more attractive in theory than available in practice . " Passing by the prematureness of the concluding remark , which must be sufficiently clear to Mr. PRxers by this time , and the inelegance of the metaphor which mixes up a panacea with swords and plowshares , it seems to us that Mr. PHELPS has quite failed to apprehend clearly what arbitration really is and to what uses it can fairly be put . We do not know of any considerable body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal remedy , " and to assert a doubt as to whether it is one throws no light on any actual question . On the other band , to suggest that it is " . only an alleviation useful in certain cases , " betrays a tendency to be led away by one 's own rhetoric . Arbitration israther a preventive than an alleviation . It does not , where it is practicable , merely soften the effect of a cause that is not removed , it removes a cause that if left free to operate might produce very mischievous consequences . We take it that Mr. PHELPS would hardly deny that , in. the most conspicuous and important case of arbitration known in the history of nations , that of the Alabama case , the result was something very much more than the " alleviation " of the irritation previously existing . The irritation , on the contrary , was not only practically extinguished , but consequences of the most disastrous character that , without arbitratifn , must have been nearly inevitable , . vere absolutely prevented . What arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to compel , or permit , the two disputants - to state their respective cases , submit them to examination with full opportunity to each to traverse and discuss the statement of the other , and to take - the judgment of an arbitrator assented to by both . It is perfectly true that there must be mutual consent to make this mode of settlement effective , and that no court of arbitration can enforce its decisions . And even where there has been mutual consent and either of the parties refuses to submit to the decision given , only force can finally decide between them . But in that case the result is no worse than it - would have been if force had . been resorted to at first , while there is always the possibility that it May be avoided . Two things unquestionably tend to make arbitration successful . One is that each Government is obliged . to argue its case not only from its own point of view but with reference to . that of the other Government , and that the sum of the statements and arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , which is a force of constantly though slowly advancing influence . The second is that arbitration gives to a Government that is in the wrong , but could never be got to acknowledge it by the mere insistence of its opponent , an opportunity to submit without injury to its dignity . It is not easy for an individual who has once become engaged in a warm dispute to abandon his pretensions , even when he is convinced that they are mistaken . It is much more difficult for a Government - to do so , since the men who constitute the Government must keep in mind not merely what they think , but - what others may think , or pretend to think , of them . Arbitration does distinctly facilitate this often I very useful and necessary course . Itis true , again , that , generally speaking , questions involving " the honor and dignity of the country " can not be arbitrated , hat then the more arbitration is demanded . by the custom of nations and the opinion of mankind , the more careful the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving honor and dignity in disputes where they do not need . to be introduced .
