<H3> Text of page : </H3> <PRE> CAMPAIGNING WITH GRANT . BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER . OPERATIONS ABOUT RICHMOND , PETERSBURG , AND ATLANTA , AND IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY . STORMING OF NEWMARKET HEIGHTS . T was found that Lee had sent a 77 division of infantry and cavalry -* as far as Culpeper to cooperate with Early 's forces , and on August 12 , 1864 , Grant began a movement at Petersburg intended to force the enemy to return his detached troops to that point . Hancock 's corps was marched from Petersburg to City Point , and there placed on steamboats . The movement was to create the impression that these troops were to be sent to Washington . Butler relaid the pontoon-bridge , and his forces crossed to Deep Bottom . Tl*e same night , August 13 , the boats which carried Hancock 's corps were sent up the river , and the troops disembarked on the north side of the James . Hancock was put in command of the movement . General Grant said , in discussing the affair : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect it to result in anything decisive in the way of crippling the enemy in battle ; my main object is to call troops from Early and from the derenses of Petersburg . If Lee withdraws the bulk of his army from Meade 's front , Meade will have a good opportunity of making a movement to his left with one of his corps. * The 14th and 15th were spent in reconnoitering and marnzeuvering and in making one successful assault . On August 16 I was directed to go to Hancock with important instructions , and remain with his command that day . This gave me an opportunity to participate in the engagements which took place . Early in the morning the movement began by sending out Miles 's brigade and Gregg 's cavalry , which drove back a body of the enemy to a point only seven miles from Richmond . At ten o'clock a vigorous attack was made by Birney 's corps upon the works at Fussell 's Mills . The intrenchments were handsomely carried , and three colors and nearly three hundred prisoners taken ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined assault , and compelled Birney to abandon the works he had captured . He succeeded , however , in VOL . LIV. - 26- 27. holding the enemy 's intrenched picket-line . In the meantime the enemy brought up a sufficient force to check the advance of Gregg and Miles and compel them to withdraw from their position . Our troops fell back in perfect order , retiring by successive lines . Gregg took up a line on Deep Creek . That evening the enemy made a heavy attack on him , but only succeeded in forcing him back a short distance . The fighting had been desperate , and all the officers present had suffered greatly from their constant exposure to the heavy fire of the enemy in their efforts to hold the men to their work and add as much as possible to the success of the movements . This day 's fighting was known as the battle of Newmarket Heights . In these engagements I was fortunate enough to be able to render service which was deemed to be of some importance by the general-in-chief , who wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular army for ( ( gallant and meritorious services in action &gt; ; and the appointment to that rank was made by the President . As a result of these operations , Hill 's command had been withdrawn from Petersburg and sent to Hancock 's front , and a division of Longstreet 's corps , which had been under marching orders for the valley , was detained . General Grant was now giving daily watchfulness and direction to four active armies in the field-those of Meade , Butler , Sheridan , and Sherman . They constituted a dashing four-in-hand , with Grant holding the reins . These armies no longer moved ( ( like horses in a balky team , no two ever pulling together. * While some of them were at long distances from the others , they were acting in harmony , and cooperating with one another for the purpose of keeping the enemy constantly employed in their respective fronts , to prevent him from concentrating his force against any particular army . The enemy had short interior lines upon which to move , and railroads for the prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous cooperative movements on the part of the Union armies that the enemy was kept from prac-201 // tising the fundamental principle of warnamely , concentrating the bulk of his forces against a fraction of those of the enemy . A DRAFT ORDERED . THE affairs of the country were now like a prairie in the season of fires : as soon as the conflagration was extinguished in one place it immediately broke out in another . While General Grant was hourly employed in devising military movements to meet the situation in the field , his advice and assistance were demanded for a grave state of affairs which had now arisen in the Northern States . A draft had been ordered by the President for the purpose of filling up our depleted regiments , and the disloyal element at home was making it a pretext to embarrass the government in its prosecution of the war . On August 11 Halleck sent Grant a confidential letter , in which he said , among other things of a disturbing nature : ( ( Pretty strong evidence is accumulating that there is a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the draft . . . . To enforce it may require the withdrawal of a very considerable number of troops from the field . . . . The evidence of this has increased very much within the last fewdays .... Are not the appearances such that we ought to take in sail and prepare the ship for a storm ? * General Grant replied , suggesting means for enforcing the draft without depleting the armies in the field , and saying he was not going to break his hold where he was on the James . On the evening of August 17 General Grant was sitting in front of his quarters , with several staff-officers about him , when the telegraph operator came over from his tent and handed him a despatch . He opened it , and as he proceeded with the reading his face became suffused with smiles . After he had finished it he broke into a hearty laugh . We were curious to know what could produce so much merriment in the general in the midst of the trying circumstances which surrounded him . He cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( ( The President has more nerve than any of his advisers . This is what he says after reading my reply to Halleck 's despatch. * He then rcad aloud to us the following : ( ( ( I have seen your despatch expressing your unwillingness to break your hold where you are . Neither am I willing . Hold on with a bulldog grip , and chew and choke as much as possible . A. LINcoLN.n Throughout this period of activity at headquarters General Grant was not unmindful of the rewards which were due to his generals for their achievements . On August 10 he had written to the Secretary of War : " I think it but a just reward for services already rendered that General Sherman be now appointed a major-general , and W. S. Hancock and Sheridan brigadiers , in the regular army . All these generals have proved their worthiness for this advancement . ) ) Sherman and Hancock received their appointments on the ? 12th , and Sheridan on the 20th . General Grant was very much gratified that their cases had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WARREN moved out at dawn on August 18 , in accordance with orders , to a point three miles west of the left of the Army of the Potomac , and began the work of tearing up the Weldon Railroad . Hard fighting ensued that day , in which the enemy suffered severely . Lee hurried troops from north of the James to Petersburg , and in the afternoon of the 19th a large force turned a portion of Warren*s command and forced it to retire . Two divisions of Parke 's corps had been ordered to support Warren , our troops were now reformed , the lost ground was soon regained , the enemy fell back in great haste to his intrenchments , and the position onthe railroad was firmly held by Warren 's men . General Grant remained at City Point this day in order to be in constant communication with Hancock and Butler as well as with Meade . When he heard of Warren 's success he telegraphed at once to Meade : " I am pleased to see the promptness with which General Warren attacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate in such cases to abandon his lines and take every man to fight every battle , and trust to regaining them afterward , or to getting better . ) ) He said after writing this despatch : ( ( Meade and I have had to criticize Warren pretty severely on several occasions for being slow , and I wanted to be prompt to compliment him now that he has acted vigorously and handsomely in taking the offensive . ) ) His corps being greatly exposed in its present position , and knowing that the enemy would use all efforts to save the railroad , Warren on August 20 took up a position a mile or two in the rear of his line of battle the day before , and intrenched . All of Hancock 's corps was withdrawn from the north side of the James . Lee soon discovered this , and hurried more troops back to Petersburg . // On the morning of August 21 Hill 's whole corps , with a part of Hoke 's division and Lee 's cavalry , attacked Warren . Thirty pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaults were made ; but Warren repulsed the enemy at all points , and then advanced and captured several hundred prisoners . The enemy had failed in his desperate efforts to recover the Weldon Railroad , and he was now compelled to haul supplies by wagons around the break in order to make any use of that line of supplies . BATTLE OF REAMS 'S STATION . ON August 22 Gregg 's division of cavalry and troops from Hancock 's corps were sent to Reams 's Station , seven miles south of Warren 's position , and tore up three miles of the Weldon Railroad south of that place . Hancock discovered the enemy massing heavily in his front on the 25th , and concentrated his force at the station , and took possession of some earthworkswhich had been constructed before at that place , but which were badly laid out for the purpose of defense . That afternoon several formidable assaults were directed against Miles , who was in command of Barlow 's division , but they were handsomely repulsed . At 5 P. M. Hill 's corps made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthworks , Hancock 's command was exposed to a reverse fire , which had an unfortunate effect upon the morale of the men . A portion of Miles 's line finally gave way , and three of our batteries of artillery were captured . Our troops were now exposed to attack both in flank and reverse , and the position of Hancock 's command had become exceedingly critical ; but the superb conduct displayed by him and Miles in rallying their forces saved the day . By a gallant dash the enemy was soon swept back , and one of our batteries and a portion of the intrenchments were retaken . Gibbon 's division was driven from its intrenched position , but it took up a new line , and after hard fighting the further advance of the enemy was checked . As the command was now seriously threatened in its present position , and none of the reinforcements ordered up had arrived , Hancock 's troops were withdrawn after dark . Hancock 's want of success was due largely to the condition of his troops . They had suffered great fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in officers , and the command was composed largely of recruits and substitutes . The casualties in this engagement , in killed , wounded , and missing , were 2742 ; the number of guns lost , 9 . The enemy 's loss was larger than ours in killed and wounded , but less in prisoners . General Miles , who thirtyone years thereafter became general-in-chief of the army , in all his brilliant career as a soldier never displayed more gallantry and ability than in this memorable engagement , which is known in history as the battle of Reams 's Station . The enemy had subjected himself to heavy loss in a well-concerted attempt to regain possession of the Weldon Railroad , which was of such vital importance to him , but in this he had signally failed . Lee had been so constantly threatened , or compelled to attack around Petersburg and Richmond , that he had been entirely prevented from sending any forces to Hood to be used against Sherman . GRANT 'S FAMILY VISIT HIM . MRS . GRANT had come East with the children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet them at Philadelphia , and bring them to City Point to pay a visit to the general . The children consisted of Frederick D. , then fourteen years old ; Ulysses S. , Jr. , twelve ; Nellie R. , nine ; and Jesse R. , six . Nellie was born on the 4th of July , and when a child an innocent deception had been practised upon her by her father in letting her believe that all the boisterous demonstrations and display of fireworks on Independence Day were in honor of her birthday . The general was exceedingly fond of his family , and his meeting with them afforded him the happiest day he had seen since they parted . They were comfortably lodged aboard the headquarters steamboat , but spent most of their time in camp . The morning after their arrival , when I stepped into the general 's tent , I found him in his shirt-sleeves engaged in a rough-and-tumble wrestling-match with the two older boys . He had become red in the face , and seemed nearly out of breath from the exertion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees on the floor grappling with the youngsters , and joining in their merry laughter , as if he were a boy again himself . I had several despatches in my hand , and when he saw that I had come on business , he disentangled himself after some difficulty from the young combatants , rose to his feet , brushed the dust off his knees with his hand , and said in a sort of apologetic manner : ( ( Ah , you know my weaknesses-my children and my horses . ) ) The // children often romped with him , and he joined in their frolics as if they were all playmates together . The younger ones would hang about his neck while he was writing , make a terrible mess of his papers , and turn everything in his tent into a toy : but they were never once reproved for any innocent sport ; they were governed solely by an appeal to their affections . They were always respectful , and never failed to render strict obedience to their father when he told them seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly Miss Julia Dent , was four years younger than the general . She had been educated in Professor Moreau 's finishing-school in St. Louis , one of the best institutions of instruction in its day , and was a woman of much general intelligence , and exceedingly well informed upon all public matters . She was noted for her amiability , her cheerful disposition , and her extreme cordiality of manner . She was soon upon terms of intimacy with all the members of the staff , and was quick to win the respect and esteem of every one at headquarters . She visited any officers o* soldiers who were sick , went to the cook and suggested delicacies for their comfort , took her meals with the mess , kept up a pleasant run of conversation at the table , and added greatly to the cheerfulness of headquarters . She had visited her husband several times at the front when he was winning his victories in the West , and had learned perfectly how to adapt herself to camp life . She and the general were a perfect Darby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quarters of an evening , and sit with her han&amp; in his , manifesting the most ardent devotion ; and if a staff-officer came accidentally upon them , they would look as bashful as two young lovers spied upon in the scenes of their courtship . In speaking of the general to others , his wife usually referred to him as ( ( Mr. Grant , ) ) from force of habit formed before the war . In addressing him she said *Ulyss , * and when they were alone , or no one was present except an intimate friend of the family , she applied a pet name which she had adopted after the capture of Vicksburg , and called him ( ( Victor . ) ) Sometimes the general would tease the children good-naturedly by examining them about their studies , putting to them all sorts of puzzling mathematical questions , and asking them to spell tongue-splitting words of half a dozen syllables . Mrs. Grant would at times put on an air of mock earnestness , and insist upon the general telling her all of the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then proceed to give her a fanciful description of an imaginary campaign , in which he would name impossible figures as to the number of the troops , inextricably confuse the geography of the country , and trace out a plan of marvelously complicated movements in a manner that was often exceedingly droll . No family could have been happier in their relations ; there was never a selfish act committed or an illnatured word uttered by any member of the household , and their daily life was altogether beautiful in its charming simplicity and its deep affection . RELATIONS BETWEEN GRANT AND SHERMAN . A LITTLE before nine o'clock on the evening of September 4 , while the general was having a quiet smoke in front of his tent , and discussing the campaign in Georgia , a despatch came from Sherman announcing the capture of Atlanta , which had occurred on September 2 . It was immediately read aloud to the staff , and after discussing the news for a few minutes , and uttering many words in praise of Sherman , the general wrote the following reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Atlanta . In honor of your great victory I have ordered a salute to be fired with shotted guns from every battery bearing upon the enemy . The salute will be fired within an hour , amid great rejoicing . ) ) In the meantime the glad tidings had been telegraphed to Meade and Butler , with directions to fire the salute , and not long afterward the roar of artillery communicated the joyful news of victory throughout our army , and bore sad tidings to the ranks of the . enemy . An answer was , received from Sherman , in which he said : " I have received your despatch , and will communicate it to the troops in general orders . . . . I have always felt that you would take personally more pleasure in my success than in your own , and I reciprocate the feeling to the fullest extent . ) ) Grant then wrote to Sherman : 4 feel that you have accomplished the most gigantic undertaking given to any general in this war with a skill and ability which will be acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me as much pleasure to record this in your favor as it would in favor of any living man , myself included . ) ) This correspondence , and the unmeasured praise which was given to Sherman at this time by the general-in-chief in his despatches and conversations , afford additional // evidences of his constant readiness to give all due praise to his subordinates for any successful work which they accomplished . He was entirely unselfish in his relations with them , and never tired of taking up the cudgels in their defense if any one criticized them unjustly . The above correspondence with Sherman recalls the letters which were interchanged betwe*n them after General Grant 's successes in the West . The general wrote to Sherman at that time : ( ( What I want is to express my thanks to you and McPherson as the men to whom , above all others , I feel indebted for whatever I have had of success . How far your advice and assistance have been of help to me you know . How far your execution of whatever has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am receiving , you can not know as well as I. I feel all the gratitude this letter would express , giving it the most flattering construction . ) ) Sherman wrote a no less manly letter in reply . After insisting that General Grant assigned to his subordinates too large a share of merit , he went on to say : ( el believe you to be as brave , patriotic , and just as the great prototype , Washington ; as unselfish , kind-hearted , and honest as a man should be ; but the chief characteristic is the simple faith in success you have always manifested , which I can liken to nothing else than the faith a Christian has in the Saviour . . . . I knew , wherever I was , that you thought of me , and if I got in a tight place you would help me out if alive . ) ) The noble sentiments expressed in this and similar correspondence were the bright spots which served to relieve the gloomy picture of desolating war . Now that Sherman had captured Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next move should be ; and a discussion took place at General Grant 's headquarters as to the advisability of a march to the sea . Such a movement had been referred to in a despatch from Grant to Halleck as early as July 15 , saying : ( ( If he Sherman can supply himself once with ordnance and quartermaster 's stores , and partially with subsistence , he will find no difficulty in staying until a permanent line can be opened with the south coast . ) ) On August 13 Sherman communicated with Grant about the practicability of cutting loose from his base and shifting his army to the Alabama River , or striking out for St. Mark 's , Florida , or for Savannah . Further correspondence took place between the two generals after Sherman had entered Atlanta . The subject was one in which the members of the staff became deeply interested . Maps were pored over daily , and most intelligent discussions were carried on as to the feasibility of Sherman 's ai'my making a march to the sea-coast , and the point upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO SHERMAN . ON September 12 General Grant called me into his tent , turned his chair around from the table at which he had been sitting , lighted a fresh cigar , and began a conversation by saying : ( ( Sherman and I have exchanged ideas regarding his next movement about as far as we can by correspondence , and I have been thinking that it would be well for you to start for Atlanta to-morrow , and talk over with him the whole subject of his next campaign . We have debated it so much here that you know my views thoroughly , and can answer any of Sherman 's questions as to what I think in reference to the contemplated movement , and the action which should be taken in the various contingencies which may arise . Sherman 's suggestions are excellent , and no one is better fitted for carrying them out . I can comply with his views in regard to meeting him with ample supplies at any point on the sea-coast which it may be decided to have him strike for . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Wilmington , North Carolina , landing the troops on the coast north of Fort Fisher ; and with the efficient cooperation of the navy we shall no doubt get control of Wilmington harbor by the time he reaches and captures other points on the seacoast . Sherman has made a splendid campaign , and the more I reflect upon it the more merit I see in it . I do not want to hamper him any more in the future than in the past with detailed instructions . I want him to carry out his ideas freely in the coming movement , and to have all the credit of its success . Of this success I have no doubt . I will write Sherman a letter , which you can take to him . ) ) The general then turned to his writingtable , and retaining between his lips the cigar which he had been smoking , wrote the communication . After reading it over aloud , he handed it to me to take to Atlanta . It said , among other things : ( ( Colonel Porter will explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do in the limits of a letter . . . . My object now in sending a staff-officer is not so much to suggest operations for you as to get your views and have plans matured by the time everything can be // got ready . It will probably be the 5th of October before any of the plans herein indicated will be executed . . . I started the next day on this mission , going by way of Cincinnati and Louisville , and after many tedious interruptions from the crowded state of traffic by rail south of the latter place , and being once thrown from the track , I reached Chattanooga on the afternoon of September 19 . From there to Atlanta is one hundred and fifty miles . Guerrillas were active along the line of the road , numerous attempts had recently been made to wreck the trains , and they were run as far as practicable by daylight . Being anxious to reach General Sherman with all despatch , I started forward that night on a freight-train . Rumors of approaching guerrillas were numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unfounded , and I arrived at Atlanta safely the next forenoon . Upon this night trip I passed over the battle-field of Chickamauga on the anniversary of the sanguinary engagement in which I had participated the year before , and all *f its exciting features were vividly recalled . THE CAPTOR OF ATLANTA . UPON reaching Atlanta , I went at once to General Sherman 's headquarters . My mind was naturally wrought up to a high pitch of curiosity to see the famous soldier of the West , whom I had never met . He had taken up his quarters in a comfortable brick house belonging to Judge Lyons , opposite the Court-house Square . As I approached I saw the captor of Atlanta on the porch , sitting tilted back in a large arm-chair , reading a newspaper . His coat was unbuttoned , his black felt hat slouched over his brow , and on his feet were a pair of slippers very much down at the heels . He was in the prime of life and in the perfection of physical health . He was just forty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his military fame . With his large frame , tall , gaunt form , restless hazel eyes , aquiline nose , bronzed face , and crisp beard , he looked the picture of ( ( grim-visaged war . ) ) My coming had been announced to him by telegraph , and he was expecting my arrival at this time . I approached him , introduced myself , and handed him General Grant 's letter . He tilted forward in his chair , crumpled , the newspaper in his left hand while with his right he shook hands cordially , then pushed a chair forward and invited me to sit down . His reception was exceedingly cordial , and his manner exhibited all the personal peculiarities which General Grant , in speaking of him , had so often described . After reading General Grant 's letter , he entered at once upon an animated discussion of the military situation East and West , and as he waxed more intense in his manner the nervous energy of his nature soon began to manifest itself . He twice rose from his chair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , and from time to time drew first one foot and then the other out of its slipper , and followed up the movement by shoving out his leg so that the foot could recapture the slipper and thrust itself into it again . He exhibited a strong individuality in every movement , and there was a peculiar energy of manner in uttering the crisp words and epigrammatic phrases which fell from his lips as rapidly as shots from a magazine-gun . I soon realized that he was one of the most dramatic and picturesque characters of the war . He asked a great deal about the armies of the East , and spoke of the avidity with which he read all accounts of the desperate campaigns they were waging . He said : " I knew Grant would make the fur fly when he started down through Virginia . Wherever he is the enemy will never find any trouble about getting up a fight . He has all the tenacity of a Scotch terrier . That he will accomplish his whole purpose I have never had a doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in acting on the defensive in a peculiarly defensive country , falling back on his supplies when we are moving away from ours , taking advantage of every river , hill , forest , and swamp to hold us at bay , and intrenching every night behind fortified lines to make himself safe from attack . Grant ought to have an army more than twice the size of that of the enemy in order to make matters at all equal in Virginia . When Grant cried , ( Forward ! ) after the battle of the Wilderness , I said : ( This is the grandest act of his life ; now I feel that the rebellion will be crushed . ) I wrote him , saying it was a bold order to give , and full of significance ; that it showed the mettle of which he was made , and if Wellington could have heard it he would have jumped out of his boots . The terms of Grant 's despatch in reply to the announcement of the capture of Atlanta gave us great gratification here . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and published them in general orders ; and they did much to encourage the troops and make them feel that their hard // work was appreciated by those highest in command. * After a while lunch was announced , and the general invited me to his mess , consisting of himself and his personal staff . Among the latter I met some of my old army friends , whom I was much gratified to see again . The g&amp;neral 's mess was established in the dining-room of the house he occupied , and was about as democratic as Grant 's . The officers came and went as their duties required , and meals were eaten without the slightest ceremony . After we were seated at the table the general said : ( ( I do n't suppose we have anything half as good to eat out here as you fellows in the East have . You have big rivers upon which you can bring up shell-fish , and lots of things we do n't have here , where everything has to come over a single-track railroad more than three hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars for luxuries . It is all we can do to get the necessaries down this far . However , here is some pretty fair beef , and there are plenty of potatoes , ) ) pointing to the dishes ; ( ( and they are good enough for anybody . We did get a little short of rations at times on the march down here , and one of my staff told me a good story of what one of the men had to say about it . An officer found him eating a persimmon that he had picked up , and cried out to him , ( Do n't eat that ; it 's not good for you . ) ( I m not eatin ' it because it s good , ) was the reply ; ( I m tryin ' to pucker up my stomach so as to fit the size of the rations Uncle Billy Sherman s a-givin ' us . ) ) ) After lunch we repaired to a room in the house which the general used for his office , and there went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said : " I am more than ever of the opinion that there 9ughtto be some definite objective point or points decided upon before I move farther into this country ; sweeping around generally through Georgia for the purpose of inflicting damage would not be good generalship ; I want to strike out for the sea . Now that our people have secured Mobile Bay , they might be able to send a force up to Columbus . That would be of great assistance to me in penetrating farther into this State ; but unless Canbyis largely reinforced , he will probably have as much as he can do at present in taking care of the rebels west of the Mississippi . If after Grant takes Wilmington he could , with the cooperation of the navy , get hold of Savannah , and open the Savannah River up to the neighborhood of Augusta , I would feel pretty safe in picking up the bulk of this army and moving east , subsisting off the country . I could move to Milledgeville , and threaten both Macon and Augusta , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augusta . I can subsist m* army upon the country as long as I can keep moving ; but if I should have to stop and fight battles the difficulty would be greatly increased . There is no telling what Hood will do , whether he will follow me and contest my march eastward , or whether he will start north with his whole army , thinking there will not be any adequate force to oppose him , and that he can carry the war as far north as Kentucky . I do n't care much which he does . I would rather have him start north , though ; and I would be willing to give him a free ticket and pay his expenses if he would decide to take that horn of the dilemma . I could send enough of this army to delay his progress until our troops scattered through the West could be concentrated in sufficient force to destroy him ; then with the bulk of my army I could cut a swath through to the sea , divide the Confederacy in two , and be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do almost anything else that Grant might require of me . Both Jeff Davis , according to the tone of his recent speeches , and Hood want me to fall back . That is just the reason why I want to go forward . ) ) The general then went into a long discussion of the details which would have to be carried out under the several contingencies which might occur . He said : ( ( In any emergency I should probably want to designate a couple of points on the coast where I could reach the sea as compelled by circumstances ; and a fleet of provisions ought to be sent to each one of the points , so that I would be sure of having supplies awaiting me. * I told him that this had been discussed by General Grant , and it was his intention to make ample provisions of that nature . The general said further : ( ( You know when I cut loose from my communications you will not hear anything from me direct , and Grant will have to learn of my whereabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of scouts , if we can get any through the country , and possibly depend largely upon the news obtained from rebel newspapers . I suppose you get these papers through the lines just as we do here . ) ) I said : ( ( Yes ;  --  and I think more readily . The enemy is always eager to get the New York papers , and as we receive them daily , we exchange them for Richmond and Petersburg papers , and obtain in that way // much news that is valuable . There will be no difficulty in hearing of your movements almost daily . ) ) At the close of the conversation I told the general I was anxious to get back to headquarters as soon as it would suit his convenience . He asked me to stay a couple of days , saying he would talk matters over further , and would write some communications for General Grant , a report , and also a list of the names of officers whom he wished to have promoted , if it could be prepared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the staff-officers , and spent a couple of days very advantageously in looking over the captured city , and learning many points of interest regarding the marvelous campaign which had secured it . AN EVENING WITH GENERAL GEORGE H. THOMAS . THAT eveninglpaidavisit to my old commanding officer , General George H. Thomas , who had quartered himself in a house on Peachtree street , now known as the Leyden House , and passed avery pleasant hour with him . The house was surrounded by a broad porch supported byrows of fluted columns , and was very commodious . The meeting revived a great many stories of the Chickamauga campaign . The general said in the course of the conversation : ( ( Do you remember that jackass that looked over the fence one day when we were passing along a road near the Tennessee River ? He pricked up his ears and brayed until he threatened to deafen everybody within a mile of him ; and when he stopped , and a dead silence followed , a soldier quietly remarked , ( Boys , did you hear him purr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a purr I had ever heard . ) ) Then the general lay back in his chair and shook with laughter at the recollection . While grave in manner and leonine in appearance , he had a great deal more fun in him than is generally supposed . When quartered at Murfreesboro , Tennessee , the year before , a piano had been secured , and it was the custom to have musical entertainments in the evening at general headquarters . There were some capital voices among the officers , and no end of comic songs at hand ; and these , with the recitations and improvisations which were contributed , made up a series of variety performances which became quite celebrated . General Thomas was a constant attendant , and would nod approval at the efforts of the performers , and beat time to the music , and when anything particularly comical took place he would roll from side to side and nearly choke with merriment . That day Sherman wrote to Grant : " 1 have the honor to acknowledge , at the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel Porter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept with thanks the honorable and kindly mention of the services of this army in the great cause in which we are all engaged . ) ) Then followed three or four pages , closing with the sentence : ( ( I will have alongtalkwith Colonel Porter , and tell him everything that may occur to me of interest to you . In the meantime , know that I admire your dogged perseverance and pluck more than ever . If you can whip Lee , and I can march to the Atlantic , I think Uncle Abe will give us a twenty days ' leave of absence to see the young folks . ) ) Two days later I started back to City Point , and reached there September 27 . GRANT VISITS SHERIDAN . GENERAL GRANT listened with manifest interest to the report which I brought of the situation at Atlanta , and of Sherman 's feelings and intentions , and asked many questions as to the condition of the great army of the West . I found that during my absence the general-in-chief had paid a visit to Sheridan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of September , had passed through Washington without stopping , and had gone directly to Charlestown , where Sheridan then had his headquarters . He went from there to Burlington , New Jersey , where it was arranged to place his children at school , and returned to City Point on the 19th . He spoke with much pleasure and satisfaction of his visit to Sheridan , and said : ( ( I was so anxious not to have the movement made in the valley unless I felt assured of its success , that I thought I would go and have a talk with Sheridan before giving a decided answer as to what should be done . I had written out a plan of campaign for his guidance , and did not stop in Washington for the reason that I thought there might be a disposition there to modify it and make it less aggressive . I first asked Sheridan if he had a plan of his own , and if so , what it was . He brought out his maps , and laid out a plan so complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy in his front , that I did not take my plan out of my pocket , but let him go ahead . I also decided not to remain with him during the movement , which was to begin in a day or two , for fear it might be thought that I was trying to share in a success which I wished to belong solely to him. ) ) // GOOD NEWS FROM WINCHESTER . IN speaking of his visit to the Middle Military Division , General Grant said : " I ordered Sheridan to move out and whip Early. * An officer present ventured the remark : *I presume the actual form of the order was to move out and attack him . ) ) ( ( No , ) ) answered the general ; " I mean just what I say : I gave the order to whip him . ) ) Sheridan advanced promptly on September 19 , and struck Early 's army at Winchester , where he gained a signal victory , capturing five guns and nine battle-flags . He pursued the enemy the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22d attacked him again in front and flank , carried his earthworks at every point , captured sixteen guns and eleven hundred prisoners , put him to flight , and completed his destruction . This left Sheridan in possession of the valley of Virginia . He had obeyed to the letter his orders to whip Early . General Grant sent cordial congratulations to the victorious commander , and ordered a salute of on* hundred guns in honor of each of his victories . No events had created more rejoicing in the mind of the general-in-chief than these brilliant triumphs of Sheridan . The general had taken the sole responsibility of bringing Sheridan East and placing him in command of a separate , important army , amid the doubts of some of the principal officials at Washington , and these victories on the part of the young commander were an entire vindication of Grant 's judgment . The spirits of the loyal people of the North were beginning to droop , and the disloyal element had become still more aggressive , and such victories just at this time were of inestimable value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry had made a bold dash round the left of Meade 's line , and captured over two thousand head of cattle . One evening after Grant 's return , at the close of a conversation upon this subject , a citizen from Washington , who was stopping at City Point , inquired of him , ( ( When do you expect to starve out Lee and capture Richmond ? ) ) ( ( Never , ) ) replied the general , significantly , ( ( if our armies continue to supply him with beef cattle . ) ) GRANT UNDER FIRE AT FORT HARRISON . THE general-in-chief was still planning to keep the enemy actively engaged in his own immediate front , so as to prevent him from detaching troops against distant commanders . He telegraphed Sherman September26 : 4 will give them another shake here before the end of the week . ) ) On the 27th he sent a despatch to Sheridan , saying : " . . . No troops have passed through Richmond to reinforce Early . I shall make a break here on the 29th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cipher . Definite instructions were issued on the 27th for the ( ( break ) ) which was in contemplation . Birney 's and Ord 's corps of Butler 's army were to cross on the night of September 28 to the north side of the James River at Deep Bottom , and at-. tack the enemy 's forces there . If they succeeded in breaking through his lines they were to make a dash for Richmond . While the general did not expect to capture the city by this movement , he tried to provide for every emergency , thinking that if the enemy 's line should be found weak , there would be a bare chance , after having once broken through , of creating a panic in Richmond , and getting inside of its inner works . Ord and Birney moved out promptly before daylight on September 29 . General Grant left a portion of his staff at City Point to communicate with him and Meade , and rode out , taking the rest of us with him , to Butler 's front . Ord moved directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , carried it by assault , captured fifteen guns and several hundred prisoners , and secured possession of an entire line of intrenchments . Everything promised further success , when Ord was wounded so severely in the leg that he had to leave the field , and proper advantage was not taken of the important success which had been gained . Birney moved with his colored troops against the line of intrenchments on the Newmarket road , promptly carried it , and drove the enemy back in great confusion . General Grant was with Birney 's command in the early part of the day . His youngest son , Jesse , had obtained permission that morning to go up the river on the boat which carried his father , and had taken along his black Shetland pony called " Little Reb . ) ) The boy was then only a little over six years old , and was dressed in kilts , probably in honor of his Scotch ancestors . When the party reached the north side of the river , and mounted and rode out to the front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was so busy in supervising the movement that he did not notice the boy until he got under fire , when , on looking around , he saw his enterprising heir moving about as coolly as any of the others of the group , // while the shots were striking the earth and stirring up the dust in every direction . ( ( What s that youngster doing there ? ) ) cried the general , manifesting no little anxiety ; and turning to the junior aide , added , ( ( Dunn , I wish you would take him to the rear , and put him where he will be safe . ) ) But Jesse had too much of his sire 's blood in his veins to yield a prompt compliance , and at first demurred . Dunn , however , took hold of Little Reb 's bridle , and started him on a gallop toward the river ; and the boy , much to his mortification , had to beat an ignominious retreat . Dunn was more troubled than any one else over this masterly retrograde movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him breaking for the rear under fire might think that he had suddenly set too high a value on his life , and was looking out for a safe place . After the capture of the works by Birney 's troops , the general-in-chief rode over to Fort Harrison to push matters in that direction . He was greatly gratified at the handsome manner in which the fort had been carried , and the Fluck which had been shown by the troops . The fort was an inclosed work , and formed a salient upon the enemy 's line . There were batteries in its rear , however , which still commanded it . The general rode up to a point near the ditch , and there dismounted , and made his way into the work on foot . The ground gave ample evidence of the effects of the assault , and was so torn with shot and shell and covered with killed and wounded in some places that the general had to pick his way in stepping over the dead bodies that lay in his path . He turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , and the expression of profound grief impressed upon his features told , as usual , of the effect produced upon him by the sad spectacle . Upon entering the fort , he climbed up and looked over the parapet on the north side , and remained there for some time , viewing the surrounding works and taking a look at Richmond , while the enemy 's batteries continued to shell us . This was the nearest view of the city he had yet obtained , and the church spires could be indistinctly seen . He made up his mind that both corps should move forward promptly , and sat down on the ground , tucked his legs under him , and wrote the following despatch to Birney , dating it 10:35 A. M. : ( ( General Ord has carried the very strong works and some fifteen pieces of artillery , and his corps is now ready to advance in conjunction with you . General Ord was wounded , and has returned to his headquarters , leaving General Heckman in command of the corps . Push forward on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's projectiles were still flying in our direction , and when the general had reached the middle of the despatch a shell burst directly over him . Those standing about instinctively ducked their heads , but he paid no attention to the occurrence , and did not pause in his writing , or even look up . The handwriting of the despatch when finished did noPbear the slightest evidence of the uncomfortable circumstances under which it was indited . General Butler had ridden up to the fort , his face flushed with excitement ; and in an interview which followed with General Grant , the commander of the Army of the James grew enthusiastic in lauding the bravery of the colored troops , who had carried so handsomely the work which Birney had assaulted that morning . General Grant had not heard from Meade since early in the morning , and feeling somewhat anxious , he now made his way out of the fort , mounted his horse , and rode over to Deep Bottom , at which point he could communicate by a field telegraph line with the commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general received a telegram at Deep Bottom from the President , saying : ( ( I hope it will lay no constraint on you , nor do harm any way , for me to say I am a little afraid lest Lee sends reinforcements to Early , and thus enables him to turn upon Sheridan. * It will be seen that the President did not pretend to thrust military advice upon his commander , but only modestly suggested his views . The general replied immediately : ( ( Your despatch just received . I am taking steps to prevent Lee sending reinforcements to Early , by attacking him here ) ) ; and closed with an account of the successes of the morning . CONSTERNATION IN RICHMOND . BUT little farther progress was made during the day north of the James . General Grant remained on the north side of the river until after 4 P. M. , and then returned to City Point so as to be within easy communication with Meade , and to determine what should be done the next day . It was long after midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then only to catch a nap of a couple of hours . General Grant set out again for Deep Bottom at five o'clock the next morning ; and after consulting with Butler , and finding everything // quiet on the part of the enemy , he decided that no movement should be made on that front at present , and returned to City Point , starting back at 8 A. M. The activity this day was on Meade 's front . His troops moved out two miles west of the Weldon Railroad , and captured two redoubts , a line of rifle-pits , a gun , and over one hundred prisoners . Three times that afternoon the enemy made vigorous efforts to recover the works which had been captured by Butler 's army the day before , for they commanded the shortest road to Richmond . So important was the movement deemed for their recapture that Lee was present in person with the troops who made the attack . Every assault , however , was handsomely repulsed . Meade threw up a strong line of intrenchments from the Weldon Railroad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left was now only about two miles from the South Side Railroad . In these movements no little advantage had been gained . The ability to carry strong works had encouraged the troops , and the circle had been closed in still further upon Lee , both on our right and left , and the effect upon the enemy was shown by the consternation and excitement which prevailed in Richmond . From refugees , scouts , and other sources of information it was learned that there was a feeling prevailing among the inhabitants that the city would very soon have to be abandoned . Provostmarshal 's guards seized all available citizens , young and old , and impressed them into the service , whether sick or well-government clerks , and even the police , being put in line in Butler 's front . All business was suspended , as there was no one left to attend to it ; publication of the newspapers was interrupted ; shops were closed ; and alarm-bells were rung from all the churches . In the meantime the enemy was having no rest in the Shenandoah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry , under Torbert , had an engagement with the enemy 's cavalry , which it completely routed , capturing eleven guns and a number of wagons , and taking over three hundred prisoners . Our loss did not exceed sixty men . The enemy was pursued about twenty-six miles . STANTON VISITS GRANT . IN the forenoon of October 16 a steamer arrived from Washington , having aboard the Secretary of War , Mr. Stanton ; the new Secretary of the Treasury , Mr. Fessenden , who had succeeded Chase ; and several of their friends . They came at once to headquarters , were warmly received by General Grant , and during their short stay of two days were profuse in their expressions of congratulation to the general upon the progress he had made with his armies . They wanted to see as much as they could of the positions occupied by our forces , and the general proposed that they should visit the Army of the James that afternoon , and offered to accompany them . He telegraphed Butler to this effect , and the party started up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursion , and was much interested in the conversations which occurred . Stanton did most of the talking . He began by saying : ( ( In getting away from my desk , and being able to enjoy the outdoor air , I feel like a boy out of school . I have found much relief in my office from the use of a high desk , at which I at times stand up and sign papers . It has been said that the best definition of rest is change of occupation , and even a change of attitude is a great rest to those who have to work at desks . ) ) He then gave a graphic description of the anxieties which had been experienced for some months at Washington on account of the boldness of the disloyal element in the North and the emissaries sent there from the South . Sheridan 's name was mentioned in terms of compliment . General Grant said : ( ( Yes ; Sheridan is an improvement upon some of his predecessors . They demonstrated the truth of the military principle that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only starts in time . ) ) Stanton laughed heartily at the general 's way of putting it , and remarked : ( ( But in all retreats I am told that there is another principle to be observed : a man must not look back . I think it was Caesar who said to an officer in his army who had retreated repeatedly , but who afterward appeared before his commander and pointed with pride to a wound on his cheek : ( Ah ! I see you are wounded in the face ; you should not have looked back . ) ) ) At Aiken 's Landing General Butler joined the party , and pointed out the objects of interest along his lines . Mr. Stanton then spoke with much earnestness of the patient labors and patriotic course of the President . There had been rumors of disagreements and unpleasant scenes at times between the distinguished Secretary of War and his chief ; but there evidently was little , if any , foundation for such reports , and certainly upon this occasion the Secretary mani // fested a genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character which amounted to positive reverence . Mr. Stanton wore spectacles , and had a habit of removing them from time to time when he was talking earnestly , and wiping the glasses with his handkerchief . His style of speech was deliberate , but his manner at times grew animated , and he presented a personality which could not fail to interest and impress all who came in contact with the great Carnot of our war . The next morning , after breakfast , the Secretary 's party went by the military railroad to our lines about Petersburg , where they had pleasant interviews with Meade , Hancock , Warren , and Parke , and returned in the afternoon to City Point . After some further consultation with General Grant about the military situation , particularly in the valley of Virginia , the Secretary , with his friends , started back to Washington . HOW GRANT RECEIVED THE NEWS FROM CEDAR CREEK . SHERIDA* had been ordered to Washington to consult with the authorities there ; and as no immediate attack on the part of the enemy was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early , however , had concentrated all the troops that could be brought to his assistance , and was determined to make a desperate effort to retrieve the defeats which he had suffered in the valley . Sheridan arrived in Washington on the 17th , and started back to his command at noon of that day . The next day he reached Winchester , which was twenty miles from his command , and remained there that night . At three o'clock on the afternoon of October 20 General Grant was sitting at his table in his tent , writing letters . Several members of the staff who were at headquarters at the time were seated in front of the tent discussing some anticipated movements . The telegraph operator came across the camp-ground hurriedly , stepped into the general 's quarters , and handed him a despatch . He read it over , and then came to the front of the tent , put on a very grave look , and said to the members of the staff : ( ( I 11 read you a despatch I have just received from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news , for we felt that the telegram was of importance . The general began to read the despatch in a very solemn tone . It was dated 10 P. M. the night before : u1 have the honor to report that my army at Cedar Creek was attacked this morning before daylight , and my left was turned and driven in confusion ; in fact , most of the line was driven in confusion , with the loss of twenty pieces of artillery . I hastened from Winchester , where I was on my return from Washington , and joined the army between Middletown and Newtown , having been driven back about four miles . ) ) ) Here the general looked up , shook his head solemnly , and said , ( ( That s pretty bad , is n't it ? * A melancholy chorus replied , ( ( It 5 too bad , too bad ! ) ) ( ( Now just wait till I read you the rest of it , ) ) added the general , with a perceptible twinkle in his eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here took the affair in hand , and quickly united the corps , formed a compact line of battle just in time to repulse an attack of the enemy 's , which was handsomely done at about 1 P. M. At 3 P. M. , after some changes of the cavalry from the left to the right flank , I attacked with great vigor , driving and routing the enemy , capturing , according to last reports , fortythree pieces of artillery and very many prisoners . I do not yet know the number of my casualties or the losses of the enemy . Wagontrains , ambulances , and caissons in large numbers are in our possession . They also burned some of their trains . General Ramseur is a prisoner in our hands , severely , and perhaps mortally , wounded . I have to regret the loss of General Bidwell , killed , and Generals Wright , Grover , and Ricketts , wounded - Wright slightly wounded . Affairs at times looked badly , but by the gallantry of our brave officers and men disaster has been converted into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . . . . ) ) ) By this time the listeners had rallied from their dejection , and were beside themselves with delight . The general seemed to enjoy the bombshell he had thrown among the staff almost as much as the news of Sheridan 's signal victory . In these after years , when this victory is recorded amongthe most brilliant battles of the war , and ( ( Sheridan 's Ride ) ) has been made famous in song and story , one can not help recalling the modesty with which he spoke of his headlong gallop to join his command , and snatch victory from defeat . He dismissed it with the sentence : *I hastened from Winchester , where I was on my return from Washington , and joined the army . . . . * Further news brought the details of the crushing blow he had struck the enemy . General Grant , in referring to the matter at headquarters , commented at great length upon the triumph which Sheridan had achieved , // and the genius he had displayed . He telegraphed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disaster into a glorious victory stamps Sheridan what I have always thought him-one of the ablest of generals ) ) ; and said in conversation : ( ( Sheridan 's courageous words and brilliant deeds encourage his commanders as much as they inspire his subordinates . While he has a magnetic influence possessed by few other men in an engagement , and is seen to best advantage in battle , he does as much beforehand to contribute to victory as any living commander . His plans are always well matured , and in every movement he strikes with a definite purpose in view . No man would be better fitted to command all the armies in the field . ) ) He ordered one hundred guns to be fired in honor of Sheridan 's decisive victory . GRANT 'S NARROW ESCAPE AT HATCHER 'S RUN . EVEN before the completion of Sheridan 's victory in the valley , Grant was planning another movement for the purpose of threatening Lee 's position , keeping him occupied , and attacking his communications . On October 24 he directed both Meade and Butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 27th . Meade was to move against the &amp;uth Side Road , while Butler was to go to the north side of the James again , and make a demonstration there against the enemy . Early on the morning of October 27 General Grant , with his staff , started for the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac , and rode out to the front , accompanied by Meade . The morning was dark and gloomy , a heavy rain was falling , the roads were muddy and obstructed , and tangled thickets , dense woods , and swampy streams confronted the troops at all points . The difficulties of the ground made the movements necessarily slow . After a conference with Warren , Grant and Meade rode over to Hancock 's front , and found that the enemy was there disputing the passage of Hatcher 's Run at Burgess 's Mill . His troops were strongly posted , with a battery in position directly in front of the head of Hancock 's corps , and another about eight hundred yards to our left . Unless this force on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our lines could not be thrown forward for the purpose of making the contemplated movement . Prompt action had to be taken , and General Grant rode out farther to the front , accompanied by General Meade and the members of their staffs , to give orders on the spot . As this group of mounted officers formed a conspicuous target , the enemy was not slow to open upon it with his guns ; and soon the whistling of projectiles and the explosion of shells made the position rather uncomfortable . One of our orderlies was killed , and two were wounded . It looked at one time as if the explosion of a shell had killed General Meade , but fortunately he escaped untouched . A little speck of blood appeared on Hancock 's cheek after the bursting of a shell . It was probably caused by a bit of gravel being thrown in his face . Staff-officers were sent forward to the principal points to reconnoiter . General Grant , as was his constant practice , wished to see the exact position of the enemy with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , called on one aide-de-camp , Colonel Babcock , to accompany him , and rode forward rapidly to within a few yards of the bridge . Before he had gone far a shell exploded just under his horse 's neck . The animal threw up hi* head and reared , and it was thought that he and his rider had both been struck , but neither had been touched . The enemy 's batteries and sharp-shooters were both firing , and the situation was such that all the lookers-on experienced intense anxiety , expectAng every moment to see the general fall . The telegraph lines had been cut , and the twisted wires were lying about in confusion upon the ground . To make matters more critical , the general 's horse got his foot caught in a loop of the wire , and as the animal endeavored to free himself the coil became twisted still tighter . Everyone 's face now began to wear a still more anxious look . Babcock , whose coolness under fire was always conspicuous , dismounted , and carefully uncoiled the wire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle , evidently thinking more about the horse than of himself , and in the most quiet and unruffled manner cautioned Babcock to be sure not to hurt the animal 's leg . The general soon succeeded in obtaining a clear view of the enemy 's line and the exact nature of the ground , and then , much to our relief , retired to a less exposed position . The advance of the troops was impeded by the dense underbrush , the crookedness of the Run , the damming of its waters , the slashed trees , and other obstacles of every conceivable description which had been placed in the line of march . It was seen by afternoon that an assault under the circumstances would not promise favorable results , and it was abandoned . The success of the operation depended upon reaching the objective point by // a rapid movement ; and as unexpected obstacles were presented by the character of the country and by the weather , instructions were now given to suspend operations , and Grant and Meade rode to Armstrong 's Mill . General Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right of Hancock 's corps ; but it was soon found that there were no troops between our party and the enemy , and that if we continued along this road it would probably not be many minutes before we should find ourselves prisoners in his lines . There was nothing to do but to turn around and strike a road farther in the rear . This , as usual , was a great annoyance to the general , who expressed his objections , as he had done many a time before , to turning back . We paused for a few minutes , and tried to find some cross-cut ; but there was not even a pathway leading in the proper direction , and the party had to retrace its steps for some distance . General Grant was now becoming anxious to get in telegraphic communication with Butler , and he rode on to a point on the military raiProad called Warren Station , reaching there about half-past five * . M. After giving some furthei* instructions to General Meade , he started back to City Point . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just taken place , and said : ( ( To-day 's movement has resulted , up to the time I left , only in a reconnaissance in force . I had hoped to accomplish more by means of it , but it has at least given us a much more thorough knowledge of the country , which , with its natural and artificial obstacles , is stronger than any one could have supposed . This movement has convinced me of the next course which will have to be pursued . It will be necessary for the Army of the Potomac to cut loose from its base , leaving only a small force at City Point and in front of Petersburg to hold those positions . The whole army can then swing completely round to the left and make Lee 's present position untenable . ) ) There was some doubt in his mind as to what action the enemy would take in front of Hancock and Warren . News came that evening , showing that Lee had assumed the offensive , and that severe fighting had occurred . Between four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Hancock and Warren , and made a vigorous assault on the right and rear of Hancock 's corps ; but Hancock struck the enemy in flank , threw him into confusion , and captured nine hundred prisoners and a number of colors . The enemy was unable to reform his troops , and did not attempt any further offensive operations . This day 's engagement is known as the battle of Hatcher 's Run . Butler had sent a force to the north side of the James ; but the enemy retired to his intrenched works whenever our troops advanced against him , and only one attack was made . These operations closed for the winter the series of battles in front of Petersburg and Richmond , cold weather and the condition of the roads rendering further important movements impracticable . While there was much skirmishing and some spirited fighting , no more general engagements occurred until spring . DISCUSSING THE ( ( MARCH TO THE SEA . ) ) SINCE my return from Atlanta a number of communications had been exchanged between Grant and Sherman regarding the contemplated ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had visited Hood 's headquarters , and at different points on his trip had made speeches , assuring the people that Atlanta was to be retaken , that Sherman 's communications were to be cut , and that his retreat would be as disastrous as Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow . When General Grant received the reports of these speeches , which were widely published in the Southern newspapers , he remarked : ( ( Mr. Davis has not made it quite plain who is to furnish the snow for this Moscow retreat through Georgia and Tennessee . However , he has rendered us one good service at least in notifying us of Hood 's intended plan of campaign . ) ) In a short time it was seen that Hood was marching his army against the railroad which constituted Sher* man 's only line of communication with his base of supplies . Sherman now called for reinforcements , and Grant directed all recruits in the West to be sent to him . On September29 Hood crossed the Chattahoochee River . This was the day on which Grant made the movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preventing Lee from detaching any troops . There were some who thought Grant manifested unnecessary anxiety on this subject : but it must be remembered that just one year before , Lee had sent Longstreet 's whole corps to northern Georgia ; that it was not discovered until it was well on its way to join Bragg 's forces against Rosecrans 's army at Chickamauga ; and that it accomplished the reverse which occurred to our arms on that field . Besides , Grant 's mind seemed // always more concerned about preventing disasters to the armies of his distant commanders than to the troops under his own personal direction . He was invariably ge*1-erous to others , and his self-reliance was so great that he always felt that he could take ample care of himself . General Rawlins had now returned , and it was very gratifying to see that while his health was not restored , it was greatly improved . He still , however , was troubled with a cough . The day he arrived General Grant saw that he was still far from well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earshot , " I do not like that cough . ) ) When Rawlins learned the plan proposed in regard to Sherman 's future movements , he was seriously opposed to it , and presented every possible argument against it . Rawlins always talked with great force . He had a natural taste for public speaking , and when he became particularly earnest in the discussion of a question , his speech often took the form of an oration ; and as he grew more excited , and his enthusiasm increased , he would hold forth in sten*orian tones , and emphasize his remarks with vehement gesticulation and no end of expletives . As I had been sent to confer with Sherman , and had studied the subject in all its bearings , and felt absolute faith in the success of the movement , I became the chief spokesman in its favor ; and many evenings were occupied in discussing the pros and cons of the contemplated movement . The staff had in fact resolved itself into an animated debating society . The general-in-chief would sit quietly by , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehemence of the debaters . One night the discussion waxed particularly warm , and was kept up for some time after the general had gone to bed . About one o'clock he poked his head out of his tent , and interrupted Rawlins in the midst of an eloquent passage by crying out : ( ( Oh , do go to bed , all of you ! You re keeping the whole camp awake . ) ) Rawlins had convinced himself that if Hood kept his army in front of Sherman to bar his progress , Sherman , having cut loose from his base , would not be able to supply himself , and his army would be destroyed ; and that , on the other hand , if Hood turned north , Sherman 's army would be unavailable , and it would be difficult to assemble sufficient force to prevent Hood from reaching the Ohio River . Against this view it was argued that if Hood decided to confront Sherman to prevent his passage across the country , Sherman would always have a force large enough to whip him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compel him to keep his forces concentrated , while Sherman could throw detachments out from his flanks and rear and obtain plenty of provisions in a country which had never been ravaged by contending armies ; or , if Hood started north , that Sherman could detach a large force to send against him , which , when reinforced by the troops that could be hurried from Missouri and other points , would be amply able to take care of Hood , while Sherman , with the bulk of his army , could cut the Confederacy in two , sever all its lines of communication , and destroy its principal arsenals and factories . In fact , Sherman was so far away from his base , with only a single-track railroad , liable constantly to be broken by raiders , that it became a necessity for him either to fall back or to go ahead . Rawlins was possessed of an earnest nature , and devoted to General Grant 's interests , and his urgency against this movement was not a factious opposition , for he bad really convinced himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this case General Grant , as usual , paid but little attention to the opinions of others upon a purely military question about the advisability of which he really had no doubt in his own mind . WHY GRANT NEVER HELD COUNCILS OF WAR . IT was suggested , one evening , that he instruct Sherman to hold a council of war on the subject of the next movement of his army . To this General Grant replied : ( ( No ; I will not direct any one to do what I would not do myself under similar circumstances . I never held , what might be called formal councils of war , and I do not believe in them . They create a divided responsibility , and at times prevent that unity of action so necessary in the field . Some officers will in all likelihood oppose any plan that may be adopted ; and when it is put into execution , such officers may , by their arguments in opposition , have so far convinced themselves that the movement will fail that they can not enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their actions by the feeling that a victory would be a reflection upon their judgment . I believe it is better for a commander charged with the responsibility of all the operations of his army to *w*ult his generals freely but informalf* , get their views and opinions *nd then make up his mind what actii " n to take , and act accordingly . // There is too much truth in the old adage , ( Councils of war do not fight . ) ) ) HOW THE MARCH TO THE SEA WAS CON CEIVED AND EXECUTED . ON October 6 General Grant went to Washington to consult with the authorities in regard to the raising of additional troops , and to learn upon what number of reinforcements he could rely before deciding definitely upon the course to be pursued in the West . Hood had now turned north , and was operating against Sherman 's railroad in his rear . Sherman had left the Twentieth Corps in Atlanta to hold that place , and had marched with the rest of his army as far north as Marietta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now crossing the Coosa , twelve miles below Rome , bound west . If he passes over to the Mobile and Ohio road , had I not better execute the plan of my letter sent by Colonel Porter , and leave General Thomas with the troops now in Tennessee to defend the State ? ) ) The situation was such , however , that General Grant disliked to see a veteran army like Sherman 's marehing away from Hood without first crippling him ; and he replied to Sherman the next day ( the 11th ) , saying , among other things : . . . If you were to cut loose , I do not believe you would meet Hood 's army , but would be bushwhacked by all the old men , little boys , and such railroad guards as are still left at home . Hood would probably strike for Nashville , thinking by going north he could inflict greater damage upPn us than we could upon the rebels by going south . If there is any way of getting at Hood 's army , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . . . It will be seen from the above despatch that Grant 's military foresight had enabled him to predict at this time precisely what afterward took place as to Sherman 's army not meeting Hood 's . At the same hour at which Grant wrote this despatch at City Point , Sherman had sent a telegram to him , saying that he would prefer to start on his march to the sea , and that he believed Hood would be forced to follow him . A little before midnight on the 11th , Grant sent Sherman the following reply : ( ( Your despatch of to-day received , if you are satisfied the trip to the sea-coast can ' be made , holding the line of the Tennessee firmly , you may make it , destroying all the railroad *outh of Dalton or Chattanooga , as you think* hest. ) * General Sherman informed re long after the war that he did not receive this reply , which was accounted for , no doubt , by the fact that his telegraph wires were cut at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote in his ( ( Memoirs , ) ) in 1875 , that November 2 was ( ( the first time that General Grant ordered the march to the sea . ) ) General Grant was now actively engaged in making additional preparations for Sherman 's reception on the sea-coast . He directed that vessels should be loaded with abundant supplies , and sail as soon as it became known that Sherman had started across Georgia , and rendezvous at Ossabaw Sound , a short distance below the mouth of the Savannah River . On October 29 , finding that the movement of the troops ordered from Missouri to Tennessee was exceedingly slow , the general directed Rawlins to go in person to St. Louis , and confer with Rosecrans , the department commander , and see that all haste was made . The Secretary of War now sent a telegram to General Grant , wishing him to reconsider his order authorizing the march to the sea . In fact , the President and the Secretary had never been favorably impressed with Sherman 's contemplated movement , and as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different plan . Grant felt that as there was so much hesitation in Washington , he ought once more to impress upon Sherman the importance of dealing a crushing blow to Hood 's army , if practicable , before starting on his march eastward , and telegraphed him accordingly . To this Sherman replied that if he pursued Hood he would bave to give up Atlanta , and that he preferred to strike out for the sea . At 11 : 30 A. M. November 2 , before Grant had received the above reply from Sherman , he sent another message to that officer , closing with the words : " I really do not see that you can withdraw from where you are to follow Hood without giving up all we have gained in territory . I say , then , go as you propose . ) ) Several additional despatches were interchanged , and at 10:30 P. M. , November 7 , Grant telegraphed Sherman : ( ( I see no present reason for changing your plan ; should any arise , you will see it ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything here favorable now . Great good fortune attend you . I believe you will be eminently successful , and at worst can only make a march less fruitful of results than is hoped for . ) ) The telegraph wires were soon after cut , and no more despatches could // GRANT UNDER FIRE AT FORT HARRISON . // be sent . It was not until the 15th that Sherman was entirely ready to move . On the morning of that day Atlanta was abandoned , and the famous march to the sea was begun . Extracts from the correspondence between the general-in-chief and the distinguished commander of the armies of the West , and the views expressed by them regarding the conception and execution of this memorable movement , are given in some detail in order to correct many erroneous impressions upon the subject . Over-zealous partizans of General Grant have claimed that he originated and controlled the entire movement ; while enthusiastic admirers of Sherman have insisted that Grant was surprised at the novelty of the suggestion , and was at first opposed to the march , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce Grant to consent to the campaign . The truth is that the two generals were in perfect accord in this , as in all other movements undertaken while Grant was in supreme command of the armies . These two distinguished officers acted in entire harmony , and the movement reflects lasting credit upon both . Long before Sherman 's army started upon his Atlanta campaign it was clear to Grant and others with whom he discussed the matter , that after that army reached a point in the interior of the South too far from its base to maintain a line of supplies , communication would have to be opened up with the sea-coast , and a new base established there . Sherman , however , is entitled to the exclusive credit of the plan of cutting loose entirely from his source of supplies , moving a long distance through the enemy 's country without a base , and having in view several objective points upon which to direct his army , his selection to depend upon the contingencies of the campaign . It was the same sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of Vicksburg . General Grant said more than once : " I want it to be recorded in history that Sherman is entitled to the entire credit of the detailed plan of cutting loose from his base at Atlanta and marching to Savannah . As to the brilliancy of the execution of the plan on Sherman 's part there can never be any dispute . The plan was entirely in accord with my views as to the general cooperation of our widely separated armies . ) ) He approved the suggestions at the start , in spite of the doubts expressed by army officers about him and by some of the authorities at Washington ; he encouraged and aided Sherman in all the work of preparation ; and when the time for final action came he promptly gave his consent to the undertaking . About the only point upon which their military judgments differed was as to the action of Hood , Grant being firmly convinced that he would turn north , while Sherman thought their armies might encounter each other .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
