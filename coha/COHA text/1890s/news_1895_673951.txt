txt John C. New , who is supposed to have charge of the Harrison Presidential boom , and to know more of the ex-President 's intentions than any other man , not even excepting Mr. Harrison himself , arrived late yesterday afternoon on the steamship Berlin , after a two months ' vacation in Europe . Mr. New came down the gangplank smiling benignly , and swinging with a jaunty air a silk umbrella- He wore a new silk hat , and a brown overcoat . There were a dozen or more newspaper reporters at the dock to meet him , and he at once found himself almost surrounded . He threw up his hands , waved his umbrella , and stepping backward nearly fell over a barrel of molasses . Having regained his equilibrium , he said : " I have nothing to say , not a word , not a single word . It is altogether too hot to attempt to say anything in this shed . " Mr. New emphatically refused to . answer . , any questions . " I will tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of you come to the Gilsey House at 8 o'clock to-night . I shall be there , and I will talk to you then . " At the Gilsey House at 8 o'clock the clerk said Mr. New was not there , had not been there , and was not expected . Neither could Mr. New be found at any other hotel . Inquiries continued to pour in at the Gilsey House , and the clerk was driven nearly frantic answering questions about Mr. New and protesting that he was not in the house . A telegram came from Mr. New later in the evening . It was addressed to the G lsey House , and was dated from Jersey City at 8:35 o'clock . It merely said Mr. New had been summoned home to Indianapolis . S-5 , 11a 73 . C ? oxacsEGG - HARBOR ' HARBOR CITY , N. J. , Aug. 12 . ? Congressman John T. Gardner , when asked to-day if he is a candidate for the Gubernatorial nomination , said : " I have not given the matter very serious consideration , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion if it comes my way . " It is reported that United States Senator Sewell is favorable to Congressman Gardner 's candidacy . Already the Atlantic County Republicans are in the field for Gardner . The United States Weather Bureau in this city is going to employ rockets to warn ships when on dark nights there are evidences of approaching hurricanes or severe storms . that are likely to prove dangerous to shipping . The idea originated with Elias E. Dunn , local weather forecast official , and he has been authorized by ' Willis Moore , the new chief of the department , to put the plan in operation . Hereafter , when storms are brewing in the nighttime , and it becomes important to give warning before I the tempest breaks , there will be a display of rockets from the lofty tower on the Manhattan Life Building , in which the Weather Bureau is situated . Mr. Dunn has also suggested to Prof. Moore to employ rockets at rignal stations in the region of the orange groves of Florida and other places remote from telegraph stations where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approach of cold waves . Mr. Dunn said yesterday : " Rockets are being manufactured now for our use . They are to be made without sticks and constructed so as not to tiurst until they are high up in the air . They will be sent up from the top of this building , and they will be visible from a great distance away . They will be made on the mortor bomb plan . They will look like balls of fire as they shoot up to a great height , and when they explode they will make an intense light . " They will be used , of course , only at night . By employing them I hope to supplement greatly our ordinary system of weather signals . Arrangements have been made also to have coast line steamships fly hurricane signals from their masts , so that as they proceed along the coast they will carry the warning to vessels bound up the . coast . Among the booth that will carry these signals are those of the United States Government . In order to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ignorance of approaching storms , signals will be displayed at Perth Amboy . Sandy Hook , City Island , North Brothers ' Island and Bath Beach .
