txt The report which Mr. PERRY BELMONT carries to Chicago of his observations in Europe upon the question of bimetallism will not be encouraging to silver men  --  even to those who are looking forward to the day when all the great powers shall unite in making their dream a reality . Mr. BELMONT has discovered no sign of any importance or significance that international bimetallism is even remotely possible . He finds ; however , that both the business men and the scientific economists of Europe are thoroughly acquainted with the one weak/spot in our system of finance . That is what Mr. CLEVELAND happily called " the endless chain . " They see plainly that there is plenty of gold to be had by the United States on reasonable terms for any reasonable purpose . But they also see that no amount of gold would be sufficient to meet the demand for the perpetual redemption of notes that can never be paid . Were our Government to require to-morrow enough gold to pay off the entire $400,000,000 of demand notes that have been issued , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gold could be had without trouble . But no amount of gold will fill a bottomless bucket . Mr. BELMONT has some hope , for which we confess we can see no ground , that the Chicago Convention can be induced to declare for the final payment of the greenbacks and the Treasury notes , and the maintenance of the gold standard until international bimetallism shall have been obtained . Undoubtedly the payment of ' Lye demand notes in gold would make the maintenance of the gold standard extremely easy , and would enable us to place our currency upon an absolutely sound and stable basis . That , unfortunately , is precisely what the majority at Chicago do not want . It is well , however , that they should have the truth placed before them .
