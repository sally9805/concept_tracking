" During the first period ( from the time of arrival in France until joined by Franklin and Lee ) , in a manner the whole of the artillery , tents , arms and other stores for the campaign of 1777 were procured by me ; the ships engaged to transport them to America , and actually loaded or ready to load with them , and as skilful and gallant a corps of artillery and engineers of family and connections every way honorable , engaged to go out with the stores as ever ( I confidently say ) embarked in any enterprise whatever . Though my contracts with them may have been considered as beyond the powers I was vested with , and an error in me , this by no means lessens the abilities and character of those gallant officers , or the importance of the supplies obtained partly by my engagements with these officers and their connections in France . It is with pleasure I find that those of them who were employed and served in America have fully justified the character given of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patrons , and that they have shown themselves in the opinion of Congress deserving of higher ranks than what I contracted with them for . At the same time I can not forbear saying that the personal distresses and chagrin which others of them have undergone equally affect me . " The appeal was made in vain . Mr. Deane died in great poverty , at Deal , in England , August 23 , 1789 . His accounts remained unsettled until 1842 , when the money due him was paid by Congress to his heirs , thus establishing the justice of the claim . It requires more than human ability to always judge correctly of the events in which we take part . Our forefathers thought that the man who entered into contracts for service from foreign officers so failed in his duty that he deserved censure and a recall from his post . Mr. Deane himself died apparently ignorant of the greatness of the service he had rendered mankind . In his published papers I find no mention of Lafayette . We of to-day looking back a hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that to Lafayette and his associates we owe a lasting debt of gratitude . Let us for a moment pay a passing tribute to the memory of a man who , by securing the assistance of such allies , made possible our existence as a nation . THE KISS OF CHILDREN .

It stirs our hearts , till memory sings Of our lost innocence and takes Us by the hand - that childlike clings To hers - along her paths , and makes Us nobler for the truth , that breaks The dream the kiss of children brings . // By Liwy Al . Salmon . 0 HN STUART MILL has written , " On all great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , if * of its discussion in periodical if one judges by the frequency literature , falls into the category of great subjects , and another word with reference to it may therefore not be out of place . The subject is one that looms up so prominently in the foreground in most households that there is danger of forgetting that it has a past as well as a present . Yet it is impossible to understand the present condition of domestic service without comprehending in a measure the manner in which it has been affected not only by its own history , but also by the history of domestic em ployments . It is equally impossible to forecast its future without due regard to this historic past . This consideration of the historical aspects of the subjects demands first a cursory review of the changes in household employments resulting from the inventions of the latter part of the eighteenth century . This change , unlike many others , came apparently without warning . At the middle of the last century steam was a plaything , electricity a curiosity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive powers . From time immemorial the human hand , unaided except by the simplest machinery , had clothed the world . Iron could be smelted only with wood , and the English parliament had seriously discussed the suppression of the iron trade as the only means of preserving the forests . But during the last third of the century the brilliant inventions of Hargreaves , Arkwright , Crompton and Cartwright had made possible the revolutionizing of all forms of cotton and woolen industries , Watt had given a new motive power to the world , the uses of coal had been multiplied and soon after its mining rendered safe , while a thousand supplementary inventions had followed quickly in the train of these . There had dawned a new era of inventive genius that was to rival in importance that of the fifteenth century . The immediate results of these inventions was seen in the rapid transference of all processes of cotton and woolen manufactures from the home of the individual weaver and spinner to large industrial centres , the centralization of important interests in the hands of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results previously accomplished . But the factory system of manufactures that has superseded the domestic . system of previous generations has not been the product of inventions alone . It has been pointed out by Hon. Carroll D .. Wright that while these inventions have been the material forces through which the change was accomplished , other agencies co-operated with them . These cooperating influences have been physical , . as illustrated in the discoveries of Watt ; . philosophical , as seen in the works of Adam Smith ; commercial , or the industrial supremacy of England considered as a result of the loss of the American colonies ; and philanthropical , or those connected with the work of the Wesleys , John Howard , Hannah More and Wilberforce . All these acting in conjunction with the material force - invention - have operated on manufacturing industries to produce the factory system of today . It is , indeed , because the factory system is the resultant of so many forces working in the past that it touches in the present nearly every great economic , social , political , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions have been intended primarily to lessen household labor , this era of inventive activity has not been without its effect on household employments . A hundred years ago the household occupations carried on in the average family included , // in addition to whatever is now ordinarily done , every form of spinning and weaving cotton , wool and flax , carpet weaving and making , upholstering , knitting , tailoring , the making of boots , shoes , hats , gloves , collars , cuffs , men 's underclothing , quilts , comfortables , mattresses , and pillows ; also , the making of soap , starch , candles , yeast , perfumes , medicines , liniments , crackers , cheese , coffeebrowning , the drying of fruits and vegetables , and salting and pickling meat . Every article in this list , which might be lengthened , can now be made or prepared for use out of the house of the consumer not only better but cheaper by the concentration of capital and labor in large industrial enterprises . Moreover , as a result of other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary household many forms of hard and disagreeable labor . The use of kerosene , gas , natural gas and electricity for all purposes of lighting and to a certain extent for heating and cooking , city and village water-works , plumbing , heatsupplying companies , steam cleaning for furniture and wearing apparel , the sewingmachine and other labor-saving contrivances , city and village sanitation measures including the collection of ashes and garbage , are in nearly every instance the results of modern business enterprise . These facts are familiar , but the effects more easily escape notice . The change from individual to collective enterprises , from the domestic to the factory system has released a vast amount of labor formerly performed in the house by women , with three results ; - either this work has been diverted to other places , or into other channels , or has become idle . The tendency at first was wholly in the former direction . The house spinners and weavers became the spinners and weavers in factories , and later the home workers in other lines became the operatives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women were employed in larger numbers until in several places and in several occupations their numbers exceed those of men . One illustration of this is found in Massachusetts , where by the census of 1885 it was found that in eight towns in the State , one of them Lowell , the number of women employed in manufacturing industries was greater than the number of men . Ten years ago a weaver in Lawrence complained , " One of the evils existing in this city is the gradual extinction of the male operative . " In 1885 in Massachusetts women predominated in fifteen occupations , including those for the manufacture of buttons and dress-trimmings , carpetings , clothing , cotton goods , fancy articles , hair-work , hosiery and knit goods , linen , mixed textiles , silk and silk goods , straw and palm-leaf goods and worsted goods . This fact has materially changed the condition of affairs within the household of the laborer and also that of other classes . Under the domestic system of manufacturers nearly all women spent a part of their time in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of food and clothing in connection with their more active household duties . When women were employed in factories the division of labor made necessary a readjustment of work so that housekeeping duties were performed by one person giving all of her time to it instead of by several persons giving part of their time . The tendency of this was at first naturally to decrease the number of women partially employed in household duties and to increase the demand for women giving all their time to domestic work . This readjustment of work in the home and in the factory brought also certain other changes that have an important bearing . One illustration is found in the New England factory . The first employ*s were the daughters of farmers , tradesmen , teachers and professional men of limited means , women of sturdy , energetic New England character . They were women who in their own homes had been the spinners and the weavers for the family , and had sometimes eked out a slender income by doing the same work in their homes for others disqualified for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in character were opened to women their places // were taken in factories by Irish immigrants , as these in turn have been displaced by the French Canadians . All these changes in the personnel of factory operatives have meant that while much labor has been taken out of the household that remaining has been performed by fewer hands , and that women of foreign nationalities have been pressed into household service . Another and later result of the change from the domestic to the factory system was the diversion of much of the labor at first performed by women within the household into entirely different channels . The anti-slavery agitation beginning about 1830 , enlisted the energies of many women , and the discussions growing out of it undoubtedly were the occasion for the opening of entirely new occupations to them . Oberlin College was founded in 1833 and Mount Holyoke Seminary in 1837 , thus forming the entering wedge for the entrance of women into higher educational work . Medical schools for women were organized and professional life made possible , while business interests came to attract the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the household was found in philanthropic work . The administration of nearly all charities came under the control of women who were , as a rule , without business training or experience , and often influenced largely by their sympathies . It was perhaps owing to this fact that so much of the work in this 4irection was crude and emotional , and has required revision during our own generation . But a large part of the labor thus released by mechanical inventions and labor-saving contrivances became in time idle labor . By idle labor is meant not only absolute idleness but labor which is unproductive and adds neither to the comfort nor to the intelligence of society . Work that had previously been performed within the home without money remuneration came to be considered unworthy of the same women when performed for persons outside the pale of their own household and for a fixed compensation . The era of the so-called fancy-work , which includes all forms of work in hair , wax , leather , beads , rice , feathers , cardboard and canvas , so offensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this labor released from necessary productive processes . It was a necessary result , because some outlet was necessary for the energies of women ; society as yet demanded that this outlet should be within the household , and the mechanical instincts were sl*rong while the artistic sense had not been developed . It is an era to be looked upon not with derision , but as an interesting phase in the history of the evolution of woman 's occupation . Still another channel for this idle labor was found in what has been called " intellectual fancy-work "  --  in literary clubs and classes that occupied the time and gave at first only the semblance of an education and culture , though many of them became in time a stimulus for more thorough scholarly work . The era of inventions and resulting business activity has therefore changed materially the condition of affairs within the household . Before this time all women shared in preparing and cooking food ; they spun , wove and made the clothing and were domestic manufacturers in the sense that they changed the raw material into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting change in the system of manufactures , as has been seen , necessarily affected household employments . The change has been the same in kind , though not in degree , as has come in the occupations of men . In the last analysis every man is a tiller of the soil , but division of labor has left only a small proportion of men in this employment . So in the last analysis every woman is a housekeeper who " does her own work , ** but division of labor has come into the household , as well as into the field , though in a more imperfect form . It has left many women in the upper and middle classes unemployed , while many in the lower classes are too heavily burdened ; in three of the four great industries which absorb the energies of the majority of women working for remuneration , manufacturing , work in shops , and teaching , the supply of workers is greater than the // demand , while in the fourth , domestic service , the reverse is the case . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first three classes have necessarily been taken from the fourth class . It has been well said " through the introduction of machinery ignorant labor is utilized , not created . " Many who under the old order would have been able to live only under the most primitive conditions , and whose labor can be used under the new order only in the simplest forms of manufacturing , would be entirely unfit to have the care of an ordinary household in the present complex form . One more effect must be noted of this transference of many forms of household labor to large centres through the operation of inventive genius . It has been seen that many women have thus been left comparatively free from the necessity of labor . The pernicious theory has therefore grown up that women who are rich or well-to-do ought not to work , at least for compensation , since by so doing they crowd out of remunerative employment others who need it . It is a theory that overlooks the historical fact that every person should be in the last analysis a producer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a curse and not a blessing , and it does not take into consideration the fact that every woman who works without remuneration or for less than the market rates thereby lowers the wages of every person who is a bread winner . This revolutionizing of manufacturing processes through the substitution of the factory for the domestic system has thus rendered necessary a shifting of all forms of household labor . The division of labor here is but partially accomplished , and out of this fact arises a part of the friction that is found in household service . It has been seen how great a change has been made in the character of household employments through the inventions of the past century . A change no less important has taken place in the nature of household service by virtue of the political revolutions of the century , acting in connection with certain economic and social forces . A study of the history of service in. this country shows that it has had three distinct phases . During the early colonial period service of every kind was in general performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this fact . Lechford tells us in his " Note-book " of Elizabeth Evans , who came from Ireland to serve John Wheelright , minister , for three years , her wages being three pounds per annum and passage paid , and of Margery Batman , who after five years of service in Charlestown was to receive a she-goat to help her in starting in life . Robert Galton advertises in the Bos/on News Le//er " a few boy servants indentured for seven years and girls for four years . ' ' Peter Kalm writes of Pennsylvania in 1748 : " A servant maid gets 8 /Js or 10 /Js a year ; these servants have their food besides their wages , but must buy their own clothes , and what they get of these they must thank their master 's goodness for . " He adds that it was cheaper to buy indented servants , since " this kind of servants may be got for half the money and even for less ; for they commonly pay 14 /s , Pennsylvania currency , for a person who is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements of " a parcel of likely men and women servants , lately imported and to be sold cheap . " By the Virginia code of I 705 , every woman servant on her discharge was entitled to receive fifteen bushels of Indian corn and forty shillings or the value in goods . George Alsop , himself a redemptioner , . gives in " A Character of the Province of Maryland , " the form of indenture used7 and says in regard to their general treatment , " for know , that the servants here in Maryland of all Colonies , distant or remote plantations , have the least cause to complain either for strictness of servitude , want of provisions or need of apparel . " Daniel DeFoe , whose own niece is said to have come to this country as a redemptioner , complains of the scarcity of servants in England because " Our Plantations carry off every year very great numbers of servants , especially of the female sex ; of which they tell us that there has , within thirty years past // above 200,000 gone away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They bind themselves for five years more or less . " The colonization of the new world gave opportunity for the transportation and subsequent employment in the colonies of large numbers of persons who as a rule belonged to a low class in the social scale . Many of those who thus became the servants of the community had indeed been in their own country beggars and vagrants , even criminals and political prisoners . These redemptioners who paid their passage to this country by selling themselves into service were found in all the colonies , though more numerous in the Southern and Middle colonies than in New England . In Virginia and Maryland they apparently outnumbered negro servants until the latter part of the seventeenth century . " Mrs. Johnson 's Captivity " tells of apprenticed servants bound for a term of years who were sold from ships in Boston as late as 1730 , while the general trade in bond white servants lasted until the time of the Revolution , and in Pennsylvania until this century . Samuel Breck writes from Philadelphia under date of August i , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsterdam and I purchased one German Swiss for Mrs. Ross and two French Swiss for myself . . . . I gave for the woman $76 , which is her passage-money , with a promise of $20 at the end of three years if she serves me faithfully ; clothing and maintenance of course . The boy had paid twenty-six guilders toward his passage-money , which I agreed to give him at the end of three years ; in addition to which I paid fifty-three dollars and sixty cents for his passage , and for two years he is to have six weeks schooling each year . " Some of these redemptioners and many their descendants became in time wealthy and prominent members of their communities , especially at the North , but for a long time they were generally considered the offscourings of English cities and formed a distinct class in the social order lower than their masters or employers . It was from their number that the class known as the poor whites came , - a class so degraded that they were despised even by the negroes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to all belonging to the class and to the designation applied to them . A second phase came about the time of the Revolution , when at the North the indented servants as a class were gradually supplanted by free laborers and at the South by negro slaves , who inher*ted with large interest the reproach attached to redemptioners . The social chasm that had existed at the North between employer and employ under the system of bond servants disappeared . The free laborers , whether employed in domestic service or otherwise , were socially the equal of their employers , especially in New England and in the smaller towns . They belonged by birth to the same section of the country , probably to the same community ; they had the same religious belief , attended the same church , sat at the same fireside , ate at the same table , . and had the same associates as their employers . They were in every sense of the word " help . " A survival of this condition of affairs is seen to-day in farming communities , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , the social chasm became impassable as negro slavery entirely displaced white labor . This democratic condition seemed especially noteworthy to European travellers . Harriet Martineau in planning for her American journey was perplexed by the difficulty of securing a travelling companion . " It would never do , as I was aware , to take a servant , to suffer from the proud Yankees on the one hand and the debased slaves on the other . " On . arriving here she found " the study of domestic service a continual amusement , " and what she saw " would fill a volume . " But she appreciated the difference between the service here and in the old world , and writes : " I had rather suffer any inconvenience from having to work occasionally in chambers and kitchen and from having little hospitable designs frustrated than witness the subservience in which the menial class is held in Europe . In England servants have been so long accustomed to this subservience , it is so completely the established custom for the mistress to regulate their manners7 // their clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat them any better . Mistresses who obstain from such regulation find that they are spoiling their servants ; and heads of families who would make friends of their domestics find them little fitted to reciprocate the duty . In America it is otherwise ; may it ever be so ! . . One of the pleasures of travelling through a democratic country is the seeing no liveries . No such badge of menial service is to be met with throughout the States except in the houses of the foreign ambassadors at Washington . " She then gives illustrations to show " of how much higher a character American domestic service is than any which would endure to be distinguished by a badge . " De Tocqueville also found that " the condition of domestic service does not degrade the character of those who enter upon it , because it is freely chosen , and adopted for a time only ; because it is not stigmatized by public opinion and creates no permanent inequality between the servant and the master . " Mrs. Trollope in her famous " Domestic Manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in organizing a family establishment in Ohio is getting servants , as it is called getting help , ' for it is more than petty treason to the Republic to call a free citizen a servant . " Francis J. Grund in " The Americans , " writing in 1837 , says , " There are but few native Americans who would submit to the degradation of wearing a livery , or any other badge of servitude . This they would call becoming a man 's man . But on the other hand , there are also but few American gentlemen who would feel any happier for their servants wearing coats of more than one color . The inhabitants of New England are quite as willing to call their servants helps ' or domestics as the latter repudiate the title of master ' in their employers . " William Cobbett in " A Year 's Residence in the United States , " writes in 1828 , " The man ( servant ) will not wear a livery any more than he will wear a halter round his neck Neither men nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will take special care not to call themselves by that name . " Nearly every European traveller of the period mentions with surprise and generally with approbation this democratic spirit of equality between employer and " help . " This condition of democratic service at the North and slavery at the South continued in both sections from the time of the Revolution until about the middle of this century . Between 1850 and 1870 four important political changes revolutionizes the character of domestic service and have introduced the third period in the history of the subject . The first of these was the Irish famine in 1845 . Previous to this time the emigration to this country from Ireland had been small , averaging not more than twenty thousand annually between 1820 and 1846 . In the decade previous to the famine the average number of arrivals had been less than thirty-five thousand annually . In 1846 the number was 51 ,  - -  752 , and this was more than doubled the following year , the reports showing rod ,  - -  536 arrivals in 1847 . In 1851 the number of arrivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number has fluctuated , but between fifty and seventy-five thousand persons annually came to this country from Ireland . A large proportion of these immigrants , forty-nine per cent , during the last decade , have been women who were classed as " unskilled laborers . " Two occupations were open to them . One was in factories where as manufacturing processes became more simple unskilled labor could be utilized . The Irish immigrants soon displaced New England women , who found , as has been seen , new opportunities for work of a higher grade . The second occupation open to the Irish was household service . Here physical strength formed a partial compensation for lack of skill and ignorance of American ways , and the Irish soon came to form a most numerous and important class engaged in domestic employments . A second important European change influencing the condition of domestic service was the German Revolution of // emigration from Germany had been insignificant , fewer than fifteen thousand coming to this country annually between 1830 and 1840 . In 1840 , owing to  |p0-litical  reasons , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accession of Frederick William IV. , in whom all political interests were centered , it fell to 15,291 . It soon became evident that the hopes raised by the accession of the new monarch were without foundation , and emigration rapidly increased until the number of emigrants coming to America reached nearly seventy-five thousand in r847 . During the year of the Revolution the number decreased , but the failure of the cause of the revolutionary party , and the political apathy that followed , again increased the move ment towards America . This reached its climax in 1854 , when the sympathies of the Court had been openly expressed during the Crimean War in favor of Russian despotism . During this year the number of Germans arriving in this country was 215,009 - a number equalled but once since that time , although the number has averaged nearly a hundred and fifty thousand annually during the last decade . A large number of these immigrants have been women , the proportion of women emigrating from Germany being greater than from any other foreign country except Ireland . The ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Germans being second only to the Irish as regards the number and proportion engaged in this occupation . A third political influence affecting the question was the establishment of treaty relations between the United States and China in 1844 . This fact and the discovery of gold in California in 1848 and the building of the Union Pacific railroad in 867T69 opened the doors to the immigration of considerable numbers of Chinese . Many of these found their way into domestic service , and on the Pacific Coast they have become formidable competitors of other nationalities in this occupation . These political and economic conditions in Europe and the breaking down of the long-established customs in Asia have thus since 1850 brought to this ' country large numbers of men and women who have performed the household ' service previously given by native born ' Americans . The presence of the Irish in the East , the Germans in the West , . the Scandinavians in the North-west and the Chinese on the Pacific Coast has thus introduced a new social as well as economic element at the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employer ' and employ the class line that was only faintly drawn in the early part of the century between employer and " help " has been changed into a caste line which ' many employers believe it to their interest to preserve . The native born American fears to lose social position by coming into competition with foreign labor . While this change has been taking place at the North in the character of the service owing to political conditions in the old world , a similar change has taken place at the South growing out of the abolition of slavery in 1863 . The negroes who had previously performed all domestic service for their personal expenses have since then received for the same service a small remuneration in money . This fact prevents now as effectually as during the slavery period any competition in domestic service on the ' part of native-bern white employis . An indication of these various changes in the condition of domestic service is " seen in the history of the word servant . As used in England and in law at the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any employ , and nc* odium was in any way attached to the ' word . This is indicated by the various definitions given in the early dictionaries7 servant being defined as " a man or woman that serves another . " Some interesting illustrations of this early use of the word are found also in colonial literature . Thus Thomas Morton in his " New Canaan " says : " In the month of June Anno Saletis 1622 it was my chance to arrive in the parts of New England with thirty servants and provisions of all sorts fit for a plantation . " Governor Bradford in his " History of Plymouth " speaks of " Captaine Wolaston* // and with him * or * more of some eminence who brought with them a great many servants , with provisions and other implements fit for to begine a plantation . " Governor Winthrop cites from an original " Narrative concerning the settlement of New England " under date of 1629 " This year there went hence 6 shippes with 1,000 people in them to Massachusetts , having sent two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against their coming , to the charge of ( at least ) so , ooo 1. : these Servants through Idleness and ill Government neglected theire huilding and plantinge of Come , so that if those 6 shippes had not arrived the plantation had been broke and dissolved . " The same use of the word is apparently found a number of times in the list of the Mayflower passengers . In a copy of a servant 's indenture given in Neil 's " Virginia Carolorum " the person making the contract promises that he will perform for his master and his heirs " all such Labours and businesses as he or they shall think good to use and ymploy him . " But five things led to gradual disuse of the word . First , the reproach connected with the word through the character and social rank of the redemptioners ; second , the fact that when the redemptioners gave place at the South to negro slaves the word servant was transferred to this class and this alone was sufficient to prevent its application to whites third , the 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth , the literal interpretation of the preamble of the Declaration of Independence ; and fifth , the new social and political theories resulting from the introduction of French philosophical ideas . At the North the word " help " as applied especially to women superseded the word servant , while at the South servant was applied only to the negro . From the time of the Revolution therefore until about r85o the word servant does not seem to have been generally applied to white persons of American birth in either section . The dictionaries of the period begin to use the word servant as synonomous with slave , and as correlative with master . J. F. D. Smith writes in his " Tour in the United States , " " However , although I now call this man ( a backwoodsman of the Alleghanies ) my servant , yet he himself never would have submitted to such an appellation , although he most readily performed every menial office and indeed every service I could desire " ; while Fanny Kemble says in her " Journal of a Residence in Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white person performing any of the offices of a servant " ; then follows an amusing account of her white maid 's being taken for the master 's wife , and her almost unavailing efforts to convince them to the contrary . Every European traveller notes the invariable use of the word " help . " Since the introduction of foreign labor at the middle of the century the word servant has again come into general use as applied to white employ*s , not , however , as a survival of the old Colonial word , but as a reintroduction from Europe of a term signifying one who performs so-called menial labor and restricted in its use , except in a legal sense , to women who perform domestic service . The present use of the word has come not not only from the almost exclusive employment of foreigners in domestic service , but also because of the increase of wealth and consequent luxury in this country , the growing class divisions and the adoption of many European habits of living and thinking and speaking . Nothing better illustrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political privileges . The French constitution of 1791 was preceded by a bill of rights declaring the equality and brotherhood of men , but a disqualification for the right of suffrage , indeed the only one , was " to be in a menial capacity , viz. , that of a servant receiving wages . " The Constitution of 1795 after a similar preamble states that the citizenship is suspended " by being a domestic on wages , attending on the person or serving the house . " The Constitution of 1799 has a similar disqualification , but is more consistent in that it has no bill of rights . During the revolutionary movement in Austria the Hungarian Diet at its session in 1847 - 48 passed an act providing that the qualification for electors should be - " To have attained the age of twenty years ; Hungarians by birth or naturalized ; not under // guardianship , nor in domestic service , nor convicted of fraud , theft , murder , etc . " The Declaration of Independence declaring all men free and equal in the presence of African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continental Europe . The qualifications for suffrage in England also excluded domestic servants , but there was no discrimination against them as a class . These simple historical facts are one explanation of the unwillingness of American girls to engage in work stigmatized by an offensive term applied to no other class of laborers . All of these political movements have had a direct and apparent influence on the condition of domestic service , and even in the use of the term applied to those who engaged in it . But other political influences more subtle and possibly more far-reaching in their effect have been at work . Our loose naturalization laws , and the determining of the qualifications for the right of suffrage by as many standards as there are states , have made the enormous number of men coming to this country annually an easy prey to scheming politicians and demagogues . The labor vote , the Irish vote , the German vote have been flattered and sought by party managers until the wageearning man feels that " like Atlas of old he carries the world on his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , his wife and daughter believe that something of the burden rests on them . The democratic tendencies of the country , the political practices of the day , have everywhere broken down the high wall of separation between employer and employl . They are subversive even in the household of that patriarchal relationship that has been driven from every stronghold but this . While the political movements of the century have thus changed the personnel of domestic servants in America , the development of the material resources of the country has affected their status . Before the present century employ*s of every kind were in a sense stationary . This was due partly to a system of indenture which bound a servant for seven , five , or four years , and to the system of slavery which bound the servant for life ; partly to the system of apprenticeship which made the servant a member of the family of his master ; partly to the custom prevailing in country districts and small towns for unmarried workmen in all industries to board with their employers , and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication between different sections of the country . There was no mobility of labor as regards either employment or place of employment- a fact true alike of domestic service and of other occupations . But this condition of affairs gradually changed . As has been seen , indented servants disappeared and every employ was free to break as well as to make an engagement for service . The establishment of the factory system of manufactures and the consequent substitution of mechanical for skilled processes of labor broke down the system of apprenticeship , and workmen in every occupation , except domestic service , ceased to be members of the families of their employers . A mobility of labor was made possible such as could not have been secured under the old system . At a later time the great era of railroad development and similar enterprises gave opportunity for a certain mobility as regards place of employment . The tide of Western immigration due to the discovery of gold and the cheapness of Western land caused much shifting of labor among the non-capitalist class , and this was increased as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of companies to encourage foreign immigration with the object of developing the material resources of of the country was another weight in the scale in favor of greater mobility of labor as regards both place and employment . The abolition of slavery removed the last important legal barrier against perfect mobility . All of these industrial movements have been important factors in changing the condition and character of domestic service . It is true in a general sense that every great change in economic conditions affects all other occupations , even those not primarily concerned in it . But domestic service has been affected in // certain specific ways . The employ who disliked housework hut to whom no other occupation had been open , could go into factories and mills since no time was consumed in learning the simple processes of mechanical work . Every invention formed the basis for a new occupation . Domestic service had a hundred competitions in a field where before the era of inventions it stood alone . Moreover these new occupations required little skill , no preparation , and possessed the charm of novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase of competition and consequent lowering of passenger rates , often influenced families immigrating to the West to take with them their trusted employees . The same fact made it possible for women seeking new employments to go from place to place in ways unthought of in the early part of the century . In view of these changed and changing economic conditions it may be said that that immobility of labor which has seemed to some economists so great an obstacle to the industrial advancement of women practically has ceased to exist in the case of domestic service . Industrial development has been carried so far that the problem has come to be how to make this form of labor not more mobile but more stable . One illustration of this is found in the fact that when nearly 700 domestic employ*s were recently asked how many of them had ever been engaged in any other occupation twenty-seven per cent . replied they had . The mobility as to place of labor was even greater . It was found that sixty-eight per cent . of the number did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement is below the truth , as it does not take ' in account the number of changes made within a single state , and considers only ' one change from place of birth to present residence . In studying the question of domestic service , therefore , the fact can not be ' overlooked that certain historical influ ences have affected its conditions ; that political revolutions have changed its per -- sonnel and industrial development its mobility . It is as impossible to dream of restoring the former condition of household service as it is of household employments . Any attempt made to secure a change for the better in the present condition of domestic service must meet with failure if it does not take into con* consideration its historical aspects .
