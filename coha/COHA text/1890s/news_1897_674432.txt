txt The opponents of the Greater New York charter were given an opportunity to be heard before the joint Cities Oommittee of both branches of the Legislature in the Senate Chamber tonight . There was not the attendance expected , but few speakers appearing . The Hon. William E. Rogers and Silas Clark of the Union League Club of New York City , Corporation Counsel Scott , and Secretary Pinney of the Greater New York Charter Commission were among those present . Sir . Rogers was the first to be heard . He said he desired first to submit a written protest against the charter on behalf of the New York City Fire Department . In his argument to-night he said he would confine himself particularly to the matters of assessment and valuation . Appearing on this question for the Union League Club , he represented an organization of men as representative of the progress , intelligence , business activity , and public spirit of the City of New York ae . any body within its limits . They were , therefore entitled to some consideration . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard to-night , as it was the first time any citizen of New York bad had an opportunity to be heard , either by the commission or any one connected with the act . Alleged Unjust Taxation . The matter of assessment and taxation , he said , had been very lightly treated in the report of the commission , notwithstanding the fact that it was the one subject of greatest interest to the people . He then read the tax clause of the charter , and declared that it imposed a grossly unjust burden upon New York City . He quoted exhaustive statistics concerning taxation in New York and Brooklyn . The assessed valuation of real estate in New York City , he said , was 51,700,000,000 , and the value of personal property $300,000,000 . The tax rate was $2.14 on each $100 , and the taxes raised $46,000,000 . In Brooklyn , the total assessed valuation was $588,000,000 , and the rate varied from $2.70 to $4.25 in different parts of the city , an average of $2.90 . This was upon an assessment of 75 to SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted Senator McCarren . " In no case has it been over 70 per cent . of the value . " " I am prepared to demonstrate , if you will permit me , that it is more often 80 than it is 70 per cent , " was Mr. Rogers 's reply . The equalized valuation of the two cities , Mr. Rogers placed at $3,555,000,000 . The joint budget of the two cities was $60,869 , - 000 . Upon the basis of the assessments of 1896 , New York 's share of this joint budget would be $50,887,000 and Brooklyn 's $9,920,000 . This was an Increase of about $6,000,000 for New York , and a decrease of 56,000,000 for Brooklyn . With all the improvements to the annexed district , he believed that the increased burden upon the City of New York would be 812,000,000 . These figures , he said , were frankly admitted by the Brooklyn League , and it was urged by them , as an argument in favor of annexation , that Brooklyn was to escape some of her taxes . Another Objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it contained no adequate repeal of existing laws . His attention was called by Senator Stranahan to the general repealing act . " Well , that does n't repeal anything . " " Oh ! I do n't know . I rather think it does , " was Senator Stranahan 's observation . Mr. Rogers suggested as a relief from this alleged unjust burden upon New York City that each borough should raise and bear its own burden of disbursement . This system , he said , he had explained in detail before the commission . In closing , he suggested that there was a general sentiment against the proposed measure in New York . " Well , there did not appear , to be when the people voted upon the question , " remarked Senator Grady . " But that was merely an expression in favor of annexation . " " Would you like to have them vote again ? " queried Senator Grady . " I wish we might vote upon this bill , " answered Mr. Rogers . " I am perfectly willing that you should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political possibilities of the concentration of so great a proportion of the population of the State under one government . It was quite possible , he said , what had happened would happen again , and that the great city might get into the power of one man . " We may get another Tweed , a Kelly , or a Croker , " he said , " and such a possibility is worthy your serious consideration . " Asked why it was that so few appeared to oppose the bill , he said the question forced the answer which he blushed to give , that it appeared useless , as everything was understood to be cut and dried . Method of Advertising . Secretary Pinney of the Charter Commission replied briefly to Mr. Rogers . He admitted a defect in the prov ! sion for advertising . He said that Assemblyman John E. Hennessy had called attention to the provisions that all public notices should be advertised in The City Record and the corporation newspapers , and a single provision near the close that the corporation newspapers should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pinney said that it had been the intention that the Brooklyn papers should publish only such matters as concerned that borough . They had found that the official advertising was now being done in that city at a cost of about $100,000 a year , and thought that as economical an arrangement as could be made . After the adjournment , an amendment was agreed upon , which clearly stated that the Brooklyn papers should publish only such matters as concerned that borough , and all other matters would be published in the City Record . The committee will give another hearing next Tuesday night , when the hearings will be closed .
