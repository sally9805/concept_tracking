txt ThOSE persons who are accustomed to observe the movements of public opinion have had occasion to note of late a curious tide which is setting our nation towards warfare . Although by our happy isolation from the field of European rivalries and by the traditions of our forefathers ours is the one great state the world has ever known which seems to be appointed for the offices of peace , we appear to be driven by a blind impulse into modes of thought and action concerning our neighbors that will , if unchecked , bring us to contests of arms . A trifling fracas with Chili , a mere police court case ; an insurrection in Cuba ; a matter of fishing in Newfoundland ; of sealing in Alaska , or the confused questions of a wilderness boundary in South America , each and all serve to set the dogs of war baying up and down the land . These questions may be settled by the judicious conduct of a few men who are in actual control of our foreign relations , and others as they arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the political wheel we may lose this protection and find in the high places men who , like the others , have eaten of the insane root , and who will welcome the opportunity for this nation to enter , as these madmen phrase it , " on a larger sphere of action . ' * The most dangerous manifestation of these belligerent people is the talk about national honor in which they are indulging . When a man begins to rave about honor we may be pretty sure that he is about to do some irrational , most likely disreputable , deed . The word is like an oath , serving , with its vague yet large meaning , to intoxicate the fancy . So , too , with states , the things they do for honor 's sake are likely to prove very dishonorable . In the distinct modern sense of the word , an hondrable // man or state is one that keeps all contracts , guards against offending neighbors , considers the weak , sacrifices personal desires for the good of others . Such an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sacred honor , for with right living the consideration does not arise . The advance which the world has made in unselfishness , an advance which is fairly betokened by the passing out of this old notion of a peculiar possession in the way of dignity which had to be guarded by arms , is the key to the moral gain of this century ; and when we observe the notion resurging in the minds of men we may reasonably expect to find that it marks one of those temporary reversions in the prevailing on-going of moral development which so often occur in the realm of mind as well as in that of organic forms . Here as elsewhere in the field of human conduct our modern insight into the life of our ancestors in the form of man and brute gives us much which may serve to guide us to the remedies which may be applied to ills such as we are considering . I shall therefore undertake a brief enquiry into the natural history of the combative motive . The first steps in the way upward from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed in the ancient time , led the beings to recognize in the world about them means of gratifying their desires . At once , in many and various series of adaptation , the bodies and minds of the creatures were swiftly modified for this task of seizing upon coveted objects , food or mates , as the case might be . For a long period , measured indeed in geologic ages , infinite invention is displayed in providing the forms with the means whereby they might win the coveted things ; all the early stages of mental development were accomplished in this rude exercise of the primitive selfishness . The monuments of this struggle are to be found in the vast array of devices which served to ensure swift motion along with the capacity to clutch and rend the enemy . As the males of the species have in general not only to capture food , but also to wrestle with their rivals in sexual combats , they are usually more militant than the females *nd much better armed for such work . In the ancestry of man we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generations in which this principle of combat was the guide in the advance of life . Gradually as the ascent in the scale of living is accomplished // there comes in an element of sympathy which is in time to qualify and in later time to overturn the original dominion of selfishness . At first this sympathy arises from the care of the parents , usually the mother alone , for the offspring . The young are recognized , at least for the period of immaturity , as neither rivals nor prey but as objects of a tender solicitude . With this the family is instituted and life enters on the beginnings of the new , the moral , order . Among the higher vertebrates , the birds and mammals , the only creatures in which we recognize a distinct spiritual kinship with ourselves , the family bond readily passes by a widening process to that of the tribe or even to a wider tie which unites all the individuals of the species in a limited sympathetic union , such , for instance , as is shown among our pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the members of the group , even those of the most diverse varieties , a desire to serve their fellow-being . The incoming of the sympathetic motive in the species below the level of man in no wise arrests the ancient deep rooted motive of combat . The altruistic tendency is , apart from the mother with her young , very little manifested . It is but a germ , but one that is destined in time to overshadow the ancient lower growth . Still all through the mammalia , which , for the reason that they are direct or relatively near kinsmen of ourselves , especially interest ns , we find the body energetically directed towards new devices in the way of arms and the mind varying in its instincts , so that the weapons may be put to the best use . In fact , nowhere else in the animal kingdom , except among certain insects and the predatory birds , are the mental and physical provisions for war so well organized as in the mammalia ; it is a class of warriors , and with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes in man . When in the ascending series we attain to the level of the group of the apes and thereby approach nearer to the estate of man , we find the shape of the animals departing in many ways from that of the lower mammalian forms . The creatures are long limbed , usually rather frail bodied ; the claws begin to take on the characteristics of our own finger nails , and the only instruments of attack are the teeth which , though sometimes formidable instruments , are not specially adapted for use as weapons in anything like the measure in which they are in many other groups of // this class . Naturalists hold the apparently well founded opinion that the race of man has not been derived from any of the existing genera of the monkey tribe ; but it is accepted that the gorilla is , though in a collateral branch of the family tree , not far removed from the main stem of our common succession . Although this animal has a reputation , perhaps well deserved , for combative humor and is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared with that of the true beast of prey . The condition of the lowest savages also indicates clearly that man is derived from a series which for ages had been working on quite other lines of development than those which give success through combat . The gains had been mainly won in the paths of extending sympathies in the enlarging social order , the fact that nearly all the species of monkeys are commonly social or tribal clearly suggests that even before the institution of the human kind the species were winning upward , by the strength due td the dev.eloping mind and especially to the sympathetic side of the spirit . The gorilla , though perhaps liker to men than any other infra-human being is in his surly unsocial humor best reckoned as a degradation so far at least as his ways are concerned . The sum of these considerations is that in the last steps on the way to man the brute was already upon other paths of advance than those which are opened by mere assailing powers . In the lowest forms of man which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lack of assailing instruments , and the quick sympathies of the monkeys . The creature lives by his wits rather than by his physical power , such strength as he has arises from his sympathetic associations with his fellows and from his mental ability , which makes him an inventor of tools . Among the first of these contrivances are arms . With the possession of arms , even those made of stone , this eminently frail , and , for his weight in combat , singularly incompetent creature , at once became endowed with a capacity for assault which had before no parallel on this earth . The forms of hurled spears , including the arrows and the javelins , gave him the singular capacity of attacking from a distance ; the mental ability which enabled him to effect a union with his fellows , and even in the earlier stages of his military art to develop strategic combinations , lifted his hunting and war exploits to a much higher state of efficiency than had been attained by any of the earlier forms of life . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to change the nature of man 's food . In his earlier state , except for an occasional resort to insects and other easily obtainable animal food , he had been a vegetarian ; in fact , as before remarked , this weakness of the anthropoid series makes any other kind of life impossible . Missile , weapons , and the primitive contrivances for fishing , by enabling him easily to capture animals , led this creature away from the ancestral habits of subsistence and gave him access to the more profitable because the more nourishing products of the chase . As all the primitive peoples and many who had attained to the high grade savagery , such as our American Indians , are instinctively cannibals , the motives of the earliest form of war were doubtless mingled with those which animate the hunter . The defeated enemies were not only deprived of their personal property and expelled from valued hunting groands , but they were eaten . In the frequent extremity of starvation in which all the earlier folk were likely to find themselves once or more each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important source of food . In these brutal conditions , when the human population of a country was divided into small tribes or clans , united among themselves by the tie of a recognized common blood , the state of constant warfare doubtless served to bring the process of natural selection into very effective operation . The gens which had the most valor , was the most provident , the best organized , which , in a word , had attained the greatest advance , would be the most likely to prevail in the struggle , to dominate the land , and thus to gain a firm place ; while the relatively weak clans would receive the curse which in the ancient pre-moral order awaited the incompetent . Here alone in the series of man do we find war making for human advance . So long as the vanquished were utterly destroyed , their bodies eaten and their goods appropriated by the conquerors , the selective effect of war was great and the rude engine worked in certain directions for human advancement . In the next stage of the npgoing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomad , becomes a soil tiller and retains only so much of the ways of the hunter as may afford sport , we find war taking on a changed aspect . In the earliest stages battles with men differed little in spirit from those with wild beasts , it was // only one chase with a difference in the quality of the game . The lives of the men were given up to the occupation which in itself bred the humor of war iu every member of the tribe . With the pastoral life and yet more with the life of the soil tiller the burthen of men 's labor and of their culture passed from the occupations of a warlike to those of a peaceful sort . No longer were their days given np to hunting beasts and men . They were now devoted to labors which led their spirits in a general way from warlike pursuits . In no case , however , so far as we know , was it permitted to any of these early flock carers or soil tillers to give over war ; in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by tribes of a lower estate who hungered for their wealth ; the result was that the men of peace needed to retain and develop in a more formal way than their ancestors the spirit and arts of war . In this condition the organization of the higher modern military systems began . It is not to be supposed that any sedentary people , because of their generally peaceful occupations , ever at once gave up the humor of conquest which had been bred in them for ages of fierce contention . On the contrary , these shepherds and soil tillers were always subjected to the outbreaks of an ancient fury , in the manner of other domesticated animals who have been in a like manner tamed . In this organized state , however , war became occasional . It rests on an accepted basis of pretexts , in which honor comes to have an important place , at least in the minds of the more civilized parties of these contests . The subjugated peoples are no longer normally eaten ; they are adopted into the nascent state as slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in this second state of the warlike motives the greater part of the beneficial selection action which was effective in the lower estates of man is lost . If the more civilized of the contestants wins , the lower folk are usually not destroyed ; their people may be adopted into the victors ' race . if the savage prevail , the extinction of a civilization sets back progress in a way which is often recorded in history or in , the monuments of vanquished states . In a certain way the work is selective , but it operates for degradation especially for the reason that all the time , strength , and means that a civilized state spends on war are spent for destructive work and not for the constructive labor which it is its task to do . So // far as the selection is accomplished it is likely to lead to these retrograde developments which are so well recognized in organic forms and which are also manifested in the realm of mental and social organization . With the further advance of the greater states to their modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated ; yet the essential characteristics of the business remain the same as those we find in the simpler agricultural communities . The complication is one of methods as shown in the management of the outbreaks and in the conduct of the military operations . No longer can aggrieved borderers set up some private war ; the right to begin contests is lodged in a central authority ; conquered peoples are not , as of old , eaten , or , as later , enslaved ; they are usually taxed to pay the costs of the victor 's campaign . Conquered territory , except it be that of the lower races , is rarely annexed by the successful state ; when this is done it is usually the excuse of some previous ownership , of consanguinity of folk , or dominating strategic considerations . Private property can uot be taken ; the right , dearest to all soldiery , of sacking a town taken by seige , is denied ; the enemy 's wounded must be tenderly cared for and his prisoners guarded from harm . The cross-bearing flag which guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; surgeons and nurses are deemed sacred . To this preposterous complexion have we come at last . It is self-evident that with the modern confusion of brutality and beneficence in warfare the struggles between armed hosts has lost all trace of its original selective value and that with this loss has gone the old reason , in the logic of nature , for the contention between human societies . There remain to be examined two arguments for the continuance of war which deserve consideration ; these are that war serves to awaken and maintain in individual man qualities of mind which can not be gained in peaceful pursuits , and that it enables the highly organized , powerful and , therefore , presumably better peoples to extend their influence over the less successful races in a manner in which they could not expect to do so by the arts of peace . We shall briefly examine these propositions . While it may be granted that valor , i. e. , in this case the motive that makes a man willing to kill his neighbor at the risk of being killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in // a state , there is absolutely no reason to believe that its presence there is in any measure a product of warfare . On the other hand , the facts , as well as more general considerations , go to show that affirmed peace affords the best possible school for the type of courage which the military serviceof modern times demands . Savages with their endless training in war rarely show anything like the fine bravery which is common to the well-bred citizens of a civilized folk , who have never seen , much less taken part in , combats . More trustworthy soldiers have never been known than those of our civil war , when not one in a thousand had slain a man until it became their duty to do so . Moreover , modern warfare calls on troops , not for the rush of battle , but for a steady business-like duty where hot blood counts for little , but where the methodical , painstaking laboriousness of civilization counts for much , is indeed the telling element of the campaign . War has indeed become in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the best qualities of the citizen and none of those of the savage* The writer has had some opportunity for noting the kind of men who are serviceable in war ; so far as his observations go the bully is worthless , for he is pretty certain to be out of the ranks in a crisis . So , too , the rather higher grade fellow who trusts to his physical prowess , who has proved his valor to his own satisfaction in personal difficulties , is likely , when a little out of condition , to evaporate in a fight . The quiet countryboy , accustomed to farm labor or , better still , the well trained clerk or student who has had a fancy for out of door sports , is the man for the trials of the march or camp , as well as for the incidental though rare moments of battle . This is the general experience of many soldiers who have had occasion to observe the qualities of men who complete the rank and file of armies . it is a noteworthy fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a clerk , entered on the lowest grade and won his way by soldierly qualities of the highest grade to the head of his corps . The facts thus seem to go dead against the notion derived from the ancient conditions of warfare when personal combats decided the fate of campaigns , that we need to keep up the habit of combat . Granting for argument 's sake that war serves to develop the spirit and latent talent for warfare in men who would not otherwise know that they were born soldiers , certain evident questions have to be // met as to the profit of the process , even on the assumption that military capacity is a thing to be sedulously cultivated . In the first place , we may ask what reason there is for believing that these aroused capacities and accomplished trainings will be by inheritance fixed in the blood of a people ? The naturalist has to answer that there is no reason why any such result should be accomplished and best founded argument is that the opposite result would be attained . It is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , are , with rare if any exceptions , not inherited ; therefore any amount of training in military affairs would not be likely to breed capacity for such work in a people . Moreover , as war is certain to bring about a high average of death among those who are successful in the craft , death which usually comes in the reproductive period , the action of this natural ( or artificial ? ) selection is to remove the soldierly strains of blood from the warring folk . It seems not unlikely that the evident decline in the military capacity of France may be due to this incessant sacrifice during the last century of those of her sons who have shown a capacity for warfare . In the next place , the question may be put as to the advantage which may be looked for from the development of martial qualities in a people like our own , who are separated in theory and in fact from the uses of war . If there be anything certain in this world it is that , save for internal strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums and tramplings of new conquests . Wherefore , then , should we turn the attention of our youth from the duties of production to the brutal purposes of destruction ? It may be allowed to the advocates of war that there is a certain development of military capacity to be won by turning the attention of a people to the task of fighting . The things which the people of a great nation think about are likely to be done , for the reason that hosts of able men have the matter on their minds . But among a business folk like our own the martial effects of war are very temporary , as may be seen by the issue of our civil war . Immediately on the disbandment , the soldiers with joyful alacrity returned to their peaceful vocations . They are fond of reviewing the memories of their campaigns , but a set of men less interested in the military theory it would be hard to find . When we hear a man shouting for conflict , it is tolerably certain that he lacks the experience or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Thirty years after the greatest struggle of modern times , the people who waged it are , if anything , less military in spirit than they were before . Therefore , those of our countrymen who are the enemies of peace must not be content with an occasional turn of arms-they must ask that the gates of the temple where they worship shall be always kept open . Their project , for its successful issue , demands that we abandon the gains , both moral and material , which are the product of the theory and situation of our nation , and turn back to the state of affairs in the old world and in other times . It should not be overlooked that war has a distinct fascination to any normally constituted man ; he may detest it as much as the writer does , but the sound of a familiar bugle call , of those notes which have for centuries sung in his blood , will stir him in a strange way with the spirit of action . It should not be assumed that those who protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat ; they are in the position of our ancestors , of earlier times , who set their faces against the degradations which our kind have lived down . Men did not give up private vengeance , or polygamy , or slavery , or the butchering of prisoners on the battle-field , because they disliked these things , but because they knew that the desire for them was wrong . It is for us in this matter to make for good as our ancestors have done . This making will be difficult ; for none of the patent evils of man 's estate are so inwoven with the texture of society of the civilized world as this of militarism . It has a place in literature which is hardly second to love ; it is ingraf ted in the systems of all the great states except our own , and in this sole stronghold of peace there is a large and apparently gaining class that desires to revive the one evil to which the sea and the good sense of our ancestors have formed barriers . The contests with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is to do away with war ; none of them have had such support from that curiously strong motive of our times , the national spirit . All the great states are now possessed with a humor for dominion , the like of which has not been seen since the day when Spain was strong . In all times since nations began to act as coherent bodies , the commercial motive , the desire to extend trade , has had much to do with conquests ; but in this age , when business means so much to // people of the ruling classes , the desire for possessions as a basis for commerce has a greater control of governments than ever before . In this way the interests of business , which in the main work for peace , have a certain influence in favor of those courses of national conduct which lead to wars . It is not likely that this disposition to grasp commercial advantages at the risk of conflict will in the end be seriously harmful ; . n the best sense , business has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motives which lead to the soundest living of which average men are capable it has made for peace even more effectively than has religion : still we have for the present to reckon with the business interests of the great states as operating in many cases for war . This is shown by the conditions of the Turkish question , where Great Britain is compelled by her relations in the East to retain the Mussulman in Constantinople at the price of enmity with Russia , and is likewise compelled to fasten on Egypt , at the cost of strained relations with France . So , too , in the Venezuelan imbroglio , the contention over territory is due to the fact that it is likely to prove the seat of rich gold mines . Wherever we turn we find the nations grasping for the small remainder of the earth which may be had even at the risk of wars , provided the lands promise a future basis for commerce . In this modern national motive , shaped as it is by business interests , we find the last stronghold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of tribute and for the glory that it might bring to the conqueror , which led to the aggrandizement of Rome , has vanished . So , too , the Spanish humor , wherein the lust for gain was mingled with a curious desire for the extension of a religion has disappeared . It is much to have the complications of actions which lead to war so far reduced . It is even more to have the remainder of the influences in a considerable measure dominated by a spirit of trade . Dr. Johnson 's saying that " men are rarely so well employed as in making moneys ' has a wider application than he intended , for it applies to those aggregations of men , the nations , which are now intent on gain in an intense but increasingly rational manner . The true business man avoids litigation , for it limits his trafficking ; the sagacious state has already come to something like the same mind and may be expected soon to be dominated by like considerations . // As the national spirit comes more and more under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound criticism of the waste involved in war and in the endless preparations for conifict . The counting house , the accounting place of our time , will reckon all expenditures on armaments beyond those necessary for the control of the malefactor element , as unprofitable , and take measures to end them . It has evidently come to be the function of trade to lay and affirm the foundations of society ; by so doing it will provide not only the basis for moral and spiritual growth of the nations , but it is likely to bring about the substantial unity of mankind . It may be well held that trade is selfish , but such is the nature of man that we must accept some hedonistic foundation for his work , and on that build , as we may , the higher parts of the edifice . A sound commerce is a better foundation for civilization than the glory of indixidual men , the extension of religions or the vaunting of national importance . It has the advantage that it is the only one of the world-wide motives that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford abetter foundation for amity , but it affects too few men ; moreover , it does not reckon costs , as needs be done on this sphere . In the foregoing glance at the history of the war spirit , inadequate though it is , we have seen reasons for believing that the motive is an inheritance from the remote past of our kind in man and brute . That the pre-human stock of the mammalia from which men came was not fitted in mind or body for rapine , but had been directed toward a subsistence on vegetable food . The invention of arms more effective than those given by nature to the lower beasts , turned the actions of these new made men into violent ways . They became rapacious , preying upon the wild beasts and on each other . With the advance in social organization and the consequent resort to agriculture , these predatores changed their nature ; the chase of wild beasts became the sport of hunting and that of men formal war . In this elaborated shape the contests between peoples lost all value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected . In the new dispensation on which man had entered the survival of the fittest depended on other agents than combats . = It furthermore appears that the continuation of the motive of warfare among civilized peoples may be regarded as a late survival // of one of the ancient bestial motives which were inherited from the lower estate . Many other of these motives have been stamped out or driven into hiding places , but it happens that this , immediately profitable , as it often is , has been glorified by tale and song , and so preserved from the shame to which the prophets have consigned murder , thieving , licentiousness , and other iniquities . So long as the control of governments was in the uneconomic classes of men who had nothing to lose and much to gain by war , the influences were overwhelming for its continuance ; now that the business people are gaining control of the world 's affairs there is reason to hope that the cure is about to come to this ancient and enduring ill . While considerations of trade may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enforced by the enlarged spirit of our time , will be certain to convince business men of the utter unprofitableness of war . As for the curious and menacing uprisings of the war motive in a nation like ours , it seems most reasonable to class them with others of the resurgences of the primal beasts and beastly men on which the students and managers of society have to reckon . We all know that many civilized men , civilized for the greater part of their lives , occasionally fall back into the state of the savage in his orgies , the old sublated demons of the lower life possess them for a time , it may be for their lives . It will be a help to our " jingo " people if we can convince them of the fact that when they have accesses of this fury , when they dream of battlefields and of the glory of the flag that floats over them , they are not moved by true patriotism , but are possessed by one of the hideous lusts which keep us ever in fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind has so marvellously won its way . It will be yet more helpful if our people come to see that when a legislator begins the war dance he therefore proves himself seriously unfit for the business for which he was chosen , in th4 he does not comprehend the nature of civilization or know the blessings which fortune has given our state by exempting it from the curse which afflicts the nations beyond the sea.
