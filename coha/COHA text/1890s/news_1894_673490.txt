txt INSANO IMMIGRANTS . The Superintendent of Immigration recently made a curious discovery in Massachusetts , where it was found that several insane and pauper immigrants , who had been insane when they arrived in this country , were being supported in tho asylums of the State at the expense of the Federal Government , although they had been in this country for nearly a year . These immigrants ought not to have been , admitted , and the admission of them proves that the inspection service at ports of entry has not been what It should be . " All of them , " it is reported , " were persons shown to have been insane when they landed at New-York , Philadelphia , or Boston . " Having been admitted , they should have been sent back at the expense of the steamship companies immediately after the discovery of their condition by the State authorities , but these authorities appear to have preferred to support them in the asylums at the expense of the Federal Government . Such discoveries are interesting to the people of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and otherwise disabled paupers are unloaded every year by European countries , and whose State Board of Charities has sent back to Europe in the last thirteen years 2,007 such paupers who were found in the asylums . The number thus returned last year exceeded 100 , and the cost of shipping them to Europe , as well as the cost of supporting them while they were here , was paid by the taxpayers of New-York . The Superintendent 's discoveries in Massachusetts and the reports of our State Board of Charities should cause an improvement of the inspection service , which is shown to be so imperfect .
