txt A meeting Of the absentees from the caucus will be held to-morrow morning to perfect a permanent organization . Either Senator Flinn of Allegheny or Senator-elect Martin of Phile.delphia will be elected Chairman . The anti-Quay leaders claim that five of those who participated in the caucus will not be bound by its action . They take the position that it was not a regularly constituted gathering and that their votes do not bind them to vote for the caucus nominee . With the exception of four , all the absentees , it is asserted . signed a written pledge binding them to keep away from the caucus . Three of these were prevented from taking part in the meeting by illness or enforced absence from the city , and the fourth declined to sign the paper , although committed to vote against Quay . The pledge follows : " We , the undersigned , members of the Senate and House of Representatives of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania , being impressed with the gravity of the present situation , and desiring to act for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth our views : " Under normal conditions we believe in party regularity and the use of the party caucus to determine party policies and nominations . We believe that a Republican should and will be elected to the rnited States Senate , and as one of the candidates at the present time is overshadowed by grave charges , which , if sustained , would render his election impossible . and as said candidate has alleged that said charges are not honestly made and well founded in fact . but that he is the victim of a political conspiracy to defeat and destroy him . we believe that common fairness demands that this candidate should have full opportunity-to present himself in the Senatorial caucus freed from the damaging accusations now pending in the courts of the Commonwealth against him . And we further believe that undue haste in holding the Senatorial caucus is unwise until the rule returnable in the Supreme Court on the 7th instant has been disposed of . " Entertaining these views , we therefore agree with each other and promise our constituents not to participtate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or denied the - petition of said candidate . " State Chairman Elkin , who managed the Quay campaign , said after the caucus that many of the members who remained out of the meeting had declared their intention of voting for the caucus nominee . He claims that the caucus was regularly and properly called according to the customs and usages of the Republican Party . Mr. Elkin also said that there was a sufficient number of Senators and members of those who did not go into the caucus who will abide by its decision and vote for its nominee to make Quay 's re-election certain . Congressman John Dalzell , who is here aiding the anti-Quay people , says , on the contrary , that it is useless for any one to claim that the action of the 11111 Republicans who attended the caucus undertook to make a nomination for Senator anything other than a Quay Waterloo , and that to be successful the Senator must get twenty votes , either from the Democrats or those who re ( mained from the meeting .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
