txt By a vote that lacked only one of a tie the Brooklyn Board of Education has chosen Goorgiana F. Putnam , an elderly colored woman , to be the head of a department in one of the city 's largest schools . Miss Putnam , who is approaching in years the threescore mark , has been a school teacher in Brooklyn since the war . The appointment of a bead of department for the big new school known as No. 83 , where theyoung ideas of the children of the Twenty-fourth Ward are taught to shoot , was the matter that brought up Miss Putnam 's name . Strange to say . the opposition to Miss Putnam was led by T. McCants Stewart . the young colored lawyer who is supposed to represent his race in the Brooklyn Board of Education and who is one of the local Committee of Three of School No. 83 . The story of the controversy is best told by Mr. Stewart . He explains his own position and the condition of affairs which led to it . " The argument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately took such a turn that people were led to believe that in the controversy the question of color was involved . If the fact that I. a colored man , opposed Miss Putnam 's appointment does not disprove that , then the explanation of the situation of affairs in School No. 83 will . " There are three members of the local committee of that school , Ebon Miller , C. Simis , and myself . Mr. Simis and I stood together in asking that Miss Augusta D. Beck . who has been filling the position of bead of department in School No. 83 , should be regularly appointed to continue her duties . " Wo recommended that Miss Putnam should be appointed as class teacher to the head of department . Mr. Miller , our fellow - committeeman , recommended that Miss Putnam should be appointed as head of department . The majority of the Committee on Teachers of the Board of Education agreed with him , and on the vote Mr. Simis and myself were defeated . " There was no color question involved in this at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not vote for the woman of my own race because I thought that Miss Beck was much more competent . As a matter of fact , the choice of Miss Putnam by the Board of Education was largely a matter of sympathy and sentiment , and I understand there is alreaay talk of rescinding the action . " You know that there used to be separate schools for white and for colored children in New-York and in Brooklyn . One of the things that did most to win Grover Cleveland the support of the colored people was that when he was Governor he warmly advocated and signed the bill abolishing the color ling in the public schools . The schools that had then been exclusively for colored children , and that had colored teachers , were then given their numbers and took their regular place in the system . " These old colored schools have remained such in fact simply because colored children went to them . Propositions to consolidate them with other schools have been met with the claim that if this was done the colored teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There were four of these old colored schools in Brooklyn . One of them was that in the Twenty-fourth Ward , of which Miss Putnam was the principal . About 200 children were attending there , with four teachers . The building was a ramshackle old affair , unfit for use . The proposition was made to replace it with a new school building . " I must explain to you now that Mr. Simis had always stood with me in protecting the school rights of the colored people of the Twenty-fourth Ward , while Mr. Miller always seemed to be against us . When the talk arose of putting up a new building for the school which the colored children attended there wag a howl from the white people in the ward . They declared that it was not right to put up a new school for the colored children when the accommodations for the white children . were not sufficient . As a matter of fact children of any color had a right in either school , but the old color division had not been wiped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was just what the colored people hoped for , a proposition from the white people of the district that instead of a new building being erected for old School No. 68 , which the colored children attended , one big building should be put up and the white and the colored children all go to it together . They promised that the teachers of old School No. 68 should be looked after . The result was the building of School No. 83 , which can accommodate fully 1,800 children . " There are at present in that school about 1,000 white children and 200 colored children . The four colored teachers of the old school are there , and everything has been going harmoniously . I forgot to tell you , though , that after the new school was built some of the white people in the ward wanted to act in bad faith , declaring that the colored children and their teachers should not be allowed there , but that a new school for them should then be built . Mr. Miller favored this plan , but Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has in all matters affecting the rights of my race . " Well . Miss Putnam was the Principal of the old school , and she was my choice on first thought for head of department in the new consolidated school . She has been receiving the $1,500 a year , the salary of a Principal , ever since the consolidation , though she has been doing no service , but only reporting for duty . " Mr. Simis talked the matter over with me , however , and changed my mind . Dr. Frank K. Perkins , the present Principal of School No. 83 , agreed with Mr. Simis . They convinced me that in a new school like No. 83 , a school that would have to grow as the population about it increased , a younger and more progressive woman , who at the same time was as good a teacher as is Miss Putnam , would make a better head . of department than she would . They had nothing but the kindest feeling for Miss Putnam , and my sympathy was entirely with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had always stood by me in my efforts in behalf of the colored people of the.ward , so I stood by him , and . when he suggested the name of Miss Bock for head of department I promised to support her , and had added to the recommendation that Miss Putnam should be appointed as class teacher to the head of department . " That was my only reason for standing out against a nominee of my own color . While I have the highest regard for Miss Putnam as a teacher , as has Mr. Simis , I thought that a younger woman would make a better executive head in tbeschool . Miss Putnam has secured the appointment , however , and I can not say that I am sorry . It was a matter of sentiment with the Board of Education , though . They thought that as ex-Principal of old . School No. 08 Miss Putnam was entitled to the position of head of department in the new consolidated school . " Miss Putnam is rather a light-colored negress , who clearly shows her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she will be have any feeling in the matter , they dv not show it , though they were all very fond of Miss Beck . Miss Putnam , who appears to be a very refined and kindhearted gentlewoman , did not care to discuss her appointment further than to say : " I expected that they would make me head of department , because as the Principal of the old school it seemed to me that I was entitled to the appointment . I have no feeling over the opposition to me , because I know that it was not on account of my ability as a teacher , and I do not think that many members of the Board of Education allowed the question of color to influence their votes . It was simply that they thought a younger woman might better be appointed . Well . I am not as young as I used to be , but if I run old I have grown old in tho service of the Board of Education , and I can assure you I do not feel old . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
