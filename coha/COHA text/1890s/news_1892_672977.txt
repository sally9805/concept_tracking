txt It is not necessary to discuss the dispute between the Carnegie Steel Company and its employees in order to fix the responsibility for the outbreak of violence at Homestead . The company may have been wrong in the course it took in regard to the scale of wages , but it had the right to employ men in its works at whatever rate of pay they were willing to accept . After its former employees had abandoned its service they had no right to interfere with the employment of others or with the operation of the works . Their relations with the company were severed , and while it was their right to use persuasion to induce others not to enter its service , they bad no right to use force or resort to violence . If the company was able to operate its works without the help of the strikers . it might prove fatal to the latter in their contest over the question of wages , but that was the misfortune of their position , and gave them no right to interfere with property which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the terms offered . When the officers of the company called upon the Sheriff of Allegheny County to protect its property , and to protect them in their efforts to operate the works with men whom they were employing , the strikers declared that the property was in no danger , and offered to guard it themselves . They even went so far as to prevent the Sheriff 's deputies from entering the grounds , and forced them to return to Pittsburg , escorting them one by one to ' the boat to protect them from the crowd . It was for the officers of the company , and not for the citizens of Homestead who had formerly been in its service , to judge of the necessity for protection . The latter had no business to interfere with the property or assume its protection . It was for the corn-pany to protect its own - property , and to call upon the authorities of the county if it was prevented from doing so or if it was threatened by a mob . In calling upon Sheriff MCCLEARY , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample cause for doing so , as subsequent events have proved . The company had also an undoubted right to employ whatever number of watchmen it deemed necessary for the protection of its works , and to obtain them wherever it saw fit . Nevertheless , the employment of " Pinkerton men " was , in the circumstances , a move sure to lead to violence and bloodshed , and forthat reason was certainly unwise . The strikers put themselves in the wrong in attempting to interfere with the company 's property and : workmen , in resisting the Sheriff and driving off his deputies , and in trying to prevent the landing at Homestead of the guards brought there for the protection of the steel works . But it was quite plain that they would do all this , and it was bad policy to give them the opportunity to do just what many of them really wanted to do . The statements are conflicting as to the side from which the first shot was fired in yesterday 's riot and bloodshed , but there is no doubt that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinkerton men , trampling upon private rights , and defying public authority . The mob practically took possession of the place , and by violence and disorder overpowered the men employed by the company and defied the authorities of the county . There is no question as to the duty of the authorities of Allegheny County arid of the State of Pennsylvania . It is to enforce law and order at Homestead , to quell the mob , to put the property of the Carnegie Steel Company in possession of its owners and . to protect them in their lawful rights . It is not a question of sympathy in a labor controversy , but of the maintenance of law and the enforcement of public authority , and all considerations relating to the labor trouble should be postponed until that is accomplished . No State can afford to lot its citizens take the law into their own hands and wage bloody warfare among themselves in defense of what they claim to be their rights . The first duty of the public authorities in Pennsylvania is plainly to establish order at Homestead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law .
