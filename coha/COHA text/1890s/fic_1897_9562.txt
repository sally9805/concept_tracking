Scene  --  A mountain near the Mississippi river where no one inhabits . Eli . Eli . Its awful the way our people are lynched . Its a shame we are driven to this Desolate place to save our lives , simply Because I had some influence among My people and refused to use it to Suit the white man and injure my people . I have invoked my god without response . What else can I do ? Ramech . Ramech . Name not thy gods , for I condemn them . For they have urged to curse thy destiny , And brought on us this desolate spot as home . Eli . Eli . Do n't condemn me , O Ramech ! I may err In my imploring , but should I not pray ? Ramech .

Ramech pray to your God . Ramech . Ramech . I have , and oft . But Eli we are doomed ! Eli . Eli . And have we merited this fearful death , This slow consuming agony , this famine , Cold and pain , and O my God still more , This inward consciousness of griefs stored up For a long time yet ! Look how our flocks Are all swept off , our gathered crops ; Our children dead , but one , and we as outcasts From our homes waiting for death to come We were better off before Abe Lincoln freed us .

Not for myself Ask I thy mercy , but for my child . Lord  --  O spare my child , my precious child . He hath not wronged the lynchers . Eli . Eli . Ramech , I dreamed last night that our Long departed Ajax had got home , and Though he left us before the war I feel Somehow he 's yet alive and will Visit us before we die . Its thirty-five Years since we 've seen him , he 's changed I know . Ramech . Ramech . Heaven forbid that he should come to us While in this valley of sorrows . Eli . Eli . I see upon the river a skiff which Contains a boy , an aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like our Ajax . Ramech . Ramech . It ca n't be so , what , Ajax , Ajax The lost boy  --  long before old Abe did set us free ! Eli you dream . ( A long silence ) Eli . Eli . That 's him , he 's coming to die with us . Ajax comes up . Ramech . Ramech . Ajax my boy ! Whence comest thou ? Where have you been ? Hast thou forgotten me ? ( Falls in his arms ) Ajax . Ajax . No mother , dear ; how could that be ? Thank God we 've met but near our family grave , Father , ere this , is ripe in age . He was In his sixtieth year when Grant fought so . Eli . Eli . Ajax , what have you son , we perish . Ajax . Ajax . Nothing have I : big piles I had but In this land of lynching what ever we have We have not . The lynchers envied my Success and it was left with me To lose my life or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with here . Eli . Eli . I 'm old , I 'm cold , I 'm hungry , I 'm dying , I yield to all . Ramech . Ramech . Grieve not , we shall not die of Hunger . Before another night the lynchers Will be here . They want our blood Because it is innocent blood . Lets not repine . Jobel . Jobel . Mother I 'm sick , this ground is wet to me . Ramech . Ramech . To see thee suffer in the bloom of life , Thou whom I watched and cheered to See thee perish thus  --  O God  --  . Jobel . Jobel . Mama I 'm cold  --  has the bread come ? Ramech . Ramech . O for the days when as a slave I worked . Thy life would then be spared . But Lincoln Freed us . Why are we not free now ? Is Lincoln yet alive , and Grant ? O God Blot these remarks from my memory . She weeps . Ajax . Ajax . Mother , fret not o'er thoughts like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramech . Ramech . My Lord . My infant child and I once Thought that you were dead . But tell me How did you live , we waited long for Thee to come but all in vain . Ajax . Ajax . We parted  --  sold as mules . You With my father 's owner , he in another drove . And I in a disgraceful to some one else . I kept up with you all , until The mighty struggle came that freed Us all and effaced your whereabouts . I started out in search of you and Prosperity . I lived quite well but Seeking higher still , the white man Envied me , and hence my life was his When he saw fit , and eighteen years , I 've wandered up and down this world In search of one dear spot where I could Rest in peace . It must be Here to die with you . At first I feared to land . O God , this lynching world is full of sin . Ramech . Ramech . Despite our griefs , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to me . That we might die together . Ajax . Ajax . Mother what awful sights I 've seen  --  I oft have wished that I had died when young , Before this dreadful calamity . My blood Do n't move , my mind deranged turns , at what I 've seen this day . The careases of Men with that of oxen , sheep and hogs  --  Did float together down the stream . I saw two brothers take a stand for right And there they stood , until the lynchers Came  --  and made the one take the life Of the other  --  murder his mother 's son , The one who did this work to save his life Lay down exhausted . Then the lynchers took His life by slow process and left him there . The famished buzzards came to his rescue And tore the quivering flesh . In vain the man Fought this new foe till breath was gone . Eli . Eli . Didst thou see this ? Ajax . Ajax . That is not half . Ramech . Ramech . Then name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick at heart . Ajax . Ajax . I saw  --  my God I can not tell . Eli . Eli . Tell on . The woes of others told to us May steel us to our own . Ajax . Ajax . I saw a barge of logs loaded down , With human beings , manacled , emaciated , Ghastly . They sang and howled out prayers , And curses and laughter . It was horrid . With hands outstretched , they beckoned me To come , but I stood off and watched And heads of men were thrown at me in rage . I further noticed a partly eaten body Mangled and bruised . I shrieked aloud . And then I saw a sight that captured all . A mother , deathly clad , who in her arms , Upheld a child . She cast her eyes on high , And then she cast her infant from her . It sank beneath the waves and was gone . A mother drowned her own dear child . Ramech . Ramech . My God this lynching world . Ajax . Ajax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eli . Eli . My son , ' t is but the winds . No human Being in this wild place save us . And the " Star Spangled Banner " as that say goes Does n't wave here . Me think that song 's a myth . Ajax . Ajax . Again I hear the dogs . I 'm not deceived . Mother I dreamed last night I saw A mountain moving on the waves , And it had all the semblance of a house , And my bewildered mind beheld unreal things . By one of the windows I saw a Gray haired man stand mute as death And by his side I saw one young in years His eyes toward heaven turned : and then again He hid his face hehind his hands As if in sorrow .  --  And behold the old man Turned his back to him . Eli . Eli . That means but this  --  that God in heaven Has turned against us , and our doom is sealed . And I will wait my hour in silence . Fain would I curse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Already have I lived Too long  --  Hunger  --  Fear , my daily fiends ! Twelve days I 've fought you bravely to be Subdued at last by thee . Jobel . Jobel . How cold it is . Eli . Eli . Is that a human carcass floating on the water ? Look Ajax , look ! Ajax . Ajax . The body of a lynched man . Could I But reach it , and eat once more before I die . Eli . Eli . Go get it Ajax . Thou art a swimmer . ( Ajax reaches the water and a band of lynchers rush from the bushes and grab him . ) Ajax . Ajax . Oh father help me ! The devil has me . The carcass had its spies . Help ! Murder ! Eli . Eli . ( Rushes to his son 's rescue , with his silvery locks dangling in his face . He rushes in their midst and grasps his boy . The lynchers spear his aged body as if it was a beast . ) Help , for I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call For help when none can aid . Ramech farewell ! Jobel , my child farewell ! ( The father and son are lynched . ) Ramech . Ramech . O Eli ! Ajax ! My God of heaven . ( She weeps aloud . ) Jobel . Jobel . Mamma , why do you weep ? Where is my Papa ? Has he gone to get me some water ? Ramech . Ramech . My precious child . My husband and my son Are gone and the lynchers will surely be After you . I hear them shriek for blood . But I am nerved to die . Jobel . Jobel . Why do n't my papa come ? I dreamed He brought me some bread and you Dear mamma and I were in a house . Ramech . Ramech . Sleep again my child , and in thy dreams Forget the ills of earth and reign on high . Oh God , please Thou forgive my sins , And let me die ; but Father spare my child ! He hath not sinned . Hush ! the lynchers come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that enough ? Why trouble me ? I hear the howl of dogs . Jobel . Jobel . My papa wo n't come . O mamma  --  Ramech . Ramech . My soul the lynchers are upon me ! O precious God ! To Thee I yield my soul , Do take my helpless child . ( The Lynchers rush upon her . ) My child ! My own dear child ! Jobel . Jobel . Mamma it is so cold . Have you No bread for me ? Where is my mamma ? Mamma  --  Mamma  --  Mamma . But during this mighty struggle with Ajax and his foes , He and one man fighting for life had drifted from the shore . And Ajax fought a brave man 's fight against a watery grave , Exhausted down he seized some planks adrift upon the waves . He stepped upon his rescu 'd ship with clothes all dripping wet , And blood from every garment fell , his eyes the white man 's met . Death had pressed him closely and precious was each second  --  Two hands from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the bloodless pallor of a wretched drowning man With mouth all gaping , eyes bloodshot and hair on end did stand . The struggling white man exhausted from trying to kill Ajax Was fighting with water , now his strength was all relaxed . He cried " I perish my dear sir , give me a helping hand . " And Ajax 's heart was melted down he drew him to a stand . And Ajax said , " You 've treated me as though I were a pup , I give you good for evil  --  I in God 's name bring you up . " And Ajax heard his mother shriek  --  afar upon the shore , And tears gushed down his bleeding cheeks , " my God can it be so ? " The planks were drifting further and further down the river , And Ajax turned to his shipmate and these words did deliver : " The shrieking voice you hear comes from my mother 's bleeding heart  --  It is a shrill and helpless voice , it makes my senses start . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their infant child is murdered to , ought I silent remain ? Can it be true that I have saved your wretched , wicked life , While others of your gang have killed my father and his wife ? You heathen of the white-skin 'd tribe , you sit down there and wonder I 've robb 'd grim death by saving you , your watery grave I 've plundered . I 've prayed to God for vengeance through all these dreary years I 've gathered patience from my friends relating all their fears . My assailants have been many and my defenders few , But now we stand as man to man , sir , should I murder you ? Grim death keeps secrets better than the mass of living men , The river waves will gladly take you to the fishy den . Then I could dive down in the waves and be , myself , at rest . And your dear lynchers seeking me would vainly beat their breast , And though they are good hunters of the blood of Negro 's vein , There they would follow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I do , sir , what the river 's waves would be In contrast of the life , my peer , which now I give to thee . And I am now adrift , afloat in the marts of the world , And if the lynchers can catch me my soul to wind 'll be hurled . If all the demons of your race could gather ' round us now , Sir , all my pleading would not keep cold death from my hot brow . But man was made for life 's battle , and sometimes life is fate , To every man that breathes a breath death cometh soon or late . And how could you die better , sir , than by a hand like mine , For all my race 's punishment by all your race 's crimes ? And could I die a nobler death than facing fearful odds For vengeance of my father and my mother ' neath the sod ; And for those tender mothers with their babies at their breast Whose husbands died the death of dogs at your race 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form lies not beneath the sod , Its now a prey for buzzards ' feast , you wicked wretch ! My God ! I have been at your mercy , sir , you tried to take my life . I have no hope of your favor , for you I have no rife . I could kill you and cast your form beneath the rolling waves But I am human , so are you , I 'm not to kill but save . " The white man set there calm as death he utter 'd not a word , It seemed his frame was void of breath his soul was all bestirred . He never gave an earnest look he did not even wink , And Ajax said , " These circumstances do make my conscience think . O white man ! have you any heart and did you ever sigh , And did your senses ever start to see a Negro die ? Consider now the torture and the cruelty on my race , Look at my mother 's cruel death , her infant child effac 'd . Come go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  That burn 'd the eyes and mouths of men and made them roar like lions . And how the lynch 'd men bellow 'd like a cow in deep distress , And how the lynchers laugh 'd and took it in with minds at rest . Oh ! how the men did struggle to loose the lynchers ' chain . Oh ! how they howl 'd like mad men , their efforts were in vain . The guards had gone upstairs to rest , women and children came To view the scene with idle jest , and they were not ashamed . The angels ' round the throne of God had turn 'd their backs to earth , With hearts melted away in tears at sight of Texas mirth . This land of brutal cowards still lack the moral backbone , The moral courage , moral strength to drive a villian home .  --  To even lift a finger or to raise a warning cry , They stand in silent pleasure and gaze on the Negro die . And in the shadow of the church human beings are burned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They gather ' round to take a smell of burning human flesh , They cheer the scene and make the spot a place of sacred mesh . For him to plead , when all the hearts his keenest prayer could probe ,  --  Are but a breath of ether in the space around the globe . It 's no more than a ripple to the roaring waterfall , It 's a snow-flake in the valley to the cloud that covers all . There 's no protest , there 's no rebuke , there 's not a single cry  --  Fished from the pools of blood and wrong to touch the nation 's eye . The world now sits in judgement and could the nations plead This land would be a criminal of the vilest kind of deeds . Could Ida Wells have raised a force to follow her crusade This dreadful crime , long ere this time in darkness would be laid . If Frances Willard and her host would help to raise the cry , Intemperate lynchings ghastly ghost would fade away and die . For when a woman makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to win , or else she 'll make opponents conscience ring . Few men of crime can stand to break a woman 's heart , perchance , Some nations chang 'd their ship of state upon a woman 's glance . Fair Helen seal 'd the fate of Troy and queens of ancient times Have led brave hearts in cause of truth and made the wrong decline . Some noble , stalwart woman have in every time and place , Wielded her influence , good or bad , upon the human race . If all the noble women who have a Christian heart , While sitting by the fireside would take an active part , And have a gen'ral family talk about the ship of state , And speak of what the states should do to have a union great  --  And speak of how almighty God was looking from the sky  --  Down on the doings of each one . He heard the lynch 'd man 's sigh , More husbands and more sons will go away from sacred homes  --  With purer thoughts and higher aims and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships of state will all be fill 'd with men With Christian hearts , with humane minds , with works oppos 'd to sin . Then there 'd be more McKinley hearts as governors of states , To see that men obeyed the laws which they themselves would make Then ev'ry gov'nor would be fit to make a president The white house then would ever have a man with good intent . Then lynching crimes would melt away as ice in summer 's heat , Then we could praise this ship of state , this union strong and great . For many years my race has been a universal target , They never try to find the part that 's crimson , bright and scarlet , In all of the affairs of life enormous fads have spent All of their forces upon him to bring our discontent . All those unhappy phrases they should try to set aright , Are dwelt upon with mighty force to make as dark as night , A just investigation , to show the brighter side , Is never made by those who strive forever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been as low As those destructive lyncher 's hearts who never try to know Whether it was a crime or not they 're simply satisfied To pass their own meek judgment , they crave the Negro 's hide . There 's no class in America whose moral pathway 's fill 'd With thorns as is the Negro 's and he must tread at will . American Christianity 's not recognized by Him Who came to earth to die for man and give him Christian trim . Her body 's broken by disease her conscience seared with crimes . A mind and soul of cruelty to cap the heathen climes . And in the light of all these things it is a poor spirit To point with Christian horror but ne'er try to prohibit . Ah ! what a reckless nation , what an undisciplin 'd child Noble , but sometimes tricky , doing somethings that are wild . A freeman am I , must I die a slave adrift at sea , Or must I live as master 's dog to whimper at his plea . And must I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands ? Poor Ajax ' cheeks did flush with heat he ground his teeth like sand . By Jove , by thunder , by the gods , I 'd rather herd with wolves , And seek the lion 's friendship and to tigers make my love , Then I could marshal all their strength against the cursed mob , And teach them how it felt to give a beast a wailing sob . To all my sorrows I would add those of my punished race , And devote myself to vengeance upon this black disgrace . And I would pray to all the gods , the gods both good and bad To lend me their special terrors to ridicule this fad . I 'd ask for tempest , heat and cold , for drought , for wild beast 's lair , And all the poison of the land that men let loose in air  --  And all the thousand other things that quickly put to sleep  --  Of which men die on sea and land , my God ! why should I weep ? My feelings are not vagary as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance sad . Every age has its sorrows and O , the ills of time , No parallel in human life to match this lynching clime , My spirit never goes to sleep I can not rest at night , A dog remembers , long , a wrong , he knows a friend at sight . I have a book of great events , I 'll write this voyage down That men may know what I have seen and try its depths to sound . My mother , father all are gone and I in this wild wood , My wife and child sev'r 'd from me , all gone but my manhood . I never hope to find them now amid my anxious fears As " Ben Hur " found his jewels after eight long grieving years . He found his precious mother and his sister with disease From out a wicked dungeon he brought them to release . But dungeons where the lynchers place the prison 'd corpse of man The buzzard sailing in the air has all at his command . O white man ! Ca n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't you help me pray one prayer to your Almighty God ? " O God ! give me a little faith and into my darkness  --  That 's deeper darkening every day , O send a light of rest . All hopes deal with the future Lord , I hope for better days , And while I 'm drifting down the tide , guide me the right of way . " Laurels of this world may be sweet but they soon pass away . We have no laurels as a race , are they in coming days ? Like those colossal tombs of old on drifting desert sands They cast shadows ' cross the cent'ries then crumble to the land . This country in a prosperous stage will yet come to a halt , And see the depths of this outrage and remedy the fault . When time lies down fore'er to sleep at eternity 's feet , And vanities , pomps , more creep upon the stage so sweet  --  And stars of heaven have all gone out of their ethereal home The eternal hand , unseen by us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gathering now , the surging waters roll 'd , And Ajax felt the cool night wind , it seemed to fan his soul . Unruly winds began to cease and zephyr 's breezes rose The lotus plant from water 's depths before his gaze reposed . The solemn river loiter 'd on its way quite unconcerned . The palm trees shook their nodding heads and stoop 'd to greet the fern . The Jackall slipping on the bank knew Ajax ' skin was black He snapp 'd his teeth he thought t'was law his fleshless bones to crack : The guiding stars began to show , the day went into night And like a phantom ship at sea they drifted out of sight . The planks , call 'd ship on which they rode , went calmly down the river  --  And no one knows unto this day which was the longest liver . Did Ajax kill the white man ? O no , his heart was tender ! Did white man kill poor Ajax ? his heart was rash a timber ! Did both of them drift to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them escape and shall we yet hear both their tales ? If poor Ajax is yet alive and dwells upon the land , He 'll write a book to shake this world and make men understand . Dominus Vobiscum.
