txt Smokers of tobacco have lately hoard words of cheer from an eminent authority . Dr. DABBS , one of the physicians who attended Lord TENNYSON in his last illness . has told the whole world , through an English newspaper reporter , that " smokiug does not injure a man who works and thinks , " adding to this a statement of his associate , Sir ANDREW CLARK , that " it only hurts a lazy man who drinks . " This refers , of course , to what is generally called by moderate persons " excessive smoking , " because TENNYSON smoked a great deal . There is much comfort in this , and , if it is true , tobacco is a greater boon than mankind has hitherto believed . Men who think and work are the only men the world has any use for , and the sooner the " lazy men who drink " are removed from the face of the earth the better it will be for society . Dr. DARES must have been speaking the exact truth , as he comprehends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all about the effects of tobacco on the human system . His statement , so terse and forcible in its expression that it arrests the attention and is likely to be held in the memory , conveys the best consolation persons addicted to the tobacco habit have ever had . BULWER , in one of his romances , remarked that " the man who smokes thinks like a sage and acts like a Samaritan , " which sounds well , but is obviously untrue , since every one knows that the man who smokes often thinks not at all and acts like a pig . But even if Buz , WER had spoken as happily and as reassnringly as Dr. DABBS on the tobacco habit , his words would have had less weight than the physician 's . Nobody nowadays heeds the poet or the artist . The scientific man alone is held in respect . Physicians frequently say things they do not exactly mean in order to cheer their patients , but in this case the patient was dead , and , moreover , no statement of a physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not due to the excessive use of tobacco . We already knew that many men who " think and work " can use tobacco with impunity , but we had been led to believe by an observation of mere facts ( not to be seriously held as evidence in conflict with the word of a distinguished physician ) that to many others , equally capable of thought and work , tobacco is poison . As for " the lazy man who drinks , " the impression has been abroad that nothing can kill him , that he thrives in all sorts of weather and on all ' sorts of food , increases his kind to overcrowd the settled places of the civilized world , to bewilder statesmen and weary even the philanthropists , and is as impervious to the evil effects of tobacco as to the smallpox or any other plague . Dr. DABBS , with the assistance of Sir ANDREW CLARK , assures us we are wrong . Tobacco , according to them , is ridding the world of its worst nuisance , and at the same time preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , the denial by Dr. WEIR MITCHELL of a tale that he had discovered a way to make cigars free from the poisonous nicotine need not cause regret , if the poisonous nicotine is , after all , a valuable agent in the improvement of mankind .
