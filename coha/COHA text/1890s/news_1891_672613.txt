txt In his speech at the Federal Club dinner last night Mr. THEODORE ROOSEVELT began by claiming credit , which is fairly his due , for his efforts in ' maintaining a nonpartisan administration of the civil service law during the last two years . Then he proceeded to show that during those two years , or perhaps a. longer time , he has been developing within himself a spirit of partisanship which did not characterize his earlier career in politics . He sustained the misguided efforts of his party to take from the States the control of elections , which are as truly the affair of the people of the States as any in which they5engage , and to exercise it through the National Government for the perpetuation of party ascendency . He assumed that the people acting as a nation are more virtuous than the people acting as States , and can secure honest elections more effectually by national than by State action , an idea that is utterly delusive . Then he put all the odium of favoring the free coinage of silver upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans , ignoring the fact that the coinage bill was passed by the Republican Senate , where its most ardent supporters were Republicans , whereas in the House it was not brought to thelest of vote . His praise of Speaker REED and the most violently partisan of the Republican leaders was in keeping with the spirit of his other remarks , and Mr. ROOSEVELT seemed determined to leave no doubt that henceforth he is to be regarded as a thorough-going party man .
