txt Agoncillo , Marti , and Luna , the Filipinos , are having a very quiet time of it at present . They have received several cablegrams and sent several , but the ones that they are ? wating  --  for , those which are supposed to contain direct news from Aguinaldo , have not yet come . Agoncillo says he is as Yet entirely unable to say what he will do . " At present , " he says , " we are in communication with seven different points by cable and wire , and there may be many more , for we can not carry on a war like this without having agents all over . When Agoncillo arrived here last Monday morning he asserted that the sole purpose of his visit was to establish cable communication with his chief , Aguinaldo , the United States Government having intercepted his messages . To-day he went a step further and told why he particularly desired uninterrupted cable communication . " On Friday last , " he said , " when I was in Washington , I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the result of the vote on the ratification of the treaty in the Senate . He desired this information so that his representative could use it in a conference he was holding with Gen. Otis . I did not think that I could get this information through to Aguinaldo , expecting , as did , that the Senate would refuse to ratify the treaty , and that the United States Government would object to putting such valuable information as that in the hands of the Filipinos . So I came to Canada just for the purpose of sending this cablegram . " " Has Aguinaldo yet received the result of the vote ? " he was asked , but the Filipino representative refused to reply to this question . Probably he does not know . " We do not rely on assistance from the Japanese for the present , " he replied in answer to an innuiry : " we have made no overtures 0 them , and they have not made any suggestions to us . " When asked if he expected his other Filipino friends from Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ordered out .
