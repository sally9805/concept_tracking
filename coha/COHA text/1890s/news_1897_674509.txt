txt Within the past few months $45,000 have been unearthed on Amelia Island , near this city , consisting of two finds of gold doubloons of the Spanish Government . They have created a sensation . In both instances the searches were conducted very secretly and the money was taken away before the truth was made known . The first find was $6,000 , and was made some months ago by a party of strangers posing as scientists . They were here over a month , and left suddenly after some charts they had were stolen by a negro , they claimed . This person , Chris Pinckney , a keen , sharp-witted darks , overheard them talking of their plans , and one night he followed them , and saw them dig up a box . When they opened it he saw the gleam of gold coins , and heard them say that there was over $6,000 in it . The next day he took French leave , and with him disappeared their charts . Some weeks after they were gone Pinckney reappeared . He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind to him in some sickness , and to him the negro showed the papers . Gause was incredulous at first , but finally took hold of the matter with Pinckney , with the result , as now ascertained , that they found a box containing a large amount of old Spanish doubloons , variously estimated at from $32,000 to $39,000 . This was in April . They would not dispose of the money here for fear that some one might claim it . Pinckney finally said he would go to Savannah and Brunswick , Ga. , and change it into bills . Gause acceded , and he sold out his plant here , as he intended going West with his share . But Pinckney disappeared , and finally Gause came to the conclusion that his partner had gone with the money . He went to Lawyer W , A. Hall and stated the case . On a promise of one-quarter of the amount recovered , Hall took the case . On May 3 he went to Tallahassee and secured a commission from Gov . Bloxham empowering him to hunt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then made for Pinckney . He was located in New York City , but the police , though wired to , could not find him . After waiting for some time , Gause stated that he would go after him , as he felt confident of finding him . Gause left here May 14 , but up to date has not been heard from , and consequently Lawyer Hall is rather " hot under the collar . " He thinks now that Gause hts used him as a " stool-pigeon . " His opinion is that Gause found Pinckney in New York and that the men divided the treasure there . Rather than come back and divide with Hall , Gause , according to Hall 's Idea , left for the West or for Central America . Anyway , Hall is after him , and has wired the police in several cities to look out for him . The find is no myth , as Hall saw some of the money and was shown the hole where it was found , under a big oak tree on Amelia Island , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken out . Then , too , Gause paid out several hundred dollars here before going , in doubloons , and many merchants have these old coins . The town is greatly excited over the mat , ter , and amateur treasure seekers are at work daily digging around old trees on the island . Over four acres in one place have been dug over in this way . The main facts came to light only yesterday , and then by accident , as Hall has been keeping quiet , hoping to get some news from Gause . The truth of the story is so well established here that it has carried the place by storm . WAS KILLED BY HIS FRIEND . Charles A. Rose and Louis Kuntz Were Going to Exercise in a Church Gymnasium .
