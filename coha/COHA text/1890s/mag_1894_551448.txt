STATES . By Josef/i Leroy harrison . THE public library of to-day is not the creation of an hour nor a generation , but the result of a gradual and natural development . It owes its rise and progress to the demands of the people , and has grown because its underlying principles are in thorough accord with those of all American institutions . The progress of evolution marks the change from the exclusive library of colonial days to one of the broadest and freest institutions of the century , - the public library . From the beginning of their history the American people have been lovers and possessors of books . Away back in the colonial days every self-respecting family had its small collection of costly , solemn , much-read tomes . It was not until the year 1638 , however , that the need of other than private collections created the more general ones . In that year Harvard University was founded , and as a part of its essential equipment , the library , - the first library in America designed to be used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of the Harvard library to the organization of the Philadelphia Library Company - covering nearly a century - witnessed also the foundation of the William and Mary and Yale College libraries , and may be regarded as the natal period of the scholastic library , whose creation was a logical and well-defined step in advance . The private library served its purpose and served it well , as the sturdy character of the early settlers of this country attests ; but with the foundation of institutions of learning the need of greater accessibility to books and of larger collections of books became apparent , and was met by what may be called the institutional library . The year 1731 began a new era in the intellectual life of the American people , 09 an era of co-operation for the procurement of books . It was in that year that Benjamin Franklin , because he was a lover of books and because books were so rare and expensive that they could only be obtained with great difficulty , proposed to the Junto , a half-social , halfliterary society , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books to the club , where they might be enjoyed by all . The result was the formation of the Philadelphia Library Company , - " the mother of all North American subscription libraries. ** The foundation of this library was the beginning of an epoch in the library history , not only of this country , but of the world . It was not until twenty-five years later that the first subscription library was established in England , - that of Liverpool , in 1756 ; 50 that the position which America holds to-day at the head of all matters pertaining to library advancement and usefulness is a trust direct from the liberty-loving founders of the Republic . It is perhaps significant that this movement for the freer use of books owes its origin to the so-called middle class , to the manual laborer rather than the professional man , for Franklin and his friends who subscribed to the stock of the company were mechanics and tradesmen . The library was created , not for the use of the scholar , or the rich , or any one class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to books through the medium of position or money . Franklin 's very simple but hitherto unthought-of device was a new and radical departure . Its effect was toward a more even distribution of intellectual wealth , the establishment , so to speak , of an intellectual democracy . Franklin 's idea , that of the joint stock library association , was contagious . Naturally adopted first in and about Philadelphia , its territory was soon // limited only by the frontiers of the country . Before the first shot of the Revolution was fired at Lexington , the seed of library co-operation had taken firm root and pushed its way through the soil of bookish exclusiveness . The library of the Carpenters ' Company , Philadelphia , was founded in 1736 ; Proprietors ' library , Pomfret , Conn. , 1737 ; library of the Four Monthly Meetings of Friends , Philadelphia , 1742 ; Redwood library , Newport , R. I. , 1747 ; Charleston ( S. C. ) Library Society , 1748 ; the curious revolving library which travelled between the first and second parishes in Kittery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1836 with the Providence Athemeum , 1753 ; New York Society library , now numbering more than ninety thousand volumes , 1754 ; Union library , Hatborough , Penn. , 1755 ; library of the Winyaw Indigo Society , of Georgetown , S. C. , 1755 ; New England library , Boston , 1758 ; Prince library , Boston , 1758 ; Social library , Salem , Mass. , 1760 ; Social library , Leominster , Mass. , 1763 ; Portland library , 1763 ; Chester ( Pa. ) library , 1769 ; and Social library , Hingham , Mass. , *773 . These libraries represent the chief means of general literary culture open to Americans prior to the Revolutionary XVar . The idea of the free public library as it is understood to-day had not been conceived ; but in that third step of library progress , co-operation , the craving for books , opened a new avenue of accessibility , the avenue which was destined in the course of time to broaden into the tolless highway of practically unrestricted procurement . The half-century following the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries . Notwithstanding that prolonged struggle , and the subsequent time and thought given to the adjustment of affairs in new relations , every now and then the blessings of peace were made manifest by the establishment of a library . The spirit which created and then maintained them - the essence of the whole movement for the co-operative use of books - is shown in the following articles of association , adopted in i8oi by the Social library , of Castine , Me. - " It is proposed by the persons whose names are hereby subjoined , to establish a social library in this town . It is greatly to be lamented that excellent abilities are not infrequently doomed to obscurity by reason of poverty ; that the rich purchase almost everything but books ; and that reading has become so unfashionable an amusement in what we are pleased to call this enlightened age and country . To remedy these evils ; to excite a fondness for books ; to afford the most rational and profitable amusement ; to prevent idleness and immorality ; and to promote the diffusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which small pecuniary abilities can afford , we are induced to associate for the above purposes . " During this half-century , 1776-1826 , many libraries were established which , though society , institutional or otherwise limited in scope , were in their general influence important factors in the library movement in this country , and necessary and logical steps toward the free public institution . The first theological library was started in connection with the theological seminary of the Reformed Church , New Brunswick , N. J. , 1784 ; the first law library by the bar association of Philadelphia , 1802 ; and the second medical library by the Harvard University Medical School , 1782 ,  --  the first collection dating back to 1763 , when the Pennsylvania hospital of Philadelphia began its library . Coincident with their foundation , scientific and historical societies began the collection of books . The library of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences was begun in 1780 , and that of the Massachusetts Historical Society , Boston , in 1791 ; this , however , was the third library established by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia having been founded in 1743 , and that of the German Society of Pennsylvania in * 764 . Books were solicited for prison and reformatory libraries as early as 1802 . The first town grants for library purposes are supposed to have been made by // Salisbury , Conn. , in 1803 , to extend the library given to the children of the town by Cabel Bingham . The origin of the Congressional library dates from the year i8oo , about the time of the establishment of the seat of government at Washington , and the first state library formally established as such , that of New Jersey , from 1796 , though it is probable that most of the states had at their capitals collections of such books as were needed for reference by their officials . To this period also belongs the origin of young men 's mercantile libraries , nominally created for young men of the mercantile class , but in fact open to all for a moderate fee . The oldest two are those of Boston and New York , both established in 1820 . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , their greatest growth was during its second quarter , and as a part of the educational movement which characterized it . These institutions , instead of being , like the earlier proprietary libraries , confined to the single function of furnishing books to readers , were designed to furnish a general , higher education to those who wished to supplement their school work . Classes for instruction in book-keeping , languages , etc. , were formed , and lecture courses for instruction , not recreation , started and maintained . The mercantile library was a distinct and necessary link in the chain of library development . The next step in this development was the real start of the public library system in America . It dates from the year 1826 , when Govenor DeWitt Clinton , of New York , advocated in his annual message to the state Legislature the establishment of school district libraries . Five years later the state placed Hall 's " Lectures on School-keeping " in every school district in the state . In 1838 an annual appropriation of $55,000 was voted to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district libraries , with the provision that after three years the money might be spent for books or teachers ' wages at the discretion of the district . In 1853 , 1,604,210 volumes were reported in the school libraries . This was the high-water mark . From that year the number steadily diminished , until in 1883 there were 701,000 reported , and in 1892 , 825,000 . Through the influence of Horace Mann , a law , similar to the New York law , was passed in Massachusetts in 1837 . In the same year Michigan adopted the plan of district school libraries , incorporating the idea in its school law ; and thus started the momentum carried , the district school library into seventeen states , as follows : Connecticut , 1839 ; Rhode Island and Iowa , 1840 ; Indiana , 1841 ; Maine , 1844 ; Ohio , 1847 ; Wisconsin , 1848 ; Missouri , 1853 ; California and Oregon , 1854 ; Illinois , i855 ; Kansas and Virginia , 1870 ; New Jersey , 1871 ; Kentucky and Minnesota , 1873 ; and Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library system has not been a success ; neither has it entirely failed to accomplish the good expected of it . In establishing a new principle , however , or rather in establishing a new and broader application of an old principle , the result accomplished was immeasurable . The founding of district school libraries by state governments recognized the most important function of the public library , that is , it recognized the library as an essential part of the system of public education , and as such entitled to a share in public taxation . That the state should educate its citizens , and for that purpose maintain schools , was a principle already firmly grounded ; but now for the first time in history it recognized the library as both the complement and supplement of the school , a factor in its educational system . It was the fourth great step in the evolution of the movement . The fifth was that of libraries endowed by private generosity , and thrown open to the public on such conditions as their founders thought wise , of which the Astor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Pratt and Peabody of Baltimore , are examples . The origin of endowed libraries dates back to about the same time as that of the public library , and to a certain extent their scope and interests have been identical ; but from the very nature of their conditions they can not be quite // the same . The endowed library , that is , a library built and maintained by gift and endowment , is for the use of the public entirely without cost to the public . Without doubt the gift is appreciated and the donor honored , and without doubt it has made books free ; but it is not the most advanced position which library progress has attained , the sixth and last step in its development , - the public library , maintained , or created and maintained , by the community in which it is placed . The structure may be a gift , but the support , in order for the library to fulfil its highest mission , must come from the people . Such , in brief , is the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when that movement broadened in its scope and became the public library movement , which , in its turn , underwent such an awakening as to begin a new epoch in the history of libraries , an epoch already spoken of as the " modern library movement . " It took two centuries to prepare the way for the suggestion made by Josiah Quincy , Jr. , mayor of Boston , to the city council , in October , 1847 , that a petition be sent to the state Legislature asking for authority to levy a tax by which the city could establish a library free to all its citizens . The petition was sent , and the following year the General Court granted Boston the right to raise annually the sum of $5 , ooo for the support of a public library . On March 20 , 1854 , the Boston Public library threw open its doors to readers , and within six weeks from that date to borrowers . It is fortunate that the public library system started under the guidance of a body of such sagacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trustees of the Boston Public library , men who , in their own words , desired to awaken " a general interest in it , as a city institution , important to the whole people , as a part of their education an element of their happiness and prosperity . " Regarding its policy , Mr. George Ticknor wrote to a friend in the summer of i8* i : " I would establish a library which differs from all free libraries yet attempted ; I mean one in which any popular books , tending to moral and intellectual improvement , shall be furnished in such numbers of copies that many persons can be reading the same book at the same time ; in short , that not only the best books of all sorts , but the present literature of the day , shall be made accessible to the whole people when they most care for it ; that is , when it is fresh and new . I would therefore continue to buy additional books of this class almost as long as they are asked fur ; and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should demand something inj urious , - create a real appetite for healthy reading . The appetite once formed will take care of itself . It will , in a great majority of cases , demand better and better boQks . " Such was the wise policy adopted by the first public library in America , a policy which has been adopted by all the public libraries in this country , and , in its main features , by the free libraries of England . The trustees believed that the purpose of a public library was to serve every class in the Eommunity , especially the so-called lower and middle classes , and that it nThst be a thoroughly democratic institution . The act of the Massachusetts General Court of 1848 was a special act , but it was initiative . In 1849 New Hampshire passed the first general library law ; and in i8* m Massachusetts made the act of 1848 applicable to every city and town in the state , and abolished all limitations as to the amount towns and municipalities might raise . There is no better testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the following twenty-seven states have followed the lead of New Hampshire and Massachusetts in passing library laws : Maine , in 1854 ; Vermont , i86* Ohio , 1867 ; Colorado , Illinois , Wisconsin and New York , 1872 ; Indiana and Iowa , 1873 ; Texas , 1874 ; Connecticut and Rhode Island , 1875 ; Michigan , 1876 ; Nebraska , 1877 ; California , Minnesota and New Jersey , 1879 ; Montana , 1883 ; New Mexico , 1884 ; Missouri , i88* Kansas and Wyoming , i886 ; North and South Dakota , 1887 // 713 ( originally a territorial law ) ; Pennsylvania , 1887 ; Washington , 1890 ; and Mississippi , 1892 ( embodied in the municipal law ) . The laws are permissive , not commandatory . They may be divided into two main groups , - those simply authorizing towns to levy a tax to form a library after their own methods , and those providing minute directions for the organization and control of local libraries . Some further generalizations and a few peculiar features may be summarized as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public library rests in California , Colorado , Minnesota , Mississippi , Nebraska and Ohio with the local legislative body . In Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Missouri , Montana , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , North and South Dakota , Texas , Wisconsin and Vermont it depends on the popular vote of the people . In Illinois , Kansas and Michigan the decision rests in cities with the municipal council , in towns with the people . In Indiana the power of establishment is vested in the school board , and in Wyoming in the county commissioners . In Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New York , Pennsylvania and Texas the amount which can be raised by taxation for the purpose of maintaining public libraries is not limited . The other twenty-three states which have passed library laws ( exclusive of Mississippi ) limit it by statute . It varies from one third to two and a half mills on the dollar of taxable property . The rate often depends on the population , and the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raised for the purpose of founding a library than it allows for subsequent maintenance . The law of Colorado does not provide for a direct tax , but allows the proceeds of fines for violations of the penal ordinances to be devoted to the support of public libraries . In Rhode Island the state grants money for library purposes on the condition that the town will raise an equal amount . In Massachusetts , New York and Vermont the control of the library is in the hands of trustees elected by the people . In Connecticut also , in the absence of any other provision , the town elects a board of directors . In Colorado , Illinois , Kansas , Michigan , Minnesota , Missouri , Ohio , Washington and Wisconsin the board of library control consists , in cities , of directors appointed by the mayor , with the advice and consent of the common council . The local governing board itself is the controlling body in Iowa , Maine , Mississippi , New Hampshire , New Mexico , Rhode Island and Texas . In Indiana the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North and South Dakota five directors appointed by the board of education . In California towns and cities of less than one hundred thousand inhabitants elect their own trustees ; in cities of more than that number they are appointed by the mayor . In New Jersey the board of control consists of the chairman of the legislative body , the president of the board of education , and three members appointed by the mayor . In Wyoming the power is vested in three trustees appointed by the county commissioners . The tendency in library legislation is toward more active help and encouragement on the part of the state . From 1849 to 1889 the laws enacted practically granted to the community nothing more than right of establishment and maintenance . In 1890 a new era was inaugurated . The state became more than a passive agent . It began to take a part in the creation and an interest in the welfare of public libraries by appropriating money , by appointing library commissions , and by providing for instruction in library science . Such advanced laws have been passed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 27 , 1892 ; Maine , March 21 , 1893 ; New Hampshire , March 22 , 1893 ; and Connecticut , June i , 1893 . The Massachusetts law gives the governor power to appoint , with the advice and consent of the council , a board of library commissioners , consisting of five persons . The librarian or trustees of any free public library may go to this board for advice in regard to the selection and cataloguing of books and matters pertaining to library administration . The // board is directed to expend for books , upon application of the library trustees of any town having no free library , a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars , the books to the commission . The Commonwealth thus supplements the free text-books loaned to the children in its schools by collections of good literature made free to its citizens . The act imposes certain initiatory steps on the part of the town , and also certain obligations . The town must accept its provisions at a regularly called town meeting , and must elect a board of library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog tax , or otherwise , a sum not less than $50 , if its last assessed valuation was $i , ooo , ooo or more ; $25 , if between $250,000 and $i , ooo , ooo ; and $15 , if less than $250,000 . The commission is obliged to report in January of each year to the General Court . C. B. Tillinghast of the State library , Samuel Sweet Green of the Worcester Public library , Henry S. Nourse , a trustee of the Lancaster library , Miss E. P. Sohier of Beverly , and Miss Anna E. Ticknor of Boston , constituted the first commission . In 1890 there were in the three hundred and fifty-two towns in the Commonwealth one hundred and three without public libraries . In 1893 there were two hundred and twenty-seven libraries entirely under municipal control ; thirty entirely free and in the management of which the municipality was represented ; twenty-two to which the town appropriated money , but over which it had no control ; nineteen supported by private benefaction ; and one owned and controlled by the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was charged . There were but fifty-three towns in the Commonwealth which did not possess public libraries , and in several of these small association libraries existed . This gain of fifty libraries in three years is largely due to the earnest and conscientious work of the commission , and demonstrates the practical utility of the law which created it . General legislation is largely imitative , and the enactment of library laws has not proved the exception . Massachusetts took the initiative . The results were seen to be good , and other states followed . Perhaps the most advanced library law is that passed by New York state in 1892 , which was incorporated in the state university law . The relations it establishes between the regents of the university and the libraries which come under their jurisdiction are , briefly : granting subsidies to libraries not owned by the public , but maintained for its use ; giving charters of incorporation ; receiving annual reports ; removing inefficient trustees ; sending small libraries known as " travelling " libraries through the state ; providing instruction in library science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by means of correspondence and an inspector of libraries , to librarians throughout the state ; and receiving property for redistribution from libraries which have been abolished . The law recognizes the library as an institution of higher learning , which may be admitted to the university of the state and developed under supervision of the regents . The regents annually appropriate $25,000 for the benefit of free public libraries . In every case where money is given the town must raise an equal amount , and the money must be spent for books approved by the regents . Two hundred dollars is the limit any one library may receive . The libraries are at all times open to official visitation , and are entitled to call upon the state library officials for advice on any point of library arrangement or management . Two provisions of the law are unique , - the provision for instruction in the Library School at Albany , which will be spoken of more fully further on , and the travelling libraries . As a new and ingenious means of broadening the field of usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey , director of the New York State library and secretary of the regents of the University of the State of New York , has inaugurated and is successfully carrying on , of sending small and carefully selected collections of books to towns and villages throughout the state , is of interest and importance . The work has created a new department // in the state library , and has grown to such an extent that its management requires a large part of the time of six persons . It contains fifteen sets of books , ten general in their character , and five subject libraries , that is , selected books on the subjects of economics , agriculture , literature , United States history and French history . Each set contains fifty or one hundred volumes , and is duplicated from two to ten times , as the popularity of the library may require , so that the entire number of books which can be circulated by this means is nearly ten thousand . The steps necessary to be taken by a community in order to obtain a library are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers or by the officers of a university extension centre registered in the university of the state , or a reading club or circle . On satisfactory guarantee of return of books and payment of three dollars for fifty or five dollars for one hundred volumes , a library will be sent without further expense , to be used for six months . Others may be afterward obtained on the same terms . The plan brings the best and newest books in current literature within easy reach of any community in the state , no matter how small or remote , and lays the foundation of increasing advantages . The law providing for these libraries took effect Oct. i , 1892 . Applications began to come in in November , and the first library went out in February , 1893 . On April i of this year ninety libraries had been loaned , and twenty-seven returned . Statistics of the first twelve returned , containing 1,200 volumes , show a circulation in six months of 2,893 volumes , with 8i* readers . The towns to which they have been sent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being mere hamlets . The laws of Maine , New Hampshire and Connecticut follow more or less closely the Massachusetts law . In Maine the state librarian is directed to donate from the state library to any town of less than fifteen hundred inhabitants , not having a free public library , books purchased for that purpose , not exceeding fifty per cent in value of books bought by the town for the object of founding a library , and in no case to be more than one hundred dollars . The town must have appropriated not less than one hundred dollars for books and provided for their custody . The librarian or trustees of any free public library may ask the governor and council for advice in regard to the selection of books , and may receive instruction at the state library in cataloguing and library management . The New Hampshire law provides for a library commission of five , to consist of the state librarian and four persons appointed by the governor , with the advice and consent of the council . The commission is required to give advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and in library management . It is authorized to assist small towns in establishing libraries , and the same obligations are enjoined on the towns receiving aid as are imposed by the Massachusetts law . In Connecticut what is known as the Connecticut public library committee , consisting of five persons , is annually appointed by the board of education . The duty of this committee is to advise librarians , directors of libraries and teachers in the public schools , when requested , in regard to the selection , purchase and cataloguing of books , and in library management . Towns desiring to establish free public libraries may apply to the committee for help , which it is empowered to grant to the extent of *2OO , the amount up to this sum to duplicate the contribution made by the town for establishment . But the enactment , development and broadening of library laws are only a part of that library movement whose beginning dates back to the foundation of the Boston Public library . The discussion attending the establishment of that library , 1841-54 ; the sequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as librarian of the British Museum , 1837 , to the passing of the Ewart library bill in 1850 , granting to the councils of English towns the right to establish public libraries and museums , and to levy a tax for their support to the extent of one half penny in the pound , - a library movement which went on // simultaneously with , but independently of , the movement in America ; the enactment of the first general library laws by New Hampshire , 1849 , and Massachusetts , 185 i ; the founding of the Astor library , the first great reference library established in this country , 1848 ; the publication of the first edition of Poole 's " Index to Periodical Literature , " I 848 , and Prof. Jewett 's report on the libraries of the United States , i85o , awakened at once a new and keen interest in library matters , and were important events in that epoch-making period immediately preceding and following the year i85o . One of the earliest evidences of the new interest taken in library affairs was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1853 , signed by twentyfour prominent members of the profession . In response to the invitation , fiftythree delegates assembled on the morning of Sept. 15 of that year in the chapel of the New York University , New York City . Prof. Charles C. Jewett , of the Smithsonian Institution , one of the most active of the promoters of the conference , was made president . Among those present were William F. Poole , of the Mercantile Library Association , Boston ; Samuel F. Haven , of the American Antiquarian Society ; Rev. Edward Everett Hale , of the Young Men 's Library Association , - XVorcester ; Charles Folsom , of the Boston Athenaeum ; Reuben A. Guild , of the Brown University library ; and Lloyd P. Smith , of the Philadelphia Library Company . The conference discussed Prof. Jewett 's new system of rules for cataloguing , based on those of the British Museum , his scheme for making the Smithsonian Institution a great national library , his plan for co-operation in printed library catalogues , and other questions of library economy and bibliography . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted to regard it as preliminary to the formation of a library association , and it:adjourned to meet in Washington . Owing to a number of reasons , however , of which the chief was probably Prof. Jewett 's retirement from the Smithsonian Jnstitution , no subsequent meeting was ever held , and the work so enthusiasti cally begun was not resumed for a long period of years . During the twenty-three years following the convening of this conference , 1853-76 , and partly as a result of its work and the series of events which led up to it , more than two thousand libraries were established in the United States , and a general advancement made in library management , administration and bibliography . They were years of hard , quiet , steady work , the fruit of which was soon to be realized in the second great awakening of library interest . Perhaps the most important event of these years was the work of collecting and publishing the statistics of the libraries of the United States , begun in 1870 by the United States Bureau of Education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that the bureau had comparatively little material upon which to build is significant . The United States census reporfs for i85o , i86o and 1870 contained some statistics regarding libraries ; but they were incomplete and unreliable . Prof. Jewett 's report , 1851 , William J. Rhees 's " Manual of Public Libraries , Institutions and Societies in the United States and British Provinces of North America , ** Philadelphia , 1859 , and Justin Winsor ' s collection of statistics in his " Seventh Annual Report of the Boston Public Library , " 1868-69 , were the only systematic attempts that had been made to localize , classify and combine the statistics of all the public libraries of the United States . Some additional help was obtained from the article on public libraries in the American Almanac for the year 1837 , from a paper by Edward Edwards read before the Statistical Society of London , 1846 , and subsequently published in its journal , from the library statistics given in Trtibner 's " Bibliographical Guide to American Literature , " London , r8*6 , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Libraries , " London , 1859 , and from an nrticle by A. R. Spofford in the " National Almanac " of 1864 . Certainly not a large showing for an institution which had been in existence for nearly two and a half centuries . // The first report on public libraries issued by the-bureau appeared in 1870 . It gives a table of i 6i principal libraries , exclusive of those connected with the colleges . The report of 1871 gives a similar table of i 8o libraries ; while that of 1872 contains statistics of i , o8o libraries of not less than , ooo volumes each . The report of 1872 awakened the interest and originated the demand which brought forth the " special report " of 1876 . It was issued in two parts : Part I. , " Public Libraries in the United States of America , their History , Condition and Management . " This is an invaluable work of 1,187 octavo pages , containing signed papers by librarians whose standing in the profession makes them authoritative , and statistics of 3,649 libraries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volumes , 12,276,964 . Part II. , " Rules of a Dictionary Catalogue , " by Charles A. Cutter . The report of the bureau of 1884-85 contains a list of 5,383 libraries , of more than 300 volumes each , an increase of 1,869 libraries in ten years , or almost 54 per cent . The number of volumes is given as 20,622,076 , an increase of about 66 per cent , and showing that the percentage of increase in the number of volumes was even greater than that of the number of libraries . The report for 1886-87 gave detailed statistics of the various classes of libraries , with the exception of college and school libraries . The list included only those of 1,000 volumes or more . The number given is 1,777 , containing 14,012,370 volumes . The last report was issued in 1893 . It contains a list of 3,804 libraries of upwards of i , ooo volumes . Deducting from the list of 1884-85 all libraries of less than i , ooo volumes , the number reported was 2,987 . From this it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics was completed in 1891-was 817 , or 27.35 percent . The 3,804 libraries enumerated contain 26,896,537 bound volumes and 4,340,817 pamphlets , a total of 31,237,354 . The average size of the libraries is 8,194 volumes , the average population to a library 16,462 , and the average number of books to every 100 of the population fifty . Compared with the report of 1884-85 , the figures show an increase in the average size of the library of 1,813 volumes to each library , or 28.4 per cent ; a decrease of population to a library of 2,360 , or 12.5 per cent ; and an increase of the number of books to every one hundred inhabitants of sixteen , or 47 per cent . Regarding the size of libraries the report gives the following interesting figures There were in 1891 three libraries containing upwards of 5oo , ooo volumes ; one between 300,000 and 5oo , ooo ; twenty-six between ioo , ooo and 300,000 ; sixty-eight between 5o , ooo and ioo , ooo ; 128 between 25,000 and 5o , ooo ; 383 between io , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io , ooo ; and 2,360 between i , ooo and 5,000 . The number of libraries in the various states decreases from 511 in New York and 5o8 in Massachusetts to three in some of the smaller and Western states . Of the three largest libraries Massachusetts contains two , the Boston Public , 556,283 volumes , and the Harvard University library , 570,097 volumes . The library of Congress contains 659,843 bound volumes and 210,000 pamphlets . The National Bureau of Education recognizes the public library as a factor in the educational system of the country , and the promotion of its interest as a part of its legitimate work . Since 1870 it has not only compiled and printed the reports referred to , but has also issued several important pamphlets on library matters . Commissioner W. T. Harris is earnest in his endeavor to advance the library interest of the country , and to show the important relations existing between the library and the public schools . The modern library movement , one of the distinctive and important movements of the nineteenth century , began in 1876 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its preparation had been long . The work and thought of years seemed only waiting for that combination of events , or rather results , which marked the Centennial year as another epoch-maker in the history of // the development of the public library in the United States . In that year a conference of librarians was held , a national association organized , an official journal established , and the government report issued . These four events mean much . They have been of vital importance in shaping and carrying on the new movement , a movement which has steadily advanced and broadened and grown in favor . The convening of librarians in Philadelphia in 1876 was largely due to the earnest efforts and great enthusiasm of Melvil Dewey , then assistant librarian in the Amherst College library . The conference assembled on the morning of Oct. 4 in the rooms of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania , with Justin Winsor , then librarian of the Boston Public library , in the chair . There were one hundred and three persons in attendance , including most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Library Association on the third day of the conference was the most important event of its session . It elected Justin Winsor the first president ; A. R. Spofford , W. F. Poole and H. A. Holmes , vice-presidents ; and Melvil Dewey , secretary and treasurer . Its object was to promote the library interests of the country , to increase reciprocity and good-will among librarians and all interested in library economy and bibliographical studies . The revised constitution of the association states it more definitely , thus " Its object shall be to promote the welfare of libraries by stimulating public interest in founding and improving them , by securing needed state aid and national legislation , by furthering such co-operative work as shall improve results or reduce expenses , by exchanging views and making recommendations , and by advancing the common interests of librarians , trustees and others engaged in library or allied educational work . " The founding of the association signalized the Centennial year by placing the library system of the country upon the broad basis of reciprocity , co-operation and mutual understanding . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the library movement , guiding to its place every new stone in the superstructure of that system , removing those which were worn with age , and remodelling still others which only needed a touch here and there to make them fit perfectly into their new surroundings . The association has been pre-eminently an active , working body . Since the Philadelphia conference it has held meetings in New York , 1877 ; London ( international ) , 1877 ; Boston and Cambridge , 1879 ; XVashington and Baltimore , i88i ; Cincinnati , 1882 ; Buffalo , 1883 ; Sagamore House , Lake George , 1885 ; Milwaukee , i886 ; Round Island House , Thousand Islands , 1887 ; Laurel House , Catskill Mountains , i888 ; St. Louis , 1889 ; Fabyan House , White Mountains , 1890 ; San Francisco , 1891 ; Lakewood , Baltimore and Washington , 1892 ; and Chicago , 1893 . The printed proceedings of these meetings cover several goodsized volumes and have been of the greatest value to the library world . The papers read at the conferences have dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management than with historical , antiquarian and bibliographical topics , and the results attained by the discussion of these perplexing questions of methods and administration are without doubt greater than could have been attained from the consideration of more literary themes . By holding its annual meetings in various sections of the country the association has done much to stimulate interest in library matters in all parts of it . It has practically created in this country what the Germans call bib/iotkekswissenschafi ' , a term having no exact equivalent in English , has elevated librarianship to the dignity of a profession , and has , in short , been the principal means of advancing the library interests of the United States . But the American Library Association is not content with the work which it does as a whole . In order to still further increase its usefulness it has established within itself several sub-organizations , known respectively as the " Publishing , " " College Library , " and Trustees " sections . // The publishing section , organized in i886 , is an outgrowth of the standard cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important committee of the association . Founded for the purpose of securing the preparation and publication of such catalogues , indexes and other biliographical helps as could be produced the most advantageously by co-operation , the results of the work have been practical and pronounced . It has brought out the third edition of Poole 's " Index to Periodical Literature , " which is each year brought down to date by the " Cooperative Index " ; has issued , 1890 , Sargent 's " Reading for the Young , " the standard guide to juvenile literature ; and has published the " A. L. A. Index , " prepared under the direction of Mr. W. I. Fletcher , of the Amherst College library , and designed to do for general essay literature what Poole 's " Index " does for periodical literature . The section has now under consideration two important pieces of work , - an index to scientific serials , and the systematic reviewing of books on every subject by librarians of recognized authority in their respective fields , to be published simultaneously in a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section must be mentioned the " American Library Association Catalog " of the library which formed a part of its exhibit at Chicago . The catalogue was prepared under the able direction of Miss Mary S. Cutler , of the New York State library , and contains a list of five thousand books , thought best for the average public library , selected from the entire range of letters by more than fifty leading librarians , and arranged in three distinct catalogues in order to illustrate the Dewey decimal system of classification of books , the new system recently brought out by Mr. Charles A. Cutter , and the principles of the dictionary catalogue . This work will form the basis of a classified , annotated and indexed list of best books on all subjects to be undertaken by the next section of the association to be organized , the bibliographic section . The college library section was organized at St. Louis in 1889 , and the trustees section at Fabyan 's in 1890 . Both have done efficient work in the special lines in which they are interested . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies whose power and influence in the library world are perhaps quite as potent within their several spheres as is the association 's in its . These are the Library Journal , Library School , state associations , local clubs and Library Bureau . The first number of the Libra ; y Journal was received at the Philadelphia conference . From the beginning it has been the official organ of the association , and indispensable to those who wished to keep abreast of library thought and work . A complete file of the Journal constitutes a bibliothecal library in itself , and is a valuable supplement to the government report in the matter of library history . It was the first paper of its kind to be started , and has been followed in England by The Library ( lironicle , now The Library , 1884 to date ; in Germany by C'entralbla// fur Bib/i ot/iekswesen , 1889 to date ; and in Italy by Revisfa del/a Bibhioteclie . In this connection may also be mentioned Library No/es , a magazine whose numbers have contained valuable articles on improved methods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still published , though at irregular intervals . Coincident with the growth of the library movement has been the development of the librarian . From a mere keeper of books he has become a factor , and an important factor , in the intellectual life of to-day . Librarianship has become a profession . It is beginning to demand men trained for its definite work just as much as the doctor , or the lawyer , or the minister is educated for his . It was in consequence of this demand that the trustees of Columbia College reported unanimously in May , 1884 , in favor of establishing the Columbia College School of Library Economy under the direction of Melvil Dewey , then in charge of the college library . The school opened Jan. * , 1887 , a course of three months being offered , . At the end of the course , which // was lengthened to four months , a majority of the class had decided to take the two years ' course which was then offered . In the second year of its history the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third year it was made to correspond to the regular collegiate year of Columbia College . In i888 Mr. Dewey was elected secretary of the University of the State of New York and director of the New York State library . In consequence , the school was transferred by the trustees of Columbia to the regents of the University of the State of New York , and from New York City to Albany . At the same time the standard of admission was raised ; the curriculum broadened so as to include thorough instruction in the three great departments of library knowledge , - library economy , administration and . bibliographical science ; the requirements for graduation raised , and the degrees B. L. S. , M. L. S. and D. L. S. established by the regents . The school is in the hands of an earnest , sympathetic , wide-awake and thoroughly competent faculty . The pupils have done hard and conscientious work . The Library School has come to stay , and is bound to develop , because it is an institution which the library world in particular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has done more than to accomplish its own particular work . It has inspired the establishment of the library training schools now conducted in connection with the Pratt Institute library , Brooklyn ; the Drexel Institute , Philadelphia ; the Armour Institute , Chicago ; and the Los Angeles ( Cal . ) Public library . For the past three years Mr. W. I. Fletcher has also directed a successful summer course in library economy at Amherst , Mass . The state associations are supplemental to the national association . Their object is the more specific work pertaining to the commonwealth within which they are organized . The fact that fourteen states have followed New York in establishing such associations seems to demonstrate the fact that their work is productive of good results , and that there is a reason for their existence and efforts . The New York state association was organized in 1890 ; Iowa , New Hampshire , Massachusetts and New Jersey followed in 1891 ; and Connecticut , Pennsylvania , XVisconsin , Maine , Michigan , Kansas , Southern California , Minnesota , Indiana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state associations , so , in turn , the state associations are supplemented by library clubs , whose object is to advance local library interests . The New York library club was organized in 1885 , and the Chicago club in 1891 . The success of these clubs and the real benefit derived from their meeting will , without doubt , inspire the organization of still others in cities and towns where the library is beginning to attract the consideration not only of actual library workers , but all those interested in the educational affairs of the community and its general well-being and advancement . It was recognized at the Philadelphia meeting that some practical means of bringing the benefits of co-operation into actual service was an absolute need . A committee was appointed to carry out recommendations as to improved methods and labor-saving appliances for simplifying and cheapening library work , and taking charge of any manufacturing , publishing or other business that could most satisfactorily be accomplished by such co-operation . At the end of three years the work had increased to such an extent that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the establishment of the Library Bureau , an institution which has no connection with the association , but one which works in full harmony with its spirit and aims . It supplements the association by publishing , manufacturing or furnishing everything , except books , that a perfectly equipped library needs , from a catalogue card to iron shelving . XVithin the past year it has begun what is perhaps its most useful work , that is , printing catalogue cards of leading new publications and standard works , thus cataloguing once for all the great mass of books which are now catalogued in each of hundreds of libraries . The development of the interest in , and demand for these fascinating things // we call books , these wonderful records of all time and all knowledge , has been traced through its various stages . Each step in the progress of evolution was the result of a demand , each demand the result of the grasping of possibilities , each revelation of possibility an incentive to still further advancement . The growth of the public library in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every phase of social economy with which the thought of the world is now concerned . The disciples of the Spencerian school of reasoning have cried out against it ; but the common sense of the people has not recognized in the library a harmful socialistic institution , but rather an institution so essential to the best good of all that it was eminently fitting it should be supported by all . And now what is the modern library movement ? What is its moving thought , its scope , its purpose , its aspiration ? The modern library movement is a movement to increase by every possible means the accessibility of books , to stimulate their reading , and to create a demand for the best . Its motive is helpfulness ; its scope , instruction and recreation ; its purpose , the enlightenment of all ; its aspiration , still greater usefulness . It is a distinctive movement , because it recognizes , as never before , the infinite possibilities of the public library , and because it has done everything within its power to develop those possibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , which the movement has made clear and greatly advanced , are its relations to the school and university extension . The education of an individual is coincident with the life of that individual . It is carried on by the influences and appliances of the family , vocation , government , the church , the press , the school and the library . I'he library is unsectarian , and hence occupies a field independent of the church . It furnishes a foundation for an intelligent reading of paper and magazine . It is the complement and supplement of the school , co-operating with the teacher in the work of educating the child , and furnishing the means for continuing that edu cation after the child has gone out from the school . These are important relations . From the beginning the child is taught the value of books . In the kindergarten period he learns that they contain beautiful pictures ; in the grammar grades they do much to make history and geography attractive ; in the high school they are indispensable as works of reference . Few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they have been taught to read , and are graduated into the world in possession of a power of almost infinite possibilities . It is as the means by which that power may be developed that the supplemental work of the library begins . Were it not for the library , the education of the masses would , in most cases , cease when the doors of the school swing in after them for the last time ; but it keeps those doors wide open , and is , in the truest sense of the word , the university of the people . The library is as much a part of the educational system of a community as the public school , and is coming more and more to be regarded with the same respect and supported in the same generous manner . It is not necessary to consider here the means which have been employed to increase the usefulness of the library in this respect ; but sufficient to say that it is constantly increasing , that librarians are fully alive to this function of the library , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The relation of the library to university extension is perhaps even closer than its relation to the public school , for its character makes it the most natural local centre of this form of education , and often its organizing force . Indeed , the question of university extension was first publicly presented in An*rica before the American Library Association , when , in 1887 , at the Thousand Islands , Dr. Herbert B. Adams of Johns Hopkins University , pointed out to librarians their peculiar opportunities for inaugurating and aiding the work . Mr. J. N. Lamed , superintendent of the Buffalo library , and Mr. F. M. Crunden , librarian of the St. Louis Public library , were the first to act on // Mr. Adams 's suggestion . Other libraries followed . Then New York state recognized the movement by making it a department of the university of the state , with the state library as the basis of its inspiration and supplies . To-day the relation between the library and university extension is firmly established , and in a natural stage of development . With its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its intelligent librarian and studious atmosphere , the library provides university extension with an attractive and appropriate home , and university extension , on its part , furnishes the library with that which it most covets , an added constituency . These are but two of  --  the many ways by which the public library is endeavoring to serve the public . The modern library spirit has found within the expansive walls of the institution possibilities which half a century ago were not even dreamed of ; and is directing all its energy to finding the means of realizing these possibilities . It began its work at the very foundation . The library of to-day is centrally located , well housed , ventilated , heated and lighted , well arranged , catalogued and manned . It aims not only to furnish books , but the best books , and thus to raise the standard of reading . Especially has great care been taken to guide the reading of the young , and by a most careful selection of juvenile literature to create in the child a desire for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects are comparatively new features , and offer great assistance to the reader . Access to shelves by the general public is becoming more and more general , the tendency being to do away just so far as possible with all restrictions to the use of books and the library . The hours of opening are longer , the days of closing fewer , and it is entirely probable that the time is not far distant when the great majority of the libraries of the country will be open every day . The library has begun to study thoroughly and systematically the community , and to shape its course to meet the best needs of the material , intellectual and moral advancement of its people . Its aspirations are unlimited . It sees that its shelves are well stocked with books on subjects most closely allied to the business and manufacturing interests about it . It provides art , literary and scientific clubs with the material necessary to carry on their work . Books of music , vocal and instrumental , were added , then music-rooms themselves , with piano and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Books on drawing and photography were found in the old days as a matter of course . Now drawing-rooms , with tables and fixtures , and dark rooms in which negatives may be developed , are beginning to find their place . The class-room , the lectureroom , the gallery of art , the museum with its many objects of local historical interest , are common . But the modern librarian will tell you that all this is but the beginning . The public library has provided the novel as a means of recreation , the art gallery to develop the artistic taste , the drawing-room for the convenience of the mechanic , and the entire library for intellectual gratification . Is there any reason why it should stop here ? When the open fire , the easy-chair and the study lamp were placed in the reading-rooms of libraries , the principle of attractiveness as a means of accomplishing good results was established . That same principle , if extended , will provide such accessories as will attract not one class but all classes , and will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities of this third function are not foreign to the library thought of the age and are among the problems of the near future . The public library of to-day is an active , potential force , serving the present , and silently helping to develop the civilization of the future . The spirit of the modern library movement which surrounds it is thoroughly catholic , thoroughly progressive , and thoroughly in sympathy with the people . It believes that the true function of the library is to serve the people , and that the only test of success is usefulness .
