txt Patriotism , not politics ; no man in the - United States will be more deeply and heartily rejoiced at the reform " round-up " made yesterday by President CLEVELAND than THEODORE , ROOSEVELT . In party views they are as wide apart as men can be . In devotion to their common country they are as closely united as men can be . Each in his way has done noble service to this cause , and nothing in their respective careers is more honorable . Evidently the labors of Herren SEIDL and DAMROSCH and ABBEY in Brooklyn have not been in vain . A knowledge of what music really is has been spread deeply all over that city , and even church choir rows , which used to he based on trivialities like the use made of their bright eyes by the soprano and the contralto , and its effect on masculine merrilitrs of the congregation , have now come to he controversies in criticism , and in these controversies musical methods are discussed with a learning and appreciation that are really astonishing . Formerly these wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide the goodness of singing  --  which is different . The advance that has been made is well shown by some remarks uttered by the wife Of Mr. CHARLES RAAPE , who attends the Lutheran church on Driggs Avenue , of which her husband is a pillar . She says that the choir there has done well to resign , because they sang in a style so absurd that " nobody could ever tell what was coming . " First one would sing , then two , and only now and then would the whole choir get together and honestly earn their salaries . As Mrs. RAAPE declares , " that 's no way to sing . " Mr. RAAPE goes further and insists that the lack of continuous industry shown by the singers proves that they would be more at home in a theatre than in a church , but this is an obvious effort to ? treat the case in the old moral way , rather than in the new artistic one , and as musical criticism , of course , it can not be commended . In Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistically , than the men are . IMISIG ? ? ? ? ? 1 ? 1 ? ?
