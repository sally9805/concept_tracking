txt WHY are we beaten by England and Germany in our competition for the trade of Central and South America , and in other markets where our skill and the quality of our goods should give ns better fortunes ? A casual remark iu a popular periodical some months ago , which attributed our failure in this respect largely to our inefficient consular service , brought upon me correspondence from consuls and from business men , which induced me to give the subject more serious study , by examining consular reports and consulting manufacturers . Since this correspondence was provoked there has appeared an executive order in regard to the service which puts a new aspect upon the matter , and appears to be a firm step in a radical reform . The subject is of so much importance to our national prosperity that I trust a slight review of it will not be inopportune . This extension of our export trade can conveniently be considered under three heads : 1 . The Consular Service . 2 . The Action of Manufacturers , Merchants and Exporters . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Consular Service . The Executive order of September 20 , 1895 , provided , in the words of the President 's last annual message " That after that date any vacancy in a consulate or commercial agency , with an annual salary or compensation from officials of not more than *2,5OO , or less than *1 , OOO , should be filled either by transfer or promotion from some other position under the Department of State , of a character tending to qnalify the incumbent for the position to be filled ; or by the appointment of a person not under the Department of State , but having pre 7 // viously served under and shown his capacity and fitness for consular duty : or by the appointment of a person who , having been selected by the President and sent to a board for examination , is found , upon such examination , to be qualified for the position . Posts which pay less than $1,000 being usually , on account of their small compensation , filled by selection from residents of the locality , it was not deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation of $2,500 was adopted as the maximum limit in the classification for the reason that consular officers receiving more than that sum are often charged with functions and duties scarcely inferior in dignity and importance to those of diplomatic agents , and it was , therefore , thought best to continue their selection in the discretion of the executive without subjecting them to examination before a board . Excluding seventy-one places with compensation at present less than $1,000 , and fiftythree places above the maximum in compensation , the number of positions remaining within the scope of the order is 196 . " A board of examiners is appointed to carry out this order , which it is desired that Congress should supplement and improve by legislation . Consular inspectors are also recommended . This is a brave beginning , and if it is seconded by intelligent public opinion , it may lead to a consistent , organized consular system . It will no doubt be found that permanent appointments to the service , as a rule , with a few outlandish exceptions , should extend to officers paid less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training schools in which young men can leavn their business ; and it is imperative that the offices paying more than $2,500 should be open to the ambition and reward of all in the service , it being a life service with promotion for ability and assignments to the more important posts according to fitness . The question of a permanent systematized service has been often argued , but it will bear restating . The consul is a business officer , without diplomatic functions except in a few cases ; he has nothing to do with politics . That he should be intelligent and patriotic-thoroughly American in sympathy-goes without saying . But to be efficient he must also have business training , experience of consular duties , and special fitness for the locality to which he is sent . It is a business to be learned like any other , and it will not be learned unless it offers a regular career to the aspirants for it . No business man in the world , no corporation , would undertake to carry on enterprises with agents selected on account of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents selected in like manner . Many good men get consulates through political influence , but in the slight tenure of their office they no sooner get a little fitted // for their work than they are thrown out by an election , turned back into politics to scramble for another place , and their places are filled with green men . The statement of our plan shows its absurdity . That we do not get as good service as other nations get is not due to our want of native ability in our appointees , but to the instability of tenure . If all our present appointees , with some weeding out , were trained intQ an organized service , with expectation of promotion , and a life career , we should have in ten years an admirable service ; that is , if the appointees were compelled to have a business training in their occupation , and to become familiar with the languages of the posts they occupy . Up to the present ti me appointments are made very often of men who can neither read , write nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent . The consequence is that the business of the offices must be done by subordinates who are foreigners , and sometimes by inferior men who will work for small pay . The consuls are compelled to rely upon these foreigners for information upon all subjects and for nearly every official act they perform . There are many American consular offices on the Continent , and doubtless elsewhere , that could not run a day except for the aid of these foreign assistants . These subordinates are commonly permanent , and they practically have control of the offices . They have control because the consuls are ignorant of the local language , and can only get information of our commercial and business relations second hand . It would be interesting to know how many of our statistical consular reports are really the work of foreign clerks . This may or may not be a criticism of them , but it would be more satisfactory to know that our own men were competent to make them . We have men in the consular service fully as bright and alert and every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , and probably they are less liable to get into a rut . But , allowing for this , the service of many other nations is more *efflcient than ours because it is systemized and permanent , and because promotion depends at every step upon efficiency . And the esprit de corps counts for much . But it must be added that no service is really good that is not constantly w*tched and weeded . The tests of fitness can not all be applied at the entrance . Granted the necessity of an organized service , how shall appointments be made ? Objection is made to admission by // " examinations . " The objection is partly but not altogether political . For it is true that capacities often exist that no examination will show , and that mere book-learning and ability to answer test questions may exist with a poor character and want of practical ability in affairs . But we must have some system . The alternative to examination is political favor . We know how uncertain a test of capacity that is . Examinations a proper examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two things general intelligence , and knowledge of languages . It will be admitted without argument that a consul should know the language of the country to which he is sent . Admission by examination , as in England , is the democratic method . No class is favored , no game of politics is played . Every poor lad in England who has ability has as good a chance for the service as the rich or the aristocracy . It should be so in America . Examination , to be sure , is not everything . The candidate should go into a subordinate clerkship on probation to learn his business . If he is incompetent he should be dropped . But if he develops capacity and does good service he should be promoted , and have a tenure during good behavior . And at the end of a life service he should be pensioned . This is a clear perquisite of any moderately paid life service to the state . We should have no difficulty in appending this to our consular service , if we were not now loaded down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The replies of the consuls in regard to the causes of our lack of foreign trade are various , as will appear in selections from their reports , but they have no doubt that in its personnel it is as good as any other . The duty , of the consul , it is said , is primarily to see that our government is not cheated in the value of its importations , to take care of the government property , and to relieve distressed seamen and travellers . Incidentally it is to encourage the sale of American products . That success in this last respect is not greater is not the fault of the consuls , but arises from quite other causes , one of them being the strange indifference of American manufacturers and exporters to the specific directions for increasing their trade in different countries conveyed in the consular reports . Another prime cause is one that is also referred to by manufacturers and exporters and that // is lack of sufficient and regular transportation between our ports and those of Central and South America . Other correspondents censure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and failure to encourage regular lines of communication . Other governments , it is said , interest themselves in the matter and take active measures to assist the merchants by fostering regular steamship communication . The English and German lines are paid by their respective governments for cariying the mails a sufficient sum to insure their permanence , and the merchants can establish agencies with a certainty that their trade will not languish for want of communication . The policy of our government is exactly the reverse of this ; our mail service is conducted with the single idea of cheapness and we have only uncertain communication with our South American neighbors . It is argued that an attempt should be made to arouse manufacturers and exporters to intelligent , vigorous and united action . It is easy to grumble ; it requires study and well-directed enterprise to attack the problem as the inhabitants and governments of England and Germany attack it . The laissez faire method will not solve it , any more than that will remove the financial and moral plague-spot in our national life  --  the greenback and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our exports is only one of the duties of a consul , and an incidental duty , but it has come to be regarded as very important . It is also true that our service has greatly improved in the past fifteen years-that I think is a matter of general observation . The character of the consular reports shows this . The extracts from them published monthly are of great value , full of statistical information , suggestions as to our economic legislation , and in detail instructive to our manufacturers and traders as to the kind of goods wanted in the various markets , and as to the best means of reaching those markets . Given a fair chance of training and system , I believe our service would speedily surpass all others in enterprise and the application of common sense , in inventiveness and shrewdness. 2 . The Action of Manufacturers and Exporters . The consuls can give information about markets , about the kind of goods wanted and most likely to sell ; they can encourage trade , but they can not create it . The initiative must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the market , / // they must make the goods suited to it ( which may differ from the goods suited to the American market ) if they really want the market , and they must have active agents on the ground , and they must find means of sending on their products regularly . The charge is made that our manufacturers are sluggish , and show lack of intelligent enterprise in this matter . They seem to be waiting for some circumstance , some action of the government may be , to open the way for them . They are ingenious and inventive , they improve processes , and make better and better goods at a lower cost of manufacture , but their energies seem to stop at the point of delivery . The English , on the contrary , understand that a part of their business is to find and create markets . And the government seconds them in this ; its action is even stigmatized as the " Manchester policy . " But the manufacturers take the initiative . One of the most notable things in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on getting markets . Goods are made to suit the tastes and traditions of all sorts of civilizations and all sorts of barbarisms . And both these specialties and the regular English goods are pushed upon the world . Agents , travellers , drummers are sent everywhere , the English consuls are made to be active in promoting trade , and steamship lines , established by private enterprise , go regularly to every part of the globe . When these are established the government at once adopts the lines and sustains them by a liberal grant for carrying the mails regularly . The English are not only Ii vely manufacturers , they are resourceful merchants as well . They are pushers in small things as well as great . The London tailors and boot-makers , when they get a foreign customer follow him up , they constantly solicit his orders , they send agents and establish in central points offices to get orders . Germany , in late years , is scarcely second in this endeavor . The German success , in the exhibit of machinery at Chicago , has stimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new efforts . Highly educated agents of manufacturers are to be sent out , to Africa as well as to South America , to study the export question , to report on the wants of special markets , and to drum np trade . This will cost money . No single firm could stand the expense . A multitude of manufacturers , therefore , club together , sharing the responsibility and the // cost , and the profits in case of success . The reports are the common property of the subscribers . It is now a veritable movement . The government at once expressed a lively interest and promised aid . As long ago as 1893 nineteen firms , representing 7,506 workmen , had subscribed . The details of this movement are interesting , but a hint of it ought to be sufficient for our enterprising people , whose ingenuity is always pushing them on to what is called over production . We can make just as good machines as any people in the world , indeed the American machine is , we verily believe , the best in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make what the markets demand . A consular report from Chemnitz says : " Let us give the South Americans such shapes as they prefer , but finished as we finish . There is nothing made in England or Germany in the machine or tool line that we can not make as good or better . If the South American prefers plain to polished , heavy to light , rough to smooth , let him have them . It is much easier to sell a man what he thinks he wants than it is to sell him what we think he ought to buy . Our hammers , hatchets , axes , spades , shovels , planes , augers , bits , patent stocks and bits , wringers , sewingandwashingmachines , hair-cutters , and tools of every profession and description should beat not only Germany 's but England 's , in every South American city and market . There is no good reason why , with our improved methods and our well-known superior machinery and quicker workmanship , we should not make them as cheap . I know we can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out engineer agents-men trained in mechanics , and able to speak Spanish , French , or other languages . Let them carry catalogues and commissions to sell anything from a paper of pins to a Corliss engine . Let our manufacturers , emulating the Germans , unite to pay the expenses . Let great efforts be concentrated in places offering a market . " In regard to this German movement it is to be noticed that the German government is making an innovation in its consular service . One report from Bamberg says : " There is no doubt that the German consuls by profession  --  the appointment of honorary consular officers being now gradually on the decline in Germany-are to be regarded as the foremost pioneers in the service of German commerce . However , it must not be forgotten that they are aided in their efforts by the various industrial branches themselves , whereas American consular officers receive // but little support of that nature . As long as American firms whose products would , in all probability , find a ready sale in European markets , fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaided efforts of a consular officer would meet with small success . " Take the case of San Salvador . American goods there have the highest reputation ; the English and German goods are inferior but they are cheaper . The consuls think that we are at disadvantage owing to our short credit system and our lack of transportation facilities , which produces the anomalous result of cheaper freight rates from European than from American ports . With lower freights our goods could be sold cheaper . A curious illustration of our unsystematic and careless handling of export goods is in the cotton trade . In comparison with the Egyptian and Indian bales , the American is so badly packed as to cause great loss ; the covers burst and the cotton is scattered , or stolen , or badly damaged by rain and mud . The Consul at Chemnitz exhibits photographs of the appearance of bales that arrive there . The Egyptian and Indian are solid and in good order ; the American is in a very disorganized condition . This causes just complaint . In Peru , England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trade that might be ours . Peru has one of the most genial climates in the world , and unlimited resources for producing sugar , cotton , coffee , rice , petroleum , salts , etc. , etc . It would be a most profitable country for us to cultivate . Why do we not have its trade ? The consul , passing by considerations of our economic policy , says : " The failure of the American people and government to provide easy , cheap and quick transportation for mails , freights and travel must , however , be largely accountable for this condition . " Take one illustration : " San Francisco mails are carried to New Orleans in less than five days . As steamships can go from New Orleans to Colon in less than four days , it follows that San Francisco fast mails could be conveyed that way to Panama in nine days . It now takes the San Francisco mails twenty-two days to reach Panama by the Pacific Mail steamers . " From Callao to Colon is 1,600 miles , from Colon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callao to Colon 1,600 , from Colon to New York 2,026 , or 3,626 , in all . From Callao to Colon 1,600 , from Colon to principal // European ports 5,500 , or 7,100 in all . " With an enterprise worthy of imitation , some seventy European steamers ply regularly between European ports and Colon . Among these a Liverpool line has steamers which on their return trip stop at New Orleans to complete cargo , but which , on their way out , do not stop at New Orleans . rme effect is obvious . New Orleans , the ' nearest American seaport-which is the natural outlet of the great valleys of the Missouri , the Mississippi and the Ohio-is left undisturbed in its strange isolation from the South American countries on the Pacific Ocean . " The whole report , dated Callao , February , 1894 , is worth the attention of all our manufacturers and exporters . We are at an equal disadvantage in the trade with Uruguay . Here also , the first question to be settled is that of transportation . But there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Europeans constantly put forth . " Let the American merchant and maunfacturer be just as accommodating as his European competitor in the manufacture and get-up of his goods , in the terms of sale and the way he places his goods before the trade . Let him adopt the modus operandior rather improve upon it if he can-of his competitors . " They have no objection to American raw material , but they unitedly work against American manufactured goods . Another suggestion is that there shall be an American bank in Uruguay . Nearly all the business is done through foreign banks-English chiefly . We are paying England a tribute on the business we are doing in that country . Attention is called also to Para , a city that commands 50,000 miles of navigable rivers which float and extend her trade , and flow through one of earth 's richest valleys . Here is a splendid field for our enterprise . But here again , is almost absolute lack of regular transportation by sea . " The only articles of which we have a monopoly in Para are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying all the cotton goods , instead of the very small proportion we now send there . The universal cry of men representing American houses at Para is that our manufacturers will not comply with the demands of the market , while English , French and German manufacturers accede to every demand . " Greatly needed are wholesale distributing houses and banking facilities . / // With friendly Venezuela , better disposed to us than any other power , there is no excuse for the want of energy in our merchants and manufacturers in regard to occupying the inviting field . Here , however , a consular report furnishes an illustration of the effect of the vacillation in our economic legislation . Our exports to Venezuela , the consul testifies , bear a direct relation to our imports of her products . In 1891 she sent us products to the value of $8,000,000 ( gold ) . This was paid for by purchase of merchandise in the United States instead of in Europe . The situation underwent a change when it was announced that duties would be levied on Venezuelan products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all went to the Uuited States , and was paid for by American products . With the change in legislation this coffee was thrown upon European markets , and much of the merchandise heretofore had from the United States was purchased in Europe . Our trade steadily decreased , and when , later , " the duties were finally removed and Venezuelan coffee was again permitted free entry , " a tenth only of the Venezuelan berry that we formerly received entered our ports . It will take years to recover our trade lost in this one item . But our traders can not too soon be on hand to take advantage of the expiration of the European contracts . These examples illustrate the situation . It is not one of which Americans can be proud . In regard to foreign trade , our country seems , in comparison with foreign countries , an inert mass , waiting for something to turn up . If our manufacturers and merchants showed the same energy , the same intelligence , the same adaptability to the market in foreign that they show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We go on inventing and making the best goods in the world , but when it comes to delivery we seem to be paralyzed . We seem content with our superior products , hoping that the world will find out how good they are , and come and buy . With our skill and increasing capital , the day has come when we make more goods than the home market can consume . This condition of what we call over-production will be intensified year by year . But we have no right to whine about over-production so long as we are supine in seeking markets for our products . The consuls complain that their reports of the foreign situation are not read or not heeded by our manufacturers and exporters . Some *German traders complain that they can not deal directly // with our manufacturers as they wish to do . They are turned over to miscellaneous commission houses . It seems to be the opinion of some manufacturers , who do not make an effort to establish means of communication , as the Euglish do , that the South American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies are so shifting and uncertain that it is difficult to establish satisfactory relations among them . The Southern dealers require longer credits than are agreeable , and have slack business habits very unprofitable to conform to . Other nations , especially Germany , continually imitate the firstclass American goods , produce inferior and cheaper qualities , and counterfeit our trade-marks . The Americans have an honorable reluctance to lower the standard of their products below the American standard . They also complain of want of government encouragement of transportation , but they complain still more of our fluctuating economic and financial policy , of the frequent changes in duties , the establishment and withdrawal of reciprocities , and a general unsettled action in which in the matter of trade and investment of capital and establishment of foreign agencies no foresight will avail . Not English , French or German traders have to contend with such an uncertainty . 3 . The Active Interest of the Government . By this I do not refer to its discriminating economic legislation , nor to the complete organization of the consular service . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promote trade without going beyond its province . They are modern , to be sure , but they are sanctioned by the most conservative governments in the enterprising nations , by France , Enoland and Germany . A brief description of their nature b would be that they bring the governments of the country into close and sympathetic touch with the industries , the trade , and commerce of their countries . This is an industrial age , and in response to this the action of government in its foreign relations must be quite as much concerned with industrial as with diplomatic problems . It is agreed on all hands , by the testimony of manufacturers , merchants , and consular agents , that a chief cause of our unsatisfactory trade , as has been said , especially with the nations south of us , is a lack of easy , frequent , regular steam communication . It is clearly not the business of the government to run // steamships , any more than it is to build warehouses . Steam communication must come from private initiative . Bnt when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is quite within the wisdom and duty of the government , touching its customs receipts , its internal revenue , to aid the country in being prosperous by liberal payment to all such lines for carrying the mails . All wise governments do this , whether their general policy be free trade , fair trade , or protection . It is good business . A second method of aiding our industries and our trade with foreign ports is indicated in a sentence quoted in one of our consular reports from the Revue de Commerce Exterieur of October , 1893 : " The obligation of the State to give information to merchants as to the methods to be pursued in order to open foreign markets to French products . " This would involve the use of our consular service in procuring information , its publication , and its distribution . The Germans are alive to the value of this work , and the government actively co.operates with the manufacturers and traders in it . Our own government is not blind to this . The character of our own consular reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Besides giving mere statistics , which always need an explanation , the consuls study causes of the lack of trade , tell how it can be improved , and speak of the resources of the country and the tastes of the people they are accredited to . Not all these reports are valuable or trustworthy , because many of those who make them lack training and experience , but month by month our government prints a mass of information of the greatest interest to our business men . So far as a stranger can judge , our bureau of statistics selects wisely and prints judiciously and liberally . But there is evidence that these reports are unheeded ( so some of the consuls complain ) , and they probably are not widely read , and do not fall into the hands of business men who would profit by them . It needs to establish a more sympathetic connection between the officials at Washington and the business men and interests of the country . As I understand it , our government publishes this information and that ends its concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , as to what can be done and how it can be done , and not dry statistics such as would suit a writer on economics . The consuls can be trained *o give these . But how shall the facts // reach business men ? Whether it is owing to the neglect or obtuseness of the business public or to the government bureau , there is a defect in the communication of this information . A manufacturer or exporter can not , or thinks he can not , keep the run of all the literature on this subject . But every week or every day , he wants precise , definite information on some particular point , as to some port of trade . How can he get it ? The Revue suggests this plan : " A set of employees constantly occupied in making abstracts of French official and foreign reports and newspapers and in extracting from them whatever would interest our commerce . Another group to inscribe those abstracts or the indication of their origin ( the original being carefully classified ) upon cards which should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be to answer inquiries , either verbally or in writing . Thanks to the cards these answers could be easy and that which would be furnished wouldbe real information . Extracts from these indications would be forwarded to the chambers of commerce , the syndicate chambers , the exportation companies , and by this means French commerce could be usefully informed . " I am incapable of judging of the value of this as a practical plan . I quote it to emphasize the defect of which we are all conscious . But in considering this whole subject of government aid to trade , it must not be forgotten that the initiative is to come from the people themselves . Given a competent consular service , and legitimate encouragement in transportation , they must work out their own salvation.
