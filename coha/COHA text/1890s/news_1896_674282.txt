txt The early returns from the canvass of voters in this county made by the Republican County Committee do not bear out the remark recently attributed to Major Byrne of the HonestMoney League , that the centre of the State is aflame for free silver . The County Committee sent out a. short time ago blanks to every township , with instructions to its workers to ascertain and report names of voters " Who have been Republicans , and will vote for Bryan , " and " who have been Democrats , and will vote for . " The returns from two towns had just been received , when a correspondent of THE NEW-Yonx TIMES called at county headquarters to-day . The lists were shown , and the official said he would be glad to let THE TIMES make public the results . One town ? was Cicero .

" " How is it in this city ? " was asked . " We have returns from only a few election districts , but those indicate a greater gain for than the country does . " A slip was produced containing the changes in the Fifth District of the Eighth Ward . That is strongly Republican . every year .

Ex-Senatoi Francis Hendricks , who is reckoned ' one of " the- ' eloseit " and most accurate observers of the political drift , not only in this county , but in the State , says he can see no - indication that the Repub- ' licans are . not holding their own vote , and in some sections making gains from Democrats who wi , 11 not . support the Chicago platform . The canvass , ? he says , shows that . One district showed 19 Democrats who say they are going to vote for . Making calculations on the entire vote of the State , based on the results of the canvass in such districts as he has . heard from , Mr. Hendricks says that Bryan will lose about 200,000 Democratic votes in New-York . This on the assumption that a Portion of Onondaga County represents the average condition throughout the State .

The first meeting was held in response to a call sent out by William A. Beach , who was one of the delegates to the Indianapolis Convention . " I believe I am not far out of the way when I say there are between 1,500 and 2,000 Democrats in this county who will stand for sound money , " said Mr. Beach . " In my judgment , 1,500 is the minimufa. number . I do not know what proportion of them will vote for the third ticket . I know that a considerable number will support . " " HON ' , many , in your judgment ? " " I should not be much surprised If onehalf of them did so . If the third ticket receives 1,000 votes in this county it will not be far off from such calculations as I am. able to make at this time . No one will ever know how many Democrats supported .

Yale , who has for years been a Hill Democrat , a. man prominent in business , and last year Chairman of the Democratic County Committee , is taking no interest in Mr. Bryan . Soon after the Chicago Convention he announced that he could not support the Chicago ticket . He has not told , any one whether he will vote for any candidate . Col. J. H.

They are sending out some literature on tariff . subjects . The regular Democratic organization here is for Bryan as much as Tammany Hall is for him . Mayor Maguire and those that follow in the  --  wake of the machine are for the Chicago platform .
