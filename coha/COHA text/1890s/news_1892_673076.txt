txt Late , but with a start and an awful yell , our esteemed contemporary , the Herald , has awakened to the dangers to which this country is exposed from the coming of " English cheap laborers " ; just as a heavy sleeper roused toward midday jumps in utmost disorder out of bed and loudly calls on Death and Apollyon in his wrath at having missed his breakfast and all the trains . For some twelve years , now ME : TIMES and all other tariffreform papers have dinned it into the ears of the wage earners that their labor was about the only article of consequence in the United States that was not protected , and every newspaper in the land has noted how Hungarian , Italian , Polish , and other " cheap laborers " were pouring in to compete with our native and naturalized workingmen for the high wages so alluringly pictured forth to them in the polyglot circulars of European emigration agencies and steamship lines . Now that the Herald has found it out there would seem to be nobody in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer with impregnable defenses against foreign competition it leaves the wage earner without shelter from the pauper and pitiless rivalry of the industrious Dago and the frugal Magyar . In the contract labor law , however , the American laborer has the form and in a considerable measure the substance of a defense against the competition of Old World pauper labor . From the " English cheap laborer " we have very little to fear , for reasons that are perfectly well known to those who have given any attention to the subject . And on the whole , the Herald 's " English cheap laborer " argument has about the same relation to the issues of this campaign that Gen. PLEASANTON 'S blue-glass cure did to orthodox therapeutics .
