OVER THE TEACUPS . XII . THERE was a great tinkling of teaspoons the other evening , when I took my seat at the table , where all The Teacups were gathered before my entrance . The whole company arose , and the Mistress , speaking for them , expressed the usual sentiment appropriate to such occasions . " Many happy returns " is the customary formula . No matter if the object of this kind wish is a centenarian , it is quite safe to assume that he is ready and very willing to accept as many more years as the disposing powers may see fit to allow him . The meaning of it all was that this was my birthday . My friends , near and distant , had seen fit to remember it , and to let me know in various pleasant ways that they had not forgotten it . The tables were adorned with flowers . Gifts of pretty and pleasing objects were displayed on a side table . A great green wreath , which must have cost the parent oak a large fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baskets of flowers which had half unpeopled greenhouses , large bouquets of roses , fragrant bunches of pinks , and many beautiful blossoms I am not botanist enough to name had been coming in upon me all day long . Many of these offerings were brought by the givers in person : many caine with notes as fragrant with good wishes as the flowers they accompanied with their natural perfumes . How old was I , The Dictator , once known by another equally audacious title , - I , the recipient of all these favors and honors ? I had cleared the eightbarred gate , which few come iii sight of , and fewer , far fewer , go over , a year before . I was a trespasser on the domain belonging to another generation . The children of my coevals were fast getting gray and bald , and their children beginning to look upon the world as belonging to them , and not to their sires and grandsires . After that leap over the tall barrier , it looks like a kind of impropriety to keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it seems to me almost of the nature of a misdemeanor to be wandering about in the preserve which the fleshless gamekeeper guards so jealously . But , on the other hand , I remember that men of science have maintained that the natural life of man is nearer fivescore than threescore years and ten . I always think of a familiar experience which I bring from the French cafts , well known to me in my early manhood . One of the illustrated papers of my Parisian days tells it pleasaimtly enough . A guest of the establishment is sitting at his little table . He has just bad his coffee , and the waiter is serving him with his petit verre . Most of my readers know very well what a petit verre is , but there may be here and there a virtuous abstainer from alcoholic fluids , living among the bayberries and the sweet ferns , who is not aware that the words , as commonly used , signify a small glass - a very small glass - of spirit , commonly brandy , taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " neat . " I may remark by the way , is not quite so bad as it looks . Whiskey or rum taken unmixed from a tumbler is a knock-down blow to temperance , but the little thimbleful of brandy , or Chartreuse , or Maraschino , is only , as it were , tweaking the nose of teetotalism . Well , - to go back behind our brackets , - the guest is calling to the waiter , " Gar*on ! et le 6am de pieds I " Waiter ! and the foot-bath ! - The little glass stands in a small tin saucer or // shallow ( liSh , and the custom is to more than fill the glass , so that some extra brandy runs over into this tin saucer or cup-plate , to the manifest gain of the consumer . Life is a petit verre of a very peculiar kind of spirit . At seventy years it used to be said that the little glass was full . We should be more apt to put it at eighty in our day , while Gladstone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , writing , speaking , in the green preserve belonging to their children and grandchildren , and Bancroft is keeping watch of the gamekeeper in the distance . But , returning resolutely to the petit verre , I am willing to concede that all after fourscore is the baja de pieds , - the slopping over , so to speak , of the full measure of life . I remember that one who was very near and dear to me , and who lived to a great age , so that the ten-l ) arred gate of the century did not look very far off , would sometimes apologize in a very sweet , natural way for lingering so long to be a care and perhaps a burden to her children , themselves getting well into years . It is not hard to understand the feeling , never less called for than it was in the case of that beloved nonagenarian . I have known few persons , young or old , more sincerely and justly regretted than the gentle lady whose memory comes up before me as I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower as gracefully , as pleasingly , as we come into blossom ! I always think of the morning-glory as the loveliest example of a graceful yielding to the inevitable . It is beautiful before its twisted corolla opens ; it is comely as it folds its petals inward , when its brief hours of perfection are over . Women find it easier than men to grow old in a becoming way . A very old lady who has kept something , it may be a great deal , of her youthful feelings , who is daintily cared for , who is grateful for the attentions bestowed upon her , and enters into the spirit of the young lives that surround her , is as precious to those who love her as a gem in an antique setting , the fashion of which has long gone by , but which leaves the jewel the color and brightness which are its inalienable qualities . With old men it is too often different . They do not belong so much indoors as women do . They have no pretty little manual occupations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and fingers will let her . The old man smokes his pipe , but does not know what to do with his fingers , unless he plays upon some instrument , or has a mechanical turn which finds business for them . But the old writer , I said to The rreacups , as I say to you , my readers , labors under one special difficulty , which I am thinking of and exemplifying at this moment . He is constantly tending to reflect upon and discourse about his own particular stage of life . He feels that he must apologize for his intrusion upon the time and thoughts of a geneation which he naturally supposes must be tired of him , if they ever had any considerable regard for him . Now , if the world of readers hates anything it sees in print , it is apology . If what one has to say is worth saying , he need not beg par ( lon for saying it . If it is not worth saying - I will not finish the sentence . But it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Superfluous lags the veteran " is always repeating itself in his dull ear . What kind of audience or reading parish is a man who secured his constituency in middle life , or before that period , to expect when he has reached the age of threescore and twenty ? His coevals have dropped away by scores and tens , and he sees only a few units scattered about here and there , like the few heads above the water after a ship has gone to pieces . Does he write and publish for those of his own time o* // life ? He need not print a large edition . Does he hope to secure a hearing from those who have come into the reading world since his coevals ? They have found fresher fields and greener pastures . Their interests are in the outdoor , active world . Some of them are circumnavigating the planet while he is hitching his rocking-chair about his hearth-rug . Some are gazing upon the pyramids while he is staring at his andirons . Some are settling the tariff and fixing the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather bulletin , and going to sleep over the obituaries in his morning or evening paper . Nature is wiser than we give her credit for being ; neVer wiser than in her dealings with the old . She has no idea of mortifying them by sudden and wholly unexpected failure of the chief servants of consciousness . The sight , for instance , begins to lose something of its perfection long before its deficiency calls the owner 's special attention to it . Very probably , the first hint we have of the change is that a friend makes the pleasing remark that we are " playing the trombone , " as he calls it ; that is , moving a book we are holding backward and forward , to get the right focal distance . Or it may be we find fault with the lamp or the gas-burner for not giving so much light as it used to . At last , somewhere between forty and fifty , we begin to dangle a jaunty pair of eye-glasses , half plaything and half necessity . In due time a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age leaps upon it as his saddle , and rides triumphant , unchallenged , until the darkness comes which no glasses can penetrate . Nature is pitiless in carrying out the universal sentence , but very pitiful in her mode of dealing with the condemned on his way to the final scene . The man who is to be hanged always has a good breakfast provided for him . Do not think that the old look upon themselves as the helpless , hopeless , forlorn creatures which they seem to young people . Do these young folks suppose that all vanity dies out of the natures of old men and old women ? A dentist of olden time told me that a good-looking young man once said to him , " Keep that incisor presentable , if you can , till I am fifty , and then I sha' n't care how I look . " I venture to say that that gentleman was as particular about his per- sonal appearance and as proud of his good looks at fifty , and many years after fifty , as he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist . My dear friends around the teacups , and at that wider board where I am now entertaining , or trying to entertain , my company , is it not as plain to you as it is to me that I had better leave such tasks as that which I am just finishing to those who live in a more interesting period of life than one which , in the order of nature , is next door to decrepitude ? Ought I not to regret having undertaken to report the doings and sayings of the members of the circle which you have known as The Teacups ? Dear , faithful reader , whose patient eyes have followed my reports through these long months , you and I are about parting company . Perhaps you are one of those who have known me under another name , in those far-off days separated from these by the red sea of the great national conflict . When you first heard the tinkle of the teaspoons , as the table was being made ready for its guests , you trembled for me , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you did , - I trembled for myself . But I remembered the story of Sir Cloudesley Shovel , who was seen all of a tremor just as he was going into action . " How is this ? " said a brother officer to him . " Surely you are not afraid ? " " No , " he answered , " but my flesh trembles at the thought of the dangers into which my intrepid spirit will carry * // I knew the risk of undertaking to carry through a series of connected papers . And yet I thought it was better to run that risk , more manly , more sensible , than to give way to the fears which made my flesh tremble as did Sir Cloudesley Shovel 's . For myself the labor has been a distraction , and one which came at a time when it was needed . Sometimes , as in one of those poems recently published , - the reader will easily guess which , - the youthful spirit has conic over me in such a rush of young blood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's manifestation surprised Lady Macbeth . To repeat one of my comparisons , it was as if an early fruit had ripened on a graft upon an old , steady-going tree , to the astonishment of all its later-maturing products . I should hardly dare to say so much as this if I had not heard a similar opinion expressed by others . Once committed to my undertaking , there was no turning back . It is true that I had said I might stop at any moment , but after one or two numbers it seemed as if there were an informal pledge to carry the series on , as in former cases , until I had completed my dozen instalments . Writers and speakers have their idiosyncrasies , their habits , their tricks , if you had rather call them so , as to their ways of writing and speaking . There is a very old and familiar story , accompanied by a feeble jest , which most of my readers may probably enough have met with in Joe Miller or elsewhere . It is that of a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thread to work upon with his fingers while he was pleading . Some one stole it from him one day , and he could not get on at all with his speech , - he had lost the thread of his discourse , as the story had it . Now this is what I myself once saw . It was at a meeting where certain grave matters were debated in an assembly of professional men . A speaker , whom I never heard before or since , got up and made a long and forcible argument . I do not think he was a lawyer , but he spoke as if he had been trained to talk to juries . He held a long string in one hand , which he drew through the other hand incessantly , as he spoke , just as a shoemaker performs the motion of waxing his thread . He appeared to be dependent on this motion . The physiological significance of the fact I suppose to be that the flow of what we call the nervous current from the thinking centre to the organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a simultaneous collateral nervous current to the set of muscles concerned in the action I have described . I do not use a string to help me write or speak , but I must have its equivalent . I must have my paper and pen or pencil before me to set my thoughts flowing in such form that they can be written continuously . There have been lawyers who could think out their whole argument in connected order without a single note . There are authors - and I think there are many - who can compose and finish off a poem or a story without writing a word of it until , when the proper time comes , they copy what they carry in their heads . I have been told that Sir Edwin Arnold thought out his beautiful " Light of Asia " in this way . I find the great charm of writing consists in its surprises . When one is in the receptive attitude of mind , the thoughts which are sprung upon him , the images which flash through his consciousness , are a delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in setting down my thoughts , - of a pen that will not write , of ink that will not flow , of paper that will not receive the ink . And here let me pay the tribute which I owe to one of the humblest but most serviceable of my assis // tants , especially in poetical composition . Nothing seems more prosaic than the stylographic pen . It deprives the handwriting of its beauty , and to some extent of its individual character . The brutal communism of the letters it forms covers the page it fills with the most uniformly uninteresting characters . But , abuse it as much as you choose , there is nothing like it for the poet , for the unagiuative writer . Many a fine flow of thought has been checked , perhaps arrested , by the ill behavior of a goose quill . Many an idea has escaped while the author was dipping his pen in the inkstand . But with the stylographic pen , in the hands of one who knows how to care for it and how to use it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unimpeded flow of the fluid which is the vehicle of the author 's thoughts and fancies . So much for my debt of gratitude to the humble stylographic pen . It does not furnish the proper medium for the correspondence of intimates , who wish to see as much of their friends ' personality as their handwriting can hold , - still less for the impassioned interchange of sentiments between lovers ; but in writing for the press its use is open to no objection . Its movement over the paper is like the flight of a swallow , while the quill pen and the steel pen and the gold pen are all taking short , laborious journeys , and stopping to drink every few minutes . A chief pleasure which the author of novels and stories experiences is that of becoming acquainted with the characters he draws . It is perfectly true that his characters must , in the nature of things , have more or less of himself in their composition . If I should seek an exemplification of this in the person of any of my Teacups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I have called Number Seven , - the one with the squinting brain . I think that not only I , the writer , but many of my readers , recognize in our own mental constitution an occasional obliquity of perception , not always detected at the time , but plain enough when looked back upon . What extravagant fancies you and I have seriously entertained at one time or another ! What superstitious notions have got into our heads and taken possession of its empty chambers , - or , in the language of science , seized on the groups of nerve-cells in some of the idle cerebral convolutions ! The writer , I say , becomes acquainted with his characters as he goes on . They are at first mere embryos , outlines of distinct personalities . By and by , if they have any organic cohesion , they begin to assert themselves . They can say and do such and such things ; such and such other things they can not and must not say or do . The story-writer 's and play-writer 's danger is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what B ought to have said . The stronger his imaginative faculty , the less liable will the writer be to this fault ; but not even Shakespeare 's power of throwing himself into his characters prevents many of his different personages from talking philosophy in the same strain and in a style common to them all . You will often observe that authors fall in love with the imaginary persons they describe , and that they bestow affectionate epithets upon them which it may happen the reader does not consider in any way called for . This is a pleasure to which they have a right . Every author of a story is surrounded by a little family of ideal children , as dear to him , it may be , as are flesh-and-blood children to their parents . You may forget all about the circle of Teacups to which I have introduced you , - on the supposition that you have followed me with some degree of interest ; but do you suppose that Number Five does not continue as a presence with me , and that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be married ? // No , my dear friend , our circle will break apart , and its different members will soon be to you as if they had never been . But do you think that I can forget them ? Do you suppose that I shall cease to follow the love ( or the loves ; which do you think is the true word , the singular or the plural ? ) of Number Five and the young Tutor who is so constantly found in her company ? Do you suppose that I do not continue my relations with the " cracked Teacup , " - the poor old fellow with whom I have so much in common , whose counterpart , perhaps , you may find in your own complex person-ality ? I take from the top shelf of the hospital department of my library - the section devoted to literary cripples , imbeciles , failures , foolish rhymesters , and silly eccentrics - one of the least conspicuous and most hopelessly feeble of the weak-minded population of that intellectual alinshouse . I open it and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked into it once before , - on its first reception as a gift from the author . I try to recall some of the names I see there : they mean nothing to me , but I venture to say the author cherishes them all , and cries over them as he did when he was writing their history . I put the book back among its dusty companions , and , sitting down in my reflective rocking-chair , think how others must forget , and how I shall remember , the company that gathered about this table . Shall I ever meet any one of them again , in these pages or in any other ? Will the cracked Teacup hold together , or will he go to pieces , and find himself in that retreat where the owner of the terrible clock which drove hini crazy is walking under the shelter of the high walls ? Has the young Doctor 's crown yet received the seal which is Nature 's warrant of wisdom and proof of professionai competency ? And Number Five and her young friend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy ? Did they get through the tutto tremante passnge , reading from the same old large edition of Dante which the Tutor recommended as the best , and in reading from which their heads were necessarily brought perilously near to each other ? It would be very pleasant if I could , consistently with the present state of affairs , bring these two young people togetlier . I say two young people , for the one who counts most years seems to me to be really the younger of the pai* . That Number Five foresaw from the first that any tenderer feeling than that of friendship would intrude itself between them I do not believe . As for the Tutor , he soon found where he was drifting . It was his first experience in matters concerning the heart , and absorbed his whole nature as a thing of course . Did he tell her lie loved her ? Perhaps he did , fifty times ; perhaps he never had the courage to say so outright . But sometimes they looked each other straight in the eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Will the Tutor ask Number Five to be his wife ; and if he does , will she yield to the dictates of nature , and lower the flag of that fortress so long thought impregnable ? Will he go on writing such poems to her as " The Rose and the Fern " or " I Like You and I Love You , " and be content with the pursuit of that which he never can attain ? That is all very well on the Grecian Urn " of Keats , - beautiful , but not love such as mortals demand . Still , that may be all , for aught that we have yet seen . " Fair youth , beneath the trees , thou canst not leave Thy song , nor ever can those trees be bare ; Bold lover , never , never , canst thou kiss , Though winning near the goal , - yet do not grieve ; She can not fade , though thou hast not thy bliss , Forever wilt thou love , and she be fair ! // " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm , and still to be enjoyed , Forever panting and forever young ! " And so , good-bye , young people , whom we part with here . Shadows you have been and are to my readers ; very real you have been and are to me , - as real as the memories of many friends whom I shall see no more . As I am not in the habit of indulging in late suppers , the reader need not think that I shall spread another board and invite him to listen to the conversations which take place around it . If , from time to time , he finds a slight refeetion awaiting him on the sideboard , I hope he may welcome it as pleasantly as he has accepted what I have offered him from the board now just being cleared . It is a good rule for the actor who manages the popular street drama of Punch not to let the audience or spectators see his legs . It is very hard for the writer of papers like these , which are now coming to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuously through the thin disguises of his various characters . As the show is now over , as the curtain has fallen , I appear before it in my proper l ) erson , to address a few words to the friends who have assisted , as the French say , by their presence , and as we use the word , by the kind way in which they have received my attempts at their entertainment . This series of papers is the fourth of its kind which I have offered to my readers . I may be allowed to look back upon the succession of serial articles which was commenced more than thirty years ago , in 1857 . " The Autocrat of the Breakfast - Table " was the first of the series . It was begun without the least idea what was to be its course and its outcome . Its characters shaped themselves gradually as the manuscript grew under my hand . I jotted down on the sheet of blotting paper before me the thoughts and fancies which came into my head . A very odd-looking object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were worked up into formal shape , many were rejected . Sometimes I recorded a story , a jest , or a pun for consideration , and made use of it or let it alone as my second thought decided . I remember a curious coincidence , which , if I have ever told in print , - I am not sure whether I have or not , - I will tell over again . I mention it , not for the pun , which I rejected as not very edifying and perhaps not new , though I did not recollect having seen it . Mulier , Latin for woman ; why apply that name to one of the gentle but occasionally obstinate sex ? The answer was that a woman is ( sometimes ) more mulish than a mule . Please observe that I did not like the poor pun very well , and thought it rather rude and inelegant . So I left it on the blotter , where it was standing when one of the next numbers of " Punch " came out and contained that very same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English contributor at just about the same time I fell upon it on this side of the Atlantic . This fact may be added to the chapter of coincidences which belongs to the first number of this series of papers . The " Autocrat " had the attraction of novelty , which of course was wanting in the succeeding papers of similar character . The criticisms upon the successive numbers as they came out were various , but generally encouraging . Some were more than encouraging ; very high-colored in their phrases of commendation . When the papers were brought together in a volume their success was beyond my expectations . Up to the present time the " Autocrat " has maintained its position . An immortality of a whole generation is more than m*t // writers are entitled to expect . I venture to think , from the letters I receive from the children and grandchildren of my first set of readers , that for some little time longer , at least , it will continue to be read , and even to be a favorite with some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who has loved his poor little planet , and will , I trust , retain kindly recollections of it through whatever wilderness of worlds he may be called to wander in his future pilgrimages . I say " poor little planet . " Ever since I had a tencent look at the transit of Venus , a few years ago , through the telescope in the Mall , the earth has been wholly different to me from what it used to be . I knew from books what a speck it is in the universe , but nothing ever brought the fact home like the sight of the sister planet sailing across the sun 's disk , about large enough for a buckshot , not large enough for a full-sized bullet . Yes , I love the little globule where I have spent more than fourscore years , and I like to think that some of my thoughts and some of my emotions may live themselves over again when I am sleeping . I *nnot thank all the kind readers of the " Autocrat " who are constantly sending me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them be assured that a writer is always rendered happier by being told that he has made a fellow-being wiser or better , or even contributed to his harmless entertainment . This a correspondent may take for granted , even if his letter of grateful recognition receives no reply . It becomes more and more difficult for me to keel ) up with my correspondents , and I must soon give it up as impossible . " The Professor at the BreakfastTable " followed immediately on the heels of the " Autocrat . " The Professor was the alter ego of the first personage . In the earlier series he had played a secondary part , and in this second series no great effort was made to create a character wholly unlike the first . The Professor was more outspoken , however , on religious subjects , and brought down a good deal of hard language on himself and the author to whom he owed his existence . I suppose he may have used some irritating expressions , unconsciously , but not unconscientiously , I am sure . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the old doctors , I fear , never pardoned me for saying that if a ship , loaded with an assorted cargo of the drugs which used to be considered the natural food of sick people , went to the bottom of the sea , it would be " all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes . " If I had not put that snapper on the end of my whip-lash , I might have got off without the ill temper which my antithesis provoked . Thirty years set that all right , and the same thirty years have so changed the theological atmosphere that such abusive words as " heretic " and " infidel , " applied to persons who differ from the old standards of faith , are chiefly interesting as a test of breeding , being seldom used by any peol ) le above the social half-caste line . I am speaking of Protestants ; how it may be among Roman Catholics I do not know , but I suspect that with them also it is a good deal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the Professor better than the Autocrat . I confess that I prefer my champagne in its first burst of gaseous enthusiasm ; but if my guest likes it better after it has stood awhile , I am pleased to accommodate him . The first of my series caine from my mind almost with an explosion , like the champagne cork ; it startled me a little to see what I had written , and to hear what people said about it . After that first explosion the flow was more sober , and I looked upon the product of my winepress more coolly . Continuations almost always sag a little . I will not say that of my own second effort , but if // others said it , I should not be disposed to wonder at or to dispute them . " The Poet at the Breakfast-Table " came some years later . This series of papers was not so much a continuation as a resurrection . It was a doubly hazardous attempt , made without any extravagant expectations , and was received as well as I had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series in containing a poem of considerable length , published in successive portions . This poem holds a good deal of self-communing , and gave me the opportunity of expressing some thoughts and feelings not to be found elsewhere in my writings . I had occasion to read the whole volume , not long since , in preparation for a new edition , and was rather more pleased with it than I had expected to be . An old author is constantly rediscovering himself in the more or less fossilized productions of his earlier years . It is a long time since I have rea ( I the " Autocrat , " but I take it up now and then and read in it for a few minutes , not always without some degree of edification . These three series of papers , " Autocrat , " " Professor , " " Poet , " are all stu ( lies of life from somewhat different points of view . They are largely made up of sober reflections , and appeared to me to require some lively human interest to save them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that love should find its way among the young people who helped to make up the circle gathered around the table ? Nothing is older than the story of young love . Nothing is newer than that same old story . A bit of gilding here and there has a wonderful effect in enlivening a landscape or an apartment . Napoleon consoled the Parisians in their year of defeat by gilding the dome of the Invalides . Boston has glorified her State House and herself at the expense of a few sheets of gold leaf laid on the dome , which shines like a sun in the eyes of her citizens , and like a star in those of the approaching traveller . I think the gilding of a love-story helped all three of these earlier papers . The same need I felt in the series of papers just closed . The slight incident of Delilah 's appearance and disappearance served my purpose to some extent . But what should I do with Number Five ? The reader must follow out her career for himself . For myself , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference of their years in the fascination of intimate intercourse . I ( 10 not believe that a nature so large , so rich in affection , as Number Five 's is going to fall defeated of its best inheritance of life , like a vine which finds no support for its tendrils to twine around , and so creeps along the ground from which nature meant that love should lift it . I feel as if I ought to follow these two personages of my sermonizing story until they come together or separate , to fade , to wither , - perhaps to die , at last , of something like what the doctors call heart-failure , but which might niore truly be called heart-starvation . When I say die , I do not mean necessarily the death that goes into the o*ituary column . It may come to that . in one or both ; but I think that , if they are never united , Number Five will outlive the Tutor , who will fall into melancholy ways , and pine and waste , while she lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself of happiness . I hope that is not going to be their fortune , or risfortune . Vieille flue fait jeune marie'e . What a youthful bride Number Five would be , if she could only make up her mind to matrimony 1 * the mean time she must be left with her lambs all around her . May Heaven temper the winds to them , for they have been shorn very close , every one of them , of their golden fleece of aspirations and anticipations . I must avail myself of this opportunity to say a few words to my distant // friends who take interest enough in my writings , early or recent , to wish to enter into communication with me by letter , or *o keep up a communication already begun . I have given notice in print that the letters , books , and mannscripts which I receive by mail are so numerous that if I undertook to read and answer them all I should have little time for anything else . I have for some years depended on the assistance of a secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , to keep down the accumulations which come in with every mail . So many of the letters I receive are of a pleasant character that it is hard to let them go unacknowleged . The extreme friendliness which pervades many of them gives them a value which I rate very highly . When large numbers of strangers insist on claiming one as a friend , on the strength of what he has written , it tends to make him think of himself somewhat indulgently . It is the most natural thing in the world to want to give expression to the feeling the loving messages from far-off unknown friends must excite . Many a ( lay has had its best working hours broken into , spoiled for all literary work , by the labor of answering correspondents whose good opinion it is gratifying to have called forth , but who were unconsciously laying a new burden on shoulders already aching . I know too well that what I say will not reach the eyes of many who might possibly take a hint from it . Still I must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters unanswered . I have been very heavily handicapped for many years . It is partly my own fault . From what my correspondents tell me , I must infer that I have established a ( langerous reputation for willingness to answer all sorts of letters . They come with such insinuating humility , - they can not bear to intrude upon my time , they know that I have a great many calls upon it , - and incontinently proceed to lay their additional weight on the load which is breaking my back . rrhe hypocri*y of kind-hearted people is one of the most painful exhibitions of human weakness . It has occurred to me that it might be profitable to reproduce some of my unwritten answers to correspondents . If those which were actually written and sent were to be printed in parallel columns with those mentally formed but not written out responses and comments , the reader would get some idea of the internal conflicts an honest and not unamiable person has to go through , when he finds himself driven to the wall by a correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound as agreeably , and signify as little , as the phrases used by a diplomatist in closing an official communication . No. 1 . Want my autograph , do you ? And do n't know how to spell my name ! An a for an e in my middle name . Leave out the 1 in my last name . Do you know how l ) eople hate to have their names mniss1 ) elled ? What do you suppose are the sentiments entertained by the rrhompsols with a p towards those who address them in writing as Thomson ? No. 2 . Think the lines you mention are by far the best I ever wrote , hey ? Well , I did n't write those lines . What is more , I think they are as detestable a string of rhymes as I could wish my worst enemy had written . A very pleasant frame of mind I am in for writing a letter , after reading yours ! No. 3 . I am glad to hear that my namesake , whom I never saw and never expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four pages on the strength of that domestic occurrence ? No. 4 . You wish to correct aim error in my Broomstick poem , do you ? You give me to uiiderstand that Wilmington is not in Essex County , but in Middlesex . Very well ; but are they separated by running water ? Because if they are not , what could hinder a witch from // crossing the line that separates Wilmington from Andover , I should like to know ? I never meant to imply that the witches made no excursions beyond the district which was more especially their seat of operations . I might go on in this way with my correspondents to an indefinite extent . But I wish to take the opportunity to make certain emendations in that same Broomstick poem . It was written sonicwhat hastily , and sent off with some imperfections and omissions . After the first two lines the first paragraph should read thus - They hanged them high . - No use ! No use ! What cares a witch for a hangman 's noose ? They buried them deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and witches are hard to kill ; They swore they should n't and would n't die , - Books say they did , but they lie ! they lie ! Then there were a few lines which were left out by mere accident , in copying the poem for the press . They should come in after the paragraph that describes the scenery through which we summer residents in Beverly and Manchester are in the habit of driving . Who would not , will not , if he can , Bathe in the breezes of fair Cape Ann , - Rest in the bowers that her bays enfold , Loved by the sachems and squaws of old ? Home where the white magnolias bloom , Sweet with the bayberry 's chaste perfume , Hugged by the woods and kissed by the sea , Where is an Eden like to thee ? As I come towards the end of this task which I had set myself , I wish , of course , that I could have performed it more to my own satisfaction and that of my readers . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion of any work he has undertaken . A common and very simple reasomi for this disappointment is that most of us overrate our capacity . We expect more of ourselves than we have any right to , in virtue of our endowments . The figurative descriptions of the last Grand Assize must no more be taken literally than the golden crowns , which we do not expect or want to wear on our heads , or the golden harps , which we do not want or expect to hold in our hands . Is it not too true that many religious sectaries think of the last tribunal complacently , as the scene in which they are to have the satisfaction of saying to the believers of a creed different from their own , " I told you so " ? Are not others oppressed with the thought of the great returns which will be expected of them as the product of their great gifts , the very limited amount of which they do not suspect , and will be very glad to learn , even at the expense of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the ways of the Supreme Being are ever really to be " justified to men , " to use Milton 's expression , every human being may expect an exhaustive explanation of himself . No man is capable of being his own counsel , and I can not help hoping that the ablest of the archangels will be retained for the defence of the worst of sinners . He himself is unconscious of the agencies which made him what he is . Self-determining he may be , if you will , but who determines the self which is the proximate source of the determination ? Why was the A self like his good uncle in bodily aspect and mental and moral qualities , and the B self like the bad uncle in look and character ? Has not a man a right to ask this question in the here or in the hereafter , - in this world or in any world in which he may find himself ? If the Allwise wishes to satisfy his reasonable and reasoning creatures , it will not be by a display of elemental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats with him as a dependent entitled to know the meaning of his existence , and if there was anything wrong in his adjustment to the moral and spiritual conditions of the world around him to have full allowance made for it . No melodramatic display of warring ele // ments , such as the white-robed Second Adventist imagines , can meet the need of the human heart . The thunders and lightnings of Sinai terrified and impressed the more timid souls of the idolatrous and rebellious caravan which the great leader was conducting , but a far nobler manifestation of divinity was that when " the Lord spake unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . " I find the burden and restrictions of rhyme more and more troublesome as I grow older . There are times when it seems natural enough to employ that form of expression , but it is only occasionally ; and the use of it as the vehicle of the commonplace is so prevalent that one is not much tempted to select it as the medium for his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of a high-school education , and its practice is far from being an evidence of intellectual distinction . Mediocrity is as much forbidden to the poet in our days as it was in those of Horace , and the immense majority of the verses written are stamped with hopeless mediocrity . When one of the ancient poets found he was trying to grind out verses which came unwillingly , he said he was writing INVITA MINERVA . Vex not the Muse with idle prayers , - She will not hear thy call ; She steals upon thee unawares , Or seeks thee not at all . Soft as the moonbeams when they sought Endymion 's fragrant bower , She parts the whispering leaves of thought To show her full-blown flower . For thee her *vooing hour has passed , The singing birds have flown , And winter comes with icy blast To chill thy buds nablown . Yet though the woods no longer thrill As once their arches rung , Sweet echoes hover round thee still Of songs thy summer sung . Live in thy past ; await no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music left in store While Memory sighs and sings . I hope my special Minerva may not always be unwilling , but she must not be called upon as she has been in times past . Now that the teacups have left the table , an occasional evening call is all that my readers must look for . Thanking them for their kind conipanionship , and hoping that I may yet meet them in the now and thens of the future , I bid them good-bye for the immediate present .
