txt Boston hangs her head a little to-night . The cause is a report of a special commission , transmitted to the Legislature by Gov . Russell , showing that a bust , long standing in Dorio Hall , in the State House , marked Samuel Adams , is really that of George Washington . The commission , composed of Edward G. Porter , Samuel A. Green . and John C. Ropes , was appointed under a special act of last year , and the standing of the members as historical Bohol. : are oarries the greatest weight . " We have had the bust removed from the pedestal , " they report , " and carefully examins-i on all sides . There is no inscription of any kind upon it , to show either when or by whom it was made or whom it was intended to represent . No record can be found at the State House showing when it was obtained or when it was planed there . It is known that it formerly stood in a niche on the old staircase leading to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old four entrances to Doric Hall were converted into niches , and this bust was placed in one of them on a new pedestal somewhat larger than the old one . The bust appears to be of Carrara marble , and was apparently made near the beginning of this century . " The present pedestal , like the one whin it replaoes , is of American marble , and bears the incised and gilded inscription , ? Samuel Adams . ' The question arises by what authority the name of Samuel Adams became connected with this bust . No good authority can be found . In the absence of any early inscription or documents we are left to mere conjecture and tradition on the one hand , as opposed to the strong presumptive evidence on the other , that the bust is really that of George Washington . The tradition connecting it with Samuel Adams is exceedingly meagre and untrustworthy . No one seems to be responsible for its origin . No one ventures to defend it . The features of the bust do not correspond with the well-known portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt . after careful and prolonged investigation , is that this is a bust of Washington .
