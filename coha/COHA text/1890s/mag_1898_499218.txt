BY JAMES BRYCE , Author of " The American Commonwealth , " " Impressions of South Africa , " etc. is now a century and a half since the idea of equality among men began to be constantly discussed , and to influence the world of practice as well as that of abstract thought . It has inspired many schemes , and has been taken as an ideal to be pursued not only in law and politics , but also in sociology and economics . More than once it has become a revolutionary force of tremendous power . Yet the great bulk of mankind have seldom stopped to analyze it , that is to say , to distinguish the various senses in which it is used , and the different bearings it has when applied in different fields of human life . Indeed , much confusion and some error have arisen from the habit of assuming that because equality is desirable and attainable in certain matters it is desirable and attainable in other and dissimilar matters also , while the excesses of some who have fallen into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pernicious notion , which ought to be resisted whenever resistance is possible . It is , therefore , worth while to subject the term equality to analysis and examination , with the view of distinguishing the different meanings it bears , or , more precisely , the different import and effect of the conception according as it is applied in one or other kind of subject-matter . One can not hope to present any really new ideas on such a topic . That which may be aimed at is rather to give definiteness and precision to ideas which most of us are apt to hold in a somewhat vague form , and in particular to estimate , in each of the matters whereto it is applied , the practical value of the conception as an ideal toward which the efforts of social or political reformers may be directed . Let us begin by inquiring what are the various senses in which the phrase equality between men is , or may be , employed . Six senses may be enumerated in which the phrase is currently used . Two of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other four to man as a social being existing under civil institutions of some sort or kind . 1 Enlarged from an address delivered to the Municipal Society of Glasgow . The first meaning , though very familiar , is one for which it is hard to find a truly descriptive name , but we may call it spiritual equality . There is a sense in which all men are naturally equal , because all have alike an individual personality which is of supreme value to each . All are alike when they come out of the darkness into this world as mewling babes ; all are alike when with failing breath they return again into the darkness . This is the kind of equality denoted by the phrase , " All men are equal in the sight of God . " The Almighty is so infinitely above his creatures that the distinctions between them are as nothing in his eyes . Each is a life-spark , and nothing more . In each , as certain philosophers have said , there dwells a tiny fragment of the universal soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a dignity  --  the dignity of moral freedom , the importance of which transcends the disparities of man and man , and gives to every life , to every personality , a kind of sacredness . This conception , though one finds it recognized in classical antiquity , deriv*s most of its power from the teachings of Christianity , and has become to most men a distinctly religious conception . Each and every human soul is precious , because each is in direct relation to God , and because each has been deemed to have an infinite future of weal or woe before it . The other sense in which equality might be said to exist between men , and to be a natural equality , is equality of gifts , physical , intellectual , and moral . Were men equally endowed with strength , intelligence , courage , force , and tenacity of will , there would be a genuine natural equality among them . As we know , there is no such natural equality , but , on the contrary , the greatest possible disparity , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under the same educational and social influences . Neverthless , obvious and familiar as is this fact , it has made far less impression on the popular mind than the external points of resemblance between one man and another on the one hand , and , on the other , that equality of personality which we have just been considering . It is only when diversity 459 // and inequality appear in the form of differences of sex , or of race and color , that they receive due recognition ; yet differences of sex and of race and color are not greater than the differences which separate the higher from the lower individuals of the same sex and race . Thus we have , as regards natural man , two salient facts : Between each man , simply as a man , and every other man , there is an equality of soul , an equal worth of personality . There is also hetween men an inequality of gifts , each man differing from his fellows in physical strength and in physical needs , in intellectual strength and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in perseverance , in rectitude , in capacity for emotion , whether good or had . We come now to the four kinds of equality which exist , or may exist , between men in their social as opposed to their purely natural state . These are usually descrihed as civil equality , political equality , social equality , and economic equality . By civil equality we understand the possession hy each man of similar and equal legal rights in the sphere of private law ; that is , equal rights to freedom of speech and action , to personal safety and protection , to the enjoyment of a position in the family , to the holding and disposal of property . This kind of equality is so far from being natural that it is found only in advanced civilizations . Slavery was the rule all over the world , not perhaps among pure savages , hut certainly among barbarous and semi-civilized peoples , and has prevailed even in some highly civilized states . Even where slavery has ceased , great disparities as regards private legal rights long continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Revolution . In Britain this equality was established , except as hetween men and women , at a comparatively early epoch , and its full recognition has been , both there and in the United States , a very potent and beneficial factor in preventing social hitterness and political unrest . We even extend it , for almost all , if not absolutely for all , purposes , to those who are not citizens or subjects of the state . The term political equality describes the equal enjoyment hy all who are citizens of the state of a share in its government , including both the right of voting for persons to he invested with executive or legislative functions , and the right of being one 's self eligible for such an executive or legislative post . This is a totally different thing from equality of private legal rights , has been later in its growth , does not prevail so extensively , and does not necessarily or logically follow from civil equality , because the grounds which recommend it are not the same . It is in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends more and more to make way , and is generally supposed to he the goal toward which nations are traveling . The term social equality is much more vague , hecause here we quit the sphere of law to enter that of social intercourse . It denotes the kind of mutual courtesy and respect which men show to one another when each feels the other to he " as good as himself "  --  a respect which stands between condescension , on the one hand , and submissiveness , on the other . The extent to which it goes depends , of course , upon the particular form of intercourse . There may he a social equality hetween men as directors of a company or members of a political committee which would not extend to dining at one another 's houses , still less to marrying one another 's sisters or daughters . Its growth is generally in proportion to the growth of the last two mentioned kinds of equality ; yet it might exist without political equality , and the latter without it . Lastly , there is economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man of an equal quantity or value of property , none being either richer or poorer than his neighbor . This state of things has never yet existed , and has no necessary connection with the other kinds of equality , though of course it is only under a regime of political equality that it would be likely to come into being . So far we have been endeavoring to distinguish and define the different kinds of equality which do exist , or may exist , among men . Now let us inquire what are the import , the value , and the practical attainability of each of these kinds . Most people tend to assume a priori that every species of equality has a sort of presumption in its favor ; that it is likely to yield better fruits , both ethically and politically and socially , than inequality ; and that it is therefore desirable for all communities to try to work toward it . This tendency deserves to be explained , this alleged presumption to be scrutinized . That which has been called spiritual equality , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now generally admitted by all civilized men , and has become so much a part of our thinking that we forget that there were times when it was not accepted at all . The latest serious attempt to deny it was // made in the last days of slavery in the United States , when some few persons , professing to be anthropologists , attempted to show that African negroes were not members of the human family , but rather a species of highly developed apes . The conception is one which the three great religions of the world all virtually embrace , Mohammedanism having taken it from the Jews and the Christians ; and the power it exerts is mainly due to its incorporation in Christian doctrine . The unity of man is correlative to the unity of God . The value of man 's soul is measured by the death of the Saviour . It is indeed the sheet-anchor of humanity ; for we owe to it all the efforts that are made to help or reclaim those criminals and outcasts whose acts excite repulsion , but who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the force which restrains , however imperfectly , the disposition of the stronger races to trample on the weaker , to reduce them to slavery , deny them civil rights , use them like beasts of burden for the benefit of those who need their labor . It is now so firmly rooted everywhere that its continuance may be deemed certain ; and no more need here be said regarding it than that it has been the chief cause of that presumption in favor of every sort of equality which has been already referred to . The admission of this principle seems to throw upon any kind of inequality the onus of justifying its existence . Men reason thus : " All men are born equal ; all men die equal ; all souls are immortal , and Christ died for all . We brought nothing into the world , and it is certain that we can carry nothing out of it . Why , then , should there be such differences of good and evil fortune , of wealth and poverty , between men ? Why should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ** The New Testament , the American Declaration of Independence , the French principles of 1789 , seem to concur in prescribing equality as the normal condition of mankind , or , at any rate , the proper starting-point for every community . Even Bentham 's doctrine that the aim of society is to secure the greatest happiness of the greatest number is obliged to assume the equal value of each person , and of the capacity of each for happiness , else the doctrine fails altogether to supply the practical guidance it has undertaken to give . The power which this view of equality as the natural state of nfen has exercised is unquestionable . But in trying to apply it to existing social phenomena we are immediately confronted by the other fact , already dwelt upon , viz. , the inequality of men as regards their physical and mental powers . Equality of gifts and abilities does not exist , and , so far as we can foresee , never will exist . It does not even seem to come nearer , except to some slight extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some individuals of remarkable capacity have arisen from among the colored races , no colored race as a whole has brought itself nearly up to the level of the leading white races . The problems that lie before human society in its onward march are all concerned or involved with these two salient natural facts , an admitted equality between men in one aspect , and a no less palpable inequality between them in another aspect ; and as these moral or social problems , like physical problems , can be solved , not by running counter to nature , but only by obeying her , like regard must in every effort at a solution be had to both facts . We may now go on to inquire how these two facts , seemingly opposed , yet both true , have worked upon the relations of men in the social sphere . And this brings us to the four forms of equality which exist in that sphere , viz. , civil , political , social , and economic equality . Civil equality , equality of rights in the field of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole community as to have become a good practical test of the higher or lower level of civilization which any state has reached . It is now virtually universal in Europe ( except , of course , in semicivilized Turkey ) , and in all the colonies of European nations . Its acceptance has been due partly to sentiment and sympathy , but largely also to an experience of the evils of inequality as giving rise to arrogance and injustice on the part of privileged classes , and exposing the less privileged to harsh treatment . The sense of wrong produces discontent , and discontent disturbs the state . The very term equity , which our lawyers have drawn from the favorite expression of the Roman lawyers , aequum ct bonum , indicates the tendency to find in equality of treatment a foundation for justice , and the easiest way out of the endless complications and difficulties to which the preference of one class of persons over another gives rise . The tendency to level down and level up became strong in jurisprudence before it had established itself in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth was acquired by persons belonging to the inferior // classes , they used it to evade and ultimately to overthrow those provisions of the old law which placed them at a disadvantage compared with men of higher rank . To one who reviews the progress of the world during the last four centuries , no small part of that progress seems to consist in or to issue from civil equality , and its steady and quiet growth is a striking illustration of the power of moral forces , of truth , reason , and good feeling . These have been more important agents in creating it than any revolts of the oppressed ; and , indeed , it was they that enabled some of those revolts to succeed . The equality of men in respect of political rights has made far slower advances , and involves considerations very different from those which govern our view of equality of civil rights . We may define it as meaning the equal right of every citizen to share in the government of a state , whether as a voter or as eligible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very modern , the realization of it still more recent , and hardly anywhere complete . So far from its having been the original condition of mankind , it would seem to have never existed in any primitive people which had reached even the rudest political organization . The dominance of one man , or a few men , over the majority is everywhere the patent fact , and the circle of those who share in political power was very slowly extended . Such extension usually comes , as in the case of the equality of private civil rights , partlythrough the discontent of the excluded mass , who see , or think they see , that the authority of the privileged few is used to their prejudice , partly by a feeling , which gradually spreads among the most enlightened members of the privileged class , that no set of people can be trusted to legislate for others , and that a government is more stable when its base is broad . Where the few rule the many , the many will always blame the few for any mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only themselves to blame . Accordingly there has been established in modern times and in advanced nations a sort of presumption in favor of a wide political franchise and universal eligibility for office , as making probably for the general good , but anyhow for the general contentment . This , however , is only a presumption . There is another side to the question . Equality of civil rights is almost certainly a good thing , for it can hardly be misused . Equality of political rights may readily be misused ; for it requires capacity , and capacity may be wanting . Where political power is committed to a mass of people who are ignorant and untrained , and where this mass is not disposed to be guided by those who are wiser and more instructed , it may choose bad rulers and sanction foolish measures . Thus a suffrage suitable to the white population of Massachusetts may not be suitable to the predominantly colored population of Louisiana . In every case the risk of this evil must be set against the presumptive advantages already mentioned ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of opinion among intelligent men and women which exists on the question of woman suffrage . There is , therefore , no general rule to be laid down on the subject . In every case a balance must be struck between probable gains and probable dangers . Regard must be had to time , place , and circumstance ; the application of abstract principles and a priori doctrines , such as were so potent among the French from 1789 to 1792 , and in the United States for two generations after 1776 , must be carefully eschewed . We come next to social equality , and find ourselves passing out of the sphere of law into that of general human intercourse . Is it desirable that there should be no social ranks or grades , and that ( apart from office and from age , two things which have usually and rightly commanded deference ) each man should treat every other man as being absolutely on his own level ? Here we are confronted by the old contradiction between natural equality , in the sense of spiritual equality of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great diversity of intellectual and moral gifts between different persons . The former would seem to forbid social distinctions ; for if each personality is of the same value , it ought to obtain the same respect from others . The latter , however , shows us some persons immensely superior in integrity , in force of character , in all the powers which enable a man to lead or to edify or to delight his fellow-men . The instinct which defers to such kinds of superiority is both natural and reasonable , and the instinct which defers to wealth and power is , at any rate , natural . Moreover , differences of intellect and of education produce differences of taste ; differences of wealth produce differences of habits of life ; and such differences necessarily affect social intercourse . The establishment of economic communism , or of an absolute equality of conditions , would remove the // latter ; but the former would still subsist , and would create , if not a barrier , at least a certain disinclination to intimacy between the person who loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his dinner . The tendency to establish distinctions of rank is deep-rooted and universal . Some of us would not consider that there was much difference , if any , between the vocation of a seller of peanuts and that of an organ grinder . The former is nearly as nomadic a person as the latter . Nevertheless , in New York the distinction is so great that the former does not permit his children to play with the children of the latter . When a tendency is naturally so strong , the attempt to ignore its results may produce an artificial state of things disagreeable to everybody , as the attempt of some idealists to make their domestic servants sit down to meals along with them has been resisted by the servants themselves . These are some of the difficulties which surround the question . An examination of them may lead us to the following conclusions : The more social equality we can secure without running counter to nature , the better . Mutual respect for one another 's feelings , mutual courtesy in forms of address , mutual recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good both for the so-called superior and the so-called inferior . They check arrogance and assumption on the part of the one , cringing and servility on the part of the other . They make the one remember that he is no more , the other that he is no less , than a free man . On the other hand , more harm than good will be done by trying to force men into a kind of intimacy which they feel to be unreal , because not grounded on sympathy of thought and tastes and habits . When these are widely divergent , social intercourse can not be so easy , or , at any rate , can not cover so much of life . You may be perfectly friendly with the coachman who drives your carriage , but you do not wish that he should spend the evening in your drawing-room , or marry your daughter . He may be more honest or more wise , or both , than you are yourself ; nevertheless , the difference in tastes and in ways of life sets certain limits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish either the duty or the value of politeness on both sides . As regards the weight to be attached to natural inequalities , wealth ought to count for least , except , of course , so far as it involves disparity of habits . Intellect may properly entitle its possessor to a certain amount of deference ; but , taken alone , and apart from the attainments or the refinement which it may produce , it ought not to be a basis of social distinction . What is to be said of what Europeans call rank , i. e. , of the conventional orders and degrees in society produced by titles , whether hereditary or personal ? Where they are personal their value depends on the care with which they have been bestowed , or , in other words , on the amount of personal excellence they indicate . There is nothing in the doctrine of natural equality to dissuadethe rendering of special deference to special excellence . Where they are hereditary , as among the nobles of Europe , they do not indicate any measurable amount of excellence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in descendants is hardly stronger than the presumption that those who have been brought up in comparative indolence and under the influence of caste sentiment will suffer from both causes . That the evils of hereditary titles exceed their advantages is the judgment of nearly all impartial observers . In Germany and the Austrian dominions they foster a spirit of haughty exclusiveness among those who possess them . In Great Britain they produce snobbishness both among those who possess them and those who do not , without ( as a rule ) any corresponding sense of a duty to sustain the credit of the family or the caste . Their abolition would be clear gain . The elaborate system of artificial rank which prevails in Europe is , however , by no means so offensive as many Americans fancy . Even in England social precedence is so much a part of the recognized conventions of the country , and is so fully discounted by a regard to the intrinsic merit of the person who does or does not enjoy it , that , though it may seem absurd enough that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room behind an insignificant young peer , and the Prime Minister 's wife have no rank at all , nobody deems this to be any disparagement of the Prime Minister . If it were a rule that all red-haired people should take precedence of black-haired people , this , too , would so soon seem a matter of course that the black-haired would accept their position , and cease to feel aggrieved . When there is substantial work to be done , social precedence usually goes to the wall . Almost the only survival of its importance is to be found in the disposition to prefer a peer for the // office of governor-general of India , or Ireland , or Canada . In some parts of Europe , however , birth and rank still count for much . Thirty years ago , I was told in Vienna that not long before , at the court balls there , the daughter of the then Prime Minister was seldom asked to dance , because her father , though he was expected to save the monarchy from the perils that then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freiherr . In Prussia people do not to-day , like the Westphalian baron in " Candide , " forbid their sister to marry a man who can not show sixteen quarterings ; yet in Prussia to-day it is all but impossible for a Jew , however rich , to obtain a commission in the army . There is a curious distinction between Eastern and Western countries in this regard . In the East the sovereign , being a despot , is held so immeasurably superior to his subjects that they all seem comparatively equal before him , and he can so easily make the beggar a prince , or the prince a beggar , that the European ideas of status are inapplicable , and there is little difference between the laborer and the employer . In Europe , on the other hand , while distinctions between classes are much regarded ( even in republican Switzerland the old families enjoy great respect ) , the chief social line is that which separates those who are called " gentlemen from those who are not so called , and the sovereign is deemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt , as in Turkey or Persia , from the obligations attaching to a gentleman . This is a result-one of the few that still survive- of the so-called system of chivalry , which created a sort of equality on* the basis of knighthood . The passion for social equality has always been less strong among the Teutonic than among the Celtic and so-called Latin peoples , as , indeed , all movements take among the former a less acute form . Everywhere , however , even in France and in the United States , this pass.ion seems less strenuous than it was formerly . The complete equality of civil rights , and the almost complete equality of political rights , which have been attained in nearly all civilized countries , have diminished the zeal to achieve it ; for men now perceive that those kinds of equality may exist without it , and that their attainment does not necessarily bring it much nearer . There is , indeed , no necessary connection between freedom and equality , according to the lines of Milton : If not equal all , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with liberty , but well consist . With the other members of the famous trio there is a close relation . Social equalitywould be a long step , though only a step , toward fraternity , and fraternity would in its fullness almost imply social equality . But the longing for fraternity has also declined . It has never really emerged- and indeed could not , except through the influence of religion , hope to emerge-from the field of aspiration into that of reality . Of late years it is seldom named , except in religious addresses . The strife of rich and poor , and the effort to bring men to a level in respect of material conditions , together with those animosities of race which have so largely taken the place of animosities of creed , have discouraged it . Something may also be due to the more frequent contact of civilized men with savage and other backward peoples , especially those of a different color . The European settler feels no sense of " solidarity** with the Chinese or the Hindu or the Malay , still less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enslaved negro appealed to sentiment as " a man and a brother ' * more than the liberated negro seems now to appeal . On a review of the whole matter , it would appear that , while the principle of social equality does point to the extinction of all artificial and legal distinctions of rank , already accomplished in the United States , and does prescribe the same courtesy and consideration toward all persons alike , it can not venture to ignore differences which spring from diversities of knowledge , culture , and taste ; for these , too , are natural , and operate outside the sphere of law or social custom . Neither has it been able to overcome the differences for which wealth , as affecting men 's habits of life , is answerable . The apostles of equality may , however , reply that inequalities of wealth are themselves artificial , and ought to be got rid of . And this brings us to the last kind of equality we have to consider-that of economic conditions . The desire to establish an equality of property has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desirability or the attainability of the state of things aimed at , a few words ought to be said on the sources whence the desire springs . Although , as we shall presently note , history does not record economic equality as having ever in fact existed , still it is deemed to be the natural state of man . Since all men come equal into the world , their chances of well-being ought , so it is argued , to be equal , and therefore those external goods // which contribute to well-being should be allotted to all in equal measure . If it is observed that Nature distributes her gifts unequally even at birth , because one man is born with a healthy , another with a weak or diseased , body , one man has a cheerful , another a querulous , spirit , the reply is that this fact makes it all the more fitting that every means should be used to rectify the injustice of chance by securing equality in one sphere , at least-that of material conditions . There is also the presumption in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil and political equality . Contrasting the society of our own times with the society of two or three centuries ago , nothing seems to show a more palpable advance than does the elevation of the ordinary private citizen to the level formerly held only by the few privileged persons . May not a like progress in the well-being of humanity be expected from the further application of this wholesome principle ? The desire for material well-being is all the stronger because the general demoralization of society , the greater publicity of life , the attainment of immense wealth by men sprung from the lower ranks , have stimulated the appetite of those humbler classes whose ancestors contentedly acquiesced in an inequality of conditions as part of the order of nature . And as the other world is less in men 's thoughts than it was some centuries ago , they have become more eager to make the best of this world . Perhaps , however , the strongest influence in bringing this question to the front has been the complete attainment by the masses , in most civilized countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belief that it would immensely improve their condition . Now that they have got it , the old inequalities of wealth remain ; and though the poor of to-day are in most countries better off than were the poor of a century ago , those inequalities are full as palpable . " Of what use , then , " - thus do many feel and say ,  - -  has it been to conquer political power , if we are not by means of it to better our own condition ? " These ideas , which are not confined to the poor , but are reinforced by the sympathy of imaginative and benevolent minds among the wealthier class , have now much force at their command . They meet us everywhere . They raise in many forms what is the main question that occupies the thoughts of thinking men . And they have behind them-do not VOL . LVI. - 59- 60. let us , whatever error or confusion may be found to lurk in them , forget this fact-they have behind them the notion that they are suggested by nature , by justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . When , however , we come to criticize these ideas and the source assigned to them , the following observations occur . First of all , be it noted that there never has been in the world such a state of natural equality as many have dreamed of . Even in the stone age , one savage had more flint hatchets or a bigger deerskin than the other tribesmen . As soon as a race begins to have any sort of organization ,  --  as soon , for instance , as it reaches the stage in which the Romans found the Britons of antiquity , or in which our settlers have found the North American Indians and the Kaflrs ,  --  inequalities of property are conspicuous . Secondly , it is not law that creates inequality of property . It is , in the first instance , strength , physical or intellectual ; that is to say , inequality is due to natural , not to artificial , causes . When law appears , it does no more than recognize and protect the inequality which it finds subsisting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greater than it is now , because the weaker would have no security for what they possess , since force , whether of body or of craft and will , would dominate . If equality of goods is ever to be established , it will have to be established by law , either by forbidding the appropriation of any articles , z. e. , by destroying the conception of private property , and giving each man the protection of the state in taking a part of whatever his neighbor has , or else by continually restoring through legal action an equilibrium of goods which natural causes are perpetually disturbing . This will be the hardest task law has ever undertaken , because law will have to steer straight in the teeth of the strong blast of nature . If ten men were to be started , on Monday morning , with equal property , and left to themselves for six days , no two would be found to have equal property on Saturday night , because in no two would the faculty of acquiring and the habit of spending be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfect , that is to say , where the action of courts , and of the authority which carries out their decisions , is certain , the qualities which tend to produce inequality of property are different from those which produced it in rude and disorderly times . In those times // physical strength and physical courage were the most important factors . In perfectly settled societies intelligence and the habit of saving most tell . Will evidently tells in all states of society , and will is one of the qualities in which men most differ from one another . Of course it is not necessarily the highest forms of intelligence that most subserve the acquisition of property . No poet before Tennyson ever made a fortune by his gift . No philosopher has ever yet grown rich by philosophy . Only in very recent times have a few great inventors been able to reap the harvest of their intellectual labors . It is by the power of devising schemes and conducting large commercial or financial operations that the largest masses of property are accumulated in one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in such a man as the late Mr. Jay Gould . This has caused a certain prejudice against the working of laws which permit a capacity not necessarily beneficial , and possibly harmful , to mankind to achieve conspicuous success . But no one has shown how this capacity can be held in check without overthrowing the entire legal basis on which modern communities rest . When we scrutinize the grounds of the desire for equality , a fourth observation presents itself . Inequality of property is not an evil per se . It is not in itself harmful to A-that is , it is no diminution of his happiness-that B should have more grain or more cattle or more money than he has himself . A may have other things which are better than B 's property , even as the psalmist says : " I had more joy than they when their corn and their oil were increased . " M may have stronger health , or a better wife or children , a greater faculty of intellectual enjoyment , than P has ,  --  things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of property ,  --  and M 's possession of these advantages does not diminish P 's happiness or increase his wretchedness , for they depend on what P himself has or lacks . So if I have $1000 , I am none the worse off because you have $10,000 . It is not your excess that affects my well-being , but my own sufficient or insufficient provision . That which is desirable is to have enough , not as much as another man has or needs , but as much as I myself need . But what is enough ? It is a variable conception ; it is , in point of quantity , no more the same for every man than is a man 's stature or his appetite . It depends for each man upon his physical and intellectual needs and tastes , and the wise man is he who regulates his conception of it by his own needs and tastes , and not by those of his neighbors , which may sometimes enlighten , but are just as likely to mislead , his own judgment . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P more than enough , jump to the conclusion that the proper way to rectify the mischief is to take from P his superfluity and bestow it upon M. But though this is a very common confusion of ideas , it is none the less a confusion . It may be bad for a man to have too much . It is certainly bad for him to have too little . But the evil lies not in the inequality of possessions , but in the excess or defect ; and the only sense in which poor M suffers from witnessing P 's wealth is that the spectacle accentuates by contrast the evils of his own condition . Just in the same way P , who is stiff with rheumatism and has been forsaken by his wife , may envy the robust health and happy home of M. Here , therefore , we note a capital difference between inequality of economic conditions and inequality of civil rights or of political rights . In the two last-named cases , one man 's gain is another man 's loss . If X has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffers , because the law enables X to prevail against him when a dispute arises . In Turkey , for instance , a Mussulman may with practical impunity kill a Christian rajah , but a Christian rajah can not with impunity kill a Mussulman . So if X ( a class of persons ) enjoy the suffrage , and Y ( another class ) do not , it usually happens that the legislation which class X enacts is calculated to benefit the privileged and to depress the excluded class . As one of the scales rises , so the other sinks . With property it is otherwise . Except in one class of cases , P 's abundance does not come from M 's deficiency , and P 's share might be reduced without increasing M 's . That one class of cases is where the thing of which men hold unequal amounts is itself limited in quantity . If P draws off two thirds of the water of a stream to irrigate his meadow , he leaves only one third to be used by M , and the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the one sixth which represents his excess . The great instance of this sort of thing is of course land , and the contents of land ; and accordingly the observation just made can not be applied to land in any country where it has become scarce . It may be said that in any given industrial undertaking , such as a factory , the profits are limited , and therefore the more P gets , so // much the less is there for C , D , and E. It would lead us too far afield to enter this field of controversy , and in particular to discuss the nature of capital . But it deserves to be noted that in most industrial undertakings the contributions of the different co-workers differ in value . P may bring scientific genius , C may bring commercial experience , D may bring consummate manual skill , while E , F , G , and H have only physical strength to contribute ; and of the whole profits of the undertaking , three fourths may be traceable to P 's inventive genius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sufficient to secure . Are there then no real objections to inequality of economic conditions ? Certainly there are ; but they are objections grounded not on abstract considerations of nature and justice , but upon the results which inequality has been found in practice to produce . Neither are they objections to inequality per se , but only to its extreme forms , where accumulations of property in a few hands are huge and conspicuous . Such accumulations create a highly luxurious class , many of whose members remain idle and useless all their lives , while others form habits and try to follow a style of living unsuited to their means . The holders of vast fortunes acquire undue power , they have undue influence with rulers , they may corrupt legislators , they may pervert the power of a state to serve their selfish ends . Their wealth , if ostentatiously displayed or squandered upon unworthy objects , excites envy , breeds discontent , and may furnish incitements to the spirit of plunder . There have no doubt been states in which great inequalities of fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed . In such states , however , the inequalities of fortune corresponded to inequalities in political power and social influence . Very different is the condition of some of our modern states , wherein fortunes still more disproportionately huge are disjoined from any power and any respect save that which mere wealth may command . There is therefore a prima facie case , grounded nowise on abstract principles , but on observation and experience , not indeed for a compulsory equalization , but for a reduction of extreme inequalities , of wealth . How can such a reduction be effected ? The problem is a difficult one , for you interfere with nature , and there is always a presumption that when you begin to interfere with nature you will get into trouble . Moreover , you may injure the man who has too little , whom you wish to benefit , as much as , or more than , the man who has far too much . Indeed the latter , though the defenders of the present system are chiefly concerned on his behalf , is less likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad thing for him , since it increases his temptations . The main difficulties are ethical , and I state them rather than the economic difficulties , because the latter would require a more elaborate examination . If by legislation you take property away from the rich man , the property he has earned or inherited , you shock confidence , and you weaken the motives for thrift and foresight which operate on the mind of the rich . If by legislation you give property to the poorer man , you weaken the natural incentive to exertion which the need of providing for himself creates . It is no doubt said that before long a new set of ethical views and habits will arise which will supply the place of those thus set aside . This is a question too large to discuss here , and it is , of course , a highly speculative one , outside the range of such experience as mankind has so far enjoyed . Attempts have been made to deal with the problem , but rather in the form of efforts to reduce inordinately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely small ones , seeing that during many centuries both humanity and political expediency have suggested the necessity for aiding those who have least . Many ways of solving it have been tried-ways which are not alternatives , for several may be applied together . There is the Christian solution , that those who have should freely give to those who have not . It is a method which has often been ill worked , but when wisely worked it is obviously the best . There is the plan of a poor law , whereof the English poor law is a type , which out of taxation secures a minimum of subsistence to the most needy . Nearly all economists have condemned it as unsound in principle and prone to abuse in practice , but it seems to be inevitable in countries like England , unless a scheme of organized private charity , such as Chalmers established in Glasgow some seventy years ago , can be substituted for it . There are various schemes for providing pensions available in sickness and old age . There is the plan of exempting smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger ones . The method , however , which most nearly touches our present subject is that which seeks to provide gratuitously out of public funds an equal supply to all citizens // of certain things which all may be taken to need . Elementary education has thus been in the United States , and now in Great Britain also , supplied to all ; and it has been proposed that gas or electric light , water , the means of locomotion , and many other things , should be similarly supplied at the public expense . Strong arguments may be used in support of this policy . The things enumerated are already provided , not by each man for himself , but by public bodies or by great private corporations . Most of them are things not likely to be squandered or abused . To supply them would not seriously impair the stimulus to exertion which the need for food and clothing , and other necessaries or comforts , secures . The force of these considerations has so far prevailed that many municipalities now do provide public parks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and free music , things which elevate and brighten the life of the poor man , and enlarge his conception of what civilized life ought to be , while they help to make all the citizens feel themselves members of one community . A few municipalities have even provided workmen 's dwellings or public lodging-houses at rents only a little above cost price . The risks incident to such schemes are obvious . There may be extravagance , because the ordinary citizen has but a slender interest in keeping down expenditure . There may be a perversion of public funds to political objects , an attempt to corrupt the people by the lavish use of money , or to reward political adherents by the bestowal of places or contracts . There is the risk of demoralizing the poorest class , as the populace of Rome was demoralized by the free distribution of corn and by the sums squandered on public amusements . And although these risks are less when the experiment is made in a small local area within the state than when it is tried by the state itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integrity and the competence of their municipal governments that they ought to permit even municipal governments to go far in this direction . In Glasgow , however , as in several other European cities , the experiment has been tried , with results so encouraging that other European cities are moving in the same direction . A priori doctrines must not be allowed to stand in the way . Politics is an experimental science , and he who tries to show that abstract theory does not justify the attempt to introduce economic equality must also urge that abstract theory ought not to prevent us from doing what can pmdently be done to reduce the evils which excessive inequality has been proved to produce , and from trying to guide into safe channels the strong stream of sentiment which condemns such inequality . Society seems to be now entering a new period , and the altered aspect of this fundamental question of equality illustrates the change . Civil equality is now all but complete in almost every civilized country . Even the colored races ( since the extinction of slavery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social equality makes daily progress , even in countries which still tolerate hereditary distinctions of rank . Political equality has been fully established in the United States , in Britain and her self-governing colonies , in the nations of western and central Europe . In most of these countries the machinery of government is deemed to need improvement ; but the main controversies turn , and are likely in the future more and more to turn , on the use to be made of government for social ends . The question that now lies before the world is , How shall political equality , for which many generations strove , be now , when it has been achieved , made to bear wholesome fruit ? How shall it be used to better the condition of the masses without attempting to override the laws of human nature ? These laws are just as sovereign in their sphere as those of the material universe , and the effort to overcome them will be just as futile . But there is one great difference between the two sets of laws . The properties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) always and everywhere the same . But though there are some elements in human nature which remain the same , there are others which change , and are susceptible of improvement by instruction and by experience . The chief interest of politics as an experimental science lies in discovering by what means this improvement can be effected , and how far it may go . The habit of order , the habit of patience , the faith in science , the disposition to listen to reason , are all points in which history records progress ; struggles for civil , or for political , or for social equality , have all at one time or another been the source of far more trouble than they cause in our own time ; and it is possible that the question of economic equality also may , when its various aspects have been more calmly and carefully discussed , and the method of experiment has been more fully applied to it , prove less menacing to the peace of society than many deem it to-day .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
