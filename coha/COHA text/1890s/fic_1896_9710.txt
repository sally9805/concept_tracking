BRIDGET MONAHAN seated on box , L. , or coil of rope , apparently sea-sick . JASPER and a few sailors at rail , R. ) JERRY . I do n't care what you-all think about it , but I say that this vessel is haunted all right , all right . You do n't catch me going down in de cellar of this vessel after potatoes any more . I tell you , there 's a hoodoo ' round here ; may be dat Irish woman , for all I knows . BRIDGET . Look here , you lump of African bog , do n't mention my name through the opening of your face ! If I was healthy enough I 'd rise up and throw you over the fence of this ship . But I 'm so sea-sick that I ca n't stand on my feet , and it 's lucky for you that I ca n't . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big , black Tom-cat or I 'll forget I 'm sick and dance on your neck like I would at Donnybrook fair . Get out of my sight , you nagur ! ( Grabs at bundle beside her and throws it at JERRY . ) JERRY . Here , hold on ; do n't insult one of the officers of this ship . You 're nothing but an ordinary passenger , I 'm de head cook and superintendent of de provision department . I 'm de sutler , commissary , and food mixer . If I say , " You do n't eat , " you do n't eat . So look out , Irish , or I 'll drop a handful of shamrocks in your soup and set you crazy . JASPER. ( crosses down ) Here , stop all this idle talk . The lady is a passenger and you are the cook of this vessel . JERRY . I know my place and I knows her place , too . I tell you , you 're all " Jonahed " and hoodooed . There 's a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JASPER . Very well . If there is anything wrong we 'll ferret it out . Wo n't we , boys ? SAILORS . Yes . Overboard with the Jonah ! JASPER . Take a look through the hold . Be careful of lights , as we have plenty of powder on board . Do n't forget that . ( Sailors exit cabin , R. ) JERRY . Suppose somebody was to drop a cigarette in dat powder . Phew ! would n't we go up like sky-rockets . It makes me almost turn pale to think of it . I 'm black in de face , but I 've got a white heart . It 's a brave heart , but I 've got a pair of cowardly legs . Once I get on dry land you do n't catch this nigger on water again . I wish I could catch dat man dat wrote " A Life on de Ocean Wave . " I 'd give him a grave in de ocean wid a wave of my razor . ( Enters cabin . ) BRIDGET . To think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love ! you 've driven me almost crazy , and to make me follow a man over land and water this way . My heart 's in my mouth . Ugh ! It ai n't my heart , it 's something I 've swallowed . ( Buries her face in a handkerchief , rocks and moans ad lib . ) JASPER . Should the sailors find any one whom they suspect , it would be sure death . Ignorant , superstitious set , but we need a rough crew at present . The Americans are sending arms and ammunition to the Cuban rebels . We are acting as a blockade-runner , taking arms to Cubans , but really we are in the pay of the Spanish government . It pays better , and we get a revenue from both parties . These infernal Yankees are considered smart , but we 're one too many for them . Spain will get even with them when the time comes . ( PHELIM MCNAB comes from cabin very sick , L. ) PHELIM . I 'm doing nothing but rolling around and creeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a pleasant ride in a row-boat from Florida to Cuba ! But here I am half dead , and I ca n't keep my insides from being outsides . ( At this moment he sees BRIDGET . JASPER is at rail with glass busy scanning the horizon ) What do I see ? Bridget Monahan , and on this vessel ! I 'm dead and buried . What the deuce is she following me around everywhere for ? She must n't see me ; I 'll skip away from Master Richard if we reach Cuba . ( Hides behind mast as BRIDGET looks up . ) BRIDGET . Oh , Phelim , Phelim , where are you ? PHELIM . I 'm where you wo n't find me . I 'll jump overboard before you can grab me BRIDGET . To leave me this way ! And I 'm following you all over just for love . PHELIM . You 're not the only oyster-shell in the basket ! ( L. ) ( CARL WEISBEER , heard in cabin . ) CARL . Oh , my ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and walk home ! ( CARL staggers out of cabin , and almost falls over BRIDGET as he goes , L. ) BRIDGET . Ca n't you see where you 're going , you sausage-headed Dutchman ! PHELIM. ( behind mast ) Ireland and Germany will have a scrap ! I 'm referee ! BRIDGET . Do n't stand there looking at me ! Say something , if you have anything on your mind , out with it  --  up with it ! CARL . Yes . ( staggers to rail  --  business of sea-sick ) It 's off my mind ! PHELIM . That Dutchman has made me sick ! ( Staggers R. , and business of sick . ) BRIDGET . Oh ! There 's a poor man over there who feels had  --  I 'll go over and console him . ( Goes towards PHELIM , and as she talks he avoids her , turns his face away , and replies only in monosyllables . Are you very ill , my poor man ? Sure I did n't see you on this vessel before . Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick , so I am ! Let me see your face , my poor man ! ( As she tries to get a look at him he manages to back away , then goes around the mast , then suddenly staggers sideways into cabin , and disappears , much to BRIDGET 'S surprise . ) Sure I think the man 's crazy ! Well , well , once I lay my hands on Phelim McNab he 'll never get away from me . I heard he was in Cuba , so I set out on his track . I 'm suffering a good bit for him ( PHELIM looks out of cabin ) but he 'll pay for it all . I 'll make him suffer twice as much ! PHELIM . You will  --  nit ! ( Disappears . ) BRIDGET . Maybe the poor Dutchman needs consolation ! CARL . No , I do n't need constellation ; I want a constitution . I 'll get some of dot Irishman 's vitsky ( starts for cabin . ) BRIDGET . Hold on there ! I want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! Funny how womens always bodder a man when he do n't want them around . ( Darts into cabin , and bumps into VALDEZ , who is entering from it . CARL falls backward and rises . ) I beg your puddings ! ( Enters cabin . ) BRIDGET . Ah , Captin dear , but you 're a fine man . You run into that lump of sourkrout as nate as a gossoon would thump a head at Donnybrook ! Say ! Captin dear , I 'm sick ! VALDEZ . You look it . BRIDGET . I feel it . Say , Captin , have you a private bottle that 's good for indigestion caused by sea-sickness ? VALDEZ . No ! Your place is in the cabin , not on deck . BRIDGET . Is that so ? I would n't have known it if you had n't told me . Sure you 're a peacock wid your gold-lace cap and spangles on your clothes . What a long tail our cat 's got ! Ah ! Ye Spanish cheroot , you ! If the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feathers off of ye mighty quick . VALDEZ . Ah ! Bah ! BRIDGET . Do n't say bah to me . I 'm not a sheep . I 'm a little Irish lamb , and you 'll not put any mint sauce on me , either . That for you and old Spain ! ( Snaps her finger . ) I 'd like to see old Weyley put me in jail . I 'd have the whole of Ireland over here in a week . VALDEZ . Hold your tongue ! BRIDGET . I ca n't . It 's too slippery . And you 'll not hold it for me , either . I 'll have the last word . I 'm a woman , and I never let a man have the last word . I 'll  --  I 'll  --  I 'd talk to you some more , but I 'm sick . ( Business with handkerchief , and staggers into cabin trying to talk to VALDEZ . ) I 'll see you when I can talk . VALDEZ . I must abandon this life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . The papers will secure a vast estate , and none can point to me as the criminal . Don Alvarez trusted me in all things , and even in his will made me his heir in case his only child should die . In an evil moment I removed him and placed the little girl upon a vessel sailing for an American port . It was not my first crime as the cursed brand of the felon was seared in my flesh . ( Enter JASPER from cabin . ) JASPER . Captain ( salutes ) , I have observed the American closely , as you have ordered me . I believe he is a spy , and if so , will stand in our way if we attempt to run this cargo into the hands of the Spanish authorities . VALDEZ . Well , he is but one American among us all ! You know what to do if he becomes two inquisitive . He is but a passenger , same as the others  --  but we did n't promise to land them anywhere , did we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , but not landed yet ! Mr. Richard Carson had best keep a quiet tongue in his head  --  or  --  VALDEZ . Or  --  you 'll keep it quiet for him . That 's the idea ! I 'll stroll into the cabin and observe him myself . ( Enters cabin . ) JASPER . These passengers imagine that they own this vessel , but they 'll have a rude awakening before long . ( Noise heard in cabin ; music , R. ) ( ELINORA rushes from cabin , pursued by sailors ; she eludes them and crosses to R. C. , sailors L. ) LOPEZ . A stowaway ! We found her concealed in the hold . JASPER . Let her be secured ! ( Sailors rush towards her . She runs towards cabin and into the arms of RICHARD CARSON , who enters from it . Sailors start back . Picture . ) ELINORA . Save me , or they will kill me ! RICHARD . What does this mean ? Why do you attack a defenceless girl ? JASPER . She is a stowaway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over with the Jonah ! ELINORA . Do n't let them kill me , sir . I will leave the vessel if they will but set me adrift upon a spar ! Will you protect me ? RICHARD . With my life ! He who attempts to harm you will answer to me ! You are under my protection ! JASPER . Down with the American if he interferes . RICHARD . Advance , cowards , advance ! but the first who approaches will lie upon this deck . I am an American , and I protect a female in distress wherever I find her ! JASPER . I warn you not to interfere with me or this crew if you value your life . ELINORA . Do not make enemies of them on my account . Leave me to them . You must not sacrifice your life for mine . RICHARD . I have faced death top often to allow these curs to frighten me . They may intimidate a woman , but a man is not afraid of such dogs . JASPER . Surrender ! We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lie ! You 're all against two . I 'm in this fight with you , Master Richard . We 're two against the lot of ' em . CARL . ( comes from cabin ) Make it three . I fights mit you against dat gang of snoozers . JASPER . Down with them ! No quarter ! Make quick work of it ! ( Music .  --  JASPER and Sailors attack RICHARD , who fells JASPER to the deck . CARL knocks down a sailor , and PHELIM levels a briar-wood pipe at them . Sailors fall back . ) PHELIM . Be gob , but they 're afraid of a briar-wood pipe ( laughs ) . ( Enter VALDEZ from cabin . ) VALDEZ . What is the meaning of this tumult ? JASPER. ( who has risen ) We found a stowaway , and that American busybody interfered with us . He struck me , but his life will pay for the blow . CARL . Ah ! blow all you want to . You 're a blower from Blowersville . PHELIM . A fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then let me bluff them with a pipe . Dutchy , we 're the boys to make them dance to our music , ai n't we ? CARL . If I play de " Wacht am Rhine " I 'll make ' em do de " hitchy kitchy , " I bet you . VALDEZ. ( to Jasper ) Leave all to me . I 'll give you a chance to retaliate in a short time . ( Aloud ) Jasper , no more of this unseemly conduct . Take the men forward . JASPER . All right , Captain . ( JASPER and Sailors exit , R. 1 E. ) PHELIM . German regiment , attention ! Fall in ! By the right flank ! By platoons ! Form a hollow square ! In a double line ! Forward  --  march ! ( Putting CARL into short drill , they exit into cabin , imitating a drum , one singing " Yankee Doodle . " ) VALDEZ. ( to RICHARD ) This is a stowaway and sailors as a rule treat them in a rough manner . I will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( aside ) and a solid apology , rest assured . ( Enters cabin . ) ELINORA . Seor , how can I ever repay you for risking your life to save mine ? RICHARD . Do not speak of the matter . Danger is past and you are safe . I have simply performed my duty as a man . ELINORA . Your face and noble action will be engraven upon my heart . RICHARD . What is your name ? ELINORA . I am called Little Cuba . You are an American , and all Americans are friends of the poor struggling patriots of Cuba . I can therefore trust you . With the aid and friendship of Americans Cuba will be free  --  free as you are yourselves . You may surmise that I am a spy , and so I am . This vessel , though a blockade runner and apparently taking arms and ammunition to the patriots , is in reality in the hands of a Spanish villain who will allow the Spaniards to take this vessel and cargo if he can . The Captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst foe . He is a villain ! RICHARD . So I have judged him . We came aboard as passengers to Havana from Key West , and I have seen enough of him to suspect that his crew of ruffians would not hesitate at murder . But tell me , do they suspect you ? ELINORA . I think not , merely taking me for a stowaway or Jonah . I am known as Elinora to all save you . I wish to reach Havana for a certain purpose , and to be of service to Cuba . I hope to aid the brave men who will avenge Maceo 's death . RICHARD . Aye , and to pay back the cowardly curs who basely murdered him . A million Americans will spring to arms if haughty Spain but dares to offer another insult to our flag . ELINORA . Bravely said , and I know you mean every word of it . The story of my life is a sad one , and would weary you to relate it . I will merely say that my father was murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , was sent away in the care of hired villains . I managed to escape , and in after years to return to Cuba , only to find the villain in full possession of my father 's estates ; but he had departed for Spain , and I could prove no claim ; I am on the trail of that villain , and I feel that some day I will meet him face to face . ( Crosses to L. ) RICHARD . Did you ever see him , or note anything peculiar whereby you might identify him ? ( VALDEZ appears at cabin door and listens . ) ELINORA . On that fatal night I heard my father 's cry for help , and rushed to his assistance . I seized the assassin by the arm , and as he threw me aside I saw by a flash of lightning that gleamed through the window , deeply imprinted on the man 's hand a letter  --  the letter A ! ( VALDEZ starts  --  looks at palm of his hand , and goes behind mast . ) RICHARD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago in the Spanish settlements to burn a letter upon a criminal 's arm , hand , or shoulder . VALDEZ . ' T is his child  --  but I am safe if I can keep this accursed mark hidden . ( Enters cabin . ) ELINORA . That is my only clue , and a small voice within my heart that bids me hope  --  watch and wait . RICHARD . We must leave this vessel before she reaches the island of Cuba ! Perhaps we may secure one of the boats , and thus make our escape . ELINORA . The Captain interfered merely to blind you ! ( Music  --  VALDEZ , JASPER and sailors come from cabin . ) VALDEZ . There is the stowaway . She is a spy , and you may do with her as you like . JASPER . Cast her overboard ! SAILORS . Yes  --  throw her overboard ! RICHARD . Would you murder a defenceless woman ? VALDEZ . I am the captain of this vessel , and will do as I please . RICHARD . But you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my protection . Remember I am a passenger , and claim my rights as such . VALDEZ . I 'll hang you from the yard-arm for interfering with me and my orders . RICHARD . Where is Phelim ? VALDEZ. ( laughs ) Your German and Irish friends are secured below . BRIDGET . ( at cabin ) If there 's any one locked up below , sure I 'll unlock ' em again . ( Disappears . ) VALDEZ . Now , my fine American , you 're left to yourself , and I leave you to the tender mercies of my crew . RICHARD . You are a pirate , a villain ! Entrusted with this cargo for the Cubans , you intend to betray them . VALDEZ . I 'll make sure you wo n't tell any one about it . Seize him ! ( Sailors seize RICHARD . ) RICHARD . You treacherous dog ! VALDEZ . I 'd send a bullet through your brain , but I 've reserved you for something else . I 'll try your nerve ; I 'll try your American courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see that cannon ? Bind him to its muzzle . ( RICHARD is bound by rope , facing the cannon , the muzzle to his breast . ) ELINORA . Surely you would not doom him to such a horrible fate . Spare him ! Take my life if you will , but be merciful to him . ( Kneels to VALDEZ . ) RICHARD . Do not kneel to that villain . Arise ! I am an American , and I can die in the defence of the downtrodden and for a woman , alone and unprotected . An American defies the cowardly Spanish dogs who yelp and bark at my heels . VALDEZ . Seize this girl ! ( Two sailors seize ELINORA . ) Lopez , to your post ! LOPEZ . Aye , aye , Captain ! ( Stands ready to fire cannon . ) ( ELINORA suddenly breaks from sailors , snatching a revolver from the belt of one , and levels it at VALDEZ . Picture . ) ELINORA . Speak the word to fire that gun and you are a dead man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike up ELINORA 'S hand . General fight takes place . PHELIM attacks LOPEZ , CARL attacks JASPER . BRIDGET runs on from cabin with a broom and attacks sailors . LOPEZ suddenly fights his way to the cannon . ELINORA quickly releases RICHARD from cannon . Soon as RICHARD is out of the way the cannon is fired at VALDEZ 'S command . PHELIM waving small American flag , and on this quick picture CURTAIN ACT II SCENE .  --  Interior of old inn , Matanzas . See scene plot . Music . LOPEZ , as landlord of inn , discovered . Several men are seated at table , R. C. LOPEZ . The Captain will pay a good price if we succeed The American carries a quantity of money , and besides , he is not wanted in Cuba . ( Enter JASPER , disguised , door flat . ) JASPER . Be careful ! The American will soon be here . Remember ! You are all patriots now . You were never on board of the blockade runner , and above all , do not let him see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Enter BRIDGET , door F. ) BRIDGET . What a murdering country and what a lot of homely men ! Nose on ' em like badgers and whiskers like a baboon ! Sure , if you were in Ireland and St. Patrick was alive he 'd drive yees all into the sea for snakes and toads . Talk up , some one of yees , for I 'm in the humor for a fight . LOPEZ . My dear madam , what do you want ? BRIDGET . Is this a hotel or is it a museum ? LOPEZ . It is a hotel . BRIDGET . Well , I 'm glad I know what it is . ' Pon my word I never saw such an ugly lot of men in all my life ! But ye ca n't help it ! ( To one of the men ) Does your face hurt you ? Why do n't you try to wear it upside down ? Oh ! my ! What a face to stamp butter ? And there 's a man so cross-eyed that he can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel , show me the best room you have in the house . LOPEZ . This way , madam . We will do our best to make you comfortable . ( Bows her out , R. 1 E. ) BRIDGET . Oh ! what a homely lot of men ! They have scrubbing-brushes for whiskers ! Oh , my ! Oh , my ! I hope I wo n't dream about them ! ( Exit , R. 1 E. ) JASPER . That gabbling woman may be in our way . I wish Lopez had sense enough to refuse her accommodations . Still , we can easily rid ourselves of such people , if needs be . ( Enter RICHARD and PHELIM , door , F. ) RICHARD . Good evening , gentlemen ! JASPER . Good evening ! ( PHELIM , startled by the voice , comes down and circles about JASPER , as if to trace a resemblance , etc . ) PHELIM . I thought I remembered that voice . It belonged to as big a blackguard and cut-throat as ever trod the earth or sailed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your comparison is not an agreeable one , sir . PHELIM . And the man I mean was n't agreeable , either . But no matter . I suppose all Spaniards look alike ! JASPER . What do you mean ? PHELIM . They 're mean enough for anything . ( LOPEZ enters R. 1 E. , passes by PHELIM , who gazes at him intently . ) LOPEZ . Welcome gentlemen ! Make yourselves at home . PHELIM . We 'll do that , my bucko , whether you want us to or not . Sit down , Master Richard , when in Rome do as the Roman candles do  --  when in Cuba do as the Cubanians do  --  and we 'll do anybody that tries to do us . ( Sits down and puts his feet on the table . ) JASPER. ( to RICHARD ) I am always glad to meet Americans . They sympathize with us and aid us at every chance . RICHARD . We never refuse to extend a helping hand to the cause of liberty . Our Republic is made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they breathe the air of freedom they are anxious that all other lands may be as free ! I know not if you are a Cuban or a Spaniard , but I will say this to you , my heart is with the struggling Cubans , and I am ready to aid them in their battle against cruel oppression . Every liberty-loving man in the United States thinks as I do . PHELIM . And in Ireland , too ! We 're not free ourselves , but we 'll get there ! Here 's to the American eagle and Yankee Doodle that will make that yaller-faced Weyler " walk Spanish " if he tries a bluff on us , now . JASPER . I 'm glad to meet you both ; we need aid and the services of brave men . We are all patriots and we 're friends of the cause . RICHARD . I am pleased to meet you ! There is such a thing as pretending to be friendly to Cuba and betraying those who risk their lives in her cause . JASPER . That is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Here comes one who has been outlawed for his devotion to Cuba , Seor Rial . ( Enter VALDEZ , L. 1 E. He is thoroughly disguised . ) Seor Rial , I wish you to meet this brave American  --  he is one of us in heart and intentions . VALDEZ . Seor American , I am proud to meet you ! ( Shakes hands . ) PHELIM . And I 'm Phelim McNab ! You 're Seor Rial , and I 'm the " rale " thing ! I think that I have met you before . VALDEZ . That is hardly possible . I am a native of this isle and have never visited your country ! PHELIM . You may not have been in Ireland but I think you 've been on the water ! VALDEZ. ( laughs ) I am not a sailor . PHELIM . But you might be a cruiser , a blockade runner , or a sort of a pirate . VALDEZ . Sir ! I will not brook an insult . PHELIM . Keep your shirt on ! I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can wear it . RICHARD . Phelim , the subject is not a pleasant one to Seor Rial . PHELIM . Maybe it 's too " real " for him . Well , I 've spoke my mind and that 's all there is about it . It 's not my fault if he looks like a black-muzzled pirate or a rapscallion , is it ? Sit down " Real " and put a piece of ice on your cocoa-nut to keep your brains cool . VALDEZ. ( to RICHARD ) I will not notice your eccentric friend . I do not understand his style of joking . PHELIM . You 'll see the joke later on . ( Enter ELINORA disguised as a Cuban girl . She comes over to table , is surprised to see RICHARD . ) VALDEZ . Come , Lopez ! Bring us some of your choice wine , mind you , none of your cheap red vinegar  --  but the real juice of grapes . ( ELINORA starts at the voice , but lights a cigarette by scratching a match upon the bald part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold on there ! What do you take my skull for ? A bit of sandpaper or the side of a match-box ? ELINORA . Seor will please excuse me , I am very near-sighted . PHELIM . Well ! Well ! She 's that near-sighted she did n't know I had a head on me . Well , I accept your apology , but do n't do it again . ( LOPEZ returns with bottle of wine and glasses . Places it on table . Pours out wine . VALDEZ unobserved pours contents of small vial into RICHARD 'S glass . ELINORA sees the action . ) VALDEZ . Here is to our cause , and may it prove successful ! ( As RICHARD is about to drink ELINORA spills his wine , then pretends it was an accident . ) ELINORA . Oh ! excuse me . I am so near-sighted . VALDEZ. ( aside ) Confounded meddler ! ( Rises and goes to ELINORA . ) Who are you ? ELINORA . I am myself , who are you ? VALDEZ . Answer ; where did you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get in here ? ELINORA . Through the door . I could n't drop down through the chimney , could I ? ( Blows smoke into VALDEZ 'S face . ) VALDEZ . None of your insolence ! What do you want here ? ELINORA . Nothing . Have you got it ? VALDEZ . I 'll wring your neck for you . ELINORA . No , you wo n't . I do n't care that for you ! ( Snaps finger at him . ) I 'm not afraid of you . VALDEZ . A still tongue makes a wise head ! ELINORA . Then you 'll never be wise . You talk too much ! VALDEZ . What was your object in striking that gentleman 's wine glass ? ELINORA . Merely an accident , I assure you . It was fit to drink , was n't it ? You would n't do anything crooked , would you ? VALDEZ . I 'd like to know who and what you are ! ELINORA . You 'd like to know who and what I am . I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are both fighting for a cause . Mine is a good one . I do n't know about yours . Are you with us heart and soul ? ( Crosses to table . ) JASPER. ( coming to them ) . Have no words ! Just cut her throat . VALDEZ. ( to JASPER ) No , I 'll have no words with her . The American is growing uneasy . Let the girl go . I 'll fix her after we get rid of the American . JASPER . If you 'll let me attend to him I 'll warrant he wo n't be so impudent and bold . VALDEZ. ( to ELINORA ) Some people might be offended at your silly remarks , but we are too sensible , and we do n't notice it . Will you take a hand in the game we are about to play ? ELINORA . Not now . I will take a hand in the game you are going to play by and by . VALDEZ . I do n't quite catch your meaning . ELINORA . I dare say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go and sit down . I 'll make one of your merry party . VALDEZ. ( to LOPEZ ) Lopez , we will adjourn to your private room . Every idiot has a right to this public apartment , it seems . ELINORA . Make yourself at home , Mr. Idiot . Do n't worry on my account . ( Goes up stage . ) LOPEZ . You can retire to my room , seors . PHELIM . This room is all right , and as for the kid yonder , she has a right to be in here . This is a public inn . VALDEZ . You do n't know whom to trust these times . Remember , the government has spies in all directions . I am not risking my head if you are . PHELIM . I am an American citizen , and until I do something over here I defy Weyler , Spain , and the whole kitten crew of blackguards to lay a finger on me ! That 's what ! RICHARD . Seor Rial , if you choose to adjourn to another room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interest of safety . RICHARD . Lead on , sir ! ( They arise and start to exit R. 2 E. ELINORA makes signals to RICHARD to attract his attention , but he fails to note them . ) PHELIM , who is going out last , sees the motions and imitates them in a grotesque manner . ) PHELIM . She thinks I belong to her lodge ! She 's giving me the grip and the password . " Erin go Bragh ! "  --  " E Pluribus Onions ! " " Cad Millia Failthey ! " Ta-laa-loo-loo ! ( Makes frantic and eccentric signals , and exits triumphant , R. 2 E. ) ELINORA . He failed to note my signal of warning . He is lost if he remains here  --  what can I do ? Return here as soon as possible , but not in this attire , for I believe the villain has partially penetrated this disguise . The maid engaged in this inn is in my pay ; to her I will appeal for immediate aid . Come what may , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CARL . Hello , you ! Come here , I want to say something to you ! Did you see two gentlemen fellers around here  --  one is a ' merican , the other a Micky Irishwoman ? ELINORA . I have no time , sir , to answer your questions . Seek the landlord in that room ( points R. 2 E. ) You will excuse me , I am in a great hurry . ( Exits , L. 1 E. ) CARL . ( imitates voice ) Excuse me ! I 'm in a great hurry ! Well , that lady is n't a bit obliging . Excuse me , I 'm in a hurry ! Get out , you Spanish cheroot ! You ai n't got any more sense than I 've got . ( BRIDGET descends steps . ) BRIDGET . Ah , ha ! There you are ! ( Grabs CARL . ) Now , my bucko , I have a hold on you ! Where 's that deceiving Irish friend of yours ? CARL . Cross my suspenders , I do n't know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you ! You tell me where he is , and I 'll tell you ! What have I got to do with your troubles ? Find him if you want him , but I ai n't got nothing to do with your foolishness . BRIDGET . Foolishness , is it ? You 'll find that I 'm not fooling . He promised to marry me , and borrowed five dollars from me to buy the ring , and he lit out ! CARL . ( laughs ) He gave you de slip , did he ? BRIDGET . ( hits him ) What are you laughing at , you Dutch herring ! I 'll give you a smack that will knock you clean back to Germany like a sky-rocket ! CARL . My dear woman , I do n't blame you for trying to find your mash , but do n't soak me in the jaw like that . BRIDGET . Well , I 'll find him , so I will ! And you 'll go with me ! CARL . I 'll go with you , " nit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? ( Slaps him . ) Nit is it ? CARL . I 'll go with you nit , yes  --  I said mit you , not nit you ! " Nit " means yes in German . BRIDGET . ( crosses to L. ) I 'll just keep my fins on you for safe keeping . Come right along Mr. Smearcase ; Ireland 's got a hold of you now , and it 's home rule or nothing . CARL . This is tough on Germany ! What 's this world a coming to , when a woman can kidnap a man dis way and de poor sucker ca n't help himself ! ( Business . She leads him out L. 1 E. He is protesting in vain . ) ( Enter ELINORA , richly attired in Spanish female costume , door in flat . ) ELINORA . Perhaps I may be able to save him . I must dissemble as much as possible . No harm must come to Richard while I am here . ( Enter PHELIM , L. 1 E. Begins a flirtation with her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met twice yesterday  --  and I believe she 's pretty well gone on me . ELINORA. ( aside ) I must get rid of this troublesome admirer in some manner , and yet keep him near in case I need his assistance . PHELIM. ( comes to her ) You 're a bird ! I mean you 're pretty as a bird . ELINORA . Ah , seor , you flatter me . PHELIM . Not a bit of it . I bowed twice to you this afternoon . I 'm a man that falls in love mighty quick ! ELINORA . The seor is a gallant man ! ( PHELIM has business of bowing . ) PHELIM . Do you know that I think a great deal of you ! What is your name ? ELINORA . Helena Matanzas ! PHELIM . Is that so ? What is it in English ? ELINORA . Same thing ! Helena Matanzas . PHELIM . You 're one of the prettiest girls I 've seen over here . Now , then , I hate to be fooling around and wasting time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , what do you ? Will you marry me and become Mrs. Phelim McNab instead of Helen Kansas ? ELINORA . Matanzas ! PHELIM . Yes , Matanzas ! Now , do n't jump at me . I know I 'm a very fascinating man . I know you ca n't resist me , but try to calm yourself and just show that you 're anxious in a lady-like way . ELINORA . Oh , seor , this is so sudden . PHELIM . I told you I was a sudden man . Come , what do you say about it ? ELINORA. ( aside ) I may as well carry out the joke just to pacify him . ( Aloud ) Well , I 'll tell you , we will have to elope . You see , my uncle is a very peculiar man . He watches me all the time . Disguised as my maid , we might escape from here unobserved . PHELIM . But where 's my bustle , my dress , my other fixings to be a lady ? ELINORA . I can get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal by saying " molasses , " and you are to reply " taffy . " PHELIM . I 'll say molasses and you 'll say taffy ? ELINORA . No . I say molasses . PHELIM . And I 'm taffy . But look here , you 're not giving me taffy , are you ? ELINORA . No ; you 'll get molasses . ( Exits up steps . ) PHELIM . Oh , molasses , you sweet creature , you . I feel like a rainbow smothered in honey , wid a million angels sprinkling gum drops over me . ( Exit L. 1 E. Introduce specially . ) ELINORA . ( Entering , descends steps ) At last I have a moment to myself to watch over Richard Carson and warn him of his great danger . I have placed that warm-hearted Irishman out of the way for the present , and I may be able to pursue my way without interruption . ( Enter CARL , R. 1 E. ) CARL . I got away from that Irish woman ! Ah ! There 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feet ! ( Kneels . ) From the first time what I looked at you I was struck ! I mean crazy foolish about you ! I never loved anybody before , and this is my first offence ! I know that that Irishman was making sheep 's eyes on you , but he 's no good ! He buried seven wives in Ireland , and St. Patrick chased him out for killing his grandfather ! Oh ! Miss  --  Miss  --  what is your name ?  --  I ca n't make resistance about you ! If you do n't have me I 'll jump overboard and hang myself ! I lay my Dutch heart at your feet and I accept you ! ELINORA . Rise ! ( He does so . ) From the first time I saw you I was struck with your manly beauty . CARL . Why , certainly ! ELINORA . I could not be seen leaving this place with you because my uncle and brothers watch every movement , but , disguised as my maid , we could leave here with security . CARL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELINORA . Yes . I 'll find garments for you . Now , there is no time for explanations . I will throw a bundle out of the window to you . I will also attire myself differently to avoid recognition . Now , go . I 'll be waiting for you here in the dark . To avoid mistakes I will say " molasses " and you will say " taffy . " CARL . You put molasses on me and I give you taffy ? ELINORA . Remember what I said ! Go  --  go  --  I hear some one coming . My uncle must not see us together . Go . Do n't stop to talk . ( She pushes him out R. 1 E. CARL attempts to talk . ) CARL . But which do I say  --  syrup of figs or peanut candy ? ELINORA . Go  --  go . We will be discovered . ( She forces him out . ) At last ! Was any one ever bothered in this way ? Well , I think it is the easiest way to rid myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover Richard Carson 's whereabouts , and leave my admirers to explain matters to each other . I have something more serious to attend to than love-making . ( Ascends stairs . ) ( Enter BRIDGET , R. 1 E. ) BRIDGET . The Dutchman gave me the slip . There 's some of the craziest lot of people around here I ever saw . You ca n't get a civil answer nor information of any kind . ( CARL enters R. 1 E. ) CARL . What was that you said I 'd say ? You say molasses and I say taffy " tooty-frooty . " BRIDGET . What are you talking about ? CARL . I do n't know ; I 'm in love . ( PHELIM enters boldly from L. 1 E. , but suddenly seeing BRIDGET he darts under the table and hides . ) BRIDGET . Where 's Phelim McNab , I ask you ? CARL . Well , the last time I saw him  --  ( PHELIM hits CARL on the foot with hand . ) Oh , the last time I seen him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him ? CARL . Well , I saw him  --  ( PHELIM hits him . ) I did n't see him until I looked at him . Nit , not , no . BRIDGET . Of course you did n't , you idiot . Now answer me , where was he and what was he doing ? ( PHELIM hits CARL again . ) CARL . He was hitting me on de foot . BRIDGET . What ? CARL . I say , he was standing on his feet . ( BRIDGET steps on PHELIM 'S hand unconsciously and keeps on talking to CARL . PHELIM grimaces , squirms and groans , She 's on my hand , she 's standing on my fingers , etc . ) BRIDGET . You 're a thick-headed fool . You know where Phelim is at this moment . I wish I could stand on him . PHELIM. ( aside ) You are standing on him . Oh , she 's like a ton of coal . BRIDGET . It wo n't be well for him when I lay my hands on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet your life I 'll find him . Bah ! you Dutch fool , get away out of my sight ! CARL . Yes , ma'am . ( She pushes him over ; he scrambles to his feet ; he loses his hat as he falls . PHELIM attempts to escape while her back is turned and drops his hat , C. , and returns under table . CARL scrambles around near it and drops his hat . Picks up PHELIM 'S and leaves his on the floor . Puts on PHELIM 'S hat . Soon as BRIDGET sees it she screams . ) BRIDGET . The hat ! The hat ! It 's Phelim 's hat ! ( Grabs it from CARL 'S head , and shrieks in a hysterical manner . PHELIM escapes , R. 1 E. ) CARL . De woman is crazy ! Dat 's my hat ! BRIDGET . It 's Phelim 's hat  --  and he 's here , or it 's the ghost of his hat ! Where is he ? ( Looks all around , and under table , still holding on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me to find him . If he 's in this house I 'll have him , if I have to tear it down from roof to cellar ! Come along ! I 've got his hat  --  and I 'll find the rest of him  --  or I 'll kill you ! CARL . Here I go again ! I was going to get married , but now I 'm going to get killed . Oh , molasses ! molasses ! Save your own taffy ! ( Begins to cry ; BRIDGET drags him out , R. 1 E. Enter VALDEZ , R. 2 E. , looks after CARL and BRIDGET . ) VALDEZ . There is no danger from that quarter , Our plot is progressing fairly well . With that Irishman out of the way the end is near . The American is engaged in a game of cards , and Lopez is watching an opportunity to drug his wine . ( Enter LOPEZ , R. 2 E. ) LOPEZ . It 's all right , Captain ! I had to wait my chance but I gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him have another if you can get a chance  --  we 'll make doubly sure . He has got enough money to pay for any damage we may do to this old shanty . LOPEZ . Where is that impudent girl ? VALDEZ . I do n't know , and I 'm not worried now , for you have succeeded . Let this room be kept dark for the present . ( LOPEZ takes the light . ) We will join the American , to avoid suspicion on his part . LOPEZ . What are you going to do with him ? VALDEZ . Do n't ask silly questions . What would you do to a mad dog who threatened to bite you ? ( Laughs and exits R. 2 E. with LOPEZ . ) ( Enter PHELIM R. 1 E. , disguised as " waiting maid ; " female garments . ) PHELIM . This is a nice get-up for a respectable man ! How do women get along inside of these togs , I wonder ? Well , I 'm all ready to elope if my black-eyed charmer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see us  --  I defy my own mother to know me . ( Enter CARL in female garments , L. 2 E. ) CARL . I 'm a woman but I do n't know it . I 'm all ready for to slope off and get married to her . ( Sees PHELIM . ) Ah ! There she is , Taffy Molasses ! PHELIM . Molasses taffy , butter scotch , and chewing gum . CARL . Is that you , my darling ? PHELIM . Yes , Petty ! I 'm your own birdie , waiting to fly ! ( They approach each other , and put arms around each other . ) CARL . I was afraid you would n't keep your promises . PHELIM . And I was afraid you 'd throw me down ! Ah , my darling , I love you so ! CARL . I love you harder than a dozen mules can kick . Give me one sweet kiss . PHELIM . Certainly !  --  a dozen if you want them ! I 'm a bird at kissing ! ( They prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces ; note the whiskers on chin or rough beard . ) CARL . Your face is full of sand-paper and pimples . PHELIM . And yours is like the rocky roads to Dublin . CARL . Well , kiss me , sweetheart , and let us skip de gutter . ( Just as they are about to kiss each other a noise is heard and BRIDGET comes down-stairs . CARL and PHELIM pick up their skirts and rush off R. and L. BRIDGET comes C. ) BRIDGET . I thought I heard the sound of voices and somebody scampering off . Well , I 'm not surprised at anything I see or hear in this crazy house . ( PHELIM returns L. 2 C. ) PHELIM . Molasses  --  taffy  --  molasses . BRIDGET . Who the deuce is it that wants molasses ? PHELIM . There she is . ( Goes to BRIDGET . ) I thought I heard some one coming , that 's why I scooted away . You 're not angry with me , are you ? ( Puts arms around her . ) BRIDGET . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . PHELIM . We 'll elope while we have the chance ! BRIDGET . It sounds like Phelim McNab 's voice , or I 'm a ghost ! Is that you , Phelim ? PHELIM . Yes , Helene , your own Phelim is at your side . One sweet kiss and away we go ! Fix your face and I 'll give you a smack that would water a horse ! ( He is just about to kiss her when LOPEZ enters L. 1 E. with a light . ) Holy Moses ! It 's Bridget ! BRIDGET . ( screams ) Phelim McNabs turned into a woman ! PHELIM . Legs , do your duty ! ( Runs off , holding up skirts , L. 1 E. ) BRIDGET . After him ! Woman or no woman , I 'll have every rag on him or her  --  whichever she or him happens to be . ( Dashes off in pursuit . Soon as she exits CARL rushes in , bumps into LOPEZ , and both fall from the shock . LOPEZ throws candlestick after CARL , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up-stairs  --  tripping over his female garments , falling down a few steps , and finally escaping up-stairs . LOPEZ groping to find candle , and with matches to relight candle during all of CARL 'S ad lib. business of escaping up steps . ) ( Enter RICHARD , VALDEZ , JASPER , and men from R. 2 E. ) RICHARD . I believe I will bid you good-night . I feel very drowsy ; a strange feeling seems to steal over me and my limbs refuse to bear me . ( Sinks in chair . ) What does this mean ? VALDEZ . It means , my fine American braggart , that you are drugged and in the power of Roderick Valdez . RICHARD . Valdez ! ( Attempts to rise . ) Coward ! VALDEZ . Yes , and you are helpless to defend yourself . ( Laughs . ) Look about you . You are surrounded by men in my employ . You will never leave this place alive ! RICHARD . Would you murder me in my helpless condition ? VALDEZ . I mean to burn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flames you are at liberty to do so . Bear him to the stairway and tie him . ( JASPER and men force RICHARD to stairs and bind him with rope . Soon as this is done ELINORA darts down stairs . ) ELINORA . Cowards ! Do you intend to murder this brave man ? Stand back ! You call yourselves men , but you are miserable dogs . JASPER . Out of the way , no power can save him now . ELINORA . I will save him or die by his side . ( Levels pistol at the group . They fall back . ) Cowards ! a woman is a match for such Spaniard curs as you are . ( LOPEZ steals behind her unobserved . ) VALDEZ . You are quite theatrical in your language and deeds , but you have reckoned without your host . ( LOPEZ suddenly seizes the pistol from her grasp and two men seize her quickly . ) Now , my fair lady ! You see how easily the tables are turned when you are dealing with men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vipers and crawling reptiles . Men of courage do not war on women nor murder helpless men . VALDEZ . Look your last upon him ! Bear her into that room and lock the door . ( She is taken into R. 1 E. and door locked . ) Now then apply the torch and let their cry for help be answered by the roaring flames . ( LOPEZ with a torch is seen to ignite the tow upon stairs , etc . Music . Flames appear R. and L. Red fire under stairs . Footnote : 1Kb ) VALDEZ . Now then out of the building everybody . ( All exit R. 1 E. ELINORA batters down the door with an axe after crying for help in vain . She runs over to RICHARD and unties him and begins to assist him up the stairs just as VALDEZ , JASPER , and followers enter hurriedly , L. ) VALDEZ . By all the fiends , she has escaped from the room and is saving the American . Shoot ! Shoot them down . It 's the Cuban spy ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and level them at villains . ) PHELIM . Shoot if you dare ! CARL . Down on your knees or I 'll pepper you full of holes . ( They cover ELINORA 'S escape up the steps . Flames , smoke , etc. , add to the picture . VALDEZ and men are huddled down L. ) CURTAIN ACT III SCENE .  --  Old sugar house used as headquarters and prison by VALDEZ ( see scene plot ) . Music . JASPER and several Spanish guerillas discovered in room , L. , some seated on boxes . JASPER at small table , examining papers by aid of candle . JASPER . We 've done much better than we expected . The Captain will be pleased with our work . It wo n't do to keep the prisoners in the other building  --  we 'd better have them here where we can watch every movement . ( Enter SOPHIE , L. , a young Ingenue . ) SOPHIE . Oh , Mr. Jasper , I wanted to tell you that the prisoners are quarreling , and one threatens to throw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet it 's that Irishman . He 'd try to quarrel with himself if he was the only one in the building . SOPHIE . I think that 's the very one that started the quarrel . He had the impudence to try to kiss me ! He asked me if I 'd miss a kiss , and I said that I would n't miss a kiss for anything , and he actually tried to kiss me then and there . JASPER . Bring the prisoners into this building . ( LOPEZ exits L. ) They will be much safer , and leave room for quieter ones . ( To SOPHIE . ) You had better remain away from our American prisoners . They are too bold and impudent . SOPHIE . Well , I rather like them to be smart and attentive ! I do n't like these drowsy kinds of men . Oh , if all Americans are like these prisoners , I 'd like to get acquainted with them . JASPER . The acquaintance wo n't last long  --  we 'll soon be rid of them . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with chains , and seeming quite anxious to quarrel with each other . ) PHELIM . I wo n't be hitched up with the Dutch ! The idea of chaining me to that barrel of sour krout . It 's an insult to Ireland , and I wo n't stand it . CARL . Do n't put airs on ! Do n't you think you 're afraid of me ! If you was twice as big as Ireland I would n't care ! I do n't want to be in company with you . Bite this chain in two , and you go my way and I 'll go yours ! PHELIM . You 'll not follow me around any more . Say you ( to JASPER ) . Put this Dutchman into a jail by himself ! CARL . Yes  --  give me a bridle chamber all to my lonesome ! Throw this in the cellar with the rats and the mices and the cockroaches . PHELIM . If a rat would look at you it would have the jim-jams . JASPER . Enough of this quarreling . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shot ! PHELIM . Well , I 'd rather be shot than have this Dutchman tagging around after me . ( Sees SOPHIE . ) Ah ! there 's the little beauty that brought my dinner to me ! Ah ! my , but she 's sweet ; and you 're not married , are you ? SOPHIE . No , indeed ; I 'm still single . PHELIM . Well , I do n't blame you for being single . Look at the mugs of the men around you ! They look like " Jo-Jo . " Then look at me  --  a fine , handsome man ! No wonder you 're crazy about me . Can you blame her ? Ah ! if I was n't chained up I 'd make love to you and marry you in a minute ! SOPHIE . It 's too bad you are all chained up ! I feel sorry for you . PHELIM . You 're not half as sorry as I am ! JASPER ( to LOPEZ ) . Place them in that room ! ( Indicates room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a soldier attempt to put PHELIM and CARL into room , R. ) PHELIM . Do n't shove me . Do n't put your dirty paws on me . Remember that President McKinley , Mark Hanna , and Jerry Simpson are looking at you ! Do n't shove me , I tell you  --  ( They are placed in room , R. , and door in partition locked . ) Come in here , the whole lot of you , and I 'll wipe the floor up with you . I can lick the whole Spanish army and old Weyler thrown in ! You 're afraid to come in here , you yaller-faced monkeys ! Speaking of monkeys , there 's a rat . ( Suddenly spies an imaginary rat off right . Seizes a stuffed club from floor and makes a dive to strike the rat . The sudden movement and lurch to R. pulls CARL down sprawling to the floor , and as they both sprawl on the floor they begin to pummel each other . LOPEZ opens the door , comes in to separate them . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashes out of room , R. , and hurriedly closes and locks the door . CARL and PHELIM shake hands and begin singing : ) " Oh , the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave . " PHELIM . Let them come in again and interfere in our family matters again ! CARL . Germany and Ireland is united again ! Three cheers for me and myself ! PHELIM . No , no ; three cheers for me ! CARL . Three cheers for the both of us . JASPER. ( to LOPEZ ) Do n't bother with them . Let them remain there until the Captain disposes of them . ( Whistle heard off L. ) There is his signal . Something of importance has occurred ! ( Exit JASPER , LOPEZ , and Soldiers L. 3 E. , leaving SOPHIE alone in room , L. ) PHELIM . I believe they 've gone out ! ( Peers through keyhole of door . ) There 's no one in there but the girl . Now , Carl  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll frighten her ! I 'm going to telephone to her . ( Through keyhole . ) I say , young woman  --  Miss  --  a  --  Miss  --  a  --  SOPHIE . Sophie is my name ! PHELIM . Well , Sophia , come over here . SOPHIE . I 'm afraid to . If they catch me conversing with you there will be trouble . PHELIM . A good smart , clever girl like you is n't going to be caught ! Come over , my angel . CARL . You could coax birds out of a tree ! You 're such a liar . ( SOPHIE comes to door . ) SOPHIE . What do you want ? PHELIM . Are the rapscallions all gone ? SOPHIE . They have gone into the other building . PHELIM . Could n't you open the door for a minute ? SOPHIE . No , indeed ! The key is in the lock , but I would n't dare to touch it . PHELIM . Ah ! you are a brave girl  --  beautiful and sweet as a hive full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your sweet face I could die content . Just turn the key in the lock  --  that 's a good girl . CARL . Yes ; just twist it , twist it . PHELIM . Shut up ! There 's no blarney in you ! Your head is full of smearcase . ( To SOPHIE ) Go ahead , Sophie , dear  --  pretty little Sophie ! SOPHIE . I 'm sure they 'll be real angry if I open this door . There 's a whole bunch of keys in the door . PHELIM . I wo n't run away  --  we ca n't  --  we 're chained hand and foot . CARL . Yes ; we 're two pug dogs chained up . PHELIM . Shut up , will you ! ( To SOPHIE ) Sophie ! if ever I get away from here , and I can induce you to go to the United States , I 'll marry you . My father owns the United States mint , where they make all the money . CARL . And my father owns a lot of pepper mint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so afraid I 'll be caught by the soldiers . ( Unlocks door . ) There ! I 've unlocked the door , but you must n't come out . PHELIM . Why , of course not ! Ah , Sophie , you 're an angel . I 'll buy you a pair of wings ! CARL . Yes ; then you 'll be " fly . " ( PHELIM comes out , dragging CARL with him . ) PHELIM . How can I ever repay you , my darling Sophie , for your kindness ( embraces her ) . There 's a kiss for you . ( CARL tries to kiss her , but PHELIM prevents him . ) Not you . You 're not in this . You do n't belong to our lodge . CARL . Well , I 'm grateful , same as you are . PHELIM . That may be , but you do n't kiss Sophie . Sophie belongs to me . The idea of you trying to kiss Sophie ! Why , it 's obstropulous ! ( JASPER heard outside , L. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended to at once . SOPHIE . Oh , they are returning ! Quick , get into the room , so I can lock the door ! PHELIM . No ; we 'll lock the door . ( Takes bunch of keys . ) We 'll lock ourselves in . SOPHIE . Oh , no ; that wo n't do . PHELIM . Oh , yes , it will , Sophie darling . Sh  --  There 's some one coming . Sneak out quick as you can . I 'll meet you in here or outside . Go on , Sophie , if you love me ! Be quick and skip ! SOPHIE . Oh , I do n't know how this will end ! ( She exits , L. ) PHELIM . I wish I did . Now then , Carl , try these keys and let 's get the jewelry off of us . ( Tries keys . ) Ah , here 's one ! Hurroo ! Erin go bragh ! It 's opened ! CARL . " De Wacht am Rhine ! Kattufel salad and bumpernickel ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into room , R. ) PHELIM . Now then for liberty , and legs do your duty . ( Just as they are about to exit , L. , BRIDGET 'S voice is heard off L. ) BRIDGET . Will I ever find the right way out of here at all ? PHELIM . Murder in Irish , I 'm in the soup ! ( They start back toward partition as BRIDGET enters , L. She recognizes PHELIM and utters a cry of surprise . ) BRIDGET . So I 've got you at last , have I ? What have you got to say for yourself ? PHELIM. ( to CARL ) Get me out of this , and I 'll never forget you . CARL . ( aside to PHELIM ) Pretend that you 're crazy ; act natural . ( Crosses over to BRIDGET ) My dear woman , do n't you see what 's the matter ? BRIDGET . I see that I 've got him , and he 'll not get away from me , either . CARL . Look at his eyes ; look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie . Look at that mouth ; it ai n't got any express complexion about it . Do n't you see what 's the matter ? De man is a lunaticle . He 's crazy . ( To PHELIM ) Act like you was in de bug house  --  crazy , foolish . BRIDGET . Phelim McNab crazy , is he ? CARL . He 's got rats in his garret . Look at him . He 's got soap suds coming out of his mouth . ( PHELIM begins a few violent contortions ; twists his legs , grimaces and finally utters a yell . BRIDGET in alarm releases him and dodges behind CARL for protection . ) CARL . Look him in the eye ! Do n't take your eyes off of him ! He 'll kill the whole two both of us . PHELIM . You are my grandfather and you are my grandmother ! I am a bicycle ! BRIDGET . He takes me for a velocipede and you for a wheelbarrow ! PHELIM . I 'm a scorcher ! Phew ! See me going up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is my lamp lit ? CARL . He 's turned into a lamp-post ! Poor fellow ! He do n't know what I 'm doing or what he did ! He 's crazy as a bedbug . PHELIM . Hurrah ! I 've found a knife ! ( Feels in pocket . ) I 'll kill you both and make you into rubber tires for my wheels ! Your fat will make oil for my lamp and your bones will be spokes for my wheels ! I 'll paint the bike red with your blood ! CARL . I 'll be darned if you do ! You do n't grease your bike with my oleomargarine ! BRIDGET . Hold him ! Hold him ! CARL . Hold him yourself . I do n't want him to bite me . BRIDGET . Do n't let him come near me ! Are you a man ? CARL . Yes , but I 'm not working at it . Do you take me for a fool to try to hold dot wild crazy Irishman ? No , sir ! I 'm no loonitical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you  --  the woman in particular . I 'll have her life or I 'll kill her ! BRIDGET . Bad luck to you , you 'll not murder me if I know it ! ( Short and wild chase ensues , and PHELIM , yelling like an Indian , chases them both off L. 2 E. ) PHELIM . That 's the way to get rid of her ! The Dutchman 's advice was good . She 'll not bother me any more . ( Laughs . ) The crazy business is a great thing . CARL . Well , Irish , I done it up in style for you , did n't I. Shake . ( They shake hands . ) Was n't it a lucky thing I thought to make you crazy ? PHELIM . I have n't enjoyed myself so well since I had the " newmonia ! " ( While they are thus laughing and complimenting each other BRIDGET enters at back from L. and comes down between them . They are laughing and hitting each other on the back . Suddenly CARL looks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PHELIM then sees her , and begins a wild series of contortions to impress her with his " crazy antics . " BRIDGET . You ca n't work that on me . I 'm on to your tricks . You 're crazy , are you ? And this Dutchman wants to make a fool of me , does he ? I 'll bring you to your senses , so I will . ( Beats CARL with umbrella . He runs off L. 2 E. PHELIM tries to dodge her , but she seizes him by the coat . He slips out of his coat and escapes L. 2 E. ) You 'll not get away from me again . ( Sees coat . ) Well ! He 's skinned out of his coat like an eel . Stop him ! Stop the crazy man ! ( Chases off after PHELIM , waving the coat . ) ( LOPEZ enters L. ) LOPEZ . There 's that wild Irishwoman again . She seems to be everywhere we go . ( Goes over to partition . ) Hello ! The door is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's a nice fix . If the Captain finds it out I 'll be shot instead of them . ( Finds keys . ) I 'll just lock the door and keep mum about it . Oh , these Americans ! these Americans ! Now you 've got ' em and now you have n't got ' em ! ( Enter VALDEZ , L. JASPER and men follow in , having RICHARD bound and a prisoner . ) VALDEZ . For the short time you have to remain on earth this will be your place of safe keeping , and I assure you that the Cuban spy will not lend a helping hand to your escape . Make your peace with heaven , for your time is short . RICHARD . Fool that I was not to see through your disguise and clumsy plot to entrap me . VALDEZ . You will admit that you Americans are not as smart as you give yourselves credit to be . RICHARD . In treachery and low cunning you excel any other race of people . Is it manly to drug a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this the boasted courage of Weyler 's representative ? VALDEZ . Fume and fret as much as you like . I laid the trap for you and you stepped into it . Your friend the Cuban spy has brought you to a nice pass . RICHARD . You pretended to be a friend of the patriots while in the States . You are doubly a scoundrel for such pretensions . You persecute a woman and you are a cur and a coward for doing so . VALDEZ . That woman is in my way and I have ample reasons for her removal . As to the patriots , misguided wretches , one and all , they 'll either hang or be shot down soon as captured . RICHARD . That is your mode of warfare , is it ? Guerrillas , robbers , cut-throats ! VALDEZ . We conduct our warfare to suit ourselves , and we will not ask the American government for its advice on that matter . If you are a citizen of that boastful nation , what are you doing over here ? RICHARD . Aiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joining the struggling men who are seeking to free themselves from the hated rule of Spain and such wretches as yourself and the craven Weyler ! VALDEZ . Put a bridle upon your tongue ! RICHARD . I have not yet been taken with arms in my possession , nor in an act of hostility . I have a right as a man to express my opinion , and I shall continue to do so . VALDEZ . You have been captured , you 'll admit . RICHARD . By treachery , as the brave Maceo was taken and murdered . But there is a day of retribution for such as you and your master in Havana ! VALDEZ . Think of your own fate . Your life hangs by a single thread . Lopez , did you remove the prisoners in that room to place this one in it ? LOPEZ. ( hesitates ) No  --  yes  --  I mean  --  the room is empty , as you ordered ! VALDEZ . Conduct the American into it . See that the ropes are tight and secure . When next you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RICHARD . I defy you ! VALDEZ . Will you tell me where to find that girl  --  the spy ? RICHARD . No ; I would rather die than speak a single word that would place her in the power of such a villain as you are . ( Exit RICHARD . ) ( Music . ELINORA attired as a Sister of Charity or " Red Cross " Society . ) ELINORA . I came to offer consolation to those condemned and about to die . VALDEZ . They do not need it , nor would they accept it , I am sure . ELINORA . All men need consolation in their last hours . No matter how wicked , there is still a desire to repent on the part of all who have led evil lives when death is at hand . VALDEZ . These Americans seem to care for nothing ! While I do not wish to prevent you in your work of mercy , you will find it fruitless and barren of good results . ELINORA . I am sure of good results , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VALDEZ . But he is a heartless villain ! ELINORA . Let him who is without sin cast the first stone ! Would you see him die unprepared ? VALDEZ . It matters not to me . I obey my military rules and my commanding officer . ELINORA . Has General Weyler condemned this American so soon to death ? VALDEZ . I am commanding this detachment of Spanish volunteers . This man is a spy , and he has been captured with important documents in his possession . ELINORA . Are you speaking the truth ? VALDEZ . I am ! But visit the prisoner if you will . His time is short , therefore you have but a few moments to ease his conscience . ELINORA . A few moments will be sufficient ! VALDEZ . Lopez , admit her to the room ! ( LOPEZ opens door  --  ELINORA slowly enters . ) Lopez  --  hearken to every word uttered ! ( LOPEZ listens at half-open door ) . ELINORA ( to RICHARD ) . I came to offer words of consolation ! You are soon to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( RICHARD looks up , and recognizes her . ) RICHARD . Elinora ! ELINORA . Richard ! You here ! ( Makes a warning motion to lip , and speaks low ) ' Sh ! We are observed , and every word listened to ! ( louder ) Think of your fate , and be prepared to meet it . RICHARD . I am ! I came to Cuba to aid in a glorious cause . I am in the hands of the merciless guerillas , but I will die an American , breathing defiance to the end , and shouting " Cuba Libre ! " ELINORA . We should forgive our enemies . Here ! ( lower ) I place this pistol within your breast . Make good use of it should needs be . ( As she speaks , she places a revolver within his vest ) Do not despair ! I will never desert you ! ( rises ) Farewell ! Meet your fate as becomes a brave man , and trust to One above who hearkens to those in affliction  --  He who rewards the innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  LOPEZ locks the door . ) The prisoner is prepared . I have succeeded in obtaining good results . VALDEZ . I am pleased to think you have succeeded ! ELINORA . Considering the surroundings , better than I expected . VALDEZ . I may require your kind services soon . I need consolation at times . ELINORA . When that time arrives , rest assured I will be present , I hope . ( Exits , L. ) VALDEZ. ( to LOPEZ ) Follow her , see where she goes , and report everything to me . I half distrust her . And Lopez , let me warn you about drinking  --  keep your head clear . There is important work ahead for us . LOPEZ . I 'm not drinking , sir ! VALDEZ . I warn you to remain sober . Follow that person , and be quick about it . ( LOPEZ exits , L. He has been showing signs of liquor since he entered ) Jasper , I think we had best avoid further delay . JASPER . In which way ? VALDEZ . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dispose of him the better . His government will never make inquiries after him , and furthermore , he is here in arms against us . JASPER . He has not been captured in open warfare nor has he as yet committed any act against our government . VBLDEZ . Very true . But what does that matter ? We have Americans and Cubans in jail for doing much less , and who is to prevent us from putting them out of the way if we condemn them ? JASPER . That 's very true . This American has interfered in your personal matters and you now have the power to remove him . VALDEZ . Yes , and I 'll do it . Jasper , you do n't know the danger surrounding me while that Cuban spy lives . So far she has not identified me , and I do not propose to give her the opportunity . Do you see this ? ( Shows mark in palm of hand . ) JASPER . A brand ! A brand that could be recognized anywhere . VALDEZ . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious good care that she wo n't . ( Enter LOPEZ , L. ) Well , what did you discover ? LOPEZ . Nothing . She went into the other building and then I lost track of her altogether . VALDEZ . You addle-headed fool ! I told you to follow close upon her track . You 've been drinking again . LOPEZ . ' Pon my word , Captain , I 'm sober as a judge . VALDEZ . Watch the building and bring me all the information possible . Go . ( LOPEZ exits , L. , partially staggering . ) It wo n't do to trust that fellow with any important mission . He 's growing worse and worse . Now about this American . I have decided to rid myself of him at once . JASPER . We are here to obey ! ( Enter SOPHIE , L. ) SOPHIE . Captain , did you know that one of the prisoners has escaped . JASPER . Escaped ! Which one ? SOPHIE . ( hesitates ) The fat one  --  the German . I saw him running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I saw . I did n't see the other one , the real nice one  --  indeed I did n't I did n't see him at all . ( Begins to cry . ) I do n't know where he is . I did n't see him . VALDEZ . No one has accused you of complicity . You saw one of them running away , did you ? Which way did he go  --  over the right ? SOPHIE . No ; over the left . VALDEZ . Give the alarm at once . He may be recaptured . ( JASPER exits with men , L. ) SOPHIE . I 'm so glad they wo n't catch the Irishman ! Oh , but he 's cunning , and he knows just how to kiss a girl ! ( Exits , L. ) ( Enter JASPER and guerillas , having ELINORA in charge . They bring her C. She is attired as " rebel " Cuban boy . ) JASPER . Captain , you are in rare luck . Look . Do you recognize this person ? We found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The Cuban spy ! ELINORA . Yes , the Cuban spy ! But it took a dozen of your " brave " men to bring Little Cuba to their brave commander . VALDEZ . So you are masquerading in the costume of the Cuban rebels . ELINORA . Not Cuban rebels  --  Cuban patriots ; men striving to gain independence for their country . I am not masquerading , as you are ; I am just what you see me . I am not a hypocrite , pretending to aid a cause and willfully betraying my fellow-men to the merciless Spaniard . RICHARD . Elinora is in their hands ! Why did she venture here again ? VALDEZ . You possess valuable information concerning the insurgents . What is their strength ? Where are they at present ? Give me a list of their leaders and you are free to go . ELINORA . Not if you were to doom me to a death of tortures . I am a Cuban , and I never betray my companions . VALDEZ . But it means life to you . ELINORA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill me if you will , but you can not force me to speak . VALDEZ. ( crosses to C. ) Were you not a woman I would strike you to my feet . ELINORA . And if you were a man you would n't threaten a woman . VALDEZ . Do n't tempt me too far or I 'll forget that you are a woman . ELINORA . That would be nothing new to you . You sought my life on the blockade runner and encouraged your ruffianly crew to destroy me . VALDEZ . Silence , or ( produces pistol ) I 'll end your career . ELINORA . I see that , and I go you one better . ( Levels revolvers at VALDEZ . ) Brave men ! ( Laughs . ) You shrink from a woman . The first one who makes a movement toward his belt dies upon the spot . Place that weapon upon the floor ! ( VALDEZ does so . ) And you ( to JASPER ) follow suit . ( She compels them to place weapons upon the floor . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attired as counterpart of LOPEZ , staggers in L. He makes his way toward ELINORA , and behind her as she is commanding the guerillas to lay down their arms . Soon as VALDEZ sees LOPEZ he becomes reassured . ) VALDEZ . Seize her , Lopez , quick ! Disarm her ! PHELIM . I 'm not Lopez , but Phelim McNab , at your service . ( Throws off hat and shows features . ) I 'm with the Cuban spy . ( Levels pistol at them . ) VALDEZ . Tricked again ! and by these Americans ! PHELIM . Make way there , you yaller-faced gorrillas . Pick up the artillery , Elinora ! ( She picks up weapons . ) Now , then , retreat in good order , with your face to the foe ! ELINORA . And if harm comes to the American prisoner we 'll burn down this building and every Spaniard in it . Phelim ! away for our friends while I hold these brave men at bay ! PHELIM . Do n't take your eyes off of them . Pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million of consumptive monkeys like this . Oh , but you 're a pudding for us . ( Exits L. ) ELINORA . I will be at this door ; make but a single hostile movement and I 'll fire . The Cuban band of patriots are close at hand . Harm Richard Carson at your peril ! the Cuban spy is still your master ! ( She exits L. , covering VALDEZ and his followers with her revolvers as she exits backing off ; then she closes the door , L. ) VALDEZ . Why do you all stand petrified ! Are you all afraid of a woman ? JASPER . Captain , you did n't appear to be any too anxious to face those revolvers yourself . The girl is desperate and she meant business . VALDEZ . She has taken our arms and she says the rebels are close by . JASPER . Our arms are not all gone ! ( LITTLE CUBA is seen at grated window in RICHARD 'S room . ) VALDEZ . Not all gone ? Where have you enough to arm your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are rifles loaded and ready for use . VALDEZ . Loaded and ready for use ? JASPER . I loaded them myself . ( By this time ELINORA has entered RICHARD 'S room . She motions him to be quiet , and searching in a corner sees the rifles stacked behind some bags and boxes L. U. corner . ) VALDEZ . Then I will put them into immediate use . JASPER . To repel the attack ? VALDEZ . No  --  to shoot that American dog . That will be one less standing in my way . ( During this conversation ELINORA is seen to remove the cartridges from the rifles and cast them away . ) JASPER . Then the quicker you carry out your threat the better . ( Soon as possible ELINORA unties RICHARD 'S arms . She has barely time to do this when JASPER is at the door unlocking it . ) ELINORA. ( to RICHARD ) Fear not  --  friends are near you . ( She hides behind bags up stage ; the door is opened by JASPER . ) VALDEZ . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are passed out by JASPER to men who aim at RICHARD as they stand at open door . ) VALDEZ . The Cuban spy vowed to save you ! Let her do so now , my bold American . ( To men ) Take good aim  --  Fire ! ( Music . Guns miss fire . RICHARD instantly shows that his hands are free , and he produces a pistol from bosom . ELINORA jumps out from hiding place with brace of revolvers leveled at VALDEZ and men . ) ELINORA . Surrender , in the name of the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America . ( PHELIM and CARL , with guns , appear from L. , thus hemming in the Spaniards and placing them between two fires . PHELIM and CARL dancing with joy . ELINORA and RICHARD in room , R. , keeping ruffians in C. ) CURTAIN ACT IV SCENE .  --  Handsome parlor . Hotel at Pinar del Rio . See scene plot . ( Music . Enter RICHARD ; evening dress . ) RICHARD . The American Minister is to call and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate the outrages . A reception is to be given in his honor , and I dare say that for the present our troubles are over . ( Enter CARL , door C. , extravagant missfit suit . ) CARL . Ah ! Mr. Carson , we 're right in it now . When they see me they 'll drop dead . I hunted all over this place for a nice suit , and I got it . RICHARD . You look very well , indeed . ( PHELIM heard outside . ) PHELIM . You need n't bother yourself ; I 'll find the parlor . This is n't the first time I 've been in a hotel , by a " darn site . " ( Enters door , C. , eccentric full dress . ) Hello , fellers ! How 's my togs ? I do n't feel at home in these dude fixings . It 's like being in a straight jacket . What 's going on here to-night ? ( Sees CARL ) Ah ! get on to the bag of oats ! Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't look like a whiskey barrel , anyway . PHELIM . Indeed you do n't , for if you did I 'd tap you in a minute . But tell us , Mr. Carson , where 's the General ? RICHARD . The General ? PHELIM . Yes , the General ! Elinora , the Cuban spy . The one that got us out of all the scrapes ! RICHARD . She 'll be here in a moment . PHELIM . I hope she 's not flirting with any of those Spanish galoots . RICHARD . At present the Spaniards are far from this town . This place is in the hands of a few patriot Cubans . After defeating Valdez and placing him in the hands of the Cubans , we came here to take part in the American minister 's investigations . He is expected here shortly . PHELIM . I do n't care for him ! I want to see " our " General . I 've gone to a lot of trouble to get fixed up to dazzle her , and I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here she is . ( Music . ELINORA enters in evening costume , door , C. Comedians have business of extravagant bowing R. and L. , kicking up their heels . ) PHELIM . My , oh , my ! But ai n't she pretty as a humming-bird ! CARL . She 's beautiful as my picture ! PHELIM . Shut up ! What do you know about beauty , anyway ? ELINORA . Gentlemen , I am pleased to see you , but wish to say this : Do not fancy that we rest here in security , for scouts have been coming in and going out of the city all the afternoon . It may be that Weyler 's men have approached the city . PHELIM . That 's all right I can fight in these togs just as well as I can in my working clothes . CARL . Yes : I do n't care if I get shot all dressed up ! RICHARD . With your permission I will go at once and investigate . Come , Carl  --  I may need you ! Elinora ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ) CARL . You will kindly excuse myself ! ( Bows and exits . ) PHELIM . The dude clothes will drive that Dutchman crazy ! ( sits in chair ) My , but I ca n't keep my eyes off of you  --  you look so pretty ! ( Enter VALDEZ , R. 1 E. He pauses as he recognizes ELINORA . ) VALDEZ . So  --  we meet again , but the meeting is not quite unexpected ! ELINORA . Why are you here ? VALDEZ . To appear before the American minister and refute the fabrications that will be told him . ELINORA . You are very bold to venture here . Are you aware that I can deliver you into the hands of General Maximo Gomez ? VALDEZ . Indeed ! And if you do so you will be kind enough to say that you found me in the regular service of the Spanish government . ELINORA . I will do nothing of the kind . You made war upon the poor Cubans as pirates upon the high seas . You lack the manhood to enlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robber , a villain , and to fight as savages . You must take the consequences . VALDEZ . But who can prove that I was not an enlisted man ? ELINORA . I can ! I know you , Roderigo Valdez . I know you thoroughly . When Richard Carson was in your power you made ready to shoot him down like a dog . When you discovered me upon the blockade runner you sought my life . You have never spared any one who fell into your hands . You are a traitor to the cause of Cuba . You have betrayed every leader of our struggling army . You showed no mercy . So expect none in return . PHELIM . Hurrah ! That 's the kind of talk . When St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland some of them got over here , and I 'll bet that his great grandfather was an anaconda or a sea serpent , or the daddy of all the snakes . VALDEZ . Very well . I am forearmed . ELINORA . Phelim , mount the horse which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to General Gomez . ( Gives paper to PHELIM . CARL appears at door . ) PHELIM . But I never rode a horse in all my life . Let the Dutchman go . CARL . Oh , no ! You do n't catch me on the back of a horse . PHELIM . All right . I 'll chance it . Keep your eye on that villain , CARL . Good-bye Helen Matanzas . Your molasses obeys you . ( Exits C. D. ) CARL . Is that Irishman going to ride a horse ? Good-bye , Irishman . ( Stands at window and speaks . ) There he goes . He 's climbing on the horse 's back . Now he 's trying to hold on . Now the horse is trying to stand on his head . Now the horse is dancing a jig  --  and  --  and now they 're off . ( Horse imitation of clattering hoofs and they die away . ) VALDEZ. ( aside ) She has sent a message to Gomez . If it reaches him and I am taken , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aloud ) I leave you to your excellent friend . I assure you that we will meet again shortly . ( Exits R. 1 E. , bowing coldly . ) CARL . Go to the donner und blitzen ! ELINORA . Carl , follow that man ! See where he goes and whom he meets . Do n't lose track of him . CARL . I 'll stick to him like a porous plister . ( Exits R. 1 E. ) ELINORA . I must warn Richard at once . Valdez is here for mischief . ( Exits L. 1 E. Enter BRIDGET , C. D. ) BRIDGET . Well , it seems that the more I learn the less I know . And the further I walk the more I travel . I 've been on the track of Phelim McNab and caught him , and when I 'd catch him I would n't have him . I never saw such a lot of contradictions in all my life , and here I am trying to catch a runaway lover that as soon as I catch him I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm disgusted with everything and everybody ! ( Enter RICHARD , D. C. ) RICHARD . I must confess that I am in the toils of Cupid at last . Elinora has been far more dangerous than the bullets of the Spaniards , for her eyes have reached my heart and made me a willing prisoner . ( BRIDGET comes down behind him and suddenly throws her arms around him . ) BRIDGET . Oh , Captain dear ! You 're just the very one to aid a poor , distressed woman whose heart is breaking , and all on account of love ! RICHARD . Yes . my good woman , I 'm willing to aid you , but not quite so willing to accept this demonstration of affection . ( Attempts to release himself . ) BRIDGET . Any port in a storm ! My heart needs consolation , and I ca n't bear to be alone in my grief . ( ELINORA enters , L. ) ELINORA . Ah , ha ! My fickle Captain , I have caught you , have I ? Keep right on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop to your love-making . ( Aside ) I 'd like to scratch her eyes out . RICHARD . But I assure you that I am not in the act of love-making . Please do n't go . ( To BRIDGET ) Remove your arms . What do you mean ? BRIDGET . I want somebody to protect me , and you 're just the one ! ( RICHARD removes her arms . ) ELINORA . I did not know that you could find time for love-making while surrounded by our enemies . But pray , do n't stop on my account . I would n't for the world interfere between sweethearts ! It was so mean of me to come in so abruptly  --  but I could n't help it . RICHARD . Why will you misunderstand everything and tantalize me in this manner ? ELINORA . You seem to enjoy the misunderstanding very much , and I 'm sure it is not very tantalizing to have a lady 's arms about your neck . is it ? ( Laughs . ) Ah ! Americans art such peculiar people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband , and I wo n't go back without one . ELINORA . The Captain will make a most lovable one . I 'm sure . But go on  --  arrange for the wedding  --  and the honeymoon . I wish you joy , Mr. Carson ! RICHARD . Enough of this nonsense ! ( To BRIDGET ) Go and seek your promised husband and do not annoy me again . ( Crosses , R. ) BRIDGET . Oh , very well ! There 's just as good fish in the sea as ever was caught  --  but I 'm not going to spend all my days a fishing ! Farewell to you . I 'll find my Phelim McNab without the help of either one of you ! You 're jealous of my good looks ; and the next time I look for consolation I 'll not come to you . If you see Mr. McNab , " Just tell him that you saw me . " ( Exits C. D. ) ELINORA . By the way , do you know that danger threatens . RICHARD . Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to alarm us . ELINORA . This is no time for surmises . I have sent a message to General Gomez for help ; meanwhile the prisoners must be looked after . Valdez is a most dangerous man , either as a captive or at liberty . RICHARD . Not half as dangerous as you are . ELINORA . Or Bridget Monahan ! I dare say you are lonesome , now that she is gone and your love-making is at an end . ( Crosses to sofa , R. ) RICHARD . Please be serious for a moment . We are in danger until we reach the patriot camp . I ask the privilege of remaining with you to protect you  --  if need be , to die for you . ELINORA . Extends , then , your devotion so far ? RICHARD . It is a man 's duty to protect a woman  --  at all places  --  under all circumstances . ELINORA . Is there no other reason ? RICHARD . Do you wish me to be perfectly frank with you ? ELINORA . Does not the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it will be a pleasure to defend you  --  for , Elinora , I love you . ( Crosses to L. ) ELINORA . You love me ? You know nothing concerning me . You know me only as Elinora  --  one who pursues a villain to avenge a father 's murder . You know me as the Cuban spy  --  a waif  --  a spy in the cause of Cuba to further my plans and to aid my country . Yet you tell me that you love me ? RICHARD . I do . You are dearer to me than life . ( Puts arm about her . ) ELINORA . When retribution has overtaken my father 's destroyer . I will say . Richard Carson , I love you ! ( Enter BRIDGET at back , L. ) BRIDGET . Ah , ha ! What do I see ? Oh , do n't stop on my account . I would n't for the world interfere between sweethearts . It was mean of me to bounce in here so disreputably , but I could n't help it . Arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar people . ( RICHARD and ELINORA exit , L. , laughing . ) Everybody is going daffy around here . There 's another poor man gone ! Oh , my ! oh , my ! what poor luck I have with the men . I wish I could find a rabbit 's foot for luck ! ( Exits , L. ) ( Enter PHELIM at back . ) PHELIM . I succeeded all right . I met one of the General 's men coming towards this stockade , and I gave him the message , and I walked back . I would n't ride on that horse 's back for a fortune . I 'm not a circus rider , by any means . ( Enter SOPHIE . R. 1 E. ) SOPHIE . Ah , there you are ! ( Runs to him . ) I 've been looking for you everywhere since you left the old sugarhouse . ( Puts arm around him . ) I was so lonesome that I had to start out to find you . You do n't seem glad to see me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm as glad as if I 'd lost a leg . SOPHIE . And I came so far to see you ! PHELIM . Of course you have , and I was just going to start on a trip to see you . ( Enter BRIDGET at back , L. Stands horrified at seeing them ) And I was about to say  --  ( Discovers BRIDGET ) Oh ! Holy Moses and blue blazes ! SOPHIE . Where ? PHELIM . ( L. C. , points toward BRIDGET . SOPHIE screams and faints in his arms . BRIDGET comes down C. ) BRIDGET . Who 's that woman you 're holding in your arms ? PHELIM . Which arms ? Which woman ? BRIDGET . That woman there ! PHELIM. ( points to SOPHIE ) Oh , this ! You mean this woman here ? Well , well  --  this woman here ? BRIDGET . Yes . I mean that woman there . How came she there ? PHELIM . Yes ; how came she there ! This woman came here , and that 's how she got there  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who is she ? I 've asked you ! PHELIM . Who is she ? Oh ! you want to know who she is . Oh ! she 's a she  --  ca n't you see she 's a woman ? BRIDGET I ask you for the last time , Who is that woman in your arms ? PHELIM. ( aside to SOPHIE ) It 's a crazy woman  --  we 'll have to humor her . ( Aloud ) This woman , madam , is  --  is  --  my sister Sadie . SOPHIE . Not Sadie  --  Sophie . PHELIM . Yes  --  Sophie  --  Sadie ! BRIDGET . Your sister ! You never told me you had a sister . PHELIM . Well , I did n't know it myself . You see I was away from home when it happened ! BRIDGET . So this is your sister ? PHELIM . Yes  --  my own dear sister Stella ! BRIDGET . Stella ! You said her name was Sophie Sadie ! PHELIM . So it is  --  Sophie Sadie Stella . She can have as many names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BRIDGET . Well , how old is your sister ? PHELIM . She 's older than me  --  I mean I 'm younger than she is , of course . You see I 'm twenty-four , and Sarah is twenty-one . BRIDGET . Sarah ! I thought you said her name was Sophie Sadie Stella ? PHELIM . So it is  --  Sophie Sadie Stella Sarah ! Oh , she 's got names to burn ! She 's got lots of names  --  and that 's all she 's got . Now , you see , when Susan was born  --  BRIDGET . Susan ! Susan ! Is her name Susan now ? PHELIM . No  --  not Susan Now  --  Susan McNab  --  Sophie Sadie Stella Sarah Susan  --  now do you see ? BRIDGET . Yes , I see . PHELIM . Well , that 's more than I do ! SOPHIE . Who is this woman ! PHELIM. ( aside to SOPHIE ) Hush ! A crazy woman ! She has an idea that I 'm in love with her . We 'll keep it up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whispering here to Salantha ! BRIDGET . Salantha ! You just said her name was a whole lot of names and Susan ! PHELIM . Of course I did  --  but we call her Salantha for short . Salantha is the Irish for Susan , BRIDGET . Where was Salantha born ? PHELIM . At home , of course ! BRIDGET . I mean where , and when ? PHELIM . Ask her yourself  --  she was present at the time I was n't . BRIDGET . Was she born in Ireland , or was n't she ? PHELIM . I think she was born away from Ireland  --  I 'm not sure . You see I was over in America at the time , and I got a telegraph , saying  --  " you 've got a sister , and it 's a female ! " BRIDGET . I think you 're telling me a lie , and I 'll find out for myself . Stand out of my way , and I 'll investigate this ! PHELIM . Go ahead ! Investigations never amount to anything . BRIDGET . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll break every bone in your body . ( BRIDGET goes over to SOPHIE in a very threatening manner . ) PHELIM . Now , ladies , do n't fight over me as if I was a bone or a mouse . BRIDGET . I want to know by what right you allow this man to put his arms around you . He 's not your brother , and you 're not his sister . SOPHIE . And by what right do you question me about this handsome man ? BRIDGET . Because he promised to marry me . SOPHIE . He promised the same thing to me . BRIDGET . Oh , the bigamist  --  the trigamist ! I 'll settle it right here . PHELIM . Settle it among yourselves . I 've got a divorce from you both . ( He rushes up stage and escapes C. D. Both women chasing after him and shouting , " Stop him ! " " Head him off ! " " Stop him ! " " Stop our husband ! " etc. , and amid much bustle exit after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHELIM and get him first . ) ( CARL enters , R. 1 E. ) CARL . I guess that feller wo n't make us any trouble . He is sitting on the piazza smoking a cigaroot . I 've got somebody watching him , all right . ( Enter ELINORA , R. ) ELINORA . ( L. C. ) Is that you , Carl ? CARL . Oh , she calls me Carl . Lie still , my pilpertating heart , lie still . ( Aloud ) Yes , it is your own Carl  --  your Carlo . Oh , Helen Matanzas , molasses taffy , now is my chance to declaration my love to you . Have pity on a love-sick Dutchman . This is my first offense . I 'm green in the business . Do n't fall in love with that Irishman . The Irish want everything they see in this world . ELINORA . Arise ! I promise you that I will not entertain the Irishman 's proposals of marriage . ( Crosses to L. ) CARL . Well , if I 'm going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one little kiss . ELINORA . Blindfold yourself , Carl ; that 's the only way I 'll consent . CARL . All right ; make me blindfolded . ( She blindfolds CARL with kerchief . ) ELINORA . Now then , Carl , earn your kiss . ( She eludes him and exits laughing , L. 1 E. As he is groping about BRIDGET enters L. U. E. She is seized by CARL . ) CARL . Now I 've got you , molasses , and I want a dozen kisses . ( Begins to kiss her ; tears off kerchief , sees his mistake , utters a yell of surprise and dashes off , C. D. , pursued by BRIDGET , shouting . " Give me the dozen . " ) ( Enter PHELIM , L. 1 E. ) PHELIM . It 's worth a man 's life to be around loose in this part of the country . The women are crazy , I believe . If I had my way they 'd all be put behind locks and bars to keep them quiet . I imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net to catch me . Bridget 's the most persistent woman I ever saw . ( Enter CARL , running , C. D. , and bumps into PHELIM . ) CARL . Oh , it 's you , is it ? I thought it was that Irish-woman ! She 's here again . PHELIM . I know she 's here . I 've just slid out of her hands like an eel . CARL . By jiminy , so did I ! But here she comes on the double quick . PHELIM . So she is . What 's to be done ? Get me out of this scrape and I 'll never forget you . CARL . Lay down quick and pretend that you 're dead . PHELIM . First you have me crazy , now you want me dead . CARL . If you do n't die now she 'll catch you , and you 'll be dead for a long time . Quick ! Die  --  die ! ( PHELIM lies down , R. C. Puts chalk upon face . ) PHELIM .

He 's shooted ! There 's an Irish angel in heaven . ( She kneels beside PHELIM . ) BRIDGET . My poor , darling , dead Phelim ! How natural he looks ! Did you see him die ? What were his last words ? CARL . He said , If you ever see Bridget tell her I 'll meet her in another world . PHELIM . What a Dutch liar ! BRIDGET . ( cries ) I knew he would n't forget me ! Oh , Carl , my poor heart is breaking ! I 'm a widow before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me , and now he 's dead and will never move again ! ( As she is crying to CARL , CARL puts his arms around her to soothe her . PHELIM looks up . ) CARL . Oh , I would n't cry about him . He ai n't worth it . He ai n't the only ace in de pack . It 's a good thing he 's dead . PHELIM. ( aside ) You Dutch villain , I 'll murder you . ( CARL slyly kicks PHELIM . ) CARL . ( aside ) Shut up ! You 're dead ! Stay dead . ( To BRIDGET . ) Lay your head on the bosom of a handsomer man . Ah ! Bridget ! Let me console you . You are just the kind of a woman that would suit me . ( Embraces her and kicks PHELIM who is sitting up and threatening CARL with motions , etc . BRIDGET turns as she speaks and discovers PHELIM in a different position . She screams with astonishment . ) BRIDGET . Look there ! Look there ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an awful liar . He 'd lie all the time . You see , crazy people get all twisted up when they die , and the first thing you know he 'll be all tied up in a knot . Let him lay there , and de crows will eat him up . BRIDGET . No ! I 'll have him buried . I 'll run and get a grave-digger and at the same time make arrangements for our marriage . ( PHELIM changes again . ) See ! It 's turned around again ! CARL . The Irish die hard . They 've got nine lives like a cat . But he 's dead for the last time . Oh ! my darling ! Kiss your little chickabiddy on de lip . Oh ! my dear wife that is to be . ( Business of kissing her , and PHELIM yells " Break away " and lies flat . BRIDGET turns and notes position . ) BRIDGET . Now , then , wait for me here , and we 'll have him buried and you 'll be my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starts to go R. 1 E. CARL calls to her . ) CARL . One more sweet kiss ! ( BRIDGET runs to his arms , hugs him and starts off R. , and then turns and comes to him again . This is done to enable PHELIM to partially rise and throw himself flat again as BRIDGET returns . This is done several times and BRIDGET runs out R. 1 E. , CARL bidding her to " hurry , " etc . Soon as she is out PHELIM jumps to his feet in great anger . ) PHELIM . So I 'm dead , am I ! I 'll feed the worms , will I ! ( Produces revolver . ) CARL . Go get buried ! You do n't cut any ice-cream around here any more . PHELIM . I 'll show you whether I do or not . There 'll be a Dutch angel climbing up to the clouds . ( Fires at CARL , who yells and hops as if shot in the foot . Short and funny chase around stage . CARL runs off L. U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She screams . ) BRIDGET . His ghost ! his ghost ! ( And scampers off , fainting and screaming , R. 1 E. PHELIM tumbles backward from sudden meeting , and he scampers off L. 1 E. ) ( Music . Several shots fired outside of the hotel . VALDEZ , JASPER , LOPEZ and guerrillas enter L , with ELINORA and RICHARD , prisoners , door , C. ) VALDEZ . A very clever ruse , and it succeeded admirably . We have captured the town . Your late prisoners are now your masters . The American dies first . ELINORA . No  --  no  --  spare his life . ' T was I who am to blame for his participation in these matters . Let me be the one to suffer . Release him and take my life . See , I kneel to you ! ( Kneels . ) RICHARD . Arise ! Kneel to no one , save Heaven . Kneel not to a craven cowardly dog for a million lives . ELINORA . Harken not to him , Roderigo Valdez , but listen to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meddling American ! ELINORA . I do ; I do love him ! VALDEZ . Enough ! No power on earth could save him now . The message you sent to General Gomez will fail of its mission , as I have a band in ambush to receive the patriots when they come this way ! ELINORA . Will nothing tempt you to release this man ? VALDEZ . No . There is a deeper reason than his interference why I should destroy him . Lopez , take a squad of men with you to the court-yard and convey the American to a spot where I see you from the window . At my signal , shoot to kill ! RICHARD . Cowardly dog ! This murder will be avenged tenfold . Farewell , Elinora . ( Crosses to her . ) Remember your mission is to avenge your father and the one who loved you so devotedly . ELINORA . No , no ! They must not take you from me . Richard , my own , I can not bear to lose you now ! ( Clings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOPEZ and a soldier take RICHARD from her , while one takes her , R. ) RICHARD . Elinora ! Remember ! Avenge me if you can . ( He is taken off , C. D. , by LOPEZ and soldiers . ) ELINORA. ( aside , R. C. ) If I can but gain time the relief party may arrive . VALDEZ . Once before I gave you a chance which you spurned . I know your motives and see through your disguise and purpose . ELINORA . I seek the false friend who murdered my father and robbed me of my inheritance . VALDEZ . You will never find him ! Yet I may say this to you : Here is a package of documents relating to that estate , and I hold them out to you as a tempting bait . ( Holds out papers . ) What would you give to possess them ? ELINORA . This is my answer . ( Seizes the papers . ) VALDEZ . Give me those documents ! ELINORA . When I am dead you can take them from the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will die defending them to the last . VALDEZ . This is quite theatrical , I must say . Your lover is beyond with guns leveled at his breast , my men awaiting the signal to fire . Quite dramatic , is it not ? And you  --  well , you know the fate of a spy . The papers you hold may give you a momentary pleasure , but you are doomed . One chance yet remains . Become mine , and ! spare the American ! Quick  --  choose . ELINORA . I prefer death . And I am sure that Richard Carson would rather die than see me wedded to a coward , a villain , a murderer such as you are ! VALDEZ . These words to me ! It is your last threat ! ( As he speaks he advances toward her , holding up his hand . She seizes his hand , screams as she beholds the mark in the palm of his hand . ) ELINORA . There is the brand I have sought ! The mark of the murderer which I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valdez  --  you are the assassin ! VALDEZ . Curses on the mark ! I wished to hide it forever from your gaze . ELINORA . ' T was you , false wretch , who destroyed my father , and cast me upon the world  --  penniless , friendless and homeless  --  while you enjoyed my inheritance ! Villain ! Traitor ! We are face to face at last ! VALDEZ . You have spoken your death-sentence , and Richard Carson 's as well . You have discovered my secret , but you will not live to tell it . Blindfold her ! ( A man steps forward to blindfold her . ) ELINORA . Stop ! I refuse to be blindfolded . I wish to gaze with my dying glances upon brave Spaniards who can shoot a helpless woman ! VALDEZ . Do not listen to her idle talk  --  do as I command ! Blindfold her , and shoot the spy ! ELINORA . Stay ! You and your murderous associates may fire upon me , but I reserve the right to die under the colors I have loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying moments . ( She places a Cuban flag which she produces from her bosom upon her shoulders ) This flag has been consecrated by the blood of Cuban patriots ! Fire upon it , and add another stain to the credit of Spain ! Here is another emblem ( takes out American flag , places it over heart ) Fire upon this if you dare ! VALDEZ . Am I to be baffled by a weak girl and her senseless talk ? Up with your guns and fire upon her . Why do you hesitate ? JASPER . Captain , I for one will not shoot down a woman in cold blood ! I may be a villain , but I draw the line at that , and I absolutely refuse to obey any such order ! VALDEZ . Am I awake or dreaming ? Jasper refusing to remove a human being for our own safety ? What does it mean ? JASPER . It means that no matter how vile or utterly lost a man may be , there is some good in him yet remaining . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that insulted or threatened her life . As I wish my sister to be treated , so will I treat this helpless girl  --  spy or no spy ! ( Bugle call heard in distance . ELINORA screams . ) ELINORA . The bugle ! General Gomez is at hand . My prayer has been answered . VALDEZ . I 'll give the signal ! ( Music . VALDEZ rushes to window as PHELIM and CARL show themselves at window and fire . VALDEZ staggers , tries to reach ELINORA to shoot her , but falls dead at her feet . PHELIM and CARL come through window and attempt to strike down JASPER , but ELINORA protects him . RICHARD and LOPEZ enter , D. C. Sword combat . LOPEZ disarmed and overpowered . Guerrillas driven on and overpowered by Cubans . One hands flag to ELINORA , which she waves in triumph . SOPHIE and BRIDGET enter L. 1 E.
