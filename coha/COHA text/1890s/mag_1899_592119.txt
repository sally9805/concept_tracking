REMINISCENCES OF JULIA WARD HOWE . V. BOSTON IN THE FIFTIES ; MOVEMENTS AND PUBLIC MEN . IN the winter of 1846-47 I one day heard Dr. Holmes speak of Agassiz , who bad then recently arrived in America . He described him as a man of great talent and reputation , who added to his mental gifts the endowment of a superb physique . Soon after this time I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of the eminent naturalist , and of hearing the first series of lectures which he gave at the Lowell Institute . The remarkable personal attraction of Agassiz , joined to his admirable power of presenting the results of scientific investigation in a popular form , made a vivid impression upon the Boston public . All his lecture courses were largely attended . These and his continued presence among us gave a new impetus to the study of natural science . In his hands the record of the bones and fossils became a living language , and the common thought was enriched by the revelation of the wonders of the visible universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great delight lay in imparting to others the discoveries in which he had found such intense pleasure . This sympathetic trait relieved his discourse of all dryness and dullness . In his college days , he had employed his hour of intermission at noon in explaining the laws of botany to a class of little children . When required to furnish a thesis , at the close of his university course , he chose for his theme the proper education of women , and insisted that it ought not to be inferior to that given to men . I need hardly relate how a most happy marriag&amp; in later life made him one of us , nor how this opened the way to the establishment in his house of a school , whose girl pupils , in addition to other valuable instruction , enjoyed daily the privilege of listening to his clear and lucid exposition of the facts and laws of his favorite science . His memory is still bright with us . His children and grandchildren are among our most valued citizens . His son , Professor Alexander Agassiz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , Mrs. Quincy Shaw , has shown her public spirit in her great services to the cause of education . An // enduring monument to his fame is the Cambridge Museum of Comparative Zo6logy , while many , myself among the number , still survive who recall with gratitude the enlargement of intellectual interest which he brought to our own and other communities . Women who wish well to their own sex should never forget that , on the occasion of his first lectures delivered in the capital of Brazil , he earnestly requested the Emperor that ladies might be allowed to be present , - a privilege till then denied them on grounds of etiquette . The request was granted , and for the first time the sacred domain of science was thrown open to the women of South America . I can not remember just when it was that an English visitor , who brought a letter of introduction to my husband , spoke to me of the Bothie of Tober-naFuosich and its author . The gentleman was a graduate of Oxford or of Cambridge . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to the classic rhythms , in which he was well versed . I had it in mind at this time to write a poem in rhythm . It was printed in my first volume . Passion Flowers ; and Mr. Sanborn , in an otherwise very friendly review of my work , characterized as " pitiable hexameters " the lines which were really not hexarneters at all , nor intended to pass for such . They were pentameters constructed according to my own ideas ; I did not have in view any special school or rule . I soon had the pleasure of reading the Bothie , which I greatly admired . While it was fresh in my mind Mr. Clough arrived in Boston , furnished with excellent letters of introduction both for that city and for Cambridge . My husband at once invited him to pass some days at our house , and I was very glad to welcome him there . In appearance , I thought him rather striking . He was tall , tending somewhat to stoutness , with a beautifully ruddy complexion and dark eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner attracted my young children to him , and I was amused , on passing near the open ( loor of his room , to see him engaged in conversation with my little son , then some five or six years of age . In Dr , Howe 's daily absences I tried at times to keep our guest company , but found him very shy . I remember that I said to him , when we had made some acquaintance , that I had often wished to meet Thackeray , and to give him two buffets , saying , " This one is for your Becky Sharp , and this one for Blanche Amory , " - regarding both as slanders upon my sex . Mr. Clough suggested that in the great world of London such characters were not out of place . The device of Blanche Aniory 's book . Mes Larmes , seemed to have afforded him much amusement . It happened that , while he was our guest , I dined one day with a German friend , who provided for us quite a wonderful repast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dessert two such sumptuous dishes were presented to us that I , having tasted of one of them , said to a friend across the table , " Anna , this is poetry ! " She was occupied with the opposite dish , and , mindful of the old pleasantry to which I alluded , replied , " Julia , this is religion . " At breakfast , the following morning , I endeavored to entertain those present with some account of the fine dinner . As I enlarged a little upon the excellence of the details , Mr. Clough said , " Mrs. Howe , you seem to have much appreciation of these matters . " I disclaimed this ; whereupon he rejoined , " Mrs. Howe , you are modest . " Some months later I met Mr. Clough at a friend 's house , where some informal charades were about to be attempted . Being requested to take part in one , I declined ; and when urged , I replied , " No , no , I am modest , - Mr. Clough once said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , and said , " It must have been at a very early period in our acquaintance . " This " give and take " was all in great good humor , and Mr. Clough was a delightful guest in all societies . Sorry indeed were we when , having become quite at home among us , he returned to England , there to marry and abide . I remember that he told me of one winter which he had passed at his university without fire in his quarters . When I heard of his illness and untimely death , it occurred to me that the seeds of the fatal disease might have been sown during that season of privation . After a seven years ' residence in and near Boston , during which I labored at study and literary composition , I enjoyed an interval of rest and recreation in Europe . With me went Dr. Howe and our two youngest children , one of them an infant in arms . We passed some weeks in London , and thence we went to renew our acquaintance with the Nightingale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightingale had been traveling in Egypt , and was still abroad . Her sister , Parthenope , read us some of her letters , which , as may be imagined , were full of interest . Florence and her companions , Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge , had made some stay in Rome , on their way to Egypt . Margaret Fuller called one day at their lodgings . Florence herself opened the door , and said to the visitor , " Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge are not at home . " Margaret replied , " My visit is intended for Miss Florence Nightingale ; " and she was admitted to a t*te-h-t*te of which one would be glad to know something . It was during this visit that I learned the sad news of Margaret 's death . Dr. Howe , with all his energy of body and mind , was something of a valetudinarian. rhe traces of a severe malarial fever , contracted in the Gr*ek campaign of his youth , went with him through life . He was subject to frightful headaches , and these and other ailments caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially in the then new system of hydropathy , as formulated by Priessnitz . At the time spoken of he arranged to pass a week or two at Boppard on the Rhine , where a water cure had recently been established . He became an outside patient of this institution , and seemed to enjoy thoroughly the routine of bathing , douchimig , packing , etc . Beyond the limits of the water cure the little town presented few features of interest . Wandering about its purlieus one day , I came upon a sort of open cave or recess in the rocks , in which I found two rude cradles , each occupied by a silent and stolid baby . Presently , two rough-looking women , who had been carrying stones from the riverside , came in from their work . The little ones now broke out into dismal wailing . " Why do they cry so ? " I asked . " They ought to be glad to see you . " " Oh , madam , they cry because they know how soon we must leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following fashion : " Water cure ? Oh yes , very fine . Priessnitz forgot one day to wash his face , an ( h so lie died . " My husband 's leave of absence was for only six months , and we parted company at Heidelberg : he to turn his face homeward ; I to proceed with my two sisters to Rome , where it had been arranged that I should pass the winter . Our party occupied two thirds of the diligence in which we made a part of the journey . My sister Louisa had with her two little daughters , my youngest sister had one . These , with my two babies and the respective nurses , filled the rotonde of the vehicle . The three mammas occupied the coup* , whAle my brother-in-law , Thomas Crawford , took refuge in the banquette . The customhouse officer at one place approached with his lantern , to ascertain the contents of the diligence . Looking into the rotonde , // he remarked , " Baby baggage , " and inquired no further . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found for me in the street named Capo le Case . A donkey brought my winter 's supply of firewood , and I made haste to lure a grand piano . Edward Freeman , the artist , occupied the suite of rooms above my own . In the apartment below , Mrs. David Dudley Field and her children were settled for the winter . Our little colony was very harmonious . When Mrs. Field entertained company , she was wont to borrow my large lamp ; when I received , she lent me her teacups . Mrs. Freeman was a most friendly little person , partly Italian by birth , but wholly English in education . She willingly became the companion and guide of my walks about Rome , which were long and many . I had begun the study of Hebrew in America , and was glad to find a learned rabbi from the Ghetto who was willing to give me lessons for a moderate compensation . My sister , Mrs. Crawford , was at that time established at Villa Negroni , an old-time papal residence . This was surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial fish pond , and a lodge which my brother-inlaw converted into a studio . My days in Rome passed very quietly . The time , which flew by rapidly , was divided between study within doors , the care and companionship of my little children , and the exploration of the wonderful old city . I dined regularly at two o'clock , having with me at table my son and my baby secured in her high chair . I shared with my sisters the few dissipations of the season , - an occasional ball , a box at the opera , a drive on the Campagna . On Sunday mornings my youngest sister usually came to breakfast with me , and afterward accompanied me to the Ara Cnli Church , where a military mass was celebrated , the music being supplied by the band of a French regimnent . The time , I need scarcely say , was that of the early years of the French occupation of the city , to which France made it her boast that she had brought back the Pope . As I chronicle these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush at their insufficiency . I write as if I had forgotten the wonderful series of events which had come to pass between my first visit to Rome and this secon ( l tarrying within its walls . In the interval , the days of 1848 had come and gone . France had dismissed her citizen king , and had established a republic in place of the monarchy . The Pope of Rome , for centuries the representative and upholder of absolute rule , had stood before time world as the head of the Christianity which liberalizes both institutions an ( l ideas . In Germany the party of progress was triumphant . Europe had trembled with the birth-pangs of freedom . A new and glorious confederacy of states seemed to be promised in the near future . The tyrannies of the earth were surely about to meet their doom . My own dear eldest son was given to me in the spring of this terrible and splendid year of 1848 . When his father wrote " Diea donn6 " under the boy 's name in the family Bible , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberte ' , Egalite ' , Fraternite ' . " The first Napoleon had overthrown rulers and dynasties . A greater power than his now came upon the stage , - the power of individual conviction , backed by popular ' enthusiasm . My husband , who had fought for Greek freedom in his youth , who had risked and suffered imprisonment in behalf of Poland in his early manhood , and who had devoted his mature life to the service of humanity , welcomed the new state of things with all the earnestness of his generous nature . To him , as to many , the final emancipation and unifi // cation of the human race , the millennium of universal peace and good will , seemed near at hand . Alas ! the great pr6mise brought only a greater failure . The time for its fulfillment had not yet arrived . Freedom could not be attained by striking an attitude , nor secured by the issuing of a document . The prophet could see the plan of the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven , but the fact remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's work . Such builders Europe could not bring to the front . The Pope retreated before the logical sequence of his own initiative . France elected for her chief a born despot of the meaner order , whose first act was to overthrow the Roman Republic . Germany had dreamed of freedom , but had not dreamed of the way to secure it . Reaction everywhere asserted itself , and the light of the great hope died down . Coming to Rome while these events were still fresh in men 's minds , I could see no trace of them in the popular life . The waters were as still as death ; the wrecks did not appear above the surface . I met occasionally Italians who could talk calmly about what had happened . Of such an one I asked , " Why did Pio Nono so suddenly forsake his liberal policy ? " " Oh , the Pope was a puppet , moved from without . He never rightly understood the import of his first departure . When the natural result of this came about , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken of only in the secrecy of very private interviews . In general intercourse they were not mentioned . Now and then , a servant , lamenting the dearness of necessaries , the paper money , etc. , would say , " And this has been brought about by blessed benedetto Pio Nono ! " People of higher condition eulogized thus the pontiff 's predecessor : " Gregorio was at least a man of decided views . He knew what he wanted , and how to obtain it . " Once only , in a village not far distant from Rome , I heard an Italian peasant woman say to a prince , " We her family are Republicans . " Victor Emmanuel , Cayour , Garibaldi , your time was not yet come . The French were not beloved in Rome . I was told that the mass of the people would not endure the license of their conquerors in the matter of sex , and that assassinations in consequence were common . In high society it was said that a French officer had endeavored to compel one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful reputation , by threatening to send a challenge in case of refusal . The invitation was nevertheless withheld , and the challenge , if sent , was not accepted . In the English and American circles which I frequented , I sometimes felt called upon to fight for the claim of Italy to freedom and self-government . At a dinner party , at which the altercation had been rather lively , I was invited to entertain the company with some music . Seating myself at the piano , I made it ring out the Marseillaise with a will . But I was myself too much disconcerted by the recent failure to find in my thoughts any promise of better things . My friends said , " The Italians are not fit for self-government . " I may ask , fifty years later , " Who is ? " The progress of ideas is not , indeed , always visible to superficial observers . I was engaged one day in making a small purchase at a shop , when the proprietor leaned across the counter and asked , almost in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard of the book , he said , and wished very much to see a copy of it . Our charge d'affaires , Mr. Cass , mentioned to me the fact that an entire edition of Deodati 's Italian translation of the New Testament had recently been seized and burned by order of the papal government . But to return to matters purely personal . As the Christmas of 1850 drew near , my sister Louisa , ever intent on hospitality , determined to have a party and // a Christmas tree at Villa Negroni . The tree was then a novelty unheard of in Rome . I was to dine with her , and had offered to furnish the music for an informal dance . On Christmas Eve I went with a party of friends to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore , where the Pope , according to the custom of those days , was to appear in state , bearing in his arms the cradle supposed to be that of the infant Jesus , which was usually kept at St. Peter 's . We were a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the highway , as the whole papal cort*ge came sweeping by , - the state coaches of crimson and gold , and the Guardia Nobile with their glittering helmets , white cloaks , and high boots . Their course was illuminated by pans of burning oil , supported by iron staves , the spiked ends of which were stuck in the ground . When the rapid procession had passed on we hastened to overtake it , but arrived too late to witness either the arrival of the Pope or his progress to the high altar with the cradle in his arms . On Christmas Day I attended high mass at St. Peter 's . Although the weather was of the pleasantest , an aguish chill disturbed my enjoyment of the service . This discomfort so increased in the course of the day that , as I sat at dinner , I could with difficulty carry a morsel from my plate to my lips . " This is a chill , " said my sister . You ought to go to bed at once. ** I insisted upon remaining to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would presently succeed the chill , and that I should then be warm enough . I passed the evening in great bodily discomfort , but managed to play quadrilles , waltzes , and the endless Virginia reel . When at last I reached home and my bed , the fever did come with a will . I was fortunate enough to recover very quickly from this indisposition , and did not forget the warning which it gave me of the dangers of the Roman climate . The shivering evening left me a happier recollection . Among my sister 's guests was Horace Binney Wallace , of Philadelphia , whom I had once met in his own city . He had angered me at that time by his ridicule of Boston society , of which he really knew little or nothing . He was now in a better frame of mind , and this second meeting with him was the beginning of a much-valued friendship . We visited together many points of historic interest in the city , - the Pantheon , the Tarpeian Rock , the bridge of Horatius Codes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually found in conjunction with red hair . As he and I were both distinguished by this feature , I was much pleased to hear from him that " the highest effort of nature is to produce a rosso . " He was a devoted student of the works of Auguste Conite , and had recently held some conversation with that remarkable man . In the course of this , he told me , he asked the great Positivist how he could account for the general religious instinct of the human race , so contrary to the doctrines of his philosophy . Comte replied , " Que voulezvous , monsieur ? Anormalit6 c*r6brale . " My new friend was good enough to interest himself in my literary pursuits . He advised me to study the most important of Comte 's works , but by no means to become a convert to his doctrines . In due time I availed myself of his counsel , and read with great interest the volumes prescribed by him . Horace Wallace was an exhilarating companion . I have never forgotten the silvery timbre of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sometimes inform me that he had discovered a new and most remarkable rosso . This was sometimes a picture , but oftener a living individual . If he found himself disappointed in the latter case , he would account for it by saying that he had at *first sight mistaken the color of the hair , which shaded too much upon the yellow . Despite his vivacity // of temperament , he was subject to fits of severe depression . Some years after thi time , finding himself in Paris , he happened to visit a friend whose mental powers had been impaired by serious illness . He himself had been haunted for some time by the dread of becoming insane , and the sad condition of his friend so impressed him with the fear of suffering a similar disaster that he made haste to avoid that fate by taking his own life . The husband of my youngest sister , Adolph Mailliard , had been an intimate friend of Joseph Bonaparte , Prince of Musignano . My sister was in consequence invited more than once to the Bonaparte palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who married his cousin , Princess Z*naIde . She had passed some years at the Bonaparte villa in Bordentown , New Jersey , the American residence of her father , Joseph Bonaparte , ex-king of Spain . This princess , who was taut soit peu gourmande , said one day to my sister , " What good things they have for breakfast in America ! I still remember those hot cakes . " The conversation was reported to me , and I managed , with the assistance of the helper brought from home , to send the princess a very excellent bannock of Indian meal , of which she afterward said , " It was so good that we ate what was left of it on the second day . " Among the friends of that winter were Sarah and William Clarke , sister and brother of the Rev. James Freeman Clarke . It was in their company that Margaret Fuller made the journey recorded . in her Summer on the Lakes . Both were devoted to her memory . I afterward learned that William Clarke considered her the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to his aid in a season of melancholy depression and self-depreciation . Miss Clarke was characterized by an exquisite refinement of feeling and of manner . She was also an artist of considerable merit . This was the first of many winters passed by her in Rome . I will further mention only a dinner given by American residents in Rome on Washington 's birthday , at which I was present . Mrs. Ann S. Stephens , the well-known writer , was also one of the guests . She had composed for the occasion a poem , of which I recall the opening line , - " We are met in the clime where the wild flowers abound , " and the closing ones , - " To the halo that circles our Washington 's head Let us pour a libation the gods never knew . " Among many toasts , my sister Annie proposed this one , " Washington 's clay in Crawford 's hand , " which was appropriate , as Thomas Crawford was known at the time to be engaged in modeling the equestrian statue of Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end in the summer of the year 1851 , and my return to home and friends became imperative . As time time of departure approached , I felt how ( leeply the subtle fascination of Roman life had entered into my very being . Pain , amounting almost to anguish , seized me at the thought that I might never again behold those ancient monuments , those stately churches , or take part in the society which had charmed me principally through its unlikeness to any that I had known elsewhere . I have indeed seen Rome and its wonders more than once since that time , but never as I saw them then . I made the homeward voyage with my sister Annie and her husband in an old-fashioned Havre packet . We were a month at sea , and after the first days of discomfort I managed to fill the hours of the long summer days with systematic occupation . In the morning I perused Swedenborg 's Divine Love and Wisdom . In the afternoon I read , for // the first and only time , Eug*ne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon borrowed for me froni a steerage passenger . In the evening we played whist ; and when others had retired for the night , I often sat alone in the cabin , meditating upon the events and lessons of the last six months . These lucubrations took form in a number of poems , which were written with no thought of publication , but , which saw the light a year or two later . Returning to Boston , I found the division of public sentiment more strongly marked than ever . The Fugitive Slave Law was much in the public mind . The anti-slavery people attacked it with might and main , while the class of wealthy conservatives and their followers strongly deprecated all opposition to its enactments . During my absence Charles Sumner had been elected to the Senate of the United States , in place of Daniel Webster , who had hitherto been the political idol of the Massachusetts aristocracy . Mr. Sumner 's course had warmly commended him to a laige and ever increasing constituency , but had brought down upon him the anger of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely with the class then derided as " a band of disturbers of the public peace , enemies of law and order . " I deeply regretted the discords of the time , and would have had all people good friends , however diverse in political persuasion . As this could not be , I felt constrained to cast in my lot with those who protested against the new assumptions of the slave power . The social ostracism which visited Mr. Sumner never fell upon Dr. Howe . This may have been because the active life of the latter lay without the domain of politics , but also , I must think , because the services which he continually rendered to the community compelled from all who knew him respect and cordial good will . VOL . LXXXIII. - NO. 498. 31 I did not then , nor at any time , make any willful breach with the society to which I was naturally related . It did , however , much annoy me to hear those spoken of with contempt and invective who , I was persuaded , were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose I sometimes repelled the attacks made upon them with a certain heat of temper , to avoid which I ought to have remembered Talleyrand 's famous admonition , " Surtout point de zde . " Better , perhaps , would it have been to rest in the happy prophecy which assures us that " Wisdom is justified of all her childi-en . " Ordinary society is apt to class the varieties of individuals under certain stereotyped heads , and I have no doubt that it held me at this time to be a seeker after novelties , and one disposed to offer a premium for heresies of every kind . Yet I must say that I was never made painfully aware of the existence of such a feeling . There was always a leaven of good sense and good sentiment even in the worldly world of Boston , and as time went on I became the recipient of much kindness , and the happy possessor of a circle of substantial friends . When I came back from Europe , in 1851 , my husband spoke to me about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by name , - concerning whom lie related time following circumstances . Count Gurowski had been implicated in one of the later Polish insurmections . In order to keep his large estates from confiscation lie had made them over to his younger brothem , upon the explicit condition that a remittance should be regularly sent him , sufficient to enable him to live wherever his lot should thenceforth be cast . He came to this country , but the remittance failed to follow him , and he presently found himself without funds in a foreign land . Being a man of much erudition , he had made friends with some of the professors // of Harvard University . They offered him assistance , but he declined it , and applied for work at the gardens of Hovey &amp; Co. , in or near Cambridge . His new friends remonstrated with him , pleading that this work was unsuitable for a man of his rank and condition . He replied , " I am Gurowski ; labor can not degrade me . " This independence of his position commended him much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once invited to our house . He obtained some literary employment , and finally , through influence exerted at Washington , a position as translator was secured for him in the State Department . He was at Newport during a summer that we passed at the Cliff House , and lie it was who gave to this the title of Hotel Rambouillet . His proved to be a character of remarkable contradictions , in which really noble and generous impulses contrasted with an undisciplined temper and an insatiable curiosity . While inveighing constantly against the rudeness of American manners , he himself was often guilty of great impoliteness . To give an example : At his boarding-house in Newport a child at table gave a little trouble , upon which the count animadverted with much severity . The mother , waxing impatient , said , " I think , count , that you have no right to say so mucb about table manners ; for yesterday you broke the crust of the chicken pie with your fist , and pulled the meat out with your fingers . " His curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady of his acquaintance at her door , and seeing a basket on her arm , he asked , " Where are you going . Mrs. , so early , with that basket ? " She declined to answer the question , on the ground that the questioner had no concern in her errand . On the evening of the same day he again met the lady , and said to her , " I know now where you were going this morning with that basket . " If friends on whom he called were said to be engaged or not at home , he was at great pains to find out how they were engaged , or whether they were really at home in spite of the message to the contrary . One gentleman in Newport , not desiring to receive the count 's visit , and knowing that he would not be safe anywhere in his own house , took refuge in the loft of his barn arid drew the ladder up after him . And yet Adam Gurowski was a truehearted man , loyal to every good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to the last to be a very checkered one . When the civil war broke out , his disapprobation of men and measures took expression in vehement and indignant protest against what appeared to him a willful mismanagement of public business . William H. Seward was then at the head of the Department of State , and against his policy the count fulminated in public and in private . He was warned by friends , and at last officially told that he could not be retained in the department if he persisted in stigmatizing its chief as a fool , a timeserver , no matter what . He persevered , and was dismissed from his place . He had been on friendly terms with Charles Sumner , to whom he probably owed his appointment . He tormented this gentleman to such a degree as to end all relations between the two . Of this breach Mr. Sumner gave the following description : " The count would come to my rooms at all hours . When I left my sleeping-chamber in the morning , I often found him in my study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably any other matter which might excite his curiosity . If he happened to come in while a foreign minister was visiting me , he would stay through the visit . I bore with this for a long time . At last the annoyance became insupportable . One evening , after a long sitting in my room , he took leave , but presently returned for a fresh s*ance , although it was already very late . I said to him , Count , you must go now , and // you must never return . ' How is this , my dear friend ? ' exclaimed the count . There is no explanation , ' said I ; only you must not come to my room again . ' This terminated the acquaintance . " After this the count spoke very bitterly of Mr. Sumner , whose procedure did seem to me a little severe . The lesson was quite lost upon Gurowski , and he continued to make enemies of those with whom he had to do , until nearly every door in Washington was closed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of a well-known lawyer , was one of the notabilities of Washington . Hers was one of those central characters which are abe to attract and harmonize the most diverse social elements . Her house had long been a resort of the worthies of the capital . Men of mark and of intelligence gathered about her , regardless of party divisions . No one understood Washington society better than she did , and no one in it was more highly esteemed or less liable to be misrepresented . Mrs. Eames well knew how provoking and tormenting Count Gurowski was apt to be , but she knew , too , the remarkable qualities which went far to redeem his troublesome traits of character . And so , when the count seemed to be entirely discredited , she stood up for him , warning her friends that if they came to her house they would always be likely to meet this unacceptable man . He , on his part , was warmly sensible of the value of her friendship , and showed his gratitude by a sincere interest in all that concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his behalf was not without effect upon the society of the place , and people in general felt obliged to show some respect to a person whom Mrs. Eames honored with her friendship . I myself hav. * reason to remember with gratitude Mis . Eames 's hospitality . I made more than one visit at her house , and I well recall the distinguished company that I met there . The house was simple in its appointments , for the hosts were not in affluent circumstances , but its atmosphere of cordiality and of good sense wa* delightful . I remember meeting at one of her parties Hon. Salmon P. Chase , afterward Chief Justice of the United States , Secretary Welles of the Navy , and Senator Grimes of Io*va . I had seen that morning a life-size painting representing President Lincoln surrounded by the members of his Cabinet . Mr. Chase , I believe , asked what I thought of the picture . I replied that I thought Mr. Lincoln 's attitude rather awkward , and his legs out of proportion in their length . Mr. Chase laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long that it would be difficult to exaggerate them . " I came to Washington soon after the conclusion of the war , and heard that Count Gurowski was seriously ill at the home of his friend . I hastened thither to inquire about him , and learned that his life was almost despaired of . Mr. Eames told me this , amid said that his wife and a lady friend of hers were incessant in their care of him . He promised that I should see him as soon as a change for the better should appear . Instead of this I received one day a message from Mrs. Eamnes , saying that the count was now given up by his physician , and that I might come , if I wished to see him alive once more . I went to the house at once , and found Mrs. Eames and her friend at the bedside of the dying man . He was already unconscious , and soon breathed his last . At Mr. Eames 's request , I now gave up my room at the hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fatigue of nursing the sick man and with grief for his loss . While I sat and talked with her Mr. Eames entered the room , amid said , " Mrs. Howe , my wife has always had a menagerie here in Washington , and now she has lost her taLfiful old grizzly . " I was intrusted with some of the ar // rangements for the funeral . Mrs. Eames said to me that , as the count had been a man of no religious belief , she thought it would be best to invite a Unitarian minister to officiate at his funeral . I accordingly secured the services of the Rev. John Pierpont , who happened to be in Washington at the time . Charles Sumner came to the house before the funeral , and actually shed tears as he looked on the face of his former friend . He remarked upon the beauty of the countenance , saying in his rather oratorical way , " There is a beauty of life , and there is a beauty of death . " The count 's good looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eye , which had been destroyed , it was said , in a duel . After death this blemish did not appear , and the distinction of the countenance was remarkable . Among his few effects was a printed volume containing the genealogy of his family , which had thrice intermarried with royal houses , once in the family of Maria Lesczinska , wife of Louis XV . of France . Within this book he had inclosed one or two cast-off trifles belonging to Mrs. Eames , with a few words of deep and grateful affection . So ended this troublous life . The Russian minister at Washington called upon Mrs. Eames soon after the funeral , and spoke with respect of the count , who , he said , could have had a brilliant career in Russia , had it not been for his quarrelsome disposition . Despite his skepticism , and in all his poverty , he caused a mass to be said every year for the soul of his mother , who had been a devout Catholic . To the brother whose want of faith added the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed a letter in the following form : " To John Gurowski , the greatest scoundrel in Europe . " A younger brother of his , a man of great beauty of person , enticed one of the infantas of Spain from the school or convent in which she was pursuing her education . This adventure made much noise at the time . Mrs. Eames once read me part of a letter from this lady , in which she spoke of " the fatal Gurowski beauty . " * It was in the early years of this decade ( 1850-60 ) that I definitively came before the world as an author . My first volume of poems , entitled Passion Flowers , was published by Ticknor and Fields , without my name . In the choice and arrangement of the poems James T. Fields had been very helpful to me . My lack of experience had led me to suppose that my incognito might easily be maintained , but in this my expectations were disappointed . The authorship of the book was at once traced to me . It was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the highest literary authorities of the time it received encouraging commendation . Mr. Emerson acknowledged the copy sent him , in a very kind letter . Mr. Whittier did likewise . He wrote , " I dare say thy volume has faults enough . " For all this , he spoke warmly of its merits . Prescott , the beloved historian , made me happy with his good opinion . George Ripley in the New York Tribune , Edwin Whipple and Frank Sanborn in Boston , reviewed the volume in a very genial and appreciative spirit . I think that my joy reached its height when I heard Theodore Parker repeat some of my lines from the pulpit . Miss Catharine Sedgwick , discussing the poems with a mutual friend , quoted with praise a line from my long poem on Rome . Speaking of my first hearing of the nightingale , I had written : - A note Fell as a star falls , trailing sound for light . Dr. Francis Lieber quoted the following passage as having a Shakespearean ring : - But , as none can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celestial will , to strike The stroke of Freedom on the fettered floods , Giving the spring his watchword - even so // Rome knew not she had spoke the word of Fate That should , from out its sluggishness , compel The frost-bound vastness of barbaric life , Till , with an ominous sound , the torrent rose And rushed upon her with terrific brow , Sweeping her back , through all her haughty ways , To her own gates , a piteous fugitive . I make mention of these things because the volume has long been out of print , and perhaps out of date . It was a timid performance upon a slender reed , but the great performers in the noble orchestra of writers answered to its appeal , which won me a seat in their ranks . The work , such as it was , dealt partly with the stirring questions of the time , partly with things near and familiar . The events of 1848 were still in fresh remerubrance : the heroic efforts of Italian patriots to deliver their country from foreign oppression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most important among my Passion Flowers were devoted to these themes . The wrongs and sufferings of the slave had their part in the volume . A second publication , following two years later , and styled Words for the Hour , was esteemed by some critics better than the first . George William Curtis , at that time editor of Putnam 's Magazine , wrote me , " It is a better book than its predecessor , but will probably not meet with the same success . " And so , indeed , it proved . I had always contemplated writing for the stage , and was now emboldened to compose a drama entitled The World 's Own , which was produced at Wallack 's Theatre , in New York . The principal characters were sustained by Matilda Heron , then in the height of her popularity , and Mr. Sothern , afterward so famous in the rSle of Lord Dundreary . The play was performed several times in New York , and once in Boston . It was pronounced by one critic " full of literary merits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , " as the saying is . My next literary venture was a series of papers descriptive of a visit made to the island of Cuba in 1859 , under the following circumstances . Theodore Parker had long intended to make this year one of foreign traveL He had planned a journey in South America , and Dr. Howe had promised to accompany him . The sudden failure of Parker 's health at this time was thought to render a change of climate imperative , and in the month of February a voyage to Cuba was prescribed for him . Dr. Howe willingly consented to the change of plan , and decided that I must be of the party . To our hotel in Havana caine , one day , a lovely lady , with pathetic dark eyes and a look of ill health . She was accompanied by her husband and little son . This was Mrs. Frank Hampton , formerly Miss Sally Baxter , a great belle in her time , and much admired by Mr. Thackeray . When we were introduced to each other , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asked , " Are you the Mrs. Howe ? " We became friends at once . The Hamptons went with us to Matanzas , where we passed a few pleasant days . Dr. Howe was very helpful to the beautiful invalid . Something in the expression of her face reminded him of a relative known to him in early life , and on inquiry he found that Mrs. Hampton 's father was a distant cousin of his own . Mrs. Hampton talked much of Thackeray , who , while in this country , had been a familiar visitor at her father 's house . She told me that she recognized bits of her own conversation in some of the sayings of Ethel Newcome , and I have little doubt that in depicting the beautiful and noble though wayward girl he had in mind something of the aspect and character of the lovely Sally Baxter . When we left Havana our new friends went with us to Charleston , and invited us to visit them at their home in Columbia , South Carolina . This we were glad // to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an elder brother , Wade Hampton , whose family were at this time traveling in Europe . Wade Hampton called upon Dr. Howe , and soon introduced a topic which we would gladly have avoided , namely , the strained relations between the North and the South . " We mean to fight for it , " said Wade Hampton . But Dr. Howe after . ward said to me : " They can not be in earnest about meaning to fight . It would be too insane , too fatal to their own interests . " So indeed it proved , but they then knew us as little as we knew them . They thought that we could not fight , and we thought that they would not . Both parties were soon made wiser by sad experience . My account of this trip , after publication in The Atlantic Monthly , was issued in book form by Ticknor and Fields . Years after this time , a friend of mine landed in Cuba with a copy of the book in her hand luggage . It was at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw it again . This little work was favorably spoken of and well received , but it did not please everybody . In one of its chapters , speaking of the natural indolence of the negroes in tropical countries , I had ventured to express the opinion that compulsory employment is better than none . Good Mr. Garrison seized upon this sentence , and impaled it in a column of The Liberator headed , " The Refuge of Oppression. ** I certainly did not intend it as an argument in favor of negro slavery . As an abstract proposition , and without ref erence to color , I still think it true . The publication of my Cuban notes brought me an invitation to chronicle the events of the season at Newport for the New York Tribune . This was the beginning of a correspondence with that paper which lasted well into the time of the civil war . My letters dealt somewhat with social doings in Newport and in Boston , but more with the great events of the time . To me , the experience was valuable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general public , and helped to a better understanding of its needs and demands . It was in the days now spoken of that I first saw Edwin Booth . Dr. Howe and I betook ourselves to the Boston Theatre one rainy evening , expecting to see nothing more than an ordinary performance . The play was Richelieu , and we had seen but little of Mr. Booth 's part in it before we turned to each other and said , " This is the real thing . " In every word , in every gesture , the touch of genius made itself felt . A little later I saw him in Hamlet . and was even more astonished and delighted . While he was still completing this his first engagement in Boston , I received a letter from his manager , proposing that I should write a play for Mr. Booth . My first drama , though not a success , had made me somewhat known to theatrical people . I had l ) ecome painfully aware of its defects , and desired nothing more than to profit by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apl ) robation . It was therefore with a good hope of success that I undertook to write the play . Mr. Booth himself called to see me , in support of his request . The favorable impression which he had made upon me was not lessened by a nearer view . I found him modest , intelligent , and above all genuine , - the man as worthy of admiration as the artist . Although I had seen Mr. Booth in a variety of characters , I could only think of representing him as Hippolytus , a beautiful youth , of heroic type , enamored of a high ideal . This was the part which I desired to create for him . I undertook the composition without much delay . and ( levoted to it the months of one summer 's sojourn at Lawton 's Valley . This lovely little estate had come to us almost fortuitously . George William Curtis , writing of the Newport of forty years ago , gives a character sketch of one // Alfred Smith , a *vell-known real estate agent , who managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , often succeeding in making them pinchasers of some bit of property in the sale of which he had a personal interest . In the summer of 1852 my husband became one of his victims . I say this because Dr. Howe made the purchase without much deliberation . In fact , he could hardly have told any one why he made it . The farm was a very poor one , and the farmhouse very small . Some necessary repairs rendered it habitable for our family of little children and ourselves . I did not desire the purchase , but I soon became much attached to the valley , which my husband 's care greatly beautified . This was a woo ( led gorge , perhaps an eighth of a mile from the house , and extending some distance between high rocky banks . We found it a wilderness of brambles , with a brook which ran much out of its proper course . Dr. Howe converted it into a most charming out-of-door salon . A firm green sod took the place of the briers , the brook was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced as many decayed stumps . An old , disused mill added to the picturesqueness of the scene . Below it rushed a small waterfall . Here I have passed many happy hours with my books and my babies , but it was not in this enchanting spot that I wrote my play . I had at this time and for many years afterward a superstition about a north light . My eyes had given me some trouble , and I felt obliged to follow my literary work under the circumstances most favorable for their use . The exposure of our little farmhouse was south and west , and its only north light was derived from a window at the top of the attic stairs . Here was a platform just large enough to give room for a table two feet square . The stairs were shut off from the rest of the house by a stout door . Here , through the summer heats , and in spite of many wasps , I wrote my five-act drama , dreaming of the fine emphasis which Mr. Booth would give to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make in classic costume . He , meanwhile , was growing into great fame and favor with the public , and was called hither and thither by numerous engagements . The period of his courtship and marriage intervened , and a number of years elapsed between the completion of my work and his first reading of it . At last there came a time in which the productiou of Hippolytus seemed possible . Charlotte Cushman and Edwin Booth were both in Boston , performing , as I remember , but not at the same theatre . They agreed to act in my play . E. L. Davenport , manager of the Howard Athemeum , undertook to produce it , and my dream was very near becoming a reality . But lo ! on a sudden , the manager bethought him that the time was rather late in the season ; that the play would require new scenery ; and , more than all , that his wife , who was also an actress , was not pleased with a secondary part assigned to her . A polite note informed me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the greatest " let down " that I ever experienced . It affected me seriously for some days , after which I determined to attempt nothing more for the stage . In truth , there appeared to be little reason for this action on the part of the manager . Miss Cushman , speaking of it , said to me , " My dear , if Edwin Booth and I had done nothing more than to stand upon the stage and say goodevening to each other , the house would have been filled . " Mr. Booth , in the course of these years , experienced great happiness and great sorrow . On the occasion of our first meeting he had spoken to inc of " little Mary Devlin " as an actress of much promise , who had recently been admired in " several heavy parts . " In process of time he became engaged to this young girl . Before the // announcement of this fact he appeared with her several times before the Boston public . Few among those who saw it would ever forget a performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at their best , ideally young , beautiful , and identified with their parts . Of the untimely death of this exquisite little woman the poet Parsons wrote : - " What shall we do now , Mary being dead , Or say or write that shall express the half ? What can we do but pillow that fair head , And let the spring-time write her epitaph ? - " As it will soon , in snowdrop , violet , Wind-flower and columbine and maiden 's tear ; Each letter of that pretty alphabet That spells in flowers the pageant of the year . " She hath fulfilled her promise and hath passed ; Set her down gently at the iron door ! Eyes look on that loved image for the last : Now cover it in earth , - her earth no more . " These lines recall to me the scene of Mary Booth 's funeral , which took place in wintry weather , the service being held at the chapel in Mount Auburn . Hers was a most pathetic figure , as she lay , serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the casket , his eyes heavy with grief , I could not but remember how often I had seen him enact the part of Hamlet at the stage burial of Ophelia . Beside or behind him walked a young man of remarkable beauty , to be sadly known at a later date as Wilkes Booth , the assassin of Lincoln and the victim of his own crime . Henry Ward Beecher , meeting Mary Booth one day at dinner at my house , was so much impressed with her peculiar charm that , on the occasion of her death , he wrote a very sympathetic letter to Mr. Booth , and became thenceforth one of his m'ost esteemed friends . The years between 1850 and 1857 , eventful as they were , appear to me almost a period of play , when compared with the time of trial which was to follow . It might have been likened to the tuning of instruments before some great musical solemnity . The theme was already suggested , but of its wild and terrible development who could have had any foreknowledge ? Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " What a pity that the map of our magnificent country should be destined to be so soon torn in two on account of the negro , that poorest of human creatures , satisfied , even in slavery , with sugar cane and a banjo ! " On reading this prediction , I remarked to my husband : " This is poor , dear Parker 's foible . He always thinks that he knows what will come to pass . How absurd is this forecast of his ! " " I do n't know about that , " replied Dr. Howe .
