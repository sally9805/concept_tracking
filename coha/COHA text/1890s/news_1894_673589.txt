txt The Republican papers ' are publishing a silly story about the proposed reduction of the duty on tin plate . We find it set forth at length , with sensational head-lines , in The Philadelphia Press and The Chicago Inter Ocean , and from those prominent organs of it has gone into the columns of other papers , where it has become the subject of partisan comment , in which the customary indignation is displayed . The substance of the tale in The Inter Ocean is as follows : " It is said that as great a scandal is to be expected in connection with the tin-plate schedule of the tariff as has been disclosed in connection with the sugar schedule . The tin-plate schedule has been framed in the interest of British and Welsh manufacturers of tin plate , and the importers have been their active agents in this country . An unnaturalized Englishman named Trench Is said to have been the chief manager in this country of the foreign tin-plate interests . It is asserted that the British and ' Welsh manufacturers had information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin plate before it was known in this country . It is stated that a letter can be produced , dated in England May 21 , in which it is stated that the British and Welsh tin-plate works have started up in anticipation of the action of the Senate on tin plate . This was several days before the action of the framers of the Tariff bill was known in Washington . " The Philadelphia Press knows all about this letter . It said on the 22d inst. : " That the Welsh and English manufacturers knew what was going on in the Finance Committee room before it was made public on this side of the water is amply shown by letters and newspaper accounts . The schedule as it now stands was made public here on May 24 . On the 21st of May a letter was mailed to James Daniel , who is now engaged as Superintendent of a large tin-plate factory in Brooklyn , from his wife , who lives at Montyglo , Monmouthshire , England . In this letter Mrs. Daniel relates how news has been received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of duty on tin plate that would cause every manufactory to start in Wales and run as it had in the past . * * Two weeks before the action of the Senate upon the tin-plate schedule orders for tens and hundreds of thousands of boxes had been received in the Monmouthshire and Swansea districts . This would indicate that the Manufacturers there had been correctly informed with regard to the schedule that was to be adopted by the Finance Committee . " Surely those are significant dates  --  May 21 and May 24 . But what was the news that could have been received by this observant woman in Montyglo ? What is the Senate duty on tin plate ? How does it differ from the House duty ? And when was the House duty fixed by the passage of the Wilson bill ? Let us in ? quire a little as to the dimensions of this midsummer mare 's nest . The duty on tin plate , as fixed by the Senate , is the same as the duty fixed by the House , 1 1-5 cents per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted by the House was known to everybody on Feb. 1 , when the House passed the Wilson bill , or three months and a half before that letter was written . The first report of the Senate committee was made on March 20 , and it reduced the duty to 1 cent . This was a fair indication that the House bill 's rate would not be increased . Would our Republican contemporaries have us believe that it was expected in Wales or elsewhere that a Democratic Congress would retain the tinplate duty ? The Senate committee 's first report having been made on March 20 , or two months before that letter was written , its second report , containing the final amendments which have since been adopted , was made on May 7 , or two weeks before the date of the letter , and in that report the House bill 's duty of 1 1-5 cents was simply confirmed . In the light of these facts the sensational story which The Press and The Inter Ocean have built up on the slender foundation of Mrs. Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those orders , our Republican friends ought to know that the quantity of tin plate imported has averaged nearly 400,000 boxes per month for the last ten months , and that the average was considerably larger in the preceding ten months . Do they ask their readers to believe that the import trade in tin plate has ceased since the tariff was passed ? The quantity imported last year was almost as large as the quantity imported under the old tariff in the year ending June 30 , 1890 , the last full year in which the imports were not affected by an impending change of duties , or 613 , - 679,990 pounds , as compared with 680 , - 060,925 . While we have this subject in hand we should like to invite the attention of The Philadelphia Press and . The Chicago Inter Ocean and our other Republican contemporaries to the effect of that provision of the tin-plate schedule ' Which postponed the application of the new duty until July , 1 , 1891 , the remainder of the bill . It will be seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponement so kindly granted by the Republican tariff makers that in June they were bringing in tin plate at thee rate of almost 2,400,000,000 pounds per annum . The new duty - was enforced on July 1 , and in July the imports fell to 12,500,000 pounds . The effect of this attempt to forestall the new duty and to take advantage of the higher price is seen in the fact that for the fiscal year ending on June 30 , 1891 , the imports rose to 1,036,489,074 pounds . Because of this abnormal movement the imports fell to 422,000,000 in the first year of the new duty , but they rose again almost to the normal figures . in the following year . We do not see how the Republican Party has ever been able to forgive the makers of the tariff for playing into the hands of the hated Importers by providing for this postponement . Perhaps our Republican contemporaries , as they think of it , will be reminded of the postpcnement of date in the Senate sugar schedule of the pending bill . Some foundation for scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinplate schedule , but there can be none in this utterly dilly story about " early information " sent this year to the Welsh manufacturers of tin plate and the date of Mrs. Daniel 's letter to her husband . going into effect on Oct. 6 , 1990 . This gave the wretched importers here , who offend our Republican- - Mena by representing " foreign tin-plate interests , " much early information and a grand opportunity to stock the American market with tin plate imported at the old and much lower rate of duty , which might be sold afterward at the higher price . D:d they take advantage of that opportunity ? They tried to do so , but their extra orders had the effect of so increasing the price abroad that we suspect they made very little if any profit . The following table shows the imports for a series of Years and also for the six months immediately preceding July 1 , 1891 , to which date the application of the new and much higher duty was postponed Pounds .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
