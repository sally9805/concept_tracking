txt The great Republican meeting at Carnegie Hall was a revelation . As an exhi-. bition of Mr. Low 's strength in that party it exceeded the hopes of his most sanguine supporters . It dumfounded the Platt Republicans by giving public evidence of their slight hold upon the voting force and moral weight of the party . It gratified and encouraged the friends of good government by its display of the unexpected prevalence of the , independent and non-partisan spirit in a party so well disciplined and so loyally devoted to its principles . Mr. Low , not Gen. TRACY , is the real Republican candidate . The men who give character and influence to the party are with him . All those qualities of Republicanism that constitute a title to public confidence were represented in Carnegie Hall . TRACY has only the dumb herd and its professional drivers , the machine rump of the party . If his supporters ' were the Republican Party it would never win a victory , never get an office . The people would not trust it . In respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican support Low is also in the lead of TRACY . After the surprising meeting of Thursday night there can be no doubt that more than half the Republicans of New York will vote for him . The evidence of that meeting may be considered conclusive of his election . This powerful Republican support , added to the Democrats , the independents , the German-Americans , and the laboring men who are already committed to him , puts him far in advance of any other candidate in the field .
