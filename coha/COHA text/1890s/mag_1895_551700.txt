THE EVANGELICAL MOVEMENT IN By Charles F. Dole . *HE history of religion in America is woven out of various and curious * strands . Of these the strongest thread is what has been called " evangelicalism . " Evangelical Christianity is really a phase of the strain of Puritanism , as old as the nature of man , which in every period of renewed interest in religion aims to draw its sharp , rigid lines about the few faithful believers . Thus the English Puritanism , out of which the settlement of New England grew , was precisely such an attempt to draw the lines of a veritable church against a loose , indifferent and compromising world . Our ancestors who emigrated to Holland and founded the Plymouth Colony would hardly recognize the national English Church as a real church . Modern evangelicalism is another phase of the ancient Puritan spirit . It is a call for genuineness and reality in religion . It is the attempt to define who 533 AMERICA . are religious and to shut out of the church those whose membership would add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle was not won merely by coming to America . As early as 1662 there had come to be a large number of persons whom the strict Puritan conditions excluded from church membership . They probably outnumbered the church members , perhaps as five to one . Theoretically they were heathen : their children could not be baptized . Yet they were often persons of correct life who did not dream of doubting the evangelical system of doctrines . The famous " half-way covenant " permitted these persons to enter as it were the vestibule of the church , so far at least as to be able to offer their children in baptism . Somewhat later certain ministers ; and especially the eminent and pious Stoddard of Northampton , invited these half-way Christians to the communion , // trusting the service would prove a " means of grace . " The State Church of Massachusetts had now obviously become like the Established Church of England , from which the Puritans had withdrawn . In other words , the " world " had entered the church . For a merely intellectual assent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital religion opened the easy door to its communion . Naturally the stricter creed itself disintegrated in this mild atmosphere of good-natured toleration . " Unconverted ministers , " which I take to mean men without earnest belief , were said to be numerous . One who has looked over several hundreds of the sermons of the eighteenth century describes them as generally dull and pointless . The exceptional revival preaching of Edwards and Whitefield was a new trumpet call to Puritanism . The strict lines were drawn anew . The church of the half-way covenant , like all the State Churches abroad , had assumed that any one born and baptized a Christian was a Christian still , and evidence should be shown to the contrary . The Puritan or evangelical revivalist shifted the presumption . A man , though born of Christian parents , and however properly reared and baptized , of however exemplary conduct , was assumed to be an unregenerate enemy of God till definite evidence could be brought to the contrary . This is the key to the understanding of the evangelical type of Christianity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The individual was not only stirred to think and judge for himself : moral responsibility was also urged upon him . He could not be saved in the multitude by his church and its forms . Each man must be saved alone . For every soul , therefore , there was a decisive choice and a moment of salvation . Heretofore the man was lost ; now he was saved . The personal experience of Luther and the philosophical system of Calvin alike brought the individual face to face with God . The doctrinal basis which underlay evangelicalism may be briefly characterized . The main facts assumed were a world ruined and the human race lost through disobedience ; mankind in a state of chronic rebellion or alienation from God ; eternal doom hanging over every soul ; an atonement made by the suffering of Jesus Christ , the second person of the Trinity , whereby it became possible for peace to be made with the offended Majesty ; conversion , through which a soul passed in a moment from death to life ; and regeneration or the working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The system could allow no easy theory of gradual education , or the growth of a soul into the life of religion . It would be difficult to show in a paragraph what it was in the Arminian heresy against which so great horror was felt by the more orthodox party in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It was probably dimly apprehended to represent a new and more humane tendency , the spirit of toleration , and somewhat more than the age approved of the mercy and love of God . At its best it expressed a compromise theology , with which no philosophic thinker could be permanently satisfied . At its worst it stood for a dry and unfruitful system of morals . But Arminius himself insisted as distinctly as Calvin on the main facts of the lost world , the unregenerate human nature and the atonement of the Son of God. * The success of the great Methodist Church , almost wholly Arminian , is sufficient proof of the Puritan or evangelical character of this theology whenever vitalized by the spirit of religion . The great fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This human life is a probation for the chance of getting religion . Eternity hangs upon this crisis . All preaching is in the main with a view to bringing men to this experience . rhe test of a church is in the answer to the question whether or not men are converted . It is an experience definite , mysterious , like a miracle , tremendous in its consequences . It is impossible that it could pass without leaving unmistakable tokens . * One may read a sermon of chauncey's. the great Boston Arminian , calculated to frighten sinners and in fact most christians also , almost as profoundly as Edwards 's famous Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God . " // Due examination therefore will show whether or not any alleged experience is valid , and whether a person is fit to be received into the church . A converted man must be assumed to have felt something of the weight and remorse of infinite sin , to acknowledge his desert to suffer forever in hell , to feel the needof an infinite atonement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed with grateful love toward his Saviour , with peace and joy in being saved . So far at least his experience and his creed must fit each other . The evangelical movement was not only religious and doctrinal ; it was highly ethical also . The Christian was a new creature , in harmony with the good will of the world . His life and conduct ought to show this by marked signs , purity , truthfulness , temperance , benevolence . It had early shocked and scandalized the Puritan spirit that dissolute men were in the church . The true church should therefore enforce discipline . Prove any course of conduct or fashion to be wordly ; show card-playing , theatre-going or dancing to be inconsistent with the life of one who has only lately stood under doom of the wrath of God , whose chief work henceforth ought to be to save sinners from similar doom ; such conduct and fashions must straightway be abolished . The evangelical system proposes one solemn and cardinal purpose for every converted man . Others are where he was , still enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save souls . " Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature " is the universal command . He must tell the news of salvation to his friends and neighbors . He must hold his time and means in trust to help send his gospel everywhere . What will happen when men possessed with burning zeal to save souls go forth to preach the news of men s lost condition and the simple and affecting means of escape ? Since God hears his people 's prayers , why should not enthusiastic believers look for immediate and startling results ? This is the evangelical theory of revivals . God may be expected to pour out his Spirit . Communities and multitudes may be expected to be moved by a common impulse . As with many other theories , the expectation has tended to bring its fulfilment . Such is the evangelical system in its main outlines , coherent , definite , practical , intense , requiring pure hearts , courage , disinterestedness , faith , in fact the highest ethical qualities . Such is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convert the world to Christ . If it draws the lines rigidly , it is in order the more surely to bring all men at last into its fold ; as an army bent on victory may first drum its shirks and cowards out of the camp . There was need enough in the period that followed the Revolutionary War for a revival of religion . The war had left its demoralizing effects like a long and dangerous fever . The whiskey riots in Pennsylvania and Shays 's Rebellion in lVlassachusetts tell the story of the low civilization of the native American population long before emigration had crowded our cities with foreign ignorance . The nation that chose a man of the notorious and dissolute character of Aaron Burr as Vice-President could have had no nice moral sense or high standards , whether private or political . Everywhere among the better educated - class were men called infidels , the Robert Ingersolls of the day , who plumed themselves on holding the opinions of the French philosophy . Just before the close of the last century there were only four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There seems to have been a prevalent dread of religion and unpopularity in professing it . The " insane extravagances , " as an evangelical writer calls them , which had attended the revivals of the eighteenth century had brought religion into doubt and odium . The attendance at church at this time must have been small . Whereas now there are nearly three ministers to each two thousand of the population , there was then only one minister to the same number . Many churches were without settled ministers . There were sections of the country in the new settlements // almost without churches and often with a coarse , low and immoral population . Finney , the noted revivalist , whose parents moved to Oneida County , New York , when he was two years old , says that up to the age of twenty-six he never lived in a " praying , " that is , a religious , community , except when at school in Connecticut . Neither did the dull and formal preaching there interest him in the least . He taught school in New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermons in English in three years . When finally he began the practice of law in a New York town and attended a Presbyterian church , he saw no evidence that the minister was " converted , " so dry , lifeless and mechanical were his sermons . This condition of things had its roots far back , as early as the settlement of New England . All the evidence goes to show that there was never a golden age in the religious history of Massachusetts . Heroic as the men were who exiled themselves for conscience sake from comfortable English livings to the wilderness of the new world , the pitiable story of Williams and Wheelwright and President Dunster and Anne Hutchinson shows the dogged narrowness and disputatiousness of the average piety of the early colonists . It may have been a religion after the standard of Samuel and Elijah , but these strenuous Boston saints had not yet discovered what Professor Drummond finely characterizes as " the greatest thing in the world . " Even such saints as these were only the few out of the whole body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as fifteen hundred ) who came to Boston with Governor Winthrop , we presently find but sixty-four men and half as many women to constitute the First Church in Boston . With the colonists who came for the sake of religion came over many others , servants and hirelings . Men came to seek their fortunes by fishing , farming and trade . Some are spoken of as " depraved men , ' ' whom a spirit of wild adventure had brought , like our western frontiersmen . There has always been a sturdy secular strain in our English stock , that has never been really converted to Christianity from the days of our heathen ancestors . Such were the men in many a parish , who had to be compelled to go to church by laws and fines , so irksome was the support of other people 's religion . By all accounts , the general level of morals and religion seems to have lapsed after the first more intense Puritan generation . Search the old parish records . Read the kind of coarse offences for which church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arrears for their ministers ' stipends , or levying their brutal tax on the cows of unwilling parishioners . Read the bills for rum at parish festivities . Presently we hear of a terrible crop of drunkards among the deacons and ministers . Yes , there was chronic need of some kind of revival both of morals and religion when the nineteenth century dawned . The need was all the more pressingly felt because of the industrial and commercial depression which had followed the war . It is in such periods that men 's attention is more readily called to the consideration of religion . There is always present in society , unless it has sunk into hopeless decay , more or less elastic moral fibre . It might easily be shown that the leaders of the evangelical movement came of this superior moral stock . In one of the most interesting chapters in the life of Horace Bushnell , he describes the better side of the " homespun " farmhouse life - very plain , but pure and earnest - in which he spent his boyhood . In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latent , waiting to be stirred and used . The evangelical system of doctrine was specially adapted to stimulate it . It emphasized two great facts , - the profound moral need of the times and the ideal of a new and higher life . It preached sin and it pointed to a God who , though stern , was conceived of as infinitely righteous . It also urged the necessity of immediate action . Certain*thinkers and theologians were heralds of the new movement . Dr. Samuel Hopkins , the minister of Newport , Rhode Island , and Dr. Emmons , minister of the little town of Franklin , // Massachusetts , exerted in their day a prodigious influence through their published works . Both of them taught a system of doctrine precisely calculated to produce a quite soldierly type of consecrated character among their disciples . All who could pass Dr. Hopkins 's test of conversion must be ready to be " damned for the glory of God . " These men were not only logicians ; they were both brave pioneers in attacking the barbarism of slavery . Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1795 Timothy Dwight took the presidency of Yale College . The college , which had been lately graduating men who despised religion , now began to send out ministers and missionaries by the score . No one could come under the teaching of this earnest president and not respect the sincerity of his religion . Lyman Beecher was one of his students . Though of the stanchest moral character from birth , he experienced such a religious awakening that he writes of his previous condition that he had been as " ignorant as a beast of the state of his heart . " It seemed to him as though he was on the verge of a new era . " I felt , " he says , " as if the conversion of the world to Christ was near . " His first settlement was over a Presbyterian church on Long Island . In i8io he became minister of the Congregational church in Litchfield , Connecticut . He was called in 1826 to combat Unitarianism from the pulpit of the Hanover Street Church in Boston . Wherever he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often quite shallow minds , who had only known the negation of religion in the lifeless formalism of the average preaching , or the fanaticism of occasional ranters , had a new problem presented in the obvious genuineness , heartiness and comparative humanity of this fresh type of religion . Whatever we think of his methods or doctrines , here was effective dynamite , precisely calculated to produce moral and spiritual upheaval . There can be no doubt that New England was distinctly purer and more vital for the work of the men of whom Lyman Beecher stands as a conspicuous type . Finney , who began to preach in 182 i , was even more direct and untrammelled by conventionalities . He was educated as a lawyer and had entered the bar before his conversion . Renouncing the prospects of his profession , he at once began to preach , without any theological training beyond what he found in his Bible read in the light of his Presbyterian traditions . In fact , he was under continual suspicion of heresy and Arminianism on the part of more regularly educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Theodore D. Weld , a well-known Unitarian , who knew him intimately , says that he never saw his equal , not only for logical argument and moving eloquence , but even more for humanity , disinterestedness and the utter unconsciousness of self . He assures us that Mr. Finney 's preaching was attended with wide-reaching and most beneficent moral results . Finney insisted on reality . Religion ought to mark a conscious difference in a man 's character , his interests and the purpose of his life . Wherever Mr. Finney 's influence went , among lawyers , business men , students , ministers , he helped to set new standards . Himself an ardent and fearless antislavery reformer , a founder of Oberlin College , - free to blacks and whites , men and women , - he helped effectively toward training the conscience of the generation which by the blood and tears of the Civil War put an end to American slavery . All along the line the evangelical movement was marked by the advancing banners of humanitarian reform . Already in 1812 Lyman Beecher with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinking habits of the age , was at work to rouse public sentiment to form the first temperance societies in western Massachusetts and Connecticut . Wherever revivals were , the new standard of temperance went also . The Massachusetts Missionary Society was started in i ' * ' ** in behalf of the more sparsely settled towns and the new settlements in the district of Maine . " Father Sewall " of Maine was an example of the sturdy pioneer minister , like an ancient prophet , who traversed a great preaching // circuit of scattered hamlets and was known as one of the characters of his day . In his case the smallest possible cost paid for the utmost missionary service . The Boston City Missionary Society was founded in 1816 . Other similar societies to care for the poor and destitute in the large towns followed . Before the opening of the century Bibles had been comparatively scarce and costly ; multitudes of families possessed no Bible . In 1804 the Bible Society was formed and began to work out the farreaching purpose that a Bible should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of most pioneers , the early efforts of John Eliot and the Mayhews to Christianize the Indians had seemed pathetically to fail . In i8io , despite the general indifference of church members and ministers , a few devoted people established the American Board , a society designed never to rest from its labors while an isle of the sea remained without its gospel . It sounded its call for volunteers to give their lives to exile and the unknown risks of foreign climates and barbarous nations . Children were brought up in thousands of homes on the stories of men and women , like Lyman , the martyr of Sumatra , who were braving death for the sake of their religion . Generosity , chivalry , consecration and loyalty were developed and stimulated by constantly growing demands . Meanwhile the rapid growth of the country called for renewed activity in home missionary work and church extension . The American Home Missionary Society was founded in 1826 . The American Missionary Association was started in 1846 by men of decided antislavery sentiment . Since the Civil War it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These and other societies have served to diffuse the New England spirit of energy and moral vigor , and have been very liberally sustained by New England men and money . The traditions of the Puritan churches had always favored a thorough education . The Protestant Reformation indeed had tended to much speculation and theorizing . For want of other subjects of thought the early New England mind had struggled especially with dogmatic studies . Besides the preachers like Beecher and Finney , were the theologians as Emmons and Hopkins , who formulated systems of doctrine and gathered groups of disciples about them . As early as 1807 , however , the deepening evangelical movement seemed to require a special school for the training of strictly and devotedly orthodox ministers . The Andover Theological School was founded with this distinct purpose . Other similar schools were established later at New Haven , Hartford , East Windsor , Bangor and Oberlin . Colleges , as Amherst and Williams , were also endowed to throw decided evangelical influences around student life . Revivals have been a common feature in the history of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education from the first with reference to their cardinal purpose of converting men to be Christians . The establishment of Sunday schools may be considered a part of the great general humanitarian movement of the century . The growing sentiment of kindliness demanded first that better care should be taken of the children of the poor . It was seen too that whatever was to be done for the grown man must be begun with the child . The evangelical purpose has seized upon this obvious principle . The Sunday school has therefore been carefully organized to make Christians of the children , and so to reenforce the church . It has been held that the teachers and officers should be converted persons themselves , and that the test of their success is in the conversion of their classes . A great and elaborate system has been gradually built up with international series of Bible lessons to make the Sunday school more effective . All is subservient to the one master purpose . The work is extended to remote prairie settlements and to the islands on the coast of Maine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with marvellous rapidity . Their intent is specially to interest the young in the Christian life . // The individual society is a sort of young people 's church in which boys and girls learn the conduct of prayer meetings . The prayer meeting has always been one of the characteristic features of the evangelical movement . It was more democratic than the regular church service . With frequent singing and extempore exhortation and prayer , its informal methods tended to the expression of religious feeling . Its chief end was to foster the religious life ; the burden of its prayers was to receive " an outpouring of the Spirit ; " its results were measured by revivals and conversions and the numbers of those brought into the church . At the lowest ebb of religious vitality the prayer meeting served to bring together the little nucleus of men and women who might pray and work for a revival . If at times it has been made a hotbed to force the growth of a spiritual feeling , it has at least stood for actual effort put forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of their faith . We have treated the evangelical movement so far mainly with reference to the Congregational body , with the history of which it has been longest associated in New England . The Presbyterians had established themselves in the middle states and in the South early in the colonial period , and among much the same class of settlers as the Congregationalists of New England . The history of the development of the evangelical spirit among them is like the history of the Congregationalists . It goes back to the same general pietistic movement in which Edwards , Whitefield and the Wesleys were pioneer spirits . This movement was already well under way among the Presbyterians at the beginning of the century . There had been the same lifelessness among them as in other religious bodies . It appears to have been unaccompanied , however , by any activity of thought . In New England , where Independency or Congregationalism had early occupied the ground and had proved to be congenial to the individualistic temper of the people , the more closely organized Presbyterian system has never flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Street Chutch in Boston , of which Dr. Channing was the minister , was started as a Presbyterian church , though it appears to have been too isolated to be able to stand alone amidst the peculiar influences of Boston . So far as New England Presbyterians have increased slightly in numbers , the gain has been due almost wholly to immigration from Scotland and from Presbyterian communities in the provinces of the Dominion . Methodists had been regularly organized in America a little before the opening oi the century . Their church was peculiarly an evangelizing agency with its mission to save souls . It had been driven out of the mother church of England because evangelical ideas and doctrines were incongruous with the loose discipline of the State Church . Its advent was not welcome to the staid , cautious and somewhat unenthusiastic " standing order " in New England . Nevertheless the earnestness , the humanity and self-sacrifice , the missionary zeal which unpopularity and opposition only quickened , the close discipline and splendid organization which Wesley had imposed , together with the essentially simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the ardent new type of religion , somewhat like the Salvation Army to-day , into frontier settlements as well as among the humbler cli'sses of the older towns . The Methodists were presently in every hamlet . Their methods and their warmer temper have also been a considerable influence upon all the other religious bodies around them . It is possible , on the other hand , that the cooler religious climate of New England has served to check the original Methodist ardor and lately to prevent any considerable growth in the churches of this section . The Baptists played the part of dissenters in the early New England life , and yet they were distinctly and consistently evangelical from the beginning , besides being independents in their organization and as simple as the Congregationalists in their worship . They insisted that the church member must be a regenerate or religious man . Otherwise baptism itself was a farce . No parents // nor godfathers could make one a Christian . The early Baptists had been poor and despised and often persecuted . This fact commended them the more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cushioned churches of old and wellto-do families . The Baptist churches of New England shared in the wave of religious enthusiasm that came in at the beginning of the century . But though their gain in numbers has been large and their meeting-houses are numerous , the conditions elsewhere , and especially in the South , have been more favorable to their progress . They have followed the usual evangelical methods such as revivals and prayer meetings . They have felt the force of the educational activity of the age , and in Brown University and Newton Seminary they command an excellent equipment for their ministry . It is not necessary to say much of other evangelical forms of faith such as the Free-Will or Arminian Baptists and the Christians , which have only a scattered holding in New England and comparatively slight influence upon the history of religious life and thought . It is hard to know how to class Roman Catholics and Episcopalians with respect to the progress of evangelical Christianity . These great communions hold the same general doctrines which make the creeds of the evangelical churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing could be more evangelical than the solemn wail of " the lost world " in its baptismal service . It has always had an evangelical element among its communicants and ministers . The early Puritan judgment , however , seems to be correct , that the practice of both these churches was fatal to the evangelical character of their creeds . They admit freely to membership on the ground of mere forms and sacraments , quite aside from the moral character of their communicants , and without inquiry whether the individual has become truly regenerate . They fail to make any actual distinction between the church and the world , the regenerate and the unregenerate . They do not therefore insist upon conversion or a personal experience of religion . In fact they have served as a check and incubus upon the evangelical movement . They have both provided an easy religion which lets worldly people off with a formal allegiance . The Episcopal Church in particular has permitted under its ample shelter the slow growth of a philosophy entirely opposite to evangelicalism . Thus the rather heterogeneous elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly life , which the comprehensive Unitarian organization provided for in eastern Massachusetts , were accommodated and welcomed in the well-established and fashionable Episcopal churches of Connecticut , New York and Virginia , precisely as the same elements have been comprised in the Church of England . Persons of sensitive nature have been let alone and not required to experience religion perforce on pain of eternal damnation , or to disclose their inner experiences in public meetings . The considerable growth , therefore , of the Episcopal Church in New England has largely followed the lines of wealth and fashion . Wherever the Englishspeaking race go , from Newfoundland to Australia , the Episcopalian finds himself in good company . His church has a dignified history , a time-honored creed and an orderly service . These facts make it obviously attractive to certain classes of persons . The rapid increase of the Catholic Church is for a different reason . This church in New England is almost wholly a foreign importation , brought over bodily through the coming of Irish , French and , later , Italians and others . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards the numerical and pecuniary growth of the evangelical churches . Their costly edifices , their millions of communicants , their Sunday schools in every neighborhood and settlement , their missionary operations dotting every continent , their Bibles sown broadcast in every language , their numerous and highly endowed colleges and theological schools , their flourishing newspapers of every shade of religious opinion , tell the well-known story . The Methodists alone in i 88o claimed three // and a half million church members in the United States . The evangelical membership had grown since i 8oo much faster than the population of the country . The various foreign missionary boards up to that date had received more than fiftyseven millions of dollars in contributions . 1-Jome missionary societies had received over seventy-two millions ; one hundred and sixty million copies of the Bible had been distributed . There has been no moral , humanitarian or patriotic enterprise which has not had tap roots in the evangelical churches . The more vital the evangelical type has been , the more its support could be relied upon in behalf of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought , effort , expense and sympathy for the young . The numerous buildings of the Young Men 's Christian Association in all our cities bespeak this growing interest . The great Chautauqua system for home education and reading is a sign of the same interest . Moreover the different evangelical bodies , which began the century with many jealousies , have been irresistibly drawing together by a common impulse and purpose . Efforts like the Evangelical Alliance looking toward closer organization may be as yet premature or superficial , but they mark the rising tide of brotherly feeling in which all share . We need to make certain important qualifications upon the success of the evangelical movement . It may have seemed as if this movement was the work of a multitude . Nothing could be a greater mistake . There was only one Lyman Beecher ; there was only one Finney . At every point the number of the men and women who thoroughly and believingly represented the evangelical faith was a little " remnant . " One of the speakers at the ordination of Dr. Spears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that his people were " made up of three sorts : the first were infidels , the second set were hypocrites , and , thirdly , there were a few Christians . " This was a brutal way of expressing the truth that evangelicalism , except for the moment of revival excitement , never carried the real belief or life of any but the few . The money and the generosity were always of the few . It seems a great sum that evangelical Christians should raise two or three millions of dollars in a year to save the souls of the heathen . It is not more than perhaps a quarter of a dollar apiece from each communicant . The nation whose Christian believers could raise for all its home and foreign missionary purposes possibly ten millions of dollars , spends seven or eight hundred millions in the same year for liquor . The story of the progress of evangelicalism has been marked by controversy and division . Again and again the supposed regenerate human nature inside the church has shown the old unregenerate symptoms . Even good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretics . Because the New Haven theological teaching was thought by many to be unsound , another expensive institution had to be started at East Windsor. * Revivals have been checked by dry doctrinal discussions , such as that which hung along for many years between old-school and new-school Calvinism . Even the coming of Mr. Finney into New England was vigorously opposed by Nettleton , another noted revivalist , as well as by Dr. Beecher . But Dr. Beecher himself aroused the suspicion of the Andover theologians . Thus the Church repeatedly got off the track of the great evangelical purpose . The real wonder is , in this material world , busy to get and spend and enjoy , with crude human nature and subtly mingled elements of ambition and selfishness , that a few men in earnest and disinterested , with a vital faith and a gospel , have been able to accomplish so much and to impart something of their moral and spiritual momentum to the multitudes about them . It is necessary to state briefly what relation the Unitarian or liberal movement in religion bears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies first came to take specific issue from their evangelical neighbors was not purely , if hardly at all , on account of mere dogmatic difference on Now removed to Hartford . // account of the Trinity or " the five points of Calvinism . " It will be remembered that such differences had subsisted within the Massachusetts churches for more than one generation . The real issue was practical rather than theological . The world is not made up of only two distinct classes of men , saints and sinners , the regenerate and the unregenerate . It is made up of many different grades shading into each other by imperceptible lines . There are the few bad at one end and the few good at the other extreme , with a great mixed , indifferent and unawakened mass between . Men are thus much like children in the various stages of school life . Piety itself is not of one type , but of diverse types . Besides the intense and emotional , specially susceptible therefore to revivalistic appeals , is a type of religion no less real as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its motions , less enthusiastic in expression , but equally faithful , conscientious and earnest . Besides those who can possibly point to the hour when they first wakened to a religious interest are others , like James Freeman Clarke , who can never remember the time when they did not feel the glad sunshine of their faith in God . These different types and statures can not be drawn down upon one Procrustean bed . As soon as the evangelical party pressed to require one type , not only of thought , but also of religious experience , there were mixed reasons compelling a differentiation of faiths . Some of these reasons , as in every human movement , were very poor . The merely formal people , the worldly and fashionable set who dreaded enthusiasm ; the indifferent class who are always advising to " let well enough alone ; " the busy secular-minded set , not without a vein of masculine common sense , whose most intelligible definition of religion is " that which pays one hundred cents on the dollar ; the men also of doubtful lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern moral requirements of any vital religion , - all these were natural broad-churchmen . There was intellectual reason enough for a new differentiation . The strict individualism of the exclusive party was on its way early in the century to meet the new and nobler social spirit - the idea of the solidarity of the race , unwilling to be saved alone , or saved at all by a process that damned the millions of the poor and ignorant . The curious evangelical system of doctrines was already drifting , like some tall polar iceberg , where a warmer atmosphere encircled it and began to dissolve its sharp lines . The irresistible zeilgeisi was breathing on men . A new science , new heavens and earth , a new philosophy , higher ethical standards and ideals were appearing . The men of the new generation must have a more righteous God to believe in than the God who had satisfied the ages of war and persecution . The few here and there already thought and saw this at the dawn of the century . Would that there had been enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character upon the Unitarian movement ! Perhaps some have supposed that the rise of Unitarianism produced an evangelical reaction . There were undoubtedly both action and reaction on both sides . But we have shown that the evangelical was the larger , stronger and earlier movement . Organized Unitarianism was mainly at first a reaction from this incoming tide . We have seen that all the more distinctive evangelical enterprises were already well launched long before there was a Unitarian association in 1825 . Read Mr. Frothingham 's book , " Boston Unitarianism , " if you want to know why it was not in the nature of the moderate and fastidious Unitarians of that period to take the aggressive . A writer in the C ' /iristian Examiner ( Unitarian ) , as late as 1826 , says that " Unitarianism was not heartily and intelligently embraced by one half of the Unitarian societies , nor by one third of the ministers of the other half . " The number of churches accounted Unitarian at this time was a little over a hundred in Massachusetts , with perhaps twenty more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances there was no missionary propaganda or gospel to be effectively presented in the face of the distinct message of the great evangelical party . // It has been assumed that IJnitarianism had a clear advantage in the possession of a large proportion of the wealth , the culture and the intellect of the older towns . The truth is , however , that the handling and Christianizing of wealth and intellect is the most difficult task that religion undertakes . The liberal movcment was destined eventually to prove that the best life of this world , so far from being opposed to God and religion , can only be won by religious men and understood from the religious point of view . Even now few appreciate the fine and arduous nature of this task or the earnest character of the faith which alone can accomplish it . Religious development was in too early a stage throughout the first half of the century for either party to work except blindly in this direction . The influence upon the evangelical movement of the legal decisions , as in the well-known Dedham case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as parish property , is a curious illustration of the working of the ethical laws in religious history . Whatever may be said of the technical legality of these decisions , they will scarcely stand the test of equity and the Golden Rule . That the Unitarian churches should have been content to abide such arbitrament shows the need that then existed of a higher moral standard and a truer Christian spirit . Though outwardly they seemed to profit by the appeal to the courts , it is easy now to see that they were the real losers in this unhappy and unbrotherly quarrel over houses and lands . Public sympathy was turned the way of the sufferers . The chivalry and generosity of the other party were stimulated , - the very qualities by which religion thrives . It is a pity for the Unitarian side of the record that no clear and persuasive voices were raised among them to require at least an equitable division of church silver and church funds . The peculiar differentiation between the orthodox and liberal parties served for a long while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which make a healthy church . The evangelical churches , wherever the great schism pre vailed , lost something in the qualities of thoughtfulness , wisdom and sturdy common sense to look religion , like every other subject , directly in the face and ask fearless questions of it . There was an evangelical reaction toward emotional excess ; there was a timidity verging close upon scepticism , fearful lest truth , if discovered , would depose faith . The advice to young men not to read certain " dangerous " books has been too common . The Unitarian churches lost in some instances a large share of the more intense and religious element . Some had scarcely any communicants left . But they had for a while a comparative excess of intellectual people , whose demand was for quiet , cultured and elaborate preaching . On one side of the gulf was the balance of enthusiasm , on the other side the balance of reason . No church could give the best results of religion where the balance of the great factors of life was thus violently disturbed . Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was likely to effect more , and if the main direction was right , to prove on the whole more beneficent also than the cooler reason without the life force of earnestness to drive the wheels of action . We are ready for an interpretation of the evangelical movement . Religion is a spirit . But like the pure light , it depends at every stage on the medium through which it shines . If it shines through clouds or fog , if it falls through ground or colored or poor and faulty glass , the light suffers accordingly . So with the spirit of religion . Men 's different theologies have been so many distortions , colors and prismatic effects that the varying human medium produced . Only the pure and transparent medium of perfect life in a perfect mind can present the white light of the truth both to warm and to shine . It is easy already to see the imperfectness in the medium . The grotesque doctrine of " triangularism , " for example , taught the triple damnation of man , first , by Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men inherit ; and , thirdly , by each man 's sinful acts . If a gleam of // truth got through this form of the teaching about sin , all to-day will agree that the medium was opaque with malarial fog . So with the Hopkinsian Calvinism , which taught that a Christian ought to be willing " to be damned for the glory of God . " Our generation , getting the same truth through a clearer quality of glass , translates it to mean that the true son of God must learn to scorn a merely selfish or idle immortality . It was impossible for men still possessed with the dry scholasticism into which the Lutheran Reformation lapsed , reared in the barbarous criminal codes of the eighteenth century , in whose veins ran the poison of rum , the slave trade and the witchcraft delusion , to furnish , except in rare fragments , the clear glass which religion needs to shine through . The evangelical theology fitted its age and the minds of the men who could hold it . It was a phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstitious men could receive . It is good to believe that in spite of its distortions it transmitted both light and heat . The history of evangelical Christianity has been the slow process by which men learned to get clearer glass to see the truth . They started with drawing exclusive lines , requiring one type of experience and insisting on a single kind of evidence of religious validity . But admission to evangelical churches has now become as easy as in the days of the half-way covenant . It is no longer a real and operative belief that true , just and benevolent persons , for the mere lack of passing the theological line of conversion , are enemies of God . The life of Horace Bushnell represents the appearance of " the new theology " in orthodox churches . We have here no timid Arminianism . The old Unitarianism of proof texts did not throw the ball of progress so far as this brave and radical thinker from the orthodox side . In many a pulpit and on the wings of the press of great religious papers the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , however , according to the degree of civilization and enlightenment of a community . It is not true in the South , where slavery kept back the progress of the spiritual life . It is not true among thoughtless and superficial people , who easily hold unreal forms of faith . It is not true of the John Wards of each age , unable to translate their own intense experiences into more than one local dialect . It is none the less true as the deeper movement of the age . Nothing can better illustrate the prevalent change from the stern and solemn preaching of Nettleton , with its tremendous and heart-rending requirements , than the easy and almost flippant revivalism of Mr. Moody . What is more to the point , the milder methods , the wider tolerance , the gentler persuasion , the humane treatment of sinners as erring children and not as rebels in arms , is an obvious success . The light and truth of God , manifested in the love of human hearts , was ever the essential " power unto salvation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium becomes clearer to carry the light , that the old differences , the distortions and colors in the glass , disappear . Through the purer glass all tend to see alike . What is better , they feel the same warmth . If it happened in the beginning of the century that the men on the liberal side got truth more distinctly , it is not certain that they got the heat rays better , if as well as the men on the opposite side . For besides the distortion that ignorance and narrow minds give to the light , there is an evil opaqueness that worldliness , pride and caste make to deaden the vital sympathies and quench earnestness . Thank God then for the pure enthusiasts , the glowing prophets , the men and women , always too feebly supported , of large and live humanitarian zeal , Channing and Parker , Tuckerman and Barnard , Samuel May and James Freeman Clarke , who , with many good men and true on the evangelical side , have given consecrated lives to help lift the level of faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the heat and the light to one focus .
