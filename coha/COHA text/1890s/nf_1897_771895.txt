What is said in the way of historical introduction , what is done in the course of the chapters in the way of rendering and grammatical explanation , all has this aim in view . The Epistle is handled throughout with the firm belief that it is an Oracle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart of one of the greatest of the sons of men ; and the Expositor 's aim accordingly is always , and above all things , to expound . To put it otherwise , his highest ambition is to call attention to the sacred text , and let it speak . May the Lord of the Apostle , of the Philippians , of ourselves , only grant that His mercy may rest upon this poor contribution to the exegesis of His inexhaustible Word . May it be permitted to throw a quiet light upon some of the treasures of this apostolic casket , to the help , in any measures , of the disciples of our day . Then will the Expositor indeed give thanks to the Master at whose feet he lays his work . RIDLEY HALL , CAMBRIDGE .

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY Characteristics of the Epistle  --  The Bible is ever young  --  Littera Scripta Manet  --  " This Same Jesus "  --  Philippi  --  How the mission church had grown  --  Where was the Epistle written ?  --  When was the Epistle written ?  --  " The word endureth " The Epistle of St Paul to the Philippians is , to careful and loving Bible-students , one of the fairest and dearest regions of the Book of God . It is true that the Christian who genuinely believes that " every Scripture is God-inspired " ( 2 Tim . iii . 16 ) , and who realizes that the " Divine Library " is nevertheless , and from a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be always on the guard against a mistaken favouritism in his Scripture studies . He will strive to make himself in some sense familiar with the whole Book , as a whole , and to recognize in all its parts the true Author 's hand and purpose . Yet it is inevitable that in this supreme Book , as in other books , though all parts are " co-operant to an end , " all parts are not equally important for the deepest needs of the reader . The reader therefore will have to be more familiar with some parts than with others . Acquaintance with the whole will indeed deepen insight into the part . But it will not supersede our study , loving and special , of the part which , in a degree and manner peculiar to itself , " is able to make us wise unto salvation , through faith which is in Christ Jesus . " The present simple Studies in the Philippian Epistle will accordingly be pursued with the desire to remember as we go the whole scriptural revelation of God and salvation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture in itself , containing in its few short pages a rare fulness of messages and teachings , meeting the inmost wants of the heart and the life . Amongst the Epistles of St Paul Philippians shines out with singular light and beauty . In such a comparison we scarcely need consider the great Epistles to Rome and Corinth ; their large scale and wide variety of topics set them apart . Nor need we consider Hebrews , with its difficult problem of authorship . Looking at the other Epistles , each with its own divine and also deeply human characteristics , we find Philippians more peaceful than Galatians , more personal and affectionate than Ephesians , less anxiously controversial than Colossians , more deliberate and symmetrical than Thessalonians , and of course larger in its applications than the personal messages to Timothy , Titus , and Philemon . Meanwhile it is as comprehensive almost as it is brief . It presents more than one important passage of doctrine , some of these passages being revelations of the first order . It is full of pregnant precepts for Christian character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . It discloses in a way of the utmost interest and significance the circumstances and experiences of the writer , and also , in a measure , of the readers . And the whole is suffused with a singularly sweet light of " joy and peace in believing . " It is written by one who was , as he wrote , at once resting and moving in the peace of God which passes understanding , and in the love of Christ which passes knowledge ; and what is felt in his soul comes out inevitably on his page . The letter , written in a prison , and addressed to a mission-church always exposed to insult and assault , yet seems in a wonderful way to call us " apart , to rest awhile . " " A glory gilds the sacred page , " the glory of the presence of the Lord in all His majesty of Godhead and nearness of Manhood ; in His finished work , and living power , and wonderful coming again . A peculiar sort of joy , which is impossible without at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow , rests and shines over the whole . It is the joy of the heart which has found at length " the secret of the Lord , " His hiding-place from the tyranny of circumstances and time ; the way how always to be of good cheer , naturally yet also supernaturally , not by a hard-won indifference to life , but by living , amidst everything external , " hidden with Christ in God . " Let us approach the beloved pages once again . They can never wear out ; there will always prove to be " more to follow . " Perhaps we have loved and pondered them for long years ourselves . Perhaps we have heard them expounded by voices silent now , " in days that never come again , " in chambers or in churches which we seem still to see , but which in fact have passed from us very far away . The heart is full and the eyes are wet as we look back . But the melancholy of the past has no permanent place in Bible-study . The Book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in it for our fathers is in it for us . And since He is in it , as He is in no other literature in the world , ( because no other literature is His Word Written , ) therefore it springs up to us ever new ; it is always contemporary with every generation of believers . Even so , come , Lord Jesus , and let us meet Thee in Thy Scripture now again . A very simple " Introduction " will suffice for our present purposes . These chapters make no pretension to be , in the technical sense , critical . I say next to nothing , for example , about the Authenticity and Genuineness of the Epistle . Let me only remind the reader that from the early dawn of the literature of the Church we have unmistakable testimonies to its existence as an apostolic Scripture . Ignatius and Polycarp , quite early in the second century , shew us that they have read it . A little later , in the " Epistle of the Churches of Lyons and Vienne " ( A.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria , and Irenaeus , and Tertullian , all in the second century , use it as " the sword of the Spirit " to assert truth and confute error . So it floats down into the broad stream of the patristic literature at large . Not till the rise of an ultra-sceptical criticism in quite modern times was Philippians ever seriously questioned as the work , in its integrity , of St Paul . And Baur 's objections , all due to an a priori theory , not to an impartial literary enquiry , have been repudiated even by critics even less orthodox than himself : Renan , for example . It is quite as certain , in a literary sense , that in Philippians we have the very words and heart of St Paul as that we have Addison in the papers signed C. in the Spectator , or Erasmus in the correspondence with Colet . And what a thought of strength and joy this is to the believer of our latter day ! Littera scripta manet . How impressive is the permanence of every written reflexion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it , even in the reading of a private letter to himself , written years and years ago ? We have St Paul speaking to us in this indelible page as really as if we were seated with him in " his own hired house , " and were listening as he dictates to the friend beside him . And as we recollect this , we reflect that all he is saying , all he has thus left written , is just so much testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ , contemporary , direct , inspired . When the words we are about to read were written , scarcely thirty years had passed away since the Son of Man died outside the gate of Jerusalem , and rose again . Perhaps my reader can not look back over thirty years , perhaps not over twenty , with conscious memory . But I can ; and beyond the thirty I can see a long vista of the still earlier past . Thirty years ago2 ;  --  at that time the great conflict between Austria and Prussia was preparing , the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany . I was then a master in a public school . The discussions of the impending war in our common-room , and the men who joined in them , are very present still to my mind ; certainly not the faintest haze of mythical change or disproportion has had time to gather over those scenes in the interval . With some differences , no doubt , the world of this day is yet essentially the same as the world of that day ; I certainly still , in my whole personal consciousness , am the man of that day , only somewhat developed in experience . Well , what the date of the battle of Sadowa ( Koeniggratz ) is to me , such was the date of the Crucifixion to St Paul , when he wrote from Rome to his dear converts at Philippi . And I venture to say that , while St Paul 's tone about the Lord of Calvary is of course immeasurably different in the highest respects from what mine might be had I to speak of the makers of European history of 1866 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as completely free from the tone of legend unreality , uncertainty . With the same entire consciousness of matter of fact with which I might write of the statesmen or generals of my early manhood , he writes of One who , in his early manhood , overcame death by death , and " shewed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs . " Only , there is this wonderful difference ; that for St Paul the Jesus Christ of recent history is absolutely One with the Jesus Christ of his present spiritual experience . The Man of the Cross is also , for him , the Lord who is exalted to the throne of heaven , and is also so related to the writer that Paul is " in Christ Jesus , " with a proximity and union which enters into everything . " In Him " are included the very actions of the disciple 's mind and the experiences of his heart . He is the Lord who lives in the inmost being of His servant , and who yet is also expected to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body into glory . The Christ of history , the Christ of the soul  --  it was " this same Jesus " then ; it is " this same Jesus " now . " Can length of years on God Himself exact , Or make that fiction which was once a fact ? Fix 'd in the rolling flood of endless years The pillar of the eternal plan appears ; The raging storm and dashing wave defies , Built by that Architect who built the skies . " 3 For me and for my reader may the two aspects of " this same Jesus , " the historical and the spiritual , ever combine in one mighty harmony of certainty ; faith 's resting-place to the end , " the rock of our heart , and our portion for ever " ; at once our peace and our power , in life and in death , and through the eternal day also , in which we shall need Him still in the experiences of heaven . What shall we say of the place to which the Epistle was sent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer , the bearer , the readers ; and of the occasion and the time ? Philippi now , so travellers tell us , is a scene of beautiful and silent ruin . Near the head of the fair Archipelago , amidst scenery of exquisite beauty , near the range of Pangaeus , now Pirnari , on the banks of the quiet Gangas , lie the relics of the once busy city , visited only by the herdsman and the explorer . By it or through it ran a great road from West to East , called by the Romans the Egnatian Way . The double battle of Philippi , B.C. 42 , when the Oligarchy fell finally before the rising Empire , made the plain famous . Augustus planted a colonia in the town . It thus became a miniature Rome , as every " colony " was . It had its pair of petty consuls ( duumviri ; the strategoi of Acts xvi . 20 ) and their lictors ( A.V. " serjeants , " rhabdouchoi ) . And it faithfully reproduced Roman pride in the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as almost every place then had ; but the Jews must have been few and despised ; their place of worship was but a " prayer-house " ( proseuche ) , outside the walls , on the river 's bank ( Acts xvi . 13 ) . We need not recount in detail the history of the first evangelization ( A.D. 52 ) of the difficult place . We recollect sufficiently the address to the pious Jewesses and proselyte-women in the " prayer-house " ; the conversion and baptism of Lydia ; the rescue of the poor girl possessed with the " spirit of Pytho " ; the tumult , and the trial before the duumvirs ; the scourge , the inner prison , the hymn at midnight , the earthquake , and the salvation of the jailor 's life and soul ; the message sent through the lictors in the morning , then the respectful approach of the magistrates themselves , and the retirement of the Missionaries " to another city , " along the Egnatian road . It is enough now to remember , what the very existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little mission-church planted amidst such storms , and in a climate , so to speak , full of possible tempests at any hour . In the Epistle , we arrive at a date some nine years later than the first visit of St Paul . Twice during that period , and perhaps only twice , we find him at Philippi again ; late in A.D. 57 ( Acts xx . 1 ) and early ( it was the sweet spring , the Passover time ) in A.D. 58 ; this last may have been a visit arranged on purpose ( in Lightfoot 's words : Philippians , p. 60 ) " that he might keep the Paschal feast with his beloved converts . " No doubt , besides these personal visits , Philippi was kept in contact with its Missionary between A.D. 52 and A.D. 61 by messages and by the occasional visits of the Apostle 's faithful helpers . But on the whole the Church would seem in a very large degree to have been left to its own charge . And what do we find as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough to need a staff of Christian ministers , " bishops and deacons , " " overseers and working-helpers " ( episkopoi kai diakonoi ) ; full of love and good works ; affectionately mindful of St Paul in the way of practical assistance ; and apparently shewing , as their almost only visible defect or danger , a tendency to separate somewhat into sections or cliques  --  a trouble which in itself indicates a considerable society . If we may ( as we may , looking at the ordinary facts of human nature ) at all estimate the calibre of Philippian Christianity by the tone in which the Apostle addresses the Philippians , we gather that on the whole it was a high tone , at once decided and tender , affectionate and mature . The converts were capable of responding to a deep doctrinal teaching , and also to the simplest appeals of love . Such was the triumph of the mysterious Gospel over place , and circumstance , and character ; the lily flowered at its fairest among the thorns ; grace shone and triumphed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil we indicated just above was present in the otherwise happy scene . When Epaphroditus crossed the mountains and the sea to carry a generous gift of money to St Paul , risking his life ( ii . 27 ) somehow by dangerous sickness in the effort , he had to carry also news of differences and heart-burnings , which could not but cloud the Apostle 's loving joy . The envoy found it needful to speak also of the emissaries of error who at Philippi , as everywhere , were troubling the faith and hope of the believers ; " turning the grace of God into lasciviousness " ; professing a lofty spirituality , and worshipping their appetites all the while . And side by side with them , apparently , might be found Pharisaic disputants of an older type ( iii . 3 , 18 , etc . ) . Such was the report with which Epaphroditus found his way from Macedonia to Rome . Where , in Rome , did he find St Paul , and at what stage of his Roman residence ? Our answer must begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not elsewhere , that Epaphroditus went . The reader is aware that the Epistle itself names no place of origin ; it only alludes to a scene of imprisonment . And this does not of itself decide the locality ; for at Caesarea Stratonis , in Palestine , as well as at Rome , St Paul spent two years in captivity ( Acts xxiv. 27 ) . Some modern critics have favoured the date from Caesarea accordingly . They have noticed e.g. the verbal coincidence between Herod 's praetorium ( A.V. " judgment-hall " ) of Acts xxiii. 35 , and the praetorium ( A.V. " palace " ) of Phil . i. 13 . But Lightfoot4 seems to me right in his decisive rejection of this theory and unshaken adherence to the date from Rome . He remarks that the oldest Church tradition is all for Rome ; that the Epistle itself evidently refers to its place of origin as to a place of first-rate importance and extent , in which any advance of the Gospel was a memorable and pregnant event ; and that the allusion to " Caesar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive as it might at first sight appear to be ) " can not without much straining of language and facts be made to apply to Caesarea . " If now the Epistle was written from Rome , during the " two whole years " of Acts xxviii. 30 , at what point in that period may we think that the writing fell ? Here again is a problem over which much thought and labour has been spent . A majority of opinions no doubt is in favour of a date towards the end of the imprisonment , so that Philippians would follow after Colossians and Ephesians . It is held that ( 1 ) the tone of the Epistle betokens the approach of a closing crisis for St Paul ; and that ( 2 ) it seems to indicate an already developed Christian mission work at Rome , as if St Paul had worked there some while ; and that ( 3 ) Epaphroditus ' visit can not be adjusted with any probability if we do not allow a good time for previous communications between Rome and Philippi . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisively . He holds that Philippians was the first of the " Epistles of the Captivity , " and was written perhaps within the first few months of the " two whole years . " Two of his reasons seem adequate of themselves to make this likely . The first is , that St Paul 's allusion to the profound impression made on the Roman Christians by his " bonds in Christ " ( i. 13 , 14 ) goes well with the hypothesis of his recent arrival as a prisoner for Christ 's sake , but not with that of his having been long present on the scene . The other is that the great doctrinal passage ( iii . 4-9 ) , where he repudiates " his own righteousness " and commits himself to " the righteousness which is of God by faith , " is evidently akin to the group of Epistles to which Romans belongs ; and that it seems more likely that the divine Inspirer , in His order of revelation , led His servant so to write while the occasion for the writing of Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different ( though kindred ) sides of saving truth dealt with in Ephesians and Colossians had become prominent in his teaching . With reason , I think , Lightfoot " can not attach any weight " to the argument from Epaphroditus ' visit , which may well have been planned at Philippi before St Paul actually reached Rome , and planned thus early on purpose , so as to reach him promptly there with the collected gifts of love . Nor are the allusions to a probable impending crisis in the trial before the Emperor important for the date ; for quite early in the imprisonment it may well have seemed likely that the case would be soon decided . As for the comparatively advanced state of Roman Christianity , the Epistle to the Romans is evidence enough that a vigorous and extensive mission-church , however it was founded , existed at Rome some years before St Paul arrived . I will venture then to take it for granted that it was some time in A.D. 61 , or at latest early in A.D. 62 , that Epaphroditus came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his illness , and then prepared to return to Macedonia , carrying this precious Letter with him . We seem to see the scene as he converses day by day with St Paul , and as at length he takes his leave , in charge of this Message of " faith and love . " We see a large chamber in one of those huge piles of building , storey over storey , of which imperial Rome was full . The window looks perhaps north-westward , up the stream of the Tiber , towards the distant hills of which Soracte is the most prominent . The sentinel , perhaps himself a convert to the Lord , sits motionless at a little distance , chained to the Apostle . The saints pray , converse , and embrace ; and then Epaphroditus descends to set out for Ostia , or for Puteoli , on his way home to Philippi . " The grass withereth , the flower fadeth , but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever . " The graves of the blessed ones who worked for the heavenly Master then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letter to Philippi is to-day as new as ever . It is addressed to us , that we too may " believe , unto life everlasting , " on " that same Jesus . " 1 Preserved by Eusebius , Hist .

We attempt first a translation of its first main section , interspersed with an explanatory paraphrase . This will be followed by a brief meditation upon one of the main " Lessons in Faith and Love " suggested by the section . Ver . 1 . +Paul and Timotheus , bondservants of Christ Jesus , to all the holy ones+ in union with +Christ Jesus who are living at Philippi , Overseers , Workers , and all+. 1 Ver . 2. +Grace to you , and peace+  --  all the free favour of acceptance and of divine presence , and all the repose which it brings , within you and around you  --  from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ , Vers. 3 , 4. +I give thanks to my God+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +over my whole memory of you ; always in each request of mine on behalf of you all forming and expressing+ ( poioumenos2 ) +that+ ( ten ) +request with joy+ ; Ver . 5. +on account of your participation with me in regard of the Gospel+ , your active co-operation with me , by prayer , by work , by gifts , in the Gospel work , Ver . 6. +from the first day up to this present .

But this is by the way ; I return to my joy and my Ver . 7. thanksgivings over you : +Even as it is just that I+ , I above all men ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( phronein ) +like this over you all , on behalf of you all , 4 because of my having you in my heart , as those who , alike in my imprisonment+ ( desmois ) +and in the vindication and establishment of the Gospel+ , the defence of it against its enemies , the developement of its truths and its power in the believing , +are copartners , all of you , of my grace+ ; my grace , the grace granted me , the glorious privilege of suffering and of doing as a Missionary of Christ .

So the Letter opens ; with greeting , with benediction , and then with an outpouring , of sympathies full at once of the warmest and tenderest humanity and of the inmost secrets of divine truth and life . It is a preamble beautifully characteristic not only of St Paul but of the Gospel . It illustrates from many sides the happy fact that there is nothing which so effectually opens human hearts to one another as the love of Christ . We are all sadly familiar with the possibilities of isolation between heart and heart . Poets have written with eloquent melancholy of our personalities as islands which lie indeed near together , but in an unfathomable ocean , over whose channels no boat has ever passed . Schools of pessimistic thought have positively affirmed that never really has one ego found its way into another through the hermetic seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others is but the action of our own mind within itself , occasioned by a blind collision with a something not itself , which we can strike upon but can never really know . Such lucubrations are artificial , not natural ; a distortion of mysterious facts , not an exposition of them ; the result of an arbitrary selection from the data of our consciousness , and then the treatment of the selection as if it were the whole . Quite apart from the Gospel , the facts of human intercourse are full of evidence to wonderful and beautiful possibilities of insight and intercourse between human spirit and spirit . But if we want to read the best possible negative to the gloomy dream of impenetrable isolation , we must come to the Lord Jesus Christ . We must make experiment of what it is , in Him , to know and love others who are in Him too . Then indeed we shall find that we can , in the common possession of a living Lord who dwells in our hearts by faith , see as it were from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . We shall find how wonderful is the friendship with one another to which the friends of Jesus are called , and for which they are enabled in Him . " IN HIM " : those words are the key to this deep , tender , healthful union , and as it were fusion , of souls . We have the truth which they convey prominent already in the Philippian Letter . It is addressed ( ver . 1 ) to " the holy ones in Christ Jesus . " That is to say , it comes to men and women who , taken on their profession , assumed to be in fact what they were denoted to be in baptism , were separated from self and sin to God by their union in covenant and life with their Redeemer . It regards them as personalities so truly annexed by Jesus Christ , in the miracle of converting grace , so articulated spiritually into Him , that no language short of this wonderful " in Him " will worthily express their relation to Him . Later ( ver . 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the fruit of righteousness " which they are to bear in rich abundance is to be borne only " through Him " ; He , the Vine , is the one possible secret by which they , the branches , can possibly be productive of the sweet cluster of " the fruit of the Spirit . " And between those two places comes a sentence ( ver . 8 ) where , just in passing , in a mere allusion to his own experience , the Apostle takes for granted this profound " continuity with Christ " in a peculiarly impressive way : " I long after you all in the heart of Jesus Christ . " As we have seen above , he regards himself ( not as an Apostle but simply as a believer ) as so " joined unto the Lord " that , if I may dare so to expand the phrase , the heart of Jesus Christ is the true organ and vehicle of his own regenerate emotions . The whole Scripture , and particularly the whole Pauline Scripture , assures us what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension or distortion of the humanity or of the personality of Paul . It means no absorption of his ego , and nothing whatever un-natural in either the nature or the exercise of his affections . His " homesick longing " to see the dear Philippian people again is quite as simple , natural , personal , as any longing he ever felt in his boyhood for his home at Tarsus when he was absent from it . Yes , but this personality , working so freely and truly in its every faculty , is now , by the Holy Ghost , so put into spiritual contact with the will and heart of Jesus Christ , who now " dwells in it by faith , " that the whole action moves , so to speak , in the sphere , in the atmosphere , of HIM . The love which passes so freely through and out of the believer to his brethren would not be what it is if the believer were not " in Christ . " He is still all himself ; nay , he is more than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed union has a genial and developing power upon its happy subject . But such is that power that it deeply qualifies the mental and spiritual action of the being who enters into it ; never violates but always qualifies . The fact , the experience , of course transcends our analysis . But it is not beyond our faith , nor beyond our reception and inward verification . " Thy love , Thy joy , Thy peace , Continuously impart Unto my heart ; Fresh springs that never cease , But still increase . " 7 Our immediate purpose meanwhile is not to discuss the believer 's union with his Lord , but to remark on this one precious result of it , the opening of his inmost sympathies to the sharers of the same blessing . We see that result displayed in all its brightness in this first paragraph of the Epistle ; and we shall see it to the end . In the particular case of St Paul and the Philippians it was indeed a remarkable phenomenon . Here on the one side was a man who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pharisaic creed , a creed which tended powerfully not to expand but to annihilate every sympathy which could touch " the Gentiles . " Here on the other side were people whose life and thought had been moulded in the proud political and national ideas of a Roman colonia ; no kindly atmosphere for the growth of affections which should be at once intense and comprehensive . But these two unlikely parties are now one , in the strongest and most beautiful union of thought and heart . If we may use again a word ventured just above , they are mutually ( not confused but ) fused together . Their whole beings have come into living touch , not on the surface merely but most of all in their depths . An interchange of idea , of sympathy , of purpose has become possible between them in which , while self-respect is only deepened and secured , reserve is melted away in the common possession of the life and love of Jesus Christ . The Apostle writes to his friends as one whose whole soul is open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexion are full of them . He not only prays and gives thanks for them but delights in telling them that he is doing so . He says without difficulty exactly what he is sure of about them , and exactly what things he is asking for them as yet more developed blessings . Above all , the name of Him who is everything to himself and to them flows from his heart with a holy freedom which is impossible except where the parties in religious intercourse are indeed " one " in Him . Seven times in these eleven short verses " Christ Jesus " is explicitly named ; as the writer 's Possessor ; as the Philippian saints ' Life and Head ; as the Giver to them , with His Father , of grace and peace ; as the Lord of the longed-for " Day , " that dear goal of hope ; as the mighty Sphere of regenerate family-love ; as the Cause and Condition of the Christian 's fruitfulness for God . His presence , as it were , moves in the whole message , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Writer and readers perfectly " understand each other , " for they both know Christ , and are found in Him . The same divine Cause tends always to similar effects . Unhappily it does not always act without obstruction  --  obstruction which need not be . There are no doubt obstructions to its action which are inherent in our mortality ; things which have to do really with physical temperament , or again with external circumstances which we may be helpless to modify . But the Cause , in itself , tends always to the effects visible in this noble passage of Christian affection . The possession and knowledge of Jesus Christ , in spirit and in truth , tends always , by an eternal law , to warm and open as well as to purify the human heart ; to anchor it indeed immoveably to God , but also to suffuse it with a gracious sympathy towards man , and first and most of all towards man who is also , in Christ , cognizant of the " free-masonry " of faith . Let this be our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The section which we have traversed is full of points of interest and importance otherwise ; but this aspect of it is so truly dominant that we may rightly take it for the true message of the whole . Let us welcome it home . Let us question ourselves , in presence of it , and before our Lord , first about our personal possession of the Cause , and then about our personal manifestation of the effects . Let us put to our own hearts some very old-fashioned interrogations : Am I indeed in Jesus Christ ? Is He to me indeed Possessor , Lord , Giver of grace and peace ? Is my life so lived and my work so done in contact with Him that through Him , and not merely through myself , " my fruit is found " ? Is His promised Day the goal and longing of my heart , as I submit myself to Him that He may perfect His work in me by the way , and watch over myself that I may meet Him single-hearted and " without offence " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life ? Is He the inward Power which colours my thought and gives direction and quality to my affections ? No answer which a heart fully wakeful to God can give to such deliberate inward questionings can possibly be an easy or " light-hearted " answer . The gladdest and most thankful utterance of such a heart will carry along with it always the prayer , " Search me , O God , and try my heart " ; " Enter not into judgment with Thy servant . " Yet we are assuredly meant , if we are in Christ , so to know the fact as to rejoice in it , and to be strong in it ; we are invited , without a doubt , so to know Him as to know we know Him , and to find in Him " all our salvation , and all our desire . " Let us not rest till , in great humility but with perfect simplicity , we so see Him as to leave behind our doubts about our part and lot in Him , and , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covet the developement of those results of possession of Christ , of union with Christ , which we have specially studied in the opening section of our Epistle . Let us welcome the Lord in to " the springs of thought and will , " with the conscious aim that He should so warm and enrich them with His presence that they shall overflow for blessing around us , in the life of Christian love . I do not mean for a moment that we should set ourselves to construct a spiritual mannerism of speech or of habit . The matter is one not of manufacture but of culture ; it is a call to " nourish and cherish " the gift of God which is in us , and to give to it the humble co-operation of our definite wish and will that it may be manifested in the ways commended in His Word . It is a call to desire and intend to " adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour , " in the outcoming of His presence in us in our tone , temper , and converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that a common faith and common love do subsist . If I mistake not , there is far too little of this at present , even in true Christian circles . A certain dread of " phraseology , " of " pietism , " of what is foolishly called " goody-goody , " has long been abroad ; a grievously exaggerated dread ; a mere parody of rightful jealousy for sincerity in religion . Under the baneful spell of this dread it is only too common for really earnest Christians to keep each other 's company , and even to take part in united religious work , and to be constantly together as worshippers , aye , perhaps as ministers of the Word and Ordinances of Christ , and yet never , or hardly ever , to exchange a word about HIM , heart to heart ; still less to " speak often one to another , " and share fully together their treasures of experience of what He is and what He has done for them . The very dialect of the Christian life has greatly lost in holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since a former generation in which this over-drawn fear ( it is a mere fashion ) of " phraseology " was less prevalent . It ought not so to be . Let us each for himself come closer to our eternal FRIEND , converse more fully with Him , " consider HIM " much more than many of us do . And then we too shall discover that " our mouth is opened , our heart enlarged , " for holy converse with our fellow-servants , in that wonderful interchange of souls which is possible " in the heart of Jesus Christ . " " Oh days of heaven , and nights of equal praise , Serene and peaceful as those heavenly days , When souls , drawn upwards in communion sweet , Enjoy the stillness of some close retreat ; Discourse , as if releas 'd and safe at home , Of dangers past and wonders yet to come , And spread the sacred treasures of the breast Upon the lap of covenanted rest . " 8 1 Sun episcopois kai diakonois . I render the words as literally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian ministry , but to remind the reader of the natural origin of the titles by which Christian ministers are designated . And it is important here to remember that our word bishop , while derived from episkopos , can not properly translate it as it is used in the New Testament . For episkopos is not used there as the special title of a superintendent pastor set over other pastors . Such superintendents , however the office originated , are found in the New Testament , and early in the second century are called distinctively episkopoi : but the term so used is later , on any theory , than the origin of the office . But I do not purpose in these devotional chapters to discuss at length such a question as that raised here . The reader should by all means consult Bishop Lightfoot 's Excursus in his Commentary on this Epistle , The Christian Ministry . The views advanced in that essay were , as I personally know , held by the writer to the last . 2 The middle suggests a certain fulness of action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ; the reference is to the work of works . 4 I give both the possible renderings of huper . Both would certainly be in place , as he thought of them and prayed and gave thanks for them . 5 The derivation is doubtful , but the idea of the word in usage is clearness , freedom from complication . 6 With some hesitation I assign to dikaiosune here the meaning of the righteousness of justification , as in iii . 9. 7 F. R. Havergal. 8 Cowper , Conversation . THE APOSTLE 'S POSITION AND CIRCUMSTANCES " Yield to the Lord , with simple heart , All that thou hast and all thou art , Renounce all strength but strength divine , And peace shall be for ever thine . " MME DE LA MOTHE GUYON , translated by COWPER . CHAPTER III THE APOSTLE 'S POSITION AND CIRCUMSTANCES PHILIPPIANS i. 12-20 Disloyal " brethren "  --  Interest of the paragraph  --  The victory of patience  --  The Praetorian sentinel  --  Separatism , and how it was met  --  St Paul 's secret  --  His " earnest expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body " St Paul has spoken his affectionate greeting to the Philippians , and has opened to them the warm depths of his friendship with them in the Lord . What he feels towards them " in the heart of Christ Jesus , " what he prays for them in regard of the growth and fruit of their new life , all has been expressed . It is time now to meet their loving anxieties with some account of his own position , and the circumstances of the mission in the City . Through this passage let us follow him now ; we shall find that the quiet picture , full of strong human interest in its details , is suffused all over with the glory of the presence and the peace of Christ . Ver . 12. +Now I wish you to know , brethren , that my position and circumstances ( ta kat eme , " the things related to me " ) +have come out , have resulted , +rather for the progress of the Gospel+ message and enter- Ver . 13. prise , than otherwise ; +so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militaris , +are become unmistakable+ ( phanerous ) as being +in Christ+ ; as due to no social or political crime , but to the name and cause of the Messiah of Israel , the Saviour of the world . This is the case in the +whole Praetorium+ , 1 in all ranks of the Imperial Guard , +and among other people in general+ ( tois loipois pasi2 ) . And Ver . 14. another result is3 +that the majority+ ( tous plaionas ) +of the brethren in the Lord+ , the converts of the Roman mission , +feeling a new confidence in connexion with my bonds+ , 4 animated by the fact of my imprisonment , realizing afresh the glory of the cause which makes me happy to suffer , +venture more abundantly+ , more frequently , more openly , +fearlessly to speak the Word+ , the message of Christ , of the Cross , of Truth , of Life . There is a drawback in this Ver . 15. welcome phenomenon : +some indeed actually ( kai ) for envy and strife , while others as truly+ ( kai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter5 Ver . 16. are at work thus +from+ motives of love , love to the Lord and to me His captive Messenger , +knowing+ that on purpose for the vindication+ ( apologian ) +of the Gospel I am posted+ ( keimai , as a soldier , fixed by his captain 's order ) here . The former from Ver . 17. motives of +faction+ , partizanship ( eritheia ) in a self-interested propaganda of their own opinions , +are announcing the Christ , not purely , thinking+ and meaning +to raise up+ ( egeirein , so read ) +tribulation for+ me in +my bonds+ ; as so easily they can do , by detaching from me many converts who would otherwise gather round me , and generally by the mortifying thought of their freedom and activity in contrast to my enforced isolation . Shall I give way to the trial , and lose patience and peace ? Must I ? Need Ver . 18 . I ? Nay ; +what matters it+ ( ti gar ) ? Is not the fiery arrow quenched in Christ for me ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , after all ; for it brings a gain ; it spreads the Gospel so much further ; so that to my " What matters it ? " I may add , +Only , in every way+ , fair or foul , +Christ is being announced ; and in this I rejoice , aye , and rejoice I shall+ ; the future can only bring me fresh reasons for a joy which lies wholly in the triumphs of my Lord , and can only bring fresh blessings to Ver . 19. me His vassal . +For I know that I shall find+ ( moi ) this experience +result in salvation+ , in the access of saving grace to my soul , +through your supplication+ for me , which will be quickened by your knowledge of my trials , +and+ through a resulting +full supply+ ( epichoregia : the word suggests a supply which is ample ) +of the Spirit of Jesus Christ+ ; a developed presence in me of the Holy Ghost , coming from the exalted Saviour , and revealing Him , and applying Him . Such blessing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( apokaradokia ) and hope , that in no respect shall I be disappointed ( aiochunthesomai : with the " shame " of a miscalculation ) , but that in all outspokenness+ ( parresia ) of testimony , whether in word or deed , +as always , so also now , Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether by means of life or by means of death+ . The passage is full of various points of interest . It is interesting , as we saw in our first chapter , in regard of the historical criticism of the Epistle . It gives a strong suggestion ( I follow Lightfoot in the remark ) in favour of dating the Epistle early in the " two years " of Acts xxviii . For it implies that the fact of the Apostle 's imprisonment was a powerful stimulant to the zeal of the Roman Christians ; and this is much more likely to have been the case when the imprisonment was still a new fact to them , than later . St Paul 's arrival and first settlement , in the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ) of a " prisoner of Jesus Christ , " would of itself give a quickening shock , so to speak , to the believing community , which had suffered , so we gather , from a certain decadence of zeal . But when he had been some time amongst them , and the conditions of the " hired house " had become usual and familiar in their thoughts , it would be otherwise ; whatever else about St Paul might rekindle their ardour , the mere fact of his imprisoned state would hardly do so . The passage is further interesting as it indicates one particular direction of the Apostle 's influence upon the pagans around him . It was felt , primarily , " in all the Praetorium , " that is to say , in the large circle of the Imperial Life-guards. 6 We gather here , with reasonable certainty , that from the Life-guards were supplied , one by one , " the soldiers that kept him " ( Acts xxviii. 16 ) ; mounting guard over him in turn , and fastened to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prisoner , at the other that of the sentinel . It needs only a passing effort of imagination to understand something of the exquisite trial to every sensibility which such a custody must have involved , even where the conditions were favourable . Let the guardian be ever so considerate and civil , it would be a terrible ordeal to be literally never alone , night or day ; and too often , doubtless , the guardian would be not at all complaisant . To many a man , certainly to any man of the refined mental and moral nature of St Paul , this slow fire of indescribable annoyance would be far worse to endure than a great and sudden infliction of pain , even to death . It is a noble triumph of grace when such a test is well borne , and turned by patience into an occasion for God . When Nicholas Ridley , for a long year and a half ( 1554-5 ) was committed at Oxford to the vexatious domestic custody of the mayor and his bigoted wife , Edmund and Margaret Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture to one whose fine nature had been used for years to the conditions of civil and ecclesiastical dignity and of a large circle of admirable friends . And it was a spiritual victory , second only to that of his glorious martyrdom ( Oct. 16 , 1555 ) , when the close of that dreary time found the once obdurate and vexatious Mrs Irish won by Ridley 's life to admiration and attachment , and also , as it would seem , to scriptural convictions. 7 But it was a still nobler result from a still more persistent and penetrating trial when St Paul so lived and so witnessed in the presence of this succession of Roman soldiers that the whole Guard was pervaded with a knowledge of his true character and position , evidently in the sense of interest and of respect . It must have been a course of unbroken consistency of conduct as well as of openness of witness . Had he only sometimes , only rarely , only once or twice , failed in patience , in kindness , in the quiet dignity of the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect , as the story passed from one to another . As a fact , the " keeping power of Christ " was always with him , and always used by him , and the men went out one after another to say that here was a prisoner such as never was before . Here was no conspirator or criminal ; his " bonds " were evidently ( ver . 13 ) due only to his devotion to a God whom he would not renounce , and whose presence with him and power over him were visibly shewn in the divine peace and love of his hourly life . We can please ourselves if we will by imagining many a scene for the exercise of that influence . Sometimes the Saint would be left much alone with the Praetorian . Sometimes a long stream of visitors would flow in , and for a whole day perhaps the two would scarcely exchange a word ; the Guardsman would only watch and listen , if he cared to do so . Sometimes it would be a case where ignorant and ribald blasphemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of God . Sometimes a really wistful heart would at once betray its presence under the Roman cuirass . Perhaps the man would attack the Apostle with ridicule , or with enquiries , after some long day of religious debate , such as that recorded in Acts xxviii. , and the silent night would see St Paul labouring on to win this soul also . " These ears were dull to Grecian speech ; This heart more dull to aught but sin ; Yet the great Spirit bade thee reach , Wake , change , exalt , the soul within : I 've heard ; I know ; thy Lord , ev'n He , JESUS , hath look 'd from heaven on me. * * * * * " A Christian , yes  --  for ever now A Christian : so our Leader keep My faltering heart : to Him I bow , His , whether now I wake or sleep : In peace , in battle . His :  --  the day Breaks in the east : oh , once more pray ! " 8 The passage before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very early rise of a separatist movement in the Roman mission-church , and on the principles on which St Paul met it . Extremely painful and perplexing the phenomenon was , though by no means new in its nature to St Paul , as we well know . It was a trouble altogether from within , not from without . The men who " preached Christ of envy and strife " bore evidently the Christian name as openly as their sincerer brethren . They were baptized members of the community of the Gospel . And their evangelization was such that St Paul was able to say , " Christ is preached " ; though this does not mean , assuredly , that there were no doubtful elements mingled in the preaching . Now for them , as for all the Roman Christians , he had every reason to regard himself as the Lord 's appointed centre of labour and of order . There he was , the divinely commissioned Apostle of Christ , at once the Teacher and the Leader of the Gentile Churches ; only a few short years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inspired and commissioned character , the greatest of the Epistles . Yet now behold a separation , a schism . That such the movement was we can not doubt . These " brethren , " he tells us , carried on their missionary efforts in a way precisely intended to " raise up trouble " for him in his prison . The least that they would do with that object would be not only to teach much that he would disapprove of , but to intercept intercourse between their converts and him ; to ignore him altogether as the central representative of the Church at Rome ; to arrange for assemblies , to administer Baptisms , to practise the Breaking of Bread , wholly apart from the order and cohesion which he would sanction , and which he had the fullest right to enjoin . All this was a great evil , a sin , carrying consequences which might affect the Christian cause far and wide . Is it not true that no deliberate schism has ever taken place in the Church where there has not been grievous sin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , or on both ? Yet how does the Apostle meet this distressing problem ? With all the large tolerance and self-forgetting patience which come to the wise man who walks close to God in Christ . No great leader , surely , ever prized more the benefits of order and cohesion than did St Paul . And where a fundamental error was in view , as for example that about Justification in Galatia , no one could meet it more energetically , and with a stronger sense of authority , than he did . But he " discerned things that differ . " And when , as here , he saw around him men , however misguided , who were aiding in the " announcement " of the Name and salvation of Christ , he thought more of the evangelization than of the breach of coherence , which yet most surely he deplored . He speaks with perfect candour of the unsound spiritual state of the separatists , their envy , strife , and partizanship . But he has no anathema for their methods . He is apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Apostle in Rome grace can be conveyed only through him ; that his authority and commission are necessary to authenticate teaching and to make ordinances effectual . He would far rather have order , and he knows that he is its lawful centre . But " the announcement of Christ " is a thing even more momentous than order . He can not stay to speak of that great but inferior benefit , while he " rejoices , aye , and is going to rejoice , " in the diffusion of the Name and salvation of the Lord . It is an instructive lesson . Would that in all the after ages the Church had more watchfully followed this noble precedent ! The result would have been , so I venture to hold , a far truer and stronger cohesion , in the long run , than we see , alas , around us now . What was the secret of this happy harmony of the love of order and the capacity for tolerance in the mind of St Paul ? It was a secret as deep but also as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Really and literally , Jesus Christ was the one ruling consideration for St Paul ; not himself , his claims , position , influence , feelings ; not even the Church . To him the Church was inestimably precious , but the Lord was more . And all his thoughts about work , authority , order , and the like , were accordingly conditioned and governed by the thought , What will best promote the glory of the Lord who loved us and gave Himself for us ? If even a separatist propaganda will extend the knowledge of HIM , His servant can rejoice , not in the separatism , not in the unhappy spirit which prompted it , but in the extension of the reign of Jesus Christ in the human hearts which need Him . Surely , even in our own day , with its immemorial complications of the question of exterior order , it will tend more than anything else to straighten the crooked places and level the rough places , if we look , from every side , on the glory of the blessed Name as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy of the Saviour in the thoughts of St Paul about the Church leads us to a view , as we close , of that supremacy in all his thoughts about his own life . Our paragraph ends with the words which anticipate a great blessing , a new developement of " salvation , " in the writer 's soul , in answer to the believing prayers of the Philippians ; and then comes the thought that this result will carry out his dearest personal ambition  --  " that Christ may be magnified in my body , whether by life or by death . " Let us take up those final words for a simple study , before God . " According to my eager expectation , " my apokaradokia , my waiting and watching , with outstretched head , for some keenly wished-for arrival , or attainment . Such is this man 's thought and feeling with regard to the " magnification " of Christ through his life and death . It is his " hope , " it is his absorbing " expectation . " It is to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and over which he lingers as he prepares to sleep at night . It is the animating inner interest which gives its zest to life . What art is to the ambitious and successful painter , what literature is to the man who loves it for its own sake and whose books have begun to take the world , what athletic toil and triumph is to the youth in his splendid prime , what the fact of extending and wealth-winning enterprise is to the man conscious of mercantile capacity  --  all this , only very much more , is the " magnification of Christ in his body " to the prisoner who sits , never alone , in the Roman lodging . It is this which effectually forbids him ever to find the days dull . Its light falls upon everything ; comforts , trials , days of toil , hours of comparative repose , prospects of life , prospects of death . It quickens and concentrates all his faculties , as a great and animating interest always tends to do ; it is always present to his mind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . It secures for him the quiet of a great disengagement and liberty from selfish motives ; it continually drives him on , with a force which does not exhaust him ( for it is from above ) in the ambition and enterprise which is for Christ ; giving him at once an impulse toward great and arduous labours , and a patience and loving tact which continually adjusts itself to the smallest occasions of love and service . Reader , this is admirable in St Paul . But after all , the ultimate secret of the noble phenomenon resides not in St Paul but in Jesus Christ . " It pleased God to reveal His Son in me " ( Gal . i. 15 , 16 ) . The man had seen his Saviour with his whole soul . And because of  --  not the man who saw but  --  the Saviour who was seen , behold , the life is lifted off the pivot of self-will and transferred to that of " the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . " The same " revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Pauls ; but the Jesus Christ of St Paul is absolutely the same , in Himself , for us . We will , in His name , place ourselves in the way of His working , that He may so shew us His fair countenance that we may not be able not to live , quite really , for Him as the enthralling Interest of life . Let us look at the words again : " That Christ may be magnified , " may be made great . In what respect ? Not in Himself ; for He is already " all in all " ; " filling all things " ; " higher than the heavens . " Such is He that " no man knoweth the Son but the Father " ; the mind of Deity is alone adequate to comprehend His glory . But He may be magnified  --  relatively to those who see Him , or may see Him . To eyes which find in Christ only a distant and obscure Object , however sacred , He may be made to occupy the whole field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telescope is directed upon the heavens , and some " cloudy spot " becomes , magnified , a mighty planet perhaps , or perhaps a universe of starry suns ; so it is when through a believer 's life " Christ is magnified " to eyes which watch that life and see the reality of the power within . Ah , have we not known such lives ourselves ? Has not the Lord been made very near to us , and very luminous , in the face of father , mother , brother , sister , friend , or pastor ? Have we not seen Him shining large and near us in their holy activities , and in their blessed sufferings , shedding His glory through all they were and all they did ? He has been magnified to us by saints in high places , whose dignity and fame have been to them only so much occasion for the exercise of their " ruling passion "  --  the glory of Christ . And He has been magnified to us also by saints in comfortless cottages , imprisoned upon sick-beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experience and to manifest the power of their Lord . May He make it always our ambition to be thus His magnifiers . But may He keep it a really pure ambition . For even this can be distorted into the misery of self-seeking ; an ambition not that Christ may be magnified , but that His magnifier may be thought " some great one " in the spiritual life . " In my body . " Because through the body , and only through it , practically , can we tell on others for the Lord . Do we speak to them ? Do we write to them ? Do we make home comfortable and happy for them ? Do we " meet the glad with joyful smiles and wipe the weeping eyes " ? Do we travel to those who want us ? Do we nurse them ? Do we think for them ? All has its motives in the regenerate spirit , but all has its effect through the body . Without brain , eyes , ears , lips , hands , feet  --  how could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no articulation to others , nor our death . " I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice . " So be it , for writer and for reader . Then blessed will be our life , as day by day brings ceaseless occasions for the pursuit of our dear ambition  --  " that Christ may be magnified . "  --   --   --   --  *** En holo to praitorio ( ver . 13 ) .  --  The word praitorion occurs in e.g. Matt. xxvii . 27 . Acts xxiii. 35 , in the sense of the residence of a great official , regarded as praetor , or commander . The A.V. here evidently reasons from such passages , and takes the word to mean the residence at Rome of the supreme praetor , the Emperor ; the Palatium , the vast range of buildings on the Mons Palatinus which has since given a name to all " palaces . " Bishop Lightfoot however has made it clear ( a ) that such a use at Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known ; ( b ) that the word Praetorium was a familiar word for the great body of the Imperial Life-guards ; and that it would probably be often so used by the ( praetorian ) " soldiers who kept him .

It never appears as a name for the great camp of the Praetorians , outside Rome at the east . 1 See note at the end of this chapter . 2 The A.V. rendering " in all other places " is obviously due to the belief that praitorion signified a place , not a body of men . 3 I thus convey the force of hoste , across the break we have made in the original sentence . 4 Literally perhaps , " relying on my bonds , " as a new ground for their assurance of the goodness of the cause .  --  It is possible to render here , " the brethren , having in the Lord confidence , are , in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the rhythm of the Greek is in favour of our rendering ( which is essentially that of A.V. and R.V. ) . 5 I adopt here the order of the Greek clauses which is best attested. 6 See note at the end of this chapter . 7 I venture to refer to my book , Bishop Ridley on the Lord 's Supper ( Seeley ) , pp. 54 , 55 , 72. 8 See the close of the volume .

The translation of our present section is completed . It has presented rather more material than usual for grammatical remark and explanation ; constructions have proved to be complex , contracted , or otherwise slightly anomalous ; and points of order and emphasis have claimed attention . But I trust that this handling of the texture has only brought more vividly into sight the holy richness and brightness of the design . Sentence by sentence , we have been reading a message of the first order of spiritual importance , as St Paul has spoken from his own experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , in his appeal to the Philippians , of the Christian 's path of love and duty . Let us listen anew to each part of that precious message . i . The Christian 's Happiness in Life and Death . In Adolphe Monod 's volume of death-bed addresses , his Adieux a ses Amis et a l'Eglise , one admirable chapter , the second , is devoted to the passage before us , Phil . i. 21-26 . From the borderland of eternity the great French Christian looks backward and forward with St Paul 's letter in his hand , and comments there upon this divine possibility of " Happiness in Life and in Death . " " The Apostle , " he says , " is asking here which is most worth while for him , to live or to die . Often has that question presented itself to us , and perhaps we , like the Apostle , have answered that ' we are in a strait . ' But I fear we may have used the words in a sense far different from St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we meant to say , ' I know not which alternative I ought most to dread , the afflictions of life , from which death would release me , or the terrors of death , from which life protects me . ' In other words , life and death look to us like two evils of which we know not which is the less . As for the Apostle , they look to him like two immense blessings , of which he knows not which is the better . Personally , he prefers death , in order to be with Christ . As regards the Church and the world , he prefers life , in order to serve Jesus Christ , to extend His kingdom , and to win souls for Him . What an admirable view of life and of death !  --  admirable , because it is all governed ( dominiee ) , all sanctified , by love , and is akin to the Lord Jesus Christ 's own view of life and death . Let us set ourselves to enter into this feeling ( sentiment ) . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it releases us from the miseries of this life , but above all because , even were life full for us of all the joys which earth can give , death bids us enter into a joy and a glory of which we can form no idea . We are then to consider death as a thing desirable in itself . Let us not shun what serves to remind us of it . Let all the illnesses , all the sudden deaths , all that passes round us , remind us that for each one of us death may come at any moment . But then life also is good , because in life we can serve , glorify , imitate , Jesus Christ . Life is not worth the trouble of living for any other object . All the strength we possess , all the breath , the life , the faculties , all is to be consecrated , devoted , sanctified , crucified , for the service of our Lord Jesus Christ . This crucified life is the happy life , even amidst earth 's bitterest pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste for ourselves and diffuse around us the most precious blessings . Let us love life , let us feel the value of life  --  but to fill it with Jesus Christ . In order to such a state of feeling , the Holy Spirit alone can transform us into new men . But observe ; it is not only that our spirit must be sustained , consoled , fortified ; the Spirit of God must come to dwell in us . We often set ourselves to work on ourselves , to set our spirit in order ; this is well , but it is not enough . We want more . Jesus Christ Himself must dwell in our hearts by the Holy Spirit . " My friends , let us reflect upon the character of the promises of the Gospel , and we shall see how far we are from possessing and enjoying them . May God open the heavens above our heads ; revealing all to us , filling us with all wisdom , granting us to see that even here below we may attain to perfect joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of victory . May He teach us how to gather up the blessings which the heavens love to pour upon the earth which opens to receive them . And so may He teach us to know that if earth is able to bear us down and trouble us , it is unable to quench the virtues of heaven , to annul the promises of God , or to throw a veil , be it even the lightest cloud , over the love with which God has loved us in Jesus Christ . " 13 " He being dead yet speaketh . " On his bed of prolonged and inexpressible sufferings Monod , called comparatively early to leave a life and ministry of singular fruitfulness and rich in interests , found in Jesus the inexhaustible secret of this blessed equilibrium of St Paul . And what a cloud of witnesses have borne their testimony to that same open secret , as the most solid while most supernatural of realities ! As I write , the memory comes up before me of a beloved friend and kinsman , my contemporary at Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life to him was full of the strongest interests and most attractive hopes , alike in nature and in grace . He had no quarrel with life ; it had poured out before him a rich store of social and mental blessings , and a large wealth of surrounding love , and the Lord Jesus , taking early and decisive possession of the young man 's heart , had only augmented and glorified , not rebuked or stunted , every interest . But a slight fever , caught in the Swiss hotel , was medically mismanaged , and when perfect skill was summoned in , it was too late . His mother came to her son on his sofa to tell him that he was not only , as he knew , very poorly ; he was about to die . In a moment , without a change of colour , without a tremor , without a pause , smiling a radiant smile , he looked up and answered , " Well , to depart and to be with Christ is far better ! " So the young Christian passed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the life it would reveal , was sweeter . And " the veterans of the King " say just the same . If ever a man enjoyed life , with a vigorous and conscious joy , it was Simeon of Cambridge . And till the age of exactly seventy-seven he was permitted to live with a powerful life indeed ; a life full of affections , interests , enterprises , achievements , and all full of Christ . Yet in that energetic and intensely human soul " the desire was to depart and to be with Christ . " It was no dreamy reverie ; but it was supernatural . It stimulated him to unwearied work ; but it was breathed into him from eternity . " I can not but run with all my might , " he wrote in the midst of his youthful old age , " for I am close to the goal . " It is indeed a phenomenon peculiar to the Gospel , this view of life and death . It is far more than resignation . It is different even from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is full of warmth , and sympathy , and all the affections of the heart , in both directions . The man who is the happy possessor of this secret does not on the one hand go about saying to himself that all around him is maya , is a dream , a phantasm of the desert sands counterfeiting the waters and the woods of Eden . He is as much alive in human life as the worldling is , and more . He cordially loves his dear ones ; he is the open-hearted friend , the helpful neighbour , the loving and loyal citizen and subject , the attentive and intelligent worker in his daily path of duty . Time with its contents is full of reality and value to him . He does not hold that the earth is God-forsaken . With his Lord ( Ps. civ. ) , he " rejoices in the works " of that Lord 's hands ; and , with the heavenly Wisdom ( Prov. viii. ) , " his delights are with the sons of men . " But on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were unpractical the dear prospect of another world . He is not foolish enough to talk of " other-worldliness , " as if it were a selfish thing to " lay up treasure in heaven , " and so to have " his heart there also . " For him the present could not possibly be what it is in its interests , affections , and purposes , if it were not for the revealed certainties of an everlasting future in the presence of the King . " He faints not , " in the path of genuine temporal toil and duty , because " he looks at the things which are not seen . " But now , what is the secret of the equilibrium ? We saw in our last chapter what was the secret of the unruffled peace with which St Paul could meet the exquisite trials occasioned by the separatist party at Rome . It was the Lord Jesus Christ . And the secret of the far more than peace with which here he meets the alternative of life and death is precisely the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no philosophy of happiness ; he has something infinitely better ; he has the Lord . What gives life its zest and charm for him ? It is , that life " is Christ . " What makes death an object of positive personal " desire " for him , matched , let us remember , against a " life " with which he is so deeply contented ? It is , that " to depart " is to be with Christ , which is " far , far better . " On either side of the veil , Jesus Christ is all things to him . So both sides are divinely good ; only , the conditions of the other side are such that the longed-for companionship of his MASTER will be more perfectly realized there . We might linger long over this golden passage . It would give us matter for more than one chapter to unfold adequately , for example , its clear witness to the conscious and immediate blessedness in death of the servants of God . We may ponder long what it implies in this direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " means " better " not than our present life at its worst but than our present life at its holiest and best ; for , as we have observed already , it is " far , far better " than a life here which " is Christ . " Whatever mysteries attend the thought of the Intermediate State , and however distinctly we remember that the disembodied spirit must , as such , be circumstanced less perfectly than the spirit lodged again in the body , " the body of glory , " yet this at least we gather here ; the believer 's happy spirit , " departing " from " this tabernacle , " finds itself not in the void , not in the dark , not under penal or disciplinary pain , but in a state " far , far better " than its very best yet . It is , in a sense so much better in degree as to be new in kind , " with Christ . " " Yes , think of all things at the best ; in one rich thought unite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and light ; Yet bind this truth upon thy brow and clasp it to thy heart , And then nor grief nor gladness here shall claim too great a part  --  All radiance of this lower sky is to that glory dim ; Far better to depart it is , for we shall be WITH HIM . " 14 ii . But even on this theme I must not linger now . Not only because " the time would fail me , " but because we have to remember that the main incidence of the Apostle 's thought here is not upon the blessedness of death but upon the joy of duty , the " fruit of labour , " in continued life . He looks in through the gate , not to sigh because he may not enter yet , but " to run with all his might , " in the path of unselfish service , " because he is close to the goal "  --  the goal of being with Christ , to whom he will belong for ever , and whom he will serve for ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He " knows that he shall remain , and that , side by side with " his dear converts at Philippi . And his " meat is to do the will of Him that sent him , and to finish His work . " The remainder of our chosen portion is altogether to this purpose . He has said enough about himself now , having just indicated how much Christ can be to him for peace and power in the great alternative . Now his thoughts are wholly at Philippi , and he spends himself on entreating them to live indeed , to live wholly for Christ ; and to do so in two main respects , in self-forgetting unity , and in the recognition of the joy and glory of suffering . " Only let them order their life in a way worthy of the Gospel of Christ . " " Only " ; as if this were the one possible topic for him now . This will content him ; nothing else will . He " desires one thing of the Lord "  --  the practical holiness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming as he has just come from " the secret of the presence , " felt in his own experience . Will they be watchful and prayerful ? Will they renounce the life of self-will , and entirely live for their Lord 's holy credit and glory ? Will they particularly surrender a certain temptation to jealousies and divisions ? Will they recollect that Christ has so committed Himself to them to manifest to the world that it is the " only " thing in life , after all , in the last resort , to be practically true to Him ? Then the Missionary will be happy ; his " joy will be fulfilled . " What pastor , what evangelist , what worker of any true sort for God in the souls of others , does not know something of the meaning of that " only " of the Apostle 's ? Then he passes , by a transition easy indeed in the case of the Philippian saints , to the subject of suffering . In that difficult scene , the Roman colonia , to be perfectly consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffer ; it must mean to encounter " adversaries , " such open adversaries , probably , as those who had dragged Paul and Silas to the judgment seat and the dungeon , ten years before . How were they to meet that experience , or anything resembling it ? Not merely with resignation , nor even with resolution , but with a recognition of the joy , nay of the " gift , " of " suffering for His sake . " Circumstances infinitely vary , and so therefore do sufferings . The Master assigns their kinds and degrees , not arbitrarily indeed but sovereignly ; and it is His manifest will that not all equally faithful Christians should equally encounter open violence , or even open shame , " for His sake . " But it is His will also , definitely revealed , that suffering in some sort , " for His name 's sake , " should normally enter into the lot of " all that will live godly in Christ Jesus . " Even in the Church there is the world . And the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however modestly and meekly , to worship its golden image . To the end , pain must be met with in the doing here on earth of the " beloved will of God . " But this very pain is " a gift " from the treasures of heaven . Not in itself ; pain is never in itself a good ; the perfect bliss will not include it ; " there shall be no more pain . " But in its relations and its effects it is " a gift " indeed . For to the disciple who meets it in the path of witness and of service for his Master amongst his fellows , it opens up , as nothing else can do , the fellowship of the faithful , and the heart of JESUS . 1 Observe the aorist infinitive , to apothanein , of the crisis , dying , contrasted with the present infinitive , to zen , of the process , living .  --  It may be noticed that the renderings of Luther , Christus ist mein Leben , and Tindale , Christ is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact a deep and precious truth . The Apostle is obviously dealing with the characteristics , not the source , of " living . " 2 Sunechomai : literally , " I am confined , restricted from the two ( sides ) " ; as if to say , " I am hindered as to my choice , whichever side you view me from . " 3 Literally , " having the desire " ; not " a desire , " which misses the point of the words . He means that his epithymia lies in one direction , his conviction of call and duty in the other . The desire , the element of personal longing in him , is for " departing . " 4 The Vulgate renders here , cupio dissolvi , as if analysai meant , so to speak , to " analyse " myself into my elements , to separate my soul from my body . But the usage of the verb , in the Greek of the Apocrypha , is for the sense given in our Versions , and above ; to " break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 5 Literally , " your progress and joy of the faith . " The Greek suggests the connexion of both " progress " and " joy " with " faith . " And St Paul 's general use of the word pistis favours its reference here not to the objective creed but to the subjective reliance of the holder of the creed . 6 Politeuesthe : literally , " live your citizen-life . " But in its usage the verb drops all explicit reference to the polites , and means little more than " live " ; in the sense however not of mere existence , or even of experience , but of a course of principle and order . See Acts xxiii. 1 , the only other N.T. passage where it occurs ; and 2 Macc. vi . 1 , xi . 25. 7 The words suggest to us that the Apostle might have written , more fully and exactly , hina ido , ean eltho , kai hina akouso , ean apo . But it is best to retain in translation the somewhat lax grammatical form of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , Eph. ii . 18 , strongly favour the reference of pneuma here to the Holy Spirit of God . 9 It is of course possible to translate synathlountes te piotei , " wrestling side by side with the faith , " as if " the faith " was the Comrade of the believers . But the context is not favourable to this ; the emphasis seems to lie throughout on the believers ' fellowship with one another . 10 Echaristhe : the English perfect best represents here the Greek aorist. 11 The Greek may be explained as if the Apostle had meant to write , echaristhn to uper Christou paschein , and then freely inserted the antecedent fact of to pioieuein. 12 Echontes : the nominative participle takes us back grammatically to the construction previous to the sentences beginning hetis eotin k.t.a. ; which sentences may be treated as a parenthesis . I have attempted to convey this in a paraphrase. 13 Adieux , ed. 1857 , pp. 10-12. 14 From the writer 's volume of verse , In the House of the Pilgrimage . " Lord , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; But give us still to find Thee near , And own us still for Thine . " Let us enjoy , and highly prize , These tokens of Thy love , Till Thou shalt bid our spirits rise To worship Thee above . " NEWTON . UNITY IN SELF-FORGETFULNESS : THE EXAMPLE OF THE LORD " Our glorious Leader claims our praise For His own pattern giv'n ; While the long cloud of witnesses Shew the same path to heav'n . " WATTS . CHAPTER V UNITY IN SELF-FORGETFULNESS : THE EXAMPLE OF THE LORD PHILIPPIANS ii . 1-11 Dissensions incident to activity  --  Arguments for heart-union  --  " No plunderer 's prize "  --  " The name "  --  The tone of the great passage  --  What the " Kenosis " can not be  --  It guarantees the infallibility  --  Doctrine and life  --  " Only thou " In the section which we studied last we found the Apostle coming to the weak point of the Christian life of the Philippians . On the whole , he was full of thankful and happy thoughts about them . Theirs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated by love to Christ , and it was evidently ready for joyful witness to the Lord , in face of opposition and even of persecution . But there was a tendency towards dissension and internal separation in the Mission Church ; a tendency which all through the Epistle betrays its presence by the stress which the Apostle everywhere lays upon holy unity , the unity of love , the unity whose secret lies in the individual 's forgetfulness of self . Such dangers are always present in the Christian Church , for everywhere and always saints are still sinners . And it is a sad but undeniable fact of Christian history that the spirit of difference , dissension , antagonism , within the ranks of the believing , is not least likely to be operative where there is a generally diffused life and vigour in the community . A state of spiritual chill or lukewarmness may even favour a certain exterior tranquillity ; for where the energies of conviction are absent there will be little energy for discussion and resistance in matters not merely secular . But where Christian life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power , there , unless the Church is particularly watchful , the enemy has his occasion to put in the seeds of the tares amidst the golden grain . The Gospel itself has animated the disciples ' affections , and also their intellects ; and if the Gospel is not diligently used as guide as well as stimulus , there will assuredly be collisions . Almost every great crisis of life and blessing in the Church has shewn examples of this . It was thus in the period of the Reformation , the moment the law of love was forgotten by the powerful minds which were so wonderfully energized as well as liberated by the rediscovery of eternal truths long forgotten . It was thus again in the course of the Evangelical Revival in the last century , when holy men , whose whole natures had been warmed and vivified by a new insight for themselves into the fulness of Christ , were betrayed into discussions on the mysteries of grace carried on in the spirit rather of self than of love . " We that are in this tabernacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of the believing individual ; they are true also of the believing Church . That which is perfect is not yet come . In the inscrutable but holy progress of the plan of God in redemption towards its radiant goal , it is permitted that temptation should connect itself with our very blessings , both in the person and in the community . And our one antidote is to watch and pray , looking unto Jesus , and looking away from ourselves . It was thus in measure at Philippi . And St Paul can not rest about it . He plies them with every loving argument for the unity of love , ranging from the plea of attachment to himself up to the supreme plea of " the mind that was in Christ Jesus " when He came down from heaven . He has begun to address them thus already . And in the wonderful passage now before us he is to develope his appeal to the utmost , in the Lord 's name . Ver . 1 . +If therefore+ , in connexion with this theme of holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as comfort+ , encouragement ( paraklesis ) , +in Christ+ , drawn from our common union with the Lord , if +there is such a thing as love 's consolation+ , the tender cheer which love can give to a beloved one by meeting his inmost wish , +if there is such a thing as Spirit-sharing+ , 1 +if there are such things as hearts+ ( splagchna , viscera ) +and compassions+ , feelings of human tenderness and attachment , through which I may appeal to you simply as a friend , and a friend in trouble , Ver . 2. calling for your pity ; +make full my joy+ , drop this last ingredient into the cup of my thankful happiness for you , and bring the wine to the brim , +by being2 of the same mind+ ( phronma , feeling , attitude of mind ) , +feeling+ ( echontes ) +the same love+ , " the same " on all sides , soul and soul together ( sympsychoi ) +in a+ Ver . 3. +mind which is unity itself+. 3 +Nothing+ ( muden , implying of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or party spirit ; 4 rather+ ( alla ) , +as regards your ( tu ) +humblemindedness+ , your view of yourselves learnt at the feet of your Saviour , +reckon5 each other superior to yourselves+ ; as assuredly you will do , with a logic true to the soul , when each sees himself , the personality he knows best , in the light of eternal holiness Ver . 4. and love . +Not to your own+ interests +look+ ( skopountes ) , +each circle of you , but each circle6 to those+ Ver . 5. +of others also .

" +And+ then , further , +being found+ , as He offered Himself to view , +in respect of guise+ ( scheati ) , in respect of outward shape , and habit , and address , +as Man+ , He went further , He stooped yet lower , even from Humanity to Death ; +He humbled Himself , in becoming obedient+ , 15 obedient to Him whose Bondservant He now was as Man , +to the length16 of death , aye+ ( de ) , +death of Cross+ , that death of unimaginable pain and of utmost shame , the death which to the Jew was the symbol of the curse of God upon the victim , and to the Roman was a horror of degradation which should be " far not only from the bodies but from the imaginations of citizens of Rome . " 17 So He came , and so He suffered , because " He Ver . 9. looked to the interests of others . " +Wherefore also God+ , His God ( ho theos ) , +supremely exalted Him+ , in His Resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of infinite love and approval ( echarisato ) , +the Name which is above every name+ ; THE NAME , unique and glorious ; the Name Supreme , the I AM ; to be His Name now , not only as He is from eternity , the everlasting Son of the Father , but as He became also in time , the suffering and risen Saviour of sinners. 18 In His whole character and work He is invested now with the transcendent glory and greatness of divine dignity ; every thought of the suffering Manhood is steeped in the fact that He who , looking on the things of others , came down to bear it , is now enthroned where only the Absolute and Eternal King Ver . 10. can sit ; +so that in the Name of Jesus+ , 19 in presence of the revealed majesty of Him who bears , as Man , the human personal Name , Jesus , +every knee should bow+ , as the prophet ( Isa. xlv . 23 ) foretells , +of things celestial , and terrestrial , and subterranean+ , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , men , and every other creature ; all bowing , each in their way , to the imperium of the exalted Jesus , Ver . 11 .

For the worship given to " His Own Son " ( Rom. viii . 32 ) , whose Nature is one with His , whose glories flow eternally from Him , is praise given to Him. 20 So closes one of the most conspicuous and magnificent of the dogmatic utterances of the New Testament . Let us consider it for a few moments from that point of view alone . We have here a chain of assertions about our Lord Jesus Christ , made within some thirty years of His death at Jerusalem ; made in the open day of public Christian intercourse , and made ( every reader must feel this ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assertion against difficulties and denials , but in the tone of a settled , common , and most living certainty . These assertions give us on the one hand the fullest possible assurance that He is Man , Man in nature , in circumstances and experience , and particularly in the sphere of relation to God the Father . But they also assure us , in precisely the same tone , and in a way which is equally vital to the argument in hand , that He is as genuinely Divine as He is genuinely Human . Did He " come to be in Bondservant 's Form " ? And does the word Form , morphe , there , unless the glowing argument is to run as cold as ice , mean , as it ought to mean , reality in manifestation , fact in sight , a Manhood perfectly real , carrying with it a veritable creaturely 98 obligation ( douleia ) to God ? But He was also , antecedently , " in God 's Form . " And there too therefore we are to understand , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living power , that He who came to be Man , and to seem Man , in an antecedent state of His blessed Being was God , and seemed God . And His " becoming to be " one with us in that mysterious but genuine Bondservice was the free and conscious choice of His eternal Will , His eternal Love , in the glory of the Throne . " When He came on earth abased " He was no Victim of a secret and irresistible destiny , such as that which in the Stoic 's theology swept the Gods of Olympus to their hour of change and extinction as surely as it swept men to ultimate annihilation . " He made Himself void , " with all the foresight and with all the freewill which can be exercised upon the Throne where the Son is in the Form of the Eternal Nature . Such is the Christology of the passage in its aspect towards Deity . Then in regard of our beloved Lord 's Manhood , its implications assure us that the perfect genuineness of that Manhood , which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this same morphe doulou , Form of Bondservant , leaves us yet perfectly sure that He who chose to be Bondservant is to us only all the more , even in His Manhood , LORD . Was it not His own prescient choice to be true Man ? And was it not His choice with a prescient and infallible regard to " the things of others , " to " us men and our salvation " ? Then we may be sure that , whatever is meant by the " made Himself void , " heauton ekenosen , which describes His Incarnation here , one thing it could never possibly mean  --  -a " Kenosis " which could hurt or distort His absolute fitness to guide and bless us whom He came to save . That awful and benignant " Exinanition " placed Him indeed on the creaturely level in regard of the reality of human experience of growth , and human capacity for suffering . But never for one moment did it , could it , make Him other than the absolute and infallible Master and Guide of His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many sides , with speculations about the " Kenosis " of the Lord which in some cases anyhow have it for their manifest goal to justify the thought that He condescended to be fallible ; that He " made Himself void " of such knowledge as should protect Him from mistaken statements about , for example , the history , quality , and authority of the Old Testament Scriptures . I have said once and again elsewhere21 that such an application of the " made Himself void , " heauton ekenosen , of this passage ( from which alone we get the word Kenosis for the Incarnation ) is essentially beside the mark . The Kenosis here is a very definite thing , as we see when we read the Greek . It is just this  --  the taking of " Bondservant 's Form . " It is  --  the becoming the absolute Human Bondservant of the Father . And the Absolute Bondservant must exercise a perfect Bond-service . And this will mean , amidst all else that it may mean , a perfect conveyance of the Supreme Master 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom God hath sent , speaketh the words of God . " The Kenosis itself ( as St Paul meant it ) is nothing less than the guarantee of the Infallibility . It says neither yes nor no to the question , Was our Redeemer , as Man , " in the days of His flesh , " omniscient ? It says a profound and decisive yes to the question , Is our Redeemer , as Man , " in the days of His flesh , " to be absolutely trusted as the Truth in every syllable of assertion which He was actually pleased to make ? " He whom God hath sent , speaketh the words of God . " The dogmatic treasures of this wonderful passage are by no means exhausted , even when we have drawn from it what it can say to us about the glory of the Lord Christ Jesus . But it is not possible to follow the research further , here and now ; this imperfect indication of the main teachings about Him must be enough . But now , in closing , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendour comes in . It is no lecture in the abstract . As we have seen , it is not in the least a controversial assertion . It is simply part of an argument to the heart . St Paul is not here , as elsewhere in his Epistles , combating an error of faith ; he is pleading for a life of love . He has full in view the temptations which threatened to mar the happy harmony of Christian fellowship at Philippi . His longing is that they should be " of one accord , of one mind " ; and that in order to that blessed end they should each forget himself and remember others . He appeals to them by many motives ; by their common share in Christ , and in the Spirit , and by the simple plea of their affection for himself . But then  --  there is one plea more ; it is " the mind that was in Christ Jesus , " when " for us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven , and was made Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model and motive for the Philippian saints ; for Euodia , and Syntyche , and every individual , and every group . Nothing short of the " mind " of the Head must be the " mind " of the member ; and then the glory of the Head ( so it is implied ) shall be shed hereafter upon the member too : " I will grant to him to sit with Me in My throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with My Father in His throne . " What a comment is this upon that fallacy of religious thought which would dismiss Christian doctrine to the region of theorists and dreamers , in favour of Christian " life " ! Christian doctrine , rightly so called , is simply the articulate statement , according to the Scriptures , of eternal and vital facts , that we may live by them . The passage before us is charged to the brim with the doctrine of the Person and the Natures of Christ . And why ? It is in order that the Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things of others , " for the reason that this supreme Fact , his Saviour , is in fact thus and thus , and did in fact think and act thus and thus for His people . Without the facts , which are the doctrine , we might have had abundant rhetoric in St Paul 's appeal for unselfishness and harmony ; but where would have been the mighty lever for the affections and the will ? Oh reason of reasons , argument of arguments  --  the LORD JESUS CHRIST ! Nothing in Christianity lies really outside Him . His Person and His Work embody all its dogmatic teaching . His Example , " His Love which passeth knowledge , " is the sum and life of all its morality . Well has it been said that the whole Gospel message is conveyed to us sinners in those three words , " Looking unto Jesus . " Is it pardon we need , is it acceptance , free as the love of God , holy as His law ? We find it , we possess it , " looking unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory and triumph over sin , capacity and willingness to witness and to suffer in a world which loves Him not at all ? We find it , we possess it , it possesses us , as we " look unto Jesus " risen and reigning , for us on the Throne , with us in the soul . Is it rule and model that we want , not written on the stones of Horeb only , but " on the fleshy tables of the heart " ? We find it , we receive it , we yield ourselves up to it , as we " look unto Jesus " in His path of love , from the Throne to the Cross , from the Cross to the Throne , till the Spirit inscribes that law upon our inmost wills . Be ever more and more to us , Lord Jesus Christ , in all Thy answer , to our boundless needs . Let us " sink to no second cause . " Let us come to Thee . Let us yield to Thee . Let us follow Thee . Present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so through a blessed fellowship in Thy wonderful humiliation we shall partake for ever hereafter in the exaltations of Thy glory , which is the glory of immortal love . 1 Koinunia pneumatos : " participation in the Spirit " ; sharing and sharing alike in the grace and power of the Holy Ghost . I venture to render pneumatos as if it were tou Pneumatos , having regard to the great parallel passage , 2 Cor. xiii . 14 , he koinonia tou hagiou Pneumatos . With a word so great and conspicuous as pneuma it is impossible to decide by the mere absence of the article that the reference is not to the ( personal ) Spirit . Kurios , Theos , Christos , are continually given without the article where the reference is definite ; because they are words whose greatness tends of itself to define the reference , unless context withstands . Pneuma in the N. T. is to some extent a parallel case with these . 2 Ina . . . phronute : my English is obviously a mere paraphrase here . More exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to be , " etc. ; words which come to much the same effect , but are less true to our common idioms. 3 To en phronountes : a difficult phrase to render quite adequately . We may paraphrase it either as above , or , " possessed with the idea , or sentiment , of unity . " But the paraphrase above seems most satisfactory in view of the similar phrase just before , to auto phronete . This phrase seems to echo that , only in a stronger and less usual form . The thought thus will be not so much of unity as the object of thought or feeling as of unity as ( so to speak ) the substance or spirit of it . 4 Kata eritheian : my long paraphrase attempts to give the suggestion that the eritheia might be either purely individual self-assertion or the animus of a clique . 5 Hegoumenoi : the participle practically does the work of an imperative . See Rom. xii . for a striking chain of examples of this powerful and intelligible idiom . 6 Hekastoi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause here , and certainly in the second . By Greek idiom , the plural gives the thought of a collective unity under " each . " 7 The Greek gives no verb . I have written " was , and is , " in the paraphrase , because the limitation of the reference of our blessed Lord 's phronema to the pre-incarnate past is not expressed in the Greek . 8 En morphe : morphe is imperfectly represented by our common use of the word " form , " which stands often even in contrast to " reality . " Morphe is reality in manifestation . 9 Uparchon : R.V. margin , " originally being . " The word lends itself to such a reference , but not so invariably as to allow us to press it here . 10 Arpagmon : the word is extremely rare , found here only in the Greek Scriptures , and once only in secular Greek . Strictly , by form ( - mon ) , it should mean , " a process of plunder " rather than " an object of plunder " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . The A.V. rendering here suggests the thought that our Lord " thought it no usurpation to be equal with God , and yet made Himself void , " etc . But surely the thought is rather , " and so made Himself void . " So sure was His claim that , so to speak , with a sublime un-anxiety , while with an infinite sacrifice , He made Himself void . 11 Isa Theo : the neuter plural calls attention rather to the Characteristics than to the Personality .  --  Through this whole passage we can not too distinctly remember that it occurs in the Scriptures , and in the writings of one who was trained in the strictest school of Pharisaic Monotheism . St Paul was not the man to use such terms of his Saviour and Master had he not seen in Him nothing less than the very " Fellow of JEHOVAH " ( Zech. xiii . 7 ) . 12 Eauton ekeose : Heauton is slightly emphatic by position ; I attempt to convey this by the words " by His own act . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transcriber 's note : page 98 is indicated in this text with " 98 " . 14 Labon : the aorist participle , in Greek idiom , unites itself closely in thought with the aorist verb ekenose just previous . The resulting idea is not " He made Himself void , and then took , " but " He made Himself void by taking . " The " Exinanition " was , in fact , just this  --  the taking the form of the doulos : neither less nor more . 15 Note again the aorist verb and aorist participle : etapeinose . . . genomenos. 16 The Greek , mechri thanatou , makes it plain that the Lord did not obey death but obeyed the Father so utterly as even to die . 17 Cicero , pro Rabirio , c. 5. 18 Bishop Lightfoot has well vindicated this reference of the onoma here . I venture to refer the reader also to my commentary on Philippians , in The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges . 19 Not " the Name Jesus , " but " the Name of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering , but the context , if I explain it aright , is decisive . " The Name " is still the Supreme Name , JEHOVAH , as just above .  --  " In the Name " should be explained , in view of the context , not of worship through but worship yielded to the Name . See Lightfoot for examples of this usage . 20 Chrysostom brings this great truth nobly out in his homiletic comments here ( Hom. vii . on Philippians , ch. 4 ) : " A mighty proof it is of the Father 's power , and goodness , and wisdom , that He hath begotten such a Son , a Son nowise inferior in goodness and wisdom . . . like Him in all things , Fatherhood alone excepted . " Nothing but the orthodox Creed , with its harmonious truths of the proper Godhead and proper Filiation of the Lord Christ , can possibly satisfy the whole of the apostolic language about His infinite glory on the one hand and His relation to the Father on the other . 21 In my Veni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a University Sermon quoted at the close of a little book published Easter , 1896 , by Seeley : Prayers and Promises . " Make my life a bright outshining Of Thy life , that all may see Thine own resurrection power Mightily shewn forth in me ; Ever let my heart become Yet more consciously Thy home . " MISS J. S. PIGOTT . THE LORD 'S POWER IN THE DISCIPLE 'S LIFE " O Jesus Christ , grow Thou in me , And all things else recede ; My heart be daily nearer Thee , From sin be daily freed . " More of Thy glory let me see , Thou Holy , Wise , and True ; I would Thy living image be In joy and sorrow too . " H. B. SMITH , from the German of C. LAVATER . CHAPTER VI THE LORD 'S POWER IN THE DISCIPLE 'S LIFE PHILIPPIANS ii . 12-18 " Your own salvation "  --  Stars in the midnight sky  --  Truth and holiness  --  The atonement and the indwelling  --  Mystery and need of the indwelling  --  Indifference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness  --  The witnesses and the martyr We have just followed the Apostle as he has followed the Saviour of sinners from the Throne to the Cross , and from the Cross to the Throne . And we have remembered the moral motive of that wonderful paragraph of spiritual revelation . It was written not to occupy the mind merely , or to elevate it , but to bring the believer 's heart into a delightful subjection to Him who " pleased not Himself , " till the Lord should be reflected in the self-forgetting life of His follower . In the passage now opening before us we find St Paul 's thought still working in continuity with this argument . He has still in his heart the risks of friction at Philippi , and the need of meeting them in the power of the Lord 's example . This will come out particularly in the fourteenth and fifteenth verses , where he deprecates " murmurings and disputings , " and pleads for a life of pure , sweet light and love . But the line of appeal , though continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine greatness of the love of the Incarnation has , during his treatment of it , filled him with an intense and profound recollection of the greatness of the Christian 's connexion with his God , and of the sacred awfulness of his responsibility , and of the fulness of his resources . So the appeal now is not merely to be like-minded , and to be watchful for unity . He asks them now to use fully for a life of holiness the mighty fact of their possession of an Indwelling God in Christ . The details of precept are as it were absorbed for the time into the glorious power and principle  --  only to reappear the more largely and lastingly in the resulting life . Ver . 12. +So , my beloved ones+ , ( he often introduces his most practical appeals with this term of affection : see for example 1 Cor. x. 14 , xv . 58 ; 2 Cor. vii . 1 , ) +just as you always obeyed+1 me , obey me now . +Not+ ( me , the imperative negative ) as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse , but now much more in my absence+ , ( " much more , " as my absence throws you more directly on your resources in the Lord , ) +work out , develope , +your own salvation+ , your own spiritual safety , health , and joy , +with fear and trembling+ ; not with the tortures of misgiving , not driven by a shrinking dread of your gracious God , but drawn by a tender reverence and solemn watchfulness , lest you should grieve the eternal Love . Yes , " work out your own salvation " ; do not depend upon me ; take your own souls in hand , in a faith and love which look , without the least earthly intermediation , straight to GOD and to Him alone. 2 For indeed He is near to you ; far nearer than ever a Paul could be ; " a very present help , " for Ver . 13. your safety , and for your holiness . +For God it is who is effecting+ ( energos ) +in you+ , in your very being , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +both your ( to ) +willing and your effecting+ , your carrying out the willing , for His+ ( tes ) +good pleasure 's sake+ ; in order to the accomplishment through you of all His holy purposes . Here , in this wonderful immanence , this divine indwelling , and in its living , operative power , you will find reason enough alike for the " fear and trembling " of deepest reverence , and for the calm resourceful confidence of those who can , if need be , " walk alone , " as regards dependence upon even an apostolic friend beside them . Live then as those who carry about with them the very life and power of God in Christ . And what will that life be ? A life of spiritual ostentation ? Nay , the beautiful and Ver . 14. gentle opposite to it . +Do all things without+ , apart from ( choris ) , in a definite isolation from , +murmurings and disputes+ , thoughts and utterances of discontent and self-assertion towards one another , grudgings of others ' claims , and contentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become+ ( genesthe ) , what in full realization you scarcely yet are , +unblamable and simple+ ( akeraioi , " unadulterated " ) , single-hearted , because self-forgetting ; +God 's children+ ( tekna ) , shewing what they are by the unmistakable family-likeness of holy love ; +blameless+ as such , true to your character ; +in the midst of a race+ ( geneas ) +crooked and distorted+ , the members of a world whose will always crosses the will of God who is Love ; +among whom you are appearing+ , like stars which come out in the gloom , +as luminaries+ ( phosteres ) , light-bearers , kindled by the Lord of Light , +in the world+ ; in which you dwell ; not of it , but in it , walking up and down " before the sons of men " ( Ps. xxxi. 19 ) , that they may see , and seek , Ver . 16. your blessed Secret ; +holding out ( epechontes3 ) , as those who offer a boon for acceptance , +the word of life+ , the Gospel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once telling and commending His message ; +to afford me+ , even me ( emoi ) , +exultation , in view of ( eis ) +Christ 's Day+ , in anticipation of what I shall feel then ; +because not in vain did I run , nor in vain did I toil+. 4 But let me not speak of " toil " as if I sighed over a hard lot , or wished to suffer less on your behalf . Ver . 17. +Nay , even if I am being poured out as a drink-offering+ ( spendomai ) +on the sacrifice and ritual+ ( leitourgia ) +of your faith+  --  on you , so to speak , as you in faith offer yourselves a living sacrifice to God5  --  +I rejoice , and I congratulate+ ( sugchairo ) +you all+ , on your faith and holiness , for which it was well worth my while to die as your helper and example . +And in+ Ver . 18. +the same way+ ( to de auto ) +do you too rejoice , and congratulate me+ , 6 as true partners with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause in our paraphrasing version , and sit down as it were to gather up and weigh some of the treasures we have found . i . We have had before us , in the whole passage , that ever-recurring lesson , Holiness in the Truth , as Truth  --  " the Truth as it is in Jesus "  --  is the living secret of Holiness . We have still in our ears the celestial music , infinitely sweet and full , of the great paragraph of the Incarnation , the journey of the Lord of Love from glory to glory by the way of the awful Cross . May we not now give ourselves awhile wholly to reverie , and feast upon the divine poetry at our leisure ? Not so ; the immediate sequel is  --  that we are to be holy . We are to act in the light and wonder of so vast an act of love , in the wealth and resource of " so great salvation . " We are to set spiritually to work . We are to learn that all-important lesson in religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man who " knows whom he has believed , " and is aware that he possesses " all spiritual blessing " ( Eph. i. 3 ) in Him . We are to rise up and , if need be , walk alone , alone of human help , in the certainty that Christ has died for us , and reigns for us , and in us . Our Paul may be far away in some distant Rome , and we may sorely miss him . But we have at hand Jesus Christ , who " took Bondservant 's Form , " and obeyed even unto death for us , and who is on the eternal throne for us , and who lives within us by His Spirit . Looking upon Him in the glory of His Person and His Work , we are not only to wonder , not only even to worship ; we are to work ; to " work out " our spiritual blessings7 into a life which shall be full of Him , and in which we shall indeed be " saved " ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " fear and trembling " of those who feel the blissful awfulness of an eternal Presence , we are to set ourselves , with the inexhaustible diligence of hope , to the business of the spiritual life . We are to bring all the treasures of a manifested and possessed Redeemer to bear upon the passing hour , and to let Him be seen in us , " Christ our Life , " always formative and empowering . ii . We have here in particular that deep secret of the Gospel , unspeakably precious to the soul which indeed longs to be holy  --  the Indwelling of God in the believer . It here appears in close and significant connexion with the revelation of the love and work of the Incarnate and Atoning Lord ; as if to remind us without more words that He who gave Himself for us did so not only to release us ( blessed be His Name ) from an infinite peril , from the eternal prison and death of a violated law , but yet more that He might bring His rescued ones into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mere compassion , which could set a guilty captive free . It was eternal love , which could not be content without nearness to its object , without union with it , without a dwelling in the very heart by faith . As if it was a matter of course in the plan of God , St Paul passes from the Cross and the Glory of Jesus to the Indwelling of God in the Christian , and to all the rest and all the power which that Indwelling is to bring . " It is God who is working in you , effecting alike your willing and your working ; for the sake of His good pleasure . " These are words of deep mystery . They contain matter which has exercised the closest thought of some of the greatest thinkers of the Church . Operatur in nobis velle ; " He worketh in us to will . " How is this to be reconciled with the reality , and in that sense the freedom , of the human will ? What relation does it bear to human responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labour ? Very soon , over such questions , we have , in the phrase of the Rabbis , to " teach our tongue to say , I do not know . " But the words appear in this context with a purpose perfectly simple and practical , whatever be their more remote and hidden indications . They do indeed intimate to us a reality and energy in the divine sovereignty which may well correct those dreams of self-salvation which man is so ready to dream . But their more immediate purpose is as simple as it is profound . It is on the one hand to solemnize the disciple with the remembrance of such an inward Presence , and on the other hand to make him always glad and ready , recollecting that such an inward Power is there , altogether for his highest good , and altogether in the line of the eternal purpose ( eudokia ) . For the while at least let us drop out of sight all hard questions of theoretical adjustment between the finite will and the Infinite , and rest quite simply in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willing and the doing . The willing is genuine , and is mine . The working is genuine , and is mine . My will chooses Him , and my activity labours for Him ; both are real , and are personally mine . But He is at the back ; He is at " the pulse of the machine " ; I , His personal creature , am held in no less a hold than His , to be moulded and to be employed ; His implement , His limb . Not very long ago I was in conversation with a young but deeply thoughtful Christian , who , placed on a difficult social height , was seeking with deep desire not only to " follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth " but to lead others similarly circumstanced to do the same . I was struck with the strong consciousness which possessed that heart , that the religious life must inevitably be a weary and exhausting effort on any other condition than this  --  " God working in us , to will and to do . " " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one can really do it ; no one can keep it up . But we must speak to them about the indwelling Spirit of God , about the Lord 's power in us ; then they will find that it is possible , and is happy . " Choris emou  --  " isolated from Me ( John xv . 5 )  --  ye can do nothing " ; and what seems our " doing " will , in such isolation , be only too sorely felt to be a weary toil . But let us accept it as true , at the foot of the atoning Cross , that the Indwelling of God in Christ is as much a fact as our pardon and adoption in Him , and we shall know something of the blessed life . Only , we must not only accept it as true , but use it . " Work out  --  for it is God who is working in you . " And , let us remember it once more , we shall learn in that quiet School not only a restful energy but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in its place , the priceless gain of the Christian . Our spiritual life is indeed intended to be social in its issues  --  but not at its root . We accept and thankfully use every assistance given us by our Lord 's care , as we live our life in His Church ; yet our life , as to its source , is to be still " hidden with Christ in God . " We are to be so related to Him , in faith , that our soul 's health , growth , gladness , shall depend not on the presence of even a St Paul at our side , but on the presence of God in our hearts . Let us cherish this blessed certainty , and develope it into experience , in these strange days of unrest and drift . That secret independence will do anything but isolate us from our fellows . It will make us fit , as nothing else could make us , to be their strength and light , in truest sympathy , in kindest insight , in the fullest sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God if we would be fully serviceable to man . iii . We have in this passage one of the richest and most beautiful expressions found in the whole New Testament of that great principle , that at the very heart of a true life of holiness there needs to lie the law of holy kindness . The connexion of thought between ver . 13 and ver . 14 is deeply suggestive here . In ver . 13 we have the power and wonder of the operative Indwelling of God . In ver . 14 we have depicted the true conduct of the subjects of the Indwelling ; and it shines with the sweet light of humility and gentleness . It is a life whose hidden power , which is nothing less than divine , comes out first and most in the absence of the grudging , self-asserting spirit ; in a watchful consistency and simplicity ; in the manifestation of the child-character , as the believer moves about " in the midst of " the hard and most unchildlike conditions of an unregenerate world . There is to be action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The disciple is to be aggressive , in the right way , as well as submissive . But the first and deepest characteristic of his wonderful new life is to be the submission of himself to others , " in the Lord , and in the power of His might . " We have this aspect of practical holiness presented to us often in the general teaching of the New Testament ; but seldom is it so explicitly connected as it is here with that other spiritual fact , the presence in us of the divine power . Perhaps our best parallels come from the two other Epistles of the Roman Captivity , Ephesians and Colossians . In Ephesians , the third chapter closes with the astonishing prayer that the Christian ( the everyday Christian , be it remembered ) may be , through the Indwelling of Christ , " filled unto all the fulness of God " ; and then the fourth chapter begins at once with the appeal to him to live " therefore " a life of " all lowliness , meekness , longsuffering , and forbearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence of thought in one noble sentence ( ver . 11 ) of the first chapter : " Strengthened with all strength , according to the might of His glory , unto all patience and longsuffering , with joy . " 8 In all three passages comes out the same deep and beautiful suggestion . " The Lord is not in the wind " so much as in " the still small voice . " Omnipotent Love , in its blessed immanence in the believer 's soul , shews its presence and power most of all in a life of love around . It is to come out not only in self-sacrificing energy but in the open sympathies of an affectionate heart , in the " soft answer , " in the generous first thought for the interests of others  --  in short , in the whole character of 1 Cor. xiii . The spiritual " power " which runs rather in the direction of harshness and isolation , which expends itself rather in censures than in " longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , and meekness , " is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostolic idea . Nothing which violates the plain precepts of the law of love can take a true part in that heavenly harmony . " On earth , as in the holy place , Nothing is great but charity . " 9 iv . Meanwhile the " charity " of the saints is not by any means the mere amiability which makes itself pleasant to every one , and forgets the solemn fact that we who believe are the servants of a Master whom the world knows not , the messengers of a King against whom it is in revolt . The Philippian disciple was to renounce the spirit of unkindness , of self ; he was to live isolated from ( choris ) " murmurings and disputings . " But he was not to hide the sacred Light , for the sake of so-called peace , from the world around . He was to " hold out the word of life " ; confessing his blessed Lord as the life of his own soul , and so commending Him to the souls of his fellows . He was to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As truly as it was to be his habit to live a life of sweet and winning consistency , it was to be his habit to offer ( epechein ) the water of life to the parched hearts around him , the lamp of glory to the dark and bewildered whom he encountered upon the difficult road . The truth and beauty of a life possessed by Christ was to be the basis of his witnessing activities . But the witness was to be articulate , not merely implied ; he was to " hold out the word ( logon ) of life " ; he was to seize occasion to " give a reason ( logon ) of the hope that was in him , with meekness and fear " ( 1 Pet . iii . 15 ) . To be , in his way , an evangelist was to be one main function of his life . In benignant and gracious conduct he was to be as a " luminary " ( phoster ) , moving calm and bright in the dark hemisphere of the world . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . He was not only to shine ; he was to speak . Here is one of the passages , by the way , in which the Apostle assumes , and stimulates , the " missionary consciousness " of the converts . It is remarkable that neither he nor his brethren have much to say in the Epistles about the duty of enterprises of evangelization , as laid upon all believers . The stress of their appeals is directed above all things on the supreme importance of holiness , at any cost , in common life . But a passage like this shews us how entirely they take it for granted all the time that the Churches would never concentrate themselves upon merely their own Christian life ; they would go out continually , with the beauty of holiness and with " the word of life , " to bring the wanderers in , and to extend the knowledge of the blessed Name . So , and so only , would their Apostle feel , in his prison at Rome , that his " running " ( edramon ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastoral " toil " ( ekopiasa ) for the souls of his converts , had not been thrown " into the void " ( eis to kenon ) . So , and so only , would his life and death of sacrifice for them be crowned with its perfect joy . Let him see his beloved converts living and speaking as indeed the Lord 's witnesses , and then with what inward " gladness " ( chairein ) , with what a call for " congratulation " ( sugchairein ) on their part , would he go out to death as the Lord 's martyr ! 1 Upekousate : the aorist . It gathers into one thought the whole recollection of his work at Philippi. 2 " There is not the slightest contradiction here to the profound truth of the Justification by Faith only ; that is to say , only for the merit 's sake of the Redeemer , appropriated by submissive trust ; that justification whose sure issue is glorification ( Rom. viii . 30 ) . It is an instance of independent lines converging on one goal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man is glorified because of Christ 's work alone , applied to his case through faith alone . From another point , that of qualifying capacity , and of preparation for the Lord 's individual welcome ( Matt. xxv. 21 ; Rom. ii . 7 ) , man is glorified as the issue of a process of work and training , in which in a true sense he is himself operant , though grace lies below the whole operation . " ( Note on this verse in The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges ) . 3 It is possible to render logon xoee epechontes , " serving as life ( to the world ) . " But it is unlikely . See Philippians in The Cambridge Greek Testament , Appendix . 4 The aorists obviously are anticipatory ; giving the review of the past as he will then make it . Cp. e.g. kathos epegnosthen , 1 Cor. xiii . 12. 5 " He views the Philippians , in their character of consecrated believers ( cp . Rom. xii . 1 ) , as a holocaust to God ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is his own life-blood , his martyrdom for the Gospel which he has preached to them . Cp . Num. xv . 5 for the Mosaic libation , oinon eis sponden . . . poisete epi tes holokautoseos . Lightfoot thinks that a reference to pagan libations is more likely in a letter to a Gentile mission . But surely St Paul familiarized all his converts with Old Testament symbolism . And his own mind was of course full of it ( Note here in The Cambridge Greek Testament for Schools ) .  --  This and Rom. xv . 16 are the only two passages where St Paul connects the language of " sacerdotalism " with the distinctive work of the Christian ministry ; and both passages speak obviously in the tone of figure and , so to say , poetry . 6 Chairete : sugchairete . The form leaves us free to render either indicative or imperative . But the latter is most likely in the context . 7 Soteria must here include not only final glory but the whole blessing possessed now and always in the Soter. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fulness of divine power in the saints is to result primarily not in ' doing some great thing ' but in enduring and forbearing , with heavenly joy of heart . The paradox points to one deep characteristic of the Gospel , which prepares the Christian for service by the way of a true abnegation of himself as his own strength and his own aim .

" O thou who makest souls to shine With light from brighter worlds above , And droppest glistening dew divine On all who seek a Saviour 's love , " Do Thou Thy benediction give On all who teach , on all who learn , That all Thy Church may holier live , And every lamp more brightly burn . * * * * * " If thus , good Lord , Thy grace be giv'n Our glory meets us ere we die ; Before we upward pass to heav'n We taste our immortality .

Our present section illustrates well the inexhaustible variety of Scripture . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some good sentences on this subject : " What varieties are in the Bible , side by side ! The Book of Ruth , with its pastoral quiet after the wars of the Judges , like an innocent child which has crept between the ranks of hostile armies ; the intense devotion of the Psalms after the speculative discussions of Job , and before the practical wisdom of Proverbs ; the gloom of Ecclesiastes , and then the sweetness of the Song of Solomon , as sharply divided as the eastern morning which leaps from the night , or , as an old Greek might have said , silver-footed Thetis rising from the bed of old Tithonus ; Isaiah 's majestic sweep of eagle pinion , with Jeremiah 's dovelike plaint ; the cloudlike obscurities of Ezekiel , to be solved , as one might expect , by piercing light from the sky ; and the perplexities of Daniel , to be opened by the movements of the nations . " 13 What a variety lies before us here ! " Into the heaven of heavens we have presumed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us ( only fourteen verses above ) how Christ Jesus , in the glory of the Throne , in the Form of God , cared for us men and for our salvation , and made Himself void , and took the creature-nature , and died ; and how He is now on the Throne again in His Incarnation , to receive supreme and universal worship . And then again we came back to earth , yet so as to be led into the deep secrets of the Lord in the inner life of His saints below ; " God is working in you , to will and to do , for His good pleasure 's sake . " And then we have seen this inner life expanding and shewing itself in the holy life without , which shines as a star in the dark , and speaks like a voice from the unseen . And then again we have watched the Apostle 's martyr-joy as he thinks of dying for his Philippians , if need be . Close upon all these heights and depths now comes in this totally different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical allusions to individual character , and to particular circumstances , and to personal hopes and duties ; its words of sympathy and sorrow ; the dear friend 's agitated state of mind ; his recent almost fatal illness ; the mercy of his recovery ; the pleasurable thought of his restoration to the loving circles at Philippi . Nothing could be more completely different than this from the grand dogmatic passage traversed a little while before , nor again from the passages to follow in the next chapter , where the believer 's inmost secrets of acceptance and of life are in view , and his foresight of glory . We are placed here not in the upper heaven , nor before the judgment-throne , nor in the light of the resurrection-morning . We are just in the " hired rooms " at Rome , and we see the Missionary seated there , studying the characters of two of his brethren , and weighing the reasons for asking them , at once or soon , to arrange for a certain journey . He reviews the case , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Philippians , what he thinks of these two men , and what he has planned about them . All is perfectly human , viewed from one side . I or my reader may at any time , in the course of life and duty , be called upon to write about Christian friends and fellow-workers of our own in a tone neither less nor more human and practical than that of this section . In any collection of modern Christian letters we may find the like . I open at this moment the precious volume of Henry Martyn 's correspondence , published ( 1844 ) as a companion to the Memoir . There I read as follows , in a letter to Daniel Corrie , dated Shiraz , December 12 , 1811 : " Your accounts of the progress of the kingdom of God among you are truly refreshing . Tell dear H. and the men of both regiments that I salute them much in the Lord , and make mention of them in my prayers . May I continue to hear thus of their state ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it evident that we have grown in grace . Affectionate remembrances to your sister and to S. I hope they continue to prosecute their labours of love . Remember me to the people of Cawnpore who enquire . Why have I not mentioned Colonel P. ? It is not because he is not in my heart , for there is hardly a man in the world whom I love and honour more . My most Christian salutations to him . May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , dearest brother . Yours affectionately , H. MARTYN . " What is the difference in quality and character between this extract and our present section of Philippians , or between it and many another passage in the Pauline Epistles ? From one point of view , I repeat it , none  --  none that we either can , or should care to , affirm . Of the letters compared , one is as purely human as the other , in the simplicity of its topics , in its local and personal scope , in its natural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can tell , the one was written under just as much or little consciousness of a supernatural prompting as the other . I feel sure that when St Paul wrote thus ( whatever might be his sense of an afflatus at other times , when he wrote , or spoke , or thought , abnormally ) he " felt " exactly as we feel when writing a quiet letter ; he was thinking , arranging topics , choosing words , considering the needs of correspondents , just as simply as we might do . And all this is an element inestimably precious in the structure and texture of the Bible . It is that side or aspect of the Bible which , at least to innumerable minds , brings the whole Book , in a sense so genuine , home ; making it felt in the human heart as a friend truly conversant with our nature and our life . " Thy testimonies , " writes the Bible-loving Psalmist ( Ps. cxix. 24 ) , " are the men of my counsel , " an'shey ' atsathi ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human element " of the blessed Word , its varieties and individualities , its living voice , or rather voices , and the sympathetic confidence which it invites as it draws close to us to advise and guide . How perfectly in contrast are the Bible on the one side , with this humanity and companionship , and such a " sacred book " as the Koran on the other , with its monotonous oracles ! Strange , that the man-made " sacred book " should be so little humane and the God-made Book so deeply and beautifully so ! Yet not strange , after all . For God knows man better than man knows himself ; and when He prepares a Book of books for man , we may expect it to correspond to the deep insight of Him who is Maker of both the volume and the reader . For now on the other part we have to remember that this Book , so naturally and humanly written , as to a very large proportion of its contents , is yet God-made all through . It is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted a passage from a letter of Henry Martyn 's just now , on purpose to place it beside this letter of St Paul 's , with a view to shewing the likeness of the two . But are they like in all respects ? No ; they present a radical difference from another side . It is just this , that the biblical letter is not only human as to its type and utterance ; as to its message , it is authoritative , it is from God . Henry Martyn writes as a Christian man , and it helps us spiritually to be in contact with his affectionate and holy thoughts . Paul writes as a Christian man , but also as " a chosen vessel to bear the Name " of his Lord ; as the messenger of the mind of Christ ; as he who received " his Gospel " " not of man , nor by man , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ " ( Gal . i. 12 ) . From his own days to these he has been known in the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clement of Rome in the first century refers to him as having written to Corinth by divine inspiration. 14 Simon Peter , earlier than Clement , refers to Paul ( 2 Pet . iii . 16 ) as the writer of " Scriptures , " graphai : that solemn word , restricted in the language of Christianity to the oracles of God . The simplest and seemingly most naturalistic passage occurring in a Pauline letter is a " Scripture " ; and as such it speaks to me only not like the utterances of a Martyn but with the voice of the Lord of the Gospel . " Paul , Paul  --  his letters I have read , but not always I agree with him ! " So , according to the story , said a German literary visitor in an Oxford common-room , fifty years ago ; the words shocked the Anglican company . Very many people think with the German now , whether or no they have really " read Paul 's letters . " But their thought is not that of the Church of God ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letters " can be when they are read as divine , and before God , will surely find itself in harmony in this matter with the Church . It will be little disposed to take up the cry ( true enough in itself ) , " Back to Christ , " in that false sense which discredits the servant 's words as if the Master was not committed to them . " If they have kept My saying , they will keep yours also . " In a passage like the present therefore we feel the two elements or aspects , the human and the divine , each real and powerful , and both working in perfect harmony . The human is there , not in the least as a necessary element of error ; rather as an element of delicate and beautiful truth , the truth of justest thought and feeling . The divine is there , as the message from Christ Himself through His servant ; sacred , authoritative , binding on belief , giving solid ground for the soul 's repose . We study here St Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Timothy and his mission , and still more in that of Epaphroditus . We recognize of course the actings of a noble human heart , and we are right to do so . But we find more than this ; we see JESUS CHRIST informing us , in the concrete example of His servant , exactly how it behoves us , as His servants , to feel and act under our responsibilities . St Paul 's thought and action is " written for our learning . " True , the " learning " comes not as a mere code , or lecture . It takes the form of a living experience , recorded , in the course of correspondence , by the man who is going through it . But the man is a vehicle of revelation . He writes about himself ; but his Master is behind him , and is taking care that his whole thought shall be the well-adjusted conveyance of a thought greater than his own . As we come to the incidental details of the passage , we find the same double aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " seeking their own interests , and not the interests of Jesus Christ " ( ver . 21 ) . He says this quite naturally , and with a reference quite local and in detail . But on the other side the words are an oracle ; they convey the message of the Master of His people ; they implicitly claim on His part that we shall seek not our own interests , but His . Again , quite in passing , the Apostle speaks of this or that " hope " or " trust " as being formed " in the Lord . " He does so with no conscious dogmatic purpose , surely ; it is because it comes as naturally to him to do it as for an ordinary correspondent to say that he hopes to do this or that " if all goes well . " But in the epistolary Scripture these brief phrases have another side ; they are authority and oracle ; they convey the mind of Christ about our right relations with Him ; they tell us , from Him , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should form our hopes and plans " in Him , " in conscious recollection of our being His members . St Paul speaks again of his human sensibilities . He tells us of his sorrows , and his longings for encouragement , and his thankfulness that an aggravation of trial , " sorrow upon sorrow , " has been spared him . He speaks of Epaphroditus , and of his generous carelessness of his own health and life , and of the illness he had contracted , and of his merciful recovery , and of his home-sick longing for Philippi , and of his " bewilderment " of regret as he thinks of the Philippians ' anxiety about him . All this is quite as naturally and " humanly " conceived and written on St Paul 's part as anything that I or my reader ever wrote about joys and griefs , our own or of our friends . But not one whit the less is this all a message , an oracle , from our Lord Jesus Christ , in a sense in which no letter of ours could possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so it tells me from above that the free and loving exercise of human sympathies is entirely according to the will of God ; that human tears and longings are in perfect harmony with holiness . It assures me that from one point of view it is right to speak of the prolongation of the believer 's life as a " mercy , " even though " to depart is to be with Christ , which is far better . " It assures me , let me notice by the way , that bodily sickness is not by any means necessarily a direct result or index of sinfulness in the sufferer . There are those who think and say that it is . But this is not the view of the " chosen vessel . " He sees no sin in Epaphroditus ' " falling ill , nigh unto death , " " drawing near , up to death . " It is for him only an occasion for fresh gratitude and affection towards the sufferer , and for deep thanksgivings to Him who in His mercy has granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recorded with beautiful naturalness ; it is a revelation , an oracle . We learn by it , as by the voice of Christ , that although " He took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses , " His servants do not therefore of necessity fail in either faith or love when they suffer " in this tabernacle , " and " groan , being burthened . " Let them look indeed with great simplicity , in humble faith , for the healing power of their Lord , whether or not it may please Him to apply it through human agency . But do not let them think it an act of faith to dictate to Him , as it were , the necessity of their physical recovery . " If it be Thy will , " is never out of place in such appeals . Faith can breathe its most absolute and restful reliance into that " If . " We close the section of Timotheus and Epaphroditus . We have given our main thought to the light which it throws upon the nature of the Scriptures , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely turned aside to think of the actual " men " of the passage ; Timotheus , and his self-forgetting devotion to the Lord and to St Paul , overcoming the sensitiveness of a tender nature ; Epaphroditus , at once brave and affectionate , yearning for the old friends in the old scene , restless in the thought of their trouble about him , yet ready to " throw his life down as a die " in the cause of God and of His people . But if we have said little about them , it is not that we do not love their very names , and feel our union with them . " Once they were mourning here below " ; finding then , as we find now , that the day 's burthen is no dream . But we shall see them hereafter , in the mercy of God , " changed and glorified , " yet the same , where there will be leisure to learn all the lessons that all the saints can teach us from their experience of the love of Jesus . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liturgy : Keep us in everlasting fellowship with our brethren of the Church triumphant , and let us rest together in Thy presence from our labours. 1 Timotheon is slightly emphatic by its place in the Greek ; as if to say , " Though I must still be absent , he will soon be with you . " 2 Not " equal-souled with myself " ; which would demand rather , in the Greek , oudena allon echo isopsychon. 3 Possibly , " entered on bondservice , " " took up the slave 's life , " with a reference to Timothy 's earliest connexion with St Paul ( Acts xvi . 1-3 ) . But the reference to the memories of Philippi is much more likely . The aorist , edouleusen , will in this case gather up into one the whole recollection . 4 The touton is slightly emphatic by position , for St Paul is about to speak of other persons also , himself and Epaphroditus. 5 Egesamen : I render the epistolary past by a present tense , which is the English idiom . 6 So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaching by usage to the word . If I read aright , we have here an instance of gentle pleasantry , quite in harmony with the gravity of the Epistle at large . He takes the Philippians ' message of love and gift of bounty as a sort of gospel to himself , and so regards their messenger as a missionary to him . So also with the word leitourgos : its usual associations in New Testament Greek are sacred , or at least solemn ; and so St Paul seems to employ it here . Epaphroditus was no mere agent ; he was a " ministrant , " commissioned from a high quarter  --  the Philippians ' love . 7 epeide epidothon en : the epistolary past ( en ) is rendered in accordance with English idiom .

Paraboleusamenos is a well-attested reading ; the verb is not found elsewhere , but the form is abundantly likely . It would be developed from the adjective parabolos , " reckless , " connected with the verb paraballesthai , " to cast a die . " 13 Thoughts for Heart and Life , by John Ker , D.D .

CHAPTER VIII JOY IN THE LORD AND ITS PRESERVING POWER " THAT I MAY KNOW HIM " PHILIPPIANS iii . 1-11 Doctrinal perils at Philippi  --  " Be glad in the Lord "  --  The true Israel  --  An ideal legalist  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Acceptance and holiness  --  Atoning Cross and Risen Life With the section just closed the Epistle reaches its middle point and already looks towards its end . We may lawfully think of St Paul as pausing here in his dictation ; he returns to it after some considerable interval , with new topics , or rather with one important new topic , in his mind . Hitherto , if we have read him aright , we have seen him occupied , from one side or another , with the thought of Christian Unity at Philippi . That thought has been either explicitly developed , as in the close of the first chapter , and in the opening of the second , and again in the passage embracing ii . 14-16 ; or it has been rather implied than expounded . The Apostle 's assurances of love and prayer have been often worded so as to suggest it . The grand passage of doctrine , ii . 5-11 , has been occasioned directly by it , and is made to bear immediately upon it ; the Lord 's wonderful self-abnegation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted there , not in an isolated way , but as it speaks to the believer of the spirit which should animate him , and which will preclude jealousies and separations as nothing else can . And even the paragraph where Timotheus and Epaphroditus are before us is tinged with the same feeling ; what the Apostle says about both these dear friends is so said as to unite the sympathies of the Philippians . But he has more to speak of than this sacred call to union of spirit and of life in Christ . We gather that Epaphroditus , talking over the condition of the Mission with his leader , had alluded to the presence there of serious doctrinal perils , which must ultimately affect Christian holiness . That ubiquitous difficulty , the propaganda of anti-Pauline Christian Judaism , had come on the scene , or was just coming . The teachers who affirmed , or insinuated , that Jesus Christ could be reached only through the ceremonial law , were now to be reckoned with . The converts were disturbed , or soon might be disturbed , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a sine qua non in order to a valid hope of salvation through the Gospel ; that the man awakened from his paganism must be at least something of a Jew to be anything of a Christian ; that the door was not absolutely open between the sinner 's soul and the Saviour , to be passed through by the one step of a living trust in the Promise . Let us remember that assertions like these , which to Christians now may seem obviously futile , by no means necessarily seemed so then . Then , much more than now , pagan enquirers after JESUS would be sure to be conscious that the true salvation offered was , in one sense , emphatically a Jewish salvation . It was the message which told of the life and death , the person and work , of One who was , " after the flesh , " a Jew . It was the announcement that the long hope of Israel was fulfilled in Him . Its terminology was full of words and ideas altogether Jewish . And its messengers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Jews , of unmistakable nationality , training , and ( doubtless ) appearance . On a first view , on a hasty and shallow view certainly , it may have seemed a quite natural incident in such a message when some of its propagandists asserted that to reach this Hebrew Deliverer and King the enquirer must form a connexion in religion which should be definitely Hebrew . It is conceivable that even yet , in the history of the Church , this phase of error may in some form assert itself again . We look in the future , it may be in the near future , for the keeping to the old Israel of promises which have never been revoked . We believe that Rom. xi . shall yet find its fulfilment , and that the " receiving of them again shall be life from the dead " to the world . In that great period of blessing , the work of missions may ( shall we not say , probably will ? ) be very largely taken up by Hebrew Christians . And if any of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have only a distorted view of the Gospel of Christ , their intense national character may tell not a little on the form of their message . But this is by the way . All that is really before us here is the fact that  --  not the open hostility of unconverted Jews but  --  the sidelong counter-action of Judaistic Christians was threatening Philippi , and must be met by the Apostle . Nor was this , if we explain rightly the close of ch. iii. , the only such danger in the air . The antinomian traitor was also within the gates . There were those who could assert that the Gospel , the Pauline Gospel , the wonderful message of Justification by Faith only , and of a life lived in the Spirit as its sequel , was the very truth they held and rejoiced in ; but they taught it so as to reason from it that practical holiness did not matter ; the justified , the accepted , the man of the Spirit , lived in a transcendental religious region ; he was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grace ? And was not grace the antithesis of works ? Was not grace , before everything else , the condonation of sin ? And the more it did that work , was it not the more glorious ? " Shall we not continue in sin then , that grace may abound ? " What does it signify , though the perishable and burthensome body defiles itself ? The emancipated spirit of the " spiritual " man lives on another plane ; the sensual and the mystical elements may approach , may run parallel , but can never meet . The body may sin ; the spirit must be pure  --  if only the man is in grace . Such assuredly were some of the conditions of error and evil to be considered when on that far-off day , in his Roman chamber , St Paul turned his soul again to Philippi , and asked his scribe to write . There is a solemn comfort in the thought . In our days of trial , when again and again it is as it " the foundations were destroyed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials of the apostolic age . It was indeed an " age of faith " ; but , as the other side of that very fact , it was an age of clouds and darkness , from the point not of " faith " but of " sight . " It had a glorious answer to the tremendous questions that beset it . But that answer was not human reasoning , or material successes ; it was the Lord Jesus Christ . And so it is for us to-day . But now St Paul is at work ; let us listen , and we shall hear how promptly he brings that answer to bear in his letter to Philippi. 1 Ver . 1 . For the rest ( to loipon ) , my brethren , to turn now to another topic , as I draw towards an end , let me give you this comprehensive watchword +Be glad in the Lord+. 2 +To write the same things to you+ , to reiterate that one thought , that CHRIST is our glory and our joy , " +to me not irksome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are spiritual dangers around you from which this will be the best preservative ; false teachings which can only be fully met with the gladness of the truth of Christ . +Beware of , Ver . 2. keep your eyes open upon ( blepete ) , +the " dogs , " + the men who would excommunicate all who hold not with their half-Christian Pharisaism and its legal burthens , but who are themselves thus self-excluded from the covenant blessing . +Beware of the evil workmen+ , the teachers whose watchword is " works , works , works , " a weary round of observances and would-be merits , but who are sorry work-men indeed , spoiling the whole structure of " Heaven 's easy , artless , unencumber 'd plan .

Here is a piece of consecutive rendering and paraphrase longer than usual . And meanwhile the passage before us is one of extraordinary fulness and richness , alike in its record of experience and its teaching of eternal truths . But it seemed impossible to break into fragments the glorious wholeness of the Apostle 's thought and utterance . And then , the utterance is so rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not but feel that , for very much of it at least , my best commentary was the closest rendering I could offer , with a few brief suggestions by the way . Drawing now to a close , I can only indicate , under one or two headings , some main messages to the mind and soul . i . I gather from the connexion of the passage , as we have traced it , the supreme importance of a true joy in the Lord , a true personal sight of " the King in His beauty , " in order to our spiritual orthodoxy . Let me quote again from the Prayer Book of the Moravians , from which I gave one short extract in the last chapter . In their " Church Litany , " among the first suffrages , occur these petitions : " From coldness to Thy merits and death . From error and misunderstanding , From the loss of our glory in Thee , Preserve us , gracious Lord and God . " The words are the very soul of St Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . St Paul dreads exceedingly for the Philippians the incursion of " error and misunderstanding " ; the advent of a mechanical rigorism of rule and ordinance , and ( as we shall see in later pages ) the subtle poison also of the specious antinomian lie . How does he apply the antidote ? In the form of an appeal to them to be sure to not to " lose their glory in the Lord " ; and then he writes a record of his own experience in which he shews them how his own Pharisaic treasures had all been cast away , or willingly given up to the spoiler ; and why ? Not for abstract reasons , but " because of the surpassingness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord " ; because of the irresistible and infinite betterness of His discovered glory , seen in the atoning Cross and the Resurrection power . Let us " arm ourselves likewise with the same mind . " We have countless perils about us in our modern Christendom , things which only too easily can trouble the reason and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us . " Let us meet them , whatever else we do , with the Moravians ' prayer . Let us meet them with obedience to the Apostle 's positive injunction , " Rejoice in the Lord . " ii . The passage bids us remember the profound connexion between a true " knowledge " of the Lord Jesus as our Atonement and a true " knowledge " of Him as our Life and Power . Both are here . In ver . 9 , so it seems to me , any unprejudiced reader of St Paul 's writings must see language akin to those great passages of Romans and Galatians which put before us the supreme question of our Justification , and which send us for our whole hope of Acceptance before the eternal Judge , whose law we have broken , to the Atoning Death of our Lord Jesus Christ . In those passages , demonstrably as I venture to think , the word " Righteousness " is largely used as a short term for the Holy One 's righteous way of accepting us sinners for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was " made a curse for us , " " made sin for us , " " delivered for our offences , " " set forth for a propitiation , " that we might be " justified from all things " in our union with Him by faith . If so , this is the purport of similar phrases here also . St Paul is thinking here first of the discovered glory of Christ as the propitiation for his sins , his peace with God , his refuge and his rest for ever against the accuser and the curse . That comes first , profoundly first . But then we have also here the sequel truth , the glorious complement . Here is Acceptance , wholly for Jesus Christ 's most blessed sake . But this is but the divine condition to another divine and transcendent blessing ; it is revealed as the way in to a knowledge of this Lord of Peace , a deep and unspeakable knowledge of Him , such as shall infuse into His disciple the power of His Risen Life , and the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of His Death , and shall be the path whose end shall be His glory . St Paul here bids us never put asunder what God hath joined together . " Never further than the Cross , never higher than Thy feet " ; there may we be " found , " " in Him " ; unshaken by surrounding mysteries , and meekly resolute against fashions of opinion . Let us be recognized for those who truly know for themselves , and truly commend to others , that blessed " Justification by Faith " which is still , as ever , the Beautiful Gate of the Gospel . " ' T is joy enough , my All in All , Before Thy feet to lie ; Thou wilt not let me lower fall , And who can higher fly ? " But then let us be known as those who , accepting Christ Jesus as our All for peace , ( whatever we may have to " consider to be loss " that we may do so , ) have clasped Him also as our Hidden Life , our Risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grow Thou in me , And all things else recede ; My heart be daily nearer Thee , From sin be daily freed . " 17 Always at the atoning Cross ;  --  yes , every day and hour ; " knowing no other stand " before the face of the Holy One . Always receiving there the Risen Life , the presence inwardly of the Risen One , the secret power to suffer and to serve in peace ;  --  yes , for ever yes ; " to the praise of the glory of His grace . " So , and only so , shall we live the life of real sinners really saved ; " worshipping by the Spirit of God , exulting in Christ Jesus , and confident , but not in the flesh . " 1 The reader may be aware that Bishop Lightfoot 's theory of the connexion of thought at the beginning of ch. iii . is different from that advocated here . He thinks that St Paul dictated on continuously till the close of iii . 1 , and was interrupted there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely on another line . In this view , the words about " writing the same things unto you " refer still to Christian unity , on which St Paul was going to dilate further , but a sudden pause occurred , and the theme was dropped . With reverence for the great expositor , I can not but think this unlikely . It assumes that St Paul was curiously indifferent to the sequence of thought in an important apostolic message , which assuredly he would read over again before it was actually sent . A theory which fairly explains the passage , and meanwhile avoids the thought of such indifference , seems to me far preferable . 2 The words obviously may be rendered , " Farewell in the Lord " ; and so some take them , explaining that St Paul was intending to close immediately , and so wrote his " Adieu " here ; but then changed his plan . This is very unlikely however . See below , iv . 4 : Chairete en Kurio pantote . The " always " there scarcely suits a formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad . And that passage is the obvious echo of this .  --  A.V. and R.V. both render " rejoice , " though R.V. writes " or , farewell " in the margin . St Chrysostom in his comments here explains the passage as referring to the Christian 's joy ( chara ) . The ancient Latin versions render Gaudete ( not valete ) in Domino . 3 I thus render rhythmically the rhythmical Greek ( it is an iambic trimeter ) : emoi men ouk okneron , humin d asphales . It is probable that the words are a quotation from a Greek poet , perhaps a " comic " poet ; the " comedies " being full of neatly expressed reflexions . For such a quotation , probably from the " comedian " Menander , see 1 Cor. xv . 33 : phtheirousin ethe chresth homiliai kakai : " Ill converse cankers fair morality. " 4 The reading pneumati Theou ( not Theo ) latreuontes is to be preferred . 5 Datreuien means first to do servants ' work , then to do religious " service " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially priestly duty ( see e.g. Heb. xiii . 10 ) . This latter may be in view here : we Christians , born anew of the Spirit , are the true priests , and we little need to be made Jewish proselytes first . 6 The sarx in St Paul is very fairly represented by the word " self " as used popularly in religious language . It is man taken as apart from God , and so man versus God ; then by transition it may mean , as here , the products of such a source , the labours of the self-life to construct a self-righteousness . It is hardly necessary to say that , in such contexts as this , where it stands more or less distinguished from the pneuma , it is not a synonym for " the body . " Sins of " the flesh " may be sins purely of the mind , as e.g. " emulation " ( Gal . v. 20 ) . 7 I thus attempt to convey the emphasis of the words ouk en sarki pepoithotes , which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a dative of reference , a frequent construction with St Paul . See Rom. xii . 10-12 for several examples together . 9 See Trench , Synonyms , Sec. xxxix. , for the special meanings of Israelites , the member of the Covenant-people ; Ebraios , the Jew who was true to his inmost national traditions ; and Ioudaios , the Jew merely as other than the Gentile . 10 The article is absent ; but context leaves no doubt of the special reference here . 11 In solemn contrast but with perfect consistency , from another point of view  --  that not of the Pharisee but of GOD  --  he can point out elsewhere that " no flesh " can possibly claim " righteousness " on the ground of fulfilment of code and precept . See especially Rom. iii . 19 , 20 . But his business here is to meet the legalist on the legalist 's own ground . 12 Notice the plural ; as if , miser-like , he had counted his bags of treasure . And then see the contrasted singular , Xemian : he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek etymologists derived the word from kusi balein , " to cast to dogs . " Otherwise it is traced to a connexion with skor , " excrement . " 14 Practically , he means " that I might gain , " in the past transaction of conversion and surrender . He thinks the past over again . 15 Lit. , " faith of , " pisteos Christou . This use of the genitive with pistis , to denote its object , is frequent . Cp. e.g. Mark xi . 22 ; Gal . ii . 16 , 20. 16 Even as the benefit of food is conditioned to us by our ( not buying but ) eating it . 17 See the whole hymn ( rendered from Lavater 's O Jesu Christe , wachs in mir ) in Hymns of Consecration , 295 .

" I want  --  and this sums up my prayer  --  To glorify Thee till I die , Then calmly to yield up my soul to Thy care , And breathe out , in faith , my last sigh . " CHARLOTTE ELLIOTT . CHAPTER IX CHRISTIAN STANDING AND CHRISTIAN PROGRESS PHILIPPIANS iii . 12-16 Christian exultation  --  Christian confidence  --  " Not in the flesh "  --  " In Jesus Christ "  --  The prize in view  --  No finality in the progress  --  " Not already perfect "  --  The recompense of reward  --  What the prize will be In a certain sense we have completed our study of the first section of the third chapter of the Epistle . But the treatment has been so extremely imperfect , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few further remarks must be made . Let us ponder one weighty verse , left almost unnoticed when we touched it . Observe then the brief , pregnant account of the true Christian , given in ver . 3 : " We are the circumcision , we who by God 's Spirit worship , and who exult in Christ Jesus , and who , not in the flesh , are confident . " This is a far-reaching description of the true member of the true Israel , the man of the Covenant of grace . Note first its positive lines . " We worship , " " we exult , " " we are confident . " Every affirmation is full of divine principles of truth . " We worship " ; ours is a hallowed , dedicated , and reverent life . It is spent in a sanctuary . Whatever we have to be , or to do , as to externals ; whether to rule a province , a church , a school , a home ; whether to keep accounts , or sweep a room ; whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places of heathenism , or to teach language , or science , or music ; whether to be active all day long , or to lie down alone to suffer ; whatever be our actual place and duty in the world , " we worship . " " We have set the Lord always before us . " We have " sanctified Christ as LORD in our hearts " ( 1 Pet . iii . 15 ; so read ) . We belong to Him everywhere , and we recollect it . We owe adoring reverence to Him everywhere , and we recollect it . Let us reiterate the fact ; ours is a hallowed life , for it belongs to a divine Master ; it is a reverent life , for that Master in His greatness is to us an abiding Presence . The fact of Him , the thought of Him , has expelled from our lives the secular air and the light and flippant spirit . We are nothing if not worshippers . Then , secondly , " we exult . " Ours is a life of gladness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Constantly and profoundly chastened by its worshipping character , it is constantly quickened and illuminated by this element of exultation . The word is strong , kauchomenoi , " exulting . " We observe that the Apostle does not say that we are resigned , that we are at peace , that there is a calm upon us . This is true ; but he says that " we exult . " The " still waters , " the mey m'nuchoth of Ps. xxiii. 2 , are anything but stagnant . They are a lake ; but it is a lake upon a river , like the fair waters of Galilee , receiving and giving , and therefore alive with pure movement , while yet surrounded by the " rest , " m'nuchah , which means repose not from action but underneath it . " We exult . " Ours is not an autumn of feeling ; not a state of the soul in which the characteristics are the sighs and starting tears of memory and apprehension . It is an everlasting spring , in which the mighty but temperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not parching but quickening all day long . " We exult . " It is a happy life , not only with the happiness of a cheerful contentment , beautiful as that is ; ours is the happiness of wondering discovery , and rich possession , and ever-opening prospects ; it is " quick and lively " ; it is " exultation . " Then , " we are confident . " If I traced the bearing of this clause aright , in the last chapter , we shall feel that the word pepoithotes is meant to carry a positive message . It is not only that " we do not rely on the flesh " ; it is that " we are reliant , though not on the flesh . " Even so , in the true idea of the Christian life . " We are confident . " We are not wanderers from one peradventure to another ; we are reliant , we are assured , we know where we are , and what we are , and whither we are bound . True , we , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only here and there that we can absolutely say , " We know . " But then , the points where we can say so are points of supreme importance . " We know that the Son of God is come . " " We know that our sins are forgiven us for His name 's sake . " " We know that all things work together for good to them that love God . " " We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved , we have a building of God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens ; therefore we are always confident . " And all this is summed up in the thought that " we know WHOM we have believed , and that HE is able to keep what we have committed unto Him . " Our certainty is a confiding certainty . It does not reside in our courage , or our mental insight ; it is lodged in a Person , who is such that He claims our entire reliance on His work , His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful verse gives us the cautions , the negatives , of the Christian life ; though even here it speaks the language of the highest positive truth . " We worship by God 's Spirit " ; our reverence , our adoration , the hallowing and religiousness of our lives , is not a form imposed from without ; it is a power exerting itself from within , having come to our poor hearts from above . Assuredly we do not neglect or slight actions and rites of worship ; He who has made each of us soul and body , one man , does not mean us to despise the outward and physical in devotion . But we watchfully remember that no such actions or rites are , for one moment , the soul of worship , or its formative power . That soul and power is " God 's Spirit " only ; the Holy Ghost dwelling in the renewed being , and teaching the man " to cry Abba , Father , " and " making intercession for him with groanings which can not be uttered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shewing it unto us . " We pray , and it is " in the Holy Ghost . " We worship , and it is " in Spirit , and in truth . " Again , " we exult in Christ Jesus . " Our glad and animated happiness lies in nothing short of HIM as its cause . We are thankful for noble religious traditions and institutions , and for holy parentage , and for all which makes Christianity correspond in practice to its name . But we are watchful not to let even these blessings take the unique place of " Christ Jesus " in our " exultation . " " In all things He must have the pre-eminence . " Piety itself without Him , if it can be found , is not a body but a statue . All the privileges of the Church of God , without Him , though we reverently cherish every teaching and every ordinance that is Christian indeed , are but the frame without the picture , the casket without the stone . Then again , " not in the flesh are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything which St Paul classes under that word " flesh . " It is always offering itself to us , in one Protean shape or another , to be our comfort and our repose . Sometimes it takes the form of our supposed usefulness and diligence ; sometimes of our strict and exemplary observances ; sometimes , putting on a disguise still more subtle , it sets before the Christian the depth , or the length , of his spiritual experience . Or it grows bolder , and is content with coarser masks ; it tempts us to a miserable reliance on some imagined betterness when we compare ourselves , forsooth , with some one else . I knew long ago an old shepherd , in my father 's parish , who based a hope for eternity on the fact ( if such it was ) that he was never tipsy on a Sunday . We are amused , or we are shocked . But this was only an extreme type of a vast phenomenon , to be found lurking in countless hearts , when God lets in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we think , " not as other men are . " And from this whole world of delusion , in all its continents and islands , the Lord calls us away here by His Apostle . He bids us migrate as it were to another planet , laying our whole confidence , not part of it , on HIM ; let that other world , our old world , roll along without us . Christ presents to us Himself ( as we follow out this rich Philippian passage ) as all our Righteousness , in His precious justifying Merit , offered for the acceptance of the very simplest faith . And He presents Himself as all our Power , for deliverance and for service , in His resurrection Life ; coming to reveal Himself to us in the divine beauty of His sufferings , His death , through which he has passed for us into " indissoluble life " ( Heb. vii . 16 ) . Our Righteousness  --  it is HE , " the propitiation for our sins . " Our Sanctification  --  it is still HE , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His sufferings , and assimilation to His death . " Our Redemption , from the power of the grave  --  it is still " this same Jesus , " in union with whom alone we " attain unto the resurrection which is out from the dead . " Even so , Lord Jesus Christ ; let us thus be " found in Thee " ; worshipping , exulting , confiding ; resting on Thee , abiding in Thee , with an accepting faith which only grows more simple and single as the years move on and gather " since we believed . " " Help us , O Christ , to grasp each truth With hand as firm and true As when we clasp 'd it first to heart A treasure fresh and new ; " To name Thy name , Thyself to own , With voice unfaltering , And faces bold and unashamed As in our Christian spring .

We have here a strong , and at the same time a most tender , warning against all approaches to a theoretical " perfectionism . " Under that word , as I am well aware , many varieties of opinion in detail may be found . And again , few who hold opinions commonly called perfectionist like the word " perfectionism . " But I speak with practical accuracy when I give that title to such views as on the whole affirm the attainableness here below of a spiritual condition in which man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in which his attention tends to be drawn more to his perfectness than to his imperfections of condition . That such views are held , and strongly held , by many earnest Christians , is a familiar fact . As far as my own observation goes , such views are not uncommonly attended , in those who hold them , by a certain oblivion to personal shortcomings and inconsistencies ; by an obscuration of consciousness , and of conscience , more or less marked , towards the sinfulness of ordinary , everyday violations of the law of holiness in respect of " meekness , humbleness of mind , longsuffering , " sympathy , and other quiet graces . In the present passage the Apostle 's whole spirit moves in just the opposite direction . His complete repose in Christ as the Righteousness of God for him , and then his deep nearness to his Lord as the Power of God in him , alike seem not so much to banish as utterly to preclude any thought about himself but that of his own imperfection . He writes as one whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . I deliberately do not say " self-complacency " ; for all Christians would repudiate that word ; I say , complacency in his spiritual condition . His spiritual position , in Christ , as he is " found in Him , " fills him with much more than complacency ; it is his glory and his boast . But when he comes to speak of his spiritual condition , the possessing thought is that all is imperfect and progressive . He has a perfect blessing ; but he is an imperfect recipient of it ; he has " not attained . " He is deeply happy . But he is thoroughly humble . As we read the passage , we feel very sure that the man who wrote it would lie very tenderly and candidly open to reproofs , and to painful truths told him about himself . For his Lord , he is ready to bear rejoicing witness to the whole world . For himself , even as in Christ , he holds no brief ; nay , he takes the other part . He has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delusion of thinking that he is himself absolutely holy , even in the fullest state of grace . He is so genuinely " perfect " in the sense of mature knowledge of his Lord that he is incapable of thinking himself " perfected . " All the while , this does not for a moment leave him in the miserable plight of acquiescing in sin because he knows he is still a sinner . If he were merely going by a theory , it might be so . But he is going by the Lord Jesus Christ ; he is using HIM , daily and hourly , as not only his always abasing standard , but as " all his salvation , and all his desire " ; as the infinitely blissful Object of his affections and of his knowledge ; as his Summum Bonum . While Christ is fully this to the Christian , he will be little likely on the one hand to say , " I am perfect " ( Job ix . 20 ) ; on the other he will be always seeking , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing , for a closer conformity and yet closer ( summorphixomenos ) to his Lord 's bright image . And at the back of all his thoughts about defect and progress will lie the restful certainties to which no ideas of defect attach , and from which the idea of progress is absent , because it is out of place  --  the certainties of the Righteousness of God , " of peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ " ; the being " found in Him . " ii . The passage puts very distinctly before us the thought of the Reward of Grace . The writer is living , loving , working , in view of a " prize , " brabeion : he looks forward to the Master 's hand as it will extend the wreath of victory , and to His voice as it will utter the longed-for words , " Well done , good and faithful Servant . " This same man has laboured , in many an hour of public and private teaching , and in many an inspired page , to emphasize the magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ; that " all things are of God " ; that " to him that worketh not , but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is reckoned for righteousness . " He well knows that there is a side of truth from which the one possible message is the Lord 's own solemn question and answer ( Luke xvii. 9 ) , " Doth he thank that servant ? I trow not . " The most complete and laborious service can not possibly outrun the obligation of the rescued bondservant to the Possessor , of the limb to the blessed Head . But then , this absolute servitude is to One who is , as a fact , eternal Love . The work is done for a Master who , while His claims are absolute , is such that He personally delights in every response of love to His love , of will to His will . His servant can not serve Him with a grateful heart without thereby pleasing the heart of his Lord . And so , at the close of the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims , the Lord " doth not thank that servant , " from the side of love and of moral sympathy He will welcome him in with " Well done , good and faithful servant ; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord . " And that holy " prize " does , and must , prove a magnet to the Christian 's will and hopes . What is he looking for ? Not an accession of personal dignity in heaven , but a word from his beloved Master 's heart . There is nothing mercenary in this . True , it " has respect unto the recompense of reward . " But the " reward " is what only love can give , and only love can take . It is love 's approval of the service of love . Much discussion has been spent upon the theory of reward , in the matter of our service rendered to " our King who has saved us . " The theme no doubt is one which admits of much interesting and important enquiry ; and it has many sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the truth as it is in Jesus . " Let the Christian be seeking the reward of personal aggrandizement in heaven , " to sit on His right hand , or on His left , in His glory " ; and the motive is as earthly as if the scene of its fulfilment were to be an earthly palace . Let him be seeking the " well done " of Jesus Christ , because Jesus Christ has redeemed him , and is dear to him ; and he is in the line of the will , and of the love , of God . 1 Dr H. Bonar. 2 Heth o katelephthen : grammatically we may render , " inasmuch as I was seized " ; cp. the Greek of Rom. v. 12 ; 1 Cor. v. 4 .

" J. DENHAM SMITH . CHAPTER X THE BLESSED HOPE AND ITS POWER PHILIPPIANS iii . 17-21 The problem of the body  --  Cautions and tears  --  " That blessed hope "  --  The duty of warning  --  The moral power of the hope  --  The hope full of immortality  --  My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of his coming The Apostle draws to the close of his appeal for a true and watchful fidelity to the Gospel . He has done with his warning against Judaistic legalism . He has expounded , in the form of a personal confession and testimony , the true Christian position , the acceptance of the believer in " the righteousness which is of God by faith , " and the sanctification of the believer through union with his Lord and in an always growing communion with Him . Throughout this deep and most tender argument has run everywhere the truth with which it began , that the sure antidote to the spiritual errors in question is " joy in the Lord . " The glad use of Jesus Christ in His personal glory and perfection , as He merited for us , and as we abide in Him  --  this is the way . Already another class of mistake and danger has risen before his mind , and occupies it now exclusively . From ver . 12 onward , if I read the passage aright , he has been thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doctrine of grace and faith , but of the school or schools which rather would applaud it  --  and then distort it . There was the teacher who would assert a premature and delusive personal perfection , proclaiming himself so close to Christ that he had already reached the holy goal . And there was the teacher who would reason so upon the perfectness of the atoning merits as to disclaim the need of seeking with all his soul a personal conformity to the Lord of the Atonement . Such a man would conceivably affirm for himself an experience of intense spiritual insight , a communion with God profound and direct , an exaltation into a celestial atmosphere of consciousness ; while yet , and on his own avowed theory , he was living a life in which sin was allowed to reign in his mortal body , What did it matter ? The spirit soared and expatiated in a higher region . The true man lived in the world above , " commercing with the skies " ; it was but the body , soon to perish , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , for it could never be other than the uncongenial burthen of the real man . Such theories , as all are aware , were largely developed and widely spread in the sub-apostolic age . The word Gnosticism , so familiar to the reader of the early history of thought in and around the Church , reminds us of this ; for while many Gnostics were severe ascetics , others were practical libertines ; and the divergent practices sprang from one deep source of error , dishonour of the body . To both schools , spirit was good , matter was evil . By both therefore the body was viewed not as a subject of redemption , but as a barrier in its way . The one aimed to wear out the barrier , to help it to disappear . The others left it , as they thought , alone ; leapt , as they thought , over it ; as if they could pursue a spiritual life which should be irrespective of the body 's hopeless evils . The embryo , at least , of this latter type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and had begun to be felt at Philippi . There , in that loving and beloved community , the plague had begun , or at least the infection was imminent . " Many walked " ( perhaps not actually at Philippi yet , but they might soon come ) in the foul broad road which they asserted to be clean and narrow . Very probably they used the terms of the Pauline Gospel , and said much of grace , and faith , and the Spirit , and the things above . But none the less they were the victims of an awful self-delusion ; teachers whose doctrine led downwards to the pit . To them he comes at length , explicitly and finally . In view of them he places before the Philippians once more the fact of his own and his brethren 's examples , and then the sanctifying power of that blessed hope , the Redemption of the Body . Ver . 17. +United imitators of me become ye , brethren+ ; taking me , your long-known guide in the Lord , for your moral pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing ( an appeal prompted not by egotism or self-confidence , but by single-hearted certainty about my message and my purpose ) ; +and mark+ , watch , in order to tread in their steps , 1 +those who so walk as you have us+ , me and my missionary-brethren , for a model+ ; those whose practical conduct in human life and intercourse ( peripatein ) , seen among you day by day in its wholesomeness and truth , plainly reproduces what you remember of ours . There is need for this attention , and for this Ver . 18. discrimination . +For there are many men walking+ , pursuing a line of conduct and practice , +whom I often used to tell you of , in the days of our direct intercourse , +but+ ( de ) +now tell you of actually ( kai ) +with cries and tears+ ( klaion ) , ( so much has the evil grown , in extent and in depth , so awfully apparent are its issues , for this world and the world to come , ) +as the enemies+ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bad pre-eminence , +of the Cross of our+ ( tou ) +Christ+ , that Cross of whose virtues they can say much , but whose power upon the soul they utterly ignore ; +of+ Ver . 19. +whom the end is perdition+ , ruin of the whole being , 2 final and hopeless ; +of whom the god is the belly+ , ( the sensual appetites , the body 's degradation , not its function , ) while they claim an exalted and special intimacy with the Supreme ; +and their+ ( he ) +glory+ , their boast to see deeper and to soar higher than others , +is in their shame ; men whose mind is for+ ( phronouten ) +the things on earth+ , not , as they dream , or as at least they say , for the things of an upper and super-corporeal world . No ; their subtle doctrine of spirit and body  --  what is it when tested in its issues ? It is but a philosophy of sin ; a gossamer robe over the self-indulgence which has come to be the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . All is really , with them , of the earth , earthy . Far other is the doctrine we have learned , and have striven to exemplify , at the feet of Christ . Ver . 20 . For our city-home , the seat of our citizenship , and of the conduct which it demands and inspires , 3 +subsists in the heavens+ , is always there , an antecedent and abiding fact ( huparchei ) , on which we are to act in life ; in that heavenly world , where the Lord is , and for which He is training us ; the eternal Country of this eternal City and Home ; +out of which ( city ) 4 +we are actually ( kai ) +waiting for , as our Saviour+ , in the full and final sense , the +Lord Jesus Christ , who will+ Ver . 21. +transfigure+  --  not annihilate , not cast away as essentially evil , but wonderfully change in its conditions , and so in its guise , in its semblance ( schema )  --  +the body of our humiliation+ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abasements of our mortality , humbling us continually in the course of its necessities , and of its sufferings , but not therefore , in its essence , other than God 's good handiwork ; +to be conformed+ , with a resemblance based on an essential assimilation ( summorphon , morphe ) , +to the body of His glory+ , as He resumed His blessed Body when He rose , and as He wears it now upon the Throne , and in it manifests Himself to the happy ones in their bliss ; +according to , in ways and measures conditioned only by , +the forth-putting+ ( energeia ) +of His ability actually to subdue to Himself all things that are+ ( ta panta ) . So the great passage , the pregnant chapter , ends . As it began so it closes  --  with Jesus Christ . With Him His servant can never have done ; " Him first , Him midst , Him last , and without end . " Jesus Christ is the present joy , and the everlasting hope . His perfected righteousness is the believer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal grace and glory are the constant animation and ever-rising standard of the believer 's spiritual progress . He is the eternal Antidote to our fears , and also to our sins . He is the infinite Contradiction to the least compromise , under any pretext , with evil ; and He is this , among other ways , by being Himself " that blessed Hope " ; " the Lord Jesus Christ , which is our Hope " ( 1 Tim . i. 1 ) ; so that the prospect of His Return , and of what He will do for us , and for Himself ( eauto ) , when He returns , is to be our mighty motive in the matter of practical , aye of bodily , cleanness and holiness of life . The whole passage now before us is strongly characteristic of the New Testament way of dealing with sin . In the first place , there is no lack of urgent and explicit warning . The moral and spiritual evil is labelled unmistakably . It is pointed out as a danger not hypothetical but actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and influences : " Many persons walk whom I tell you of with tears as the enemies of the cross of Christ . " And of these persons , as such , it is unflinchingly said that their end is atoleia , " ruin , " " perdition " ; dread and hopeless word . In all this lies a lesson for our day . In many quarters the solemn utterance of warning is now almost silent ; it is regarded as almost unchristian to warn sinners , even open sinners , to do anything so much out of the fashion as " to flee from the wrath to come , " " the wrath which is coming upon the children of disobedience . " But this is not the apostolic way , nor the Lord 's way . Yet this passage , this heart-searching appeal , while it deals with warning , does not end with it . Its strongest and chosen argument is not fear but hope ; not perdition but " the coming again of our Lord Jesus Christ , and our gathering together unto Him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most subtle form of sensual temptation , a masterpiece of the Enemy . In passing , and with bitter tears , he points to the gulph where that path ends . In closing , and with his whole heart , he points to the coming Lord in His benignant glory , and to the unutterable joy of our being then , finally and even in our material being , transfigured for ever into His likeness . For our own blessing , and for that of others , let us follow this example . Whether in the pulpit to a listening throng , or in more individual approaches to other men , or when we turn in upon ourselves , and , like the Psalmists , speak to our own souls , in the most secret possible hour , let us seek to speak thus . Let us not take an opiate against the ideas of judgment , wrath , perdition  --  unless , with our Bibles quite open , we are quite sure that such things are only dreams of a past religious night . Let us take urgent heed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warnings of God . But all the while let us present to ourselves , and to others , as the great argument of all for saying " No " to specious sin , " that blessed Hope . " Let us consider Jesus Christ , till He shines upon us in something of the glory of His Person and His Work . Let us wait for Him from heaven . More and more , as the years roll , and the suns set , and " that day " is approaching , let us take our place among those who " love His appearing . " And as for our bodies , and His call to be pure in body as in spirit , let us continually remember that " the body is for the Lord , and the Lord for the body " ( 1 Cor. vi . 13 ) . Let us not merely try to reason down temptation , or to order it down , in the name of abstract rightness , or of concrete peril . Let us recollect as a glorious fact that the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cares for it , as His dear-bought possession ; that He can , by His own Spirit , sanctify it now , through and through ; and that He is coming , perhaps very soon indeed , to " transfigure it to be conformed to the body of His glory . " The whole genius of the Gospel tends to connect together , as closely as possible , holiness and happiness . They are to act and react in manifold ways in the Christian life . Holiness lies at the root of happiness , as its deep condition . But also happiness , from another point of view , waters the root of holiness , and expands its flowers , and brings its sweet fruit to fulness . " The joy of the Lord is your strength "  --  your strength to say to temptation a " No " which shall be entirely willing and simple . Never shall we so tread down the tempter , and the traitor , as when we are " rejoicing in Christ Jesus , " and " in the hope of the glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us prove the power of Christ loved and looked for . In a very special sense let St Paul teach us here to apply to our present needs the force of a heavenly future , the future of His coming , and of our meeting Him and being transfigured by Him . In many directions , in the Church , this rule is being practised now with great earnestness , and with happy issues ; the looking for the Lord 's Return is indeed a reality to many . But in many directions it is otherwise . Christian thought and labour too often seem to limit themselves to the sphere of the present , and to forget that the goal of the Gospel is not a state of social bien-etre developed by philanthropy under the auspices , so to speak , of Christ , but an immortality of holy power and service , won for us by His merits , prepared for us by His exaltation , while we are prepared for it by His Spirit working in us . Again and again we need to remember this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of man , personal and social blessings of the philanthropic kind which nothing else can possibly bring down . It makes to-day infinitely important by connecting it with the eternal to-morrow . But the path is towards that to-morrow . " We look at the things not seen , for the things which are not seen are eternal . " We " desire a better country , that is , an heavenly . " " It doth not yet appear what we shall be ; we shall be like Him , for we shall see Him as He is . " Much current Christian teaching practically tends to drop immortality very nearly out of sight . The Lord 's Return , the heavenly Life , " the liberty of the glory of the sons of God "  --  these topics are either little mentioned , or treated too much as luxuries and ornaments of the Gospel . But it was not so for the Lord Jesus , and for His Apostles . And we shall find that to follow Him and them in this , as in other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that now is , and of that which is to come . " Their doctrine of the future is much more than an antidote to death . It is the mighty animation of life . It makes altogether for present purity , and righteousness , and self-sacrificing love , in the concrete circumstances of this generation . It is the thought in which alone man can live his true life now , as a being who is made " to glorify God  --  and to enjoy Him fully for ever . " As a matter of fact , no human life is so true , full , and beautiful as that which is at once assiduously attentive to present duty and service , and full of the everlasting hope . Such lives are being lived all around us . Which of my readers has not known at least one such ? For me , one among many shines out in my heart radiant with a brightness all its own ; it is the life of my blessed Mother . She has now been a great while with the Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what that " conversation " was is not only indelible ; it lives and moves , as fresh to-day as ever . It was a busy life  --  the life of a wife , a mother of many sons , a friend of many friends , the pastor 's help-mate in a poor parish . It was a life of minute and devoted attention to every duty , large and little . It was a life of warm and ready sympathies , and manifold interests . But it was a life all the while of divine communion , and of an unwavering " hope full of immortality . " Dear to that heart indeed were husband , children , friends , neighbours , suffering and sinning world . Very fruitful was that life for individual and social blessing , just such as the philanthropist seeks to convey . Side by side with my Father , who laboured incessantly through a long life for God and man , and for men 's health as well as their salvation , my Mother lived for others in all their present needs . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were within the veil . And the choice and the longing were always , in perfect harmony with every strong human affection , directed towards heaven She did indeed " wait , as for her Saviour , for the Lord Jesus Christ . " And the whole result , for those whom that life affected , was a deep , strong evidence of Christianity . In her we saw the Gospel beautify the present by lifting the veil of the blessed future . We recognized the reality of Jesus Christ now by converse with one who so much desired the sight of His glory then . As we draw to an end , let us take up the closing words of our paragraph , and read them as a special " lesson of faith . " St Paul is telling us of a change yet to pass over us , over these our bodies , altogether inconceivable in kind and degree . They are to be " transfigured into conformity to the body of our Saviour 's glory . " Yes , it is inconceivable ; in modern parlance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " Well , Scripture does not invite us to " conceive " it , to " think " it , in the sense of thinking it out . It helps us indeed elsewhere ( 1 Cor. xv. ) with intimations and illustrations , up to a certain point ; but this is not to explain , or to ask us to explain . What it does is something better ; it invites us to trust a personal Agent , who understands all that He has undertaken , and who is able . " How can these things be ? " Not according to this or that law , principle , or tendency , which we can divine . No ; but " according to the mighty working whereby HE is able to subdue all things unto Himself . " The method of the Bible is to give us ample views of what Jesus Christ is , and then ( not before ) to ask us to trust Jesus Christ to DO what he says He can . He says , " I will raise you up at the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain . He says nothing in detail of His modus operandi . We are in absolute ignorance of it , as much as the Christians of five , or ten , or eighteen centuries ago . We do not know how . But we know Him . And He has said , " I will "  --  and has died and risen again . Shall we not rest here ? It is good ground . " I know whom I have believed ; and am persuaded that He is able . " And what is true of His power and promise in this great matter of our resurrection and our glory , is true of course all round the circle of His undertakings . " He can subdue all things . " And therefore , not only death , and the grave , and the mysteries of matter , but also our hearts , our affections , our wills . He can " bring every thought into captivity " to the holy rule of His thought . He can " subdue our iniquities . " And he can subdue also all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked straight , and the rough places plain . How , we may be wholly ignorant beforehand ; only , " according to the mighty working . " Lastly , it is heauto , 5 " unto HIMSELF . " What a word of rest and power ! Our expectation of His victories in us and for us does not terminate upon ourselves ; it is never safe to terminate things there . It rises and rests in Himself . Our glorification , body and soul , is , ultimately , " unto Him " ; therefore the prospect , and the desire , are boundlessly right and safe . " To subdue all things unto Himself " ; so as to serve Him , to promote His ends , to do His will . Our absolute emancipation from all the limitations of both moral and material evil is " unto Himself . " Emancipation on this side , it is an entire and eternal annexation on the other .

But here obviously the " looking " is for imitation .  --  The Philippians knew St Paul 's teaching , and in his attached leading disciples among them they could see it embodied . 2 Cp . Matt. vii . 13 ; Rom. vi . 21 ; 2 Cor. xi . 15 ; Heb. vi . 8 ; 1 Pet . iv . 17. 3 I thus attempt to give the meaning of politeuma , so far as I understand it . The R.V. renders it " citizenship , " and " commonwealth " in the margin . The usage of the word in Greek literature amply justifies either , and either well suits the general context . The Apostle means that Christians are citizens of the heavenly City as to their status , and are therefore " obliged by their nobility " to live , however far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and represent it . What seems lacking however in the rendering of the R.V. is the idea of locality , which ( to me ) was clearly present to St Paul 's mind in his use of politeuma here . The proof of this lies in the words ex ou just below ; not ex on ( ouranon ) but ex ou ( politeumatos ) : I can find no proof of the assertion ( Moulton 's Winer , p. 177 ) that ex ou is a mere equivalent for hothen , and so may refer to the plural ouranoi . The rendering " seat of citizenship " seems fairly to represent politeuma thus .  --  The A.V. " conversation " ( Lat. conversatio , " intercourse of life " ) probably represents an impression of the translators that the Apostle is as it were echoing i. 27 , axios tu euaggeliou politeuesthe . But the imagery here is different , and definite . 4 See note just above on ex ou . 5 Perhaps read auta . But the translation must remain the same . 6 F. R.

The words are a link of gold between the passage just ended and that which is to follow . They sum up the third chapter of the Epistle into one practical issue . In view of all that can tempt them away to alien thoughts and beliefs St Paul once more points the converts to Jesus Christ ; or rather , he once more bids them remember that in Him they are , and that their safety , their life , is to stay there , recollected and resolved . There is the point of overwhelming advantage against error , and against sin ; and only there . " Standing in the Lord , " in remembrance and in use of their vital union with Him , they would be armed alike against the pharisaic and the antinomian heresy . Counterfeits and perversions would be seen , or at least felt , to be such while they were thus in living and working contact with the REALITY . There , with a holy instinct , they would repudiate utterly a merit of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . There , with equal inward certainty , they would detect and reject the suggestion that they " should not surely die , " though impurity was cloaked and loved . But the words we have just rendered look forward also . St Paul is about to allude , for the last time , and quite explicitly , to that blot on the fair Philippian fame , the presence in the little mission Church of certain jealousies and divisions . One instance of this evil is prominent in his thoughts , no doubt on Epaphroditus ' report . Two Christian women , Euodia1 and Syntyche , evidently well-known Church members , possibly officials , " deaconesses , " like Phoebe ( Rom. xvi . 1 ) , were at personal variance . Into their life and work for Christ ( for workers they were , or however had been ; they had " wrestled along with Paul in the Gospel , " ) had come this grievous inconsistency . Somehow ( modern experiences in religious activity supply illustrations only too easily ) they had let the spirit of self come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And out of this unhappy state it was the Apostle 's deep desire to bring them , quickly and completely . He appeals to them personally about it , with a directness and explicitness which remind us how homelike still were the conditions of the mission Church . He calls on his " true yoke-fellow , " and on Clement , and on his other " fellow-labourers , " to " help " the two to a better mind , by all the arts of Christian friendship . But surely first , in this verse , he leads not only the Philippians generally but Euodia and Syntyche in particular up to a level where the self-will and self-assertion must , of themselves , expire . " Stand firm in the Lord . " In recollection and faith surround yourselves with Jesus Christ . The more you do so the more you will find that so to be in Him is to " be of one mind in Him . " In that PRESENCE self is put to shame indeed . Pique , and petty jealousies , and miserable heart-burnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and heart meets heart in love , because in Christ . It is not guaranteed to us , I think , that we shall certainly be brought here on earth to perfect intellectual agreement by a realized union with Christ all round . Such agreement will certainly be promoted by such a realization ; we all know how powerfully , in almost all matters outside number and figure , feeling can influence reasoning ; and to have feeling rightly adjusted , " in Him that is true , " must be a great aid to just reasoning , and so a great contribution to mental agreement . Thomas Scott , in his Force of Truth , ( a memorable record of experience , ) maintains that vastly more doctrinal concord would be attained in Christendom if all true Christians unreservedly and with a perfect will sought for " God 's heart " ( and mind ) " in God 's words . " 2 But it is a law of our present state , even in Christ , that " we know in part " ; and while this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary , where many minds work each with its partial knowledge . It is otherwise with " the spirit of our mind , " the attitude of will and affection in which we think . In the Lord Jesus Christ this is meant to be , and can be , rectified indeed , as " every thought is brought into captivity " to Him . If so , to " stand firm in Him " is the way of escape out of all such miseries of dissension ( whether between two friends , or two Churches , or two enterprises ) as are due not to reasoning but to feeling . " In Him " there is really no room for envy , and retaliation , and " the unhappy desire of becoming great , " and the eager combat for our own opinion as such . " Standing firm in Him " the Euodias and Syntyches of all times and places must tend to be of one mind , one attitude of mind ( phronein ) . So far as they are , in a sinful sense , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half out of Him . But now St Paul comes to them , name by name . What must the tender weight of the words have been as they were first read aloud at Philippi ! Ver . 2. +To Euodia I appeal+ ( parakalo ) , 3 +and to Syntyche I appeal , to be of the same mind , in the Lord+ ; to lay aside differences of feeling , born of self , in the power of their common union in Christ. 5 +Aye+ ( read Ver . 3. nai , not kai ) , +and I beg thee also+ , thee in thy place , as I seek to do in mine , +thou genuine yoke-fellow , 5 help them+ ( autais )  --  these sisters of ours thus at variance , +women who+ ( aitines ) +wrestled along with me+ , as devoted and courageous workers , +in the cause of the +Gospel+ , when the first conflicts with the powers of evil were fought at Philippi ; yes , do this loving service , +with Clement6 too , and my other fellow-workers , whose names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , " written in heaven , " His for ever. 7 Wonderful is the great use of small occasions everywhere in Scripture . Minor incidents in a biography are texts for sentences which afford oracles of truth and hope for ever . Local and transitory errors , like that of the Thessalonians about their departed friends , give opportunity for a prophecy on which bereaved hearts are to rest and rejoice till the last trumpet sounds . The unhappy disagreement of two pious women at Philippi is dealt with in words which lead up to the thought of the eternal love of God for His chosen ; as if the very unworthiness of the matter in hand , by a sort of repulsion , drove the inspired thought to the utmost height , without for one moment diverting it from its purpose of peace and blessing . And now , in the passage which is to follow , the thought still keeps its high and holy level . It says no more indeed of the Book of Life . But it unfolds in one sentence after another the manifestation here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It invites Euodia , and Syntyche , and us with them , to the sight of what the believer is called to be , and may be , day by day , as he rejoices in the Lord , and recollects His presence , and tells Him everything as it comes , and so lives " in rest and quietness , " deep in His peace ; and finds his happy thoughts occupied not with the miseries of self-esteem and self-assertion , but with all that is pure and good , in the smile of the God of peace . The passage now to be translated has surely this among its other precious attractions and benefits , that it stands related to what has gone just before . The precepts and promises are not given as it were in the air ; they are occasioned by Euodia and Syntyche , or rather by what they have suggested to St Paul 's mind , the crime and distress of an unchristian spirit in Christians . It is with this he is dealing . And he deals with it not by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the sanctuary of holiness and peace , there to die . With this recollection let us read the words now before us . Ver . 4. +Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I will say+ ( ero ) , +Rejoice+ ; I have said it above , as my antidote-word to every subtle error ; I come back ( palin ) to say it again , as my antidote to self-will . Your Ver . 5. +yieldingness+ , your selflessness , the spirit which will yield in anything that is only of self , for Christ 's sake , +let it be known to all men+ , let it be proved a reality in real life , by all and sundry who have to do with you ; +the Lord is near+ , always beside you , to Ver . 6. know , to love , to elevate , to calm. 8 +About nothing be anxious+ ( merimnate ) ; never let yourselves be burthened and distracted as those who are alone from your Lord ; but in everything+ , however great , however little , +by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him , +and your ( te ) +supplication+ , your definite petitions of Him , +with thanksgiving+ , thanks at least for this , that you have Him to speak to and to trust , +let your requests be made known towards our God+ ( pros ton Theon ) , with perfect simplicity of detail , putting aside all the mysteries of prayer in the Ver . 7. recollection that He bids you pray . +And+ , and thus , not anyhow , but thus , in adoring , trusting communion with Him , +the peace of God+ , the innermost tranquillity caused by contact with Him , breathed by His Spirit into ours , the peace +which transcends all mind+ , for no reasoning can explain and define its nature and its consciousness , +shall+ ( it is nothing less than a promise ) +safeguard+ , as garrison , as sentinel ( phrouresei ) , +your hearts+ , in all their depths of will , affection , and reflexion , +and your thoughts+ , the very workings of those hearts in detail , +in Christ Jesus+ . In Him you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , while there you rest , this sacred keeper watches the door ; the peace of God is sentinel . Such was to be the condition for the true play of the inner life ; such , not in a dream but at Philippi , were to be their " hearts and thoughts , in Christ Jesus " ; thus happy , gentle , unanxious , prayerful , thankful , all the day . And now , what is to be the matter for such conditions , the food for such thinking and such willing ? There is to be no vacuum , called peace . These " hearts and thoughts " are to be active , discursive , reflective ; " reckoning , " " calculating , " " reasoning out " ( logixesthai ) innumerable things  --  all with a view , of course , to the life-long work of serving God and man . Ver . 8 . For , +finally , brethren , all things that are true , all things that are honourable+ , serious , sacred , venerable , self-respectful , +all things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , +all things that are pure+ , clean words , clean deeds , +all things that are amiable+ , gracious , kindly ; for manner as well as matter falls under the will of God ; +all things that are sweet to speak of , things prompting a loving and noble tone of conversation ; +whatever virtue there is+ , truly so called , not in the pagan sense of self-grounded vigour , even in right directions , but in that of the energy for right which is found in God ; +and whatever praise there is+ , given rightly by the human conscience to deeds and purposes of good ; +these things think out , reckon , reason on ( logixesthe ) . Let right in all its practical , all its noble forms , be the subject-matter of your considering and designing activities within . Strong , not in yourselves but in your Lord 's presence and His peace , use His strength in you to work out every precept of His Word , every whisper of His Spirit , every dictate of the conscience He has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is no egotism , but as if he would remind them amidst these great generalities of principle that they well knew a human life which strove to realize them in practice . Ver . 9. +The things you learnt+ of me , +and received+ as revealed truth from me , and +heard and saw in me , these things practise+ ( prassette ) , make them the habits of your lives ; and so +the God of peace+ , Author and Giver of peace within , and of harmony around , +shall be with you+ ; your Companion and Guardian , " Lord of the Sabbath " of the soul , secret of the true unity of the group , and of the Church . Thus we read over again this golden chain of " commandments which are not grievous " and " exceeding precious promises . " Few passages of equal length , even in St Paul 's Epistles , at once invite more attention to details of language and convey richer spiritual messages . Very passingly and partially I have noted the more important details of word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It remains to say not what I would but what I can , in brief compass , upon the messages to the Christian 's soul . Let us be quite practical , and let our study take the simplest form . In this wonderful paragraph let us not only wonder ; let us take its sentences as revelations of fact . Here the Holy Spirit through the Apostle sets before us some of the intended facts of the normal Christian life . These precepts were not meant to dissolve into bright dreams ; they were to be obeyed in Philippi then , and in England now ; they were spoken for not ideal but actual human beings , the rank and file of the followers of the Lord . These promises were not meant to be met with an aspiration , followed by a sigh . They were to be received and used , as certainties of the grace of God , " before the sons of men . " Come then to the paragraph once again , to study it with real life in immediate view , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the normal " possibilities of grace , " not for the strong and holy but for the very weak , for those who know that " in their flesh dwelleth no good thing , " but who come to Jesus , and ( if only for very fear and need ) stay by Him . Here then is the fact , first , that the Christian life , as such , is to be , and may be , a life of " joy in the Lord always . " Such is " the Lord " that He is indeed able to be a perpetual cause of joy . The believer has but to recollect HIM , to consider HIM , to converse with HIM , to make use of HIM , in order to have in himself ( not of himself ) " a well of water , springing up unto eternal life . " " In joy and sorrow , life and death , His love is still the same " ; for HE is still the same ; and the believing man is His . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of holy " joy in the Lord always . " It is not a boisterous mirth ; it is pure and chastened ; but it is joy . It is an unfigurative happiness , a deep practical cheerfulness , full of health for him who has it , and a most powerful secret for influence over those who have to do with him . Think of the track of light left behind by lives of holy joy which we have watched ! It was good to be near them . The very things and places round them were warmed and beautified by them . And their source and strength lay , not in the believer , but in " the Lord " ; therefore the way is open for us too ; we may be bearers of such sunshine too , happy and making happy . " By influence of the light divine Let thy own light to others shine ; Reflect all heaven 's propitious rays In ardent love and cheerful praise . " 9 Again , here is the fact that the normal Christian life is , as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in the controlling calm of the nearness of the Lord . The meaning of this " moderation " ( to epieikes ) we have seen ; it is that blessed facility , that unselfish yieldingness , which is not weakness at all but the outcome of the meekness of a heart which Christ has overcome . It is the instinctive spirit , where He is in full command of thought and will , when personal " grievances " cross us , when our personal claims are slighted , our feelings disregarded , and even our legitimate rights overridden . Of course more considerations than one have to be taken as to our action when our rights are overridden . We have to ask whether our yielding will be helpful or hurtful to others ; we have even to ask whether to yield may not do harm to the invader . But these questions , if honestly asked , stand clear of the spirit of self ; they regard others . And wherever they can be so answered as to leave us free to yield in view of others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , shall find it quite possible , in the Lord Jesus , to let our " yieldingness be known unto all men , " in the deep calm of " the Lord at hand . " Yes , this can be so , in the most complicated life , and with the most irritable character , if we will fully " receive the grace of God " ( 2 Cor. vi . 1 ) . And the " all men " who " know " it will note it , and will recognize , sooner or later , the Master in the servant . Yet again , the normal Christian life is given here as a life free from care , from that miserable anxiety , merimna , which blights and withers human happiness far and wide , whether it comes in the form of a weight of large responsibilities or of the most trifling misgivings . " Be careful for nothing " ; " care-ful " in the antique sense of the word ; " burthened with care . " In the modern sense of careful , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least , " " shewing all good fidelity in all things , " " walking circumspectly , " accurately , akribos ( Eph. v. 15 ) , " pleasing the neighbour for his good unto edification , " " whether we eat or drink , doing all to the glory of God , " " watching and praying always . " But in the other sense we are , we positively are , enjoined to live " without carefulness " ; to take pains , but in peace ; to work and serve , but at rest within ; to " provide , " to think beforehand ( pronoeisthai , Rom. xii . 17 ) , but in the repose of soul given by the fact that with the morrow will come the Lord , or rather that He will walk with us and lead us into it . It is a great triumph to live such a life ; but it is His triumph , not ours . Let us leave Him free ( may the word be used in reverence ? ) to win it ; to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burthen daily " ( so we may render Ps. lxxviii. 19 ) . Nothing will much more glorify Him in eyes that notice our daily walk than to see us always taking care , yet always unanxious while we take it . " In the calm of sweet communion Let thy daily work be done ; In the peace of soul-outpouring Care be banish 'd , patience won . " 10 The sweet hymn leads us straight to the next point . The normal Christian life , according to this paragraph , is a life of perpetual , habitual , converse with God , converse about everything . And such converse has everything to do with the unanxious life . The man who would be unanxious is to cultivate the practice of reverent , worshipping ( proseuche ) , thankful , detailed prayer ; so shall he enter into peace . Here is a large subject ; it is inexhaustible ; from every aspect prayer is wonderful ; and there are many kinds and types of prayer , as regards the act and exercise of it . But the all-important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the great means to a divine unanxious peace ; and that we are called to pray in the sense of " making our requests known in everything . " Shall we , in the grace of God , set ourselves to do it ? Shall we remember the presence of the Hearer , and " practise the Presence " ? Shall we act upon it ? More , and more , and always more , shall we really " in everything " turn to Him , and tell Him ? Thought is good , but prayer is better ; or rather , thought in the form of prayer is , in ten thousand cases , the best thought . Let us make it a rule , God helping , " in everything " which calls for pause , for consideration , for judgment , to pray first and then to think . Innumerable futile thoughts will thus be saved , thoughts made fruitless by a hurry of spirit , or a heat , or a hardness , which puts all our view out of order . We shall indeed need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea than the act of speaking to the unseen Friend , nothing is more easy , alas , to let slip in practice . But the pains will be infinitely worth the while ; it will be all applied at the right point . Wonderful result , guaranteed here by the Hearer of prayer ; His " peace shall safeguard our hearts and our thoughts , in Christ Jesus , " in the living Sanctuary of security and strength . There all our powers shall be active , yet at rest ; dealing with a thousand things , yet always conditioned by Him who is " the One Thing Needful . " Unity will lie at the heart of multiplicity ; Christ will rule life from the centre . Lastly , the normal Christian life , thus conditioned , is a life whose mental energies ( logixesthe ) are fully at work , always gravitating towards purposes and actions true , pure , gracious , virtuous , commendable ; " sowing the fruit of righteousness in peace , " at the side of " the God of peace . " True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are either perfectly secular in themselves ( he may be a servant , he may be a man of business , he may be a physician , he may be a minister of state ) ; or which are evil in themselves ( he may be an investigator , or a judge , of crime ) . Nevertheless , this will not deflect the true current of the mind . These " thinkings " will all find place and direction in the " thought " which remembers that the thinker is the Lord 's , and that in his whole life he is to be true to the Lord 's glory and the good of man . " The God of peace will be with him " wherever he goes , whatever he does ; deep below the surface , but so as to control the whole surface all the while . Such is the Christian life , where the Christian " stands firm in the Lord . " It was thus at Philippi . In the early generations of the Church ( let the Apology of Aristides alone be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to an extent most memorable , in at least very many Christian circles . It is thus still , in many an individual life . But is it in any sense whatever thus in the rule and average or even earnest Christian lives ? Is it thus in ours ? " Henceforth , let us live  --  not unto ourselves , but unto Him who died for us , and rose again . " To Him , in Him , by Him , we are bound to live so ( Rom. viii . 12 , opheileta ) , we are able to live so . Let us " present ourselves to God " ( Rom. vi . 13 ) , watching and praying , and it shall be . " Two arms I find to hold Thee fast , Submission meek and reverent faith ; Held by Thy hand that hold shall last Through life and over death . " Not me the dark foe fears at all , But hid in Thee I take the field ; Now at my feet the mighty fall , For Thou hast bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Euodias , which would be a man 's name , a contraction of Euodianus . Euodias as a fact is not found in inscriptions . Euodia on the other hand is a known feminine name ; and the words just following ( " help these women " ) make it practically certain that the two persons just named were both female converts . ( Euodian of course may be the accusative of either Euodias or Euodia. ) 2 Cor Dei in verbis Dei ; Gregory the Great 's noble description of the Bible , in a letter to the courtier Theodoras , begging him to study daily " the Letter of the heavenly Emperor . " 3 " I exhort , " R.V. A slightly tenderer word seems better to represent parakalein in this personal connexion . " I beseech " ( A.V. ) is perhaps rather too tender . 4 " As a curiosity of interpretation , Ellicott ( see also Lightfoot , p. 170 ) mentions the conjecture of Schwegler , that Euodia and Syntyche are really designations of Church-parties the imagined Petrine and Pauline parties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orthodoxy ; Syntyche= ' Combination , ' of Gentiles and Jews on equal terms . This theory of course regards our Epistle as a fabrication of a later generation , intended as an eirenicon . ' What will not men affirm ? ' " ( Note on ver . 2 in The Cambridge Bible for Schools ) . 5 We know nothing for certain of this person . Lightfoot suggests that it was Epaphroditus , whom St Paul would thus commission not only orally but in writing , as a sort of credential . One curious and most improbable conjecture is that it was St Paul 's wife . Renan ( Saint Paul , p. 148 ) renders here ma chere epouse. 6 Perhaps the bishop of Rome of a later day . So Origen and Eusebius . But we can not be certain of the identity . 7 " Cp . Rev. iii . 5 , xiii . 8 , xvii. 8 , xx . 12 , 15 , xxi. 27 ; and Luke x. 20 . And see Exod. xxxii. 32 , 33 ; Ps. lxix. 28 , lxxxvii. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 ; Dan . xii . 1 . The result of the comparison of these passages with this seems to be that St Paul here refers to the Lord 's ' knowledge of them that are His ' ( 2 Tim . ii . 19 : cp . John x. 27 , 28 ) , for time and eternity . All the passages in the Revelation , save iii . 5 , are clearly in favour of a reference of the phrase to the certainty of the ultimate salvation of all true saints . . . so too Dan . xii . 1 and Luke x. 20 . Rev. iii . 5 appears to point in another direction ( see Trench on that passage ) . But in view of the other mentions of the ' Book ' in the Revelation the language of iii . 5 may well be only a vivid assertion that the name in question shall be found in an indelible register . . . .

" ( Note in The Cambridge Bible for Schools. ) 8 I think the Apostle has in mind Ps. cxix. 151 , where the Septuagint version has su eggus ei , Kurie . He is thinking of " the secret of the Presence " ( Ps. xxxi. 20 ) . We need not shut out the calming thought of the Lord 's approaching Return ; but it does not seem to be the leading thought here . 9 Bishop Ken . 10 G. M. Taylor , in Hymns of Consecration , 349. 11 In the House of the Pilgrimage .

" Is the heart a living power ? self-entwin 'd , its strength sinks low ; It can only live in loving , and by serving love will grow . " E. RUNDLE CHARLES . CHAPTER XII THE COLLECTION FOR ST PAUL : THE FAREWELL PHILIPPIANS iv . 10-23 The Philippian alms  --  His sense of their faithful love  --  He has received in full  --  A passage in the Scriptural manner  --  The letter closes  --  " Christ is preached "  --  " Together with them " The work of dictation is nearly done in the Roman lodging . The manuscript will soon be complete , and then soon rolled up and sealed , ready for Epaphroditus ; he will place it with reverence and care in his baggage , and see it safe to Philippi . But one topic has to be handled yet before the end . " Now concerning the collection ! " Epaphroditus , who had brought with him to Rome the loving alms of the Philippian believers , must carry back no common thanks to them . All honour shall be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the Lord this service in him ; they shall know how it has rejoiced and warmed his heart ; they shall be made very sure that " inasmuch as they have done it to " their Missionary " they have done it to " their KING . We do not know how much the money amounted to . It was not improbably a substantial sum . Among the contributors might be Lydia , whose means may well have been comfortable ; and the Keeper of the Prison would be by no means a beggar : what gratitude to St Paul glowed in both those hearts ! But not in theirs only ; the rank and file of the mission would do all that love could do for the man who had manifested JESUS to them . And when that is the spirit , the liberality will often be surprising . Not long ago in one of our North American missions a small meeting of poor Christian Indians apologized for the scantiness of their collection for missionary objects ; it was worth only L7 ; they would do better the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was precious with the weight of love . And no doubt it was exceedingly useful practically . It would secure for the imprisoned missionary many alleviating personal comforts , and part of it would probably be spent upon the work of evangelization in Rome and its neighbourhood ; for then as now work inevitably meant expense . Ver . 10. +But+ , to turn now from teaching to thanking  --  +I rejoice+ ( echaren : the English present best gives the point of the " epistolary " aorist ) +in the Lord+ , in our union of heart and life with Him , +greatly , that now at length+ , after an interval which was no fault of yours , +you have blossomed , out1 into+ loving +thought on my behalf+. +With a view to this+ ( eph o ) , this effort to aid me , you +were , I know+ ( kai ) , +taking thought+ ( ephroneite ) , even when you made no sign ; but you were at a loss for opportunity+ for the transmission ; no bearer for your bounty could be spared , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tone of need+ ( kath usteresin ) , as if I had been wondering , and fretting , and suspecting you of forgetfulness or of parsimony ; no , I have been in a happier mood than that ; for I , for my part+ ( ego : slightly emphatic ) , have learnt ( emathon : our perfect tense best gives this aorist ) +to be , in my actual circumstances , self-sufficing+ ( autarkes ) ; " carrying with me all I have " ; independent , not of grace , but of surroundings . Ver . 12. +I know both+ ( kai , not de ) +how to run low , 2 and how to run over+ , as I do now , with your bounty ; and both experiences need a teaching from above if they are to be rightly borne . +In everything and in all things+ , in the details and in the total , I have been let into the secret , I have been initiated into the " mystery , " 3 +of being full fed and of being hungry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all things I am strong in Him who makes me able. +4 But not even this joyful testimony to the enabling presence of his Lord must divert his thought from the loving act of the Philippians . He seems about to dilate on the glorious theme of what he can be and do in Christ ; the wonder of that experience on which he entered at the crisis detailed in 2 Cor. xii . is surely powerfully upon him ; the " My grace is sufficient for thee " ; the sense of even exultation in weakness and imperfection , " that the power of Christ may overshadow " him . But all this leaves perfectly undisturbed his delicate sympathy with the dear Macedonian converts . And so he will assure them that no spiritual " sufficiency " can blunt the sense of their generous kindness . Ver . 14. +Yet you did well+ , you did a fair , good deed , +when you joined together+ ( sunkoinonesantes ) +in participating in my tribulation+ , with the partnership of a sympathy which feels the suffering it relieves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thought on your previous bounties , which may as it were correct ( de ) the thought that I needed this last bounty to assure me of your love , ) you know , +Philippians , 5 that in the beginning of the Gospel+ , in the early days of the mission in your region , +when I left Macedonia+ , parting from you on my way south , in order to quit Macedonia ( Roman Northern Greece ) for Achaia ( Roman Southern Greece ) , via Thessalonica and Beroea , 6 +no church participated with me+ , helped me in my labours , +in the matter of giving and taking+ , ( they giving and I taking the needed monetary aid , ) but you alone+ . But Ver . 16. you did so ; +because even in Thessalonica+ ; even when I was still there , in a place which was but ninety miles away , 7 and in the same province still ; twice over ( kai hapax kai dis ) +you sent+ aid +to my need+ , within the few weeks which I spent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmly expressed gratitude may conceivably be mistaken for an indirect petition , " thanks for favours to come .

" 10 +But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I and you are alike the dear children , +be the glory+ , the praise for this and for all like acts of His children 's love , for ever and ever+ ; " to the ages of the ages , " the endless cycles of eternal life , in which shall it be fully seen how He was the Secret of all the holiness of all His saints . Amen . So the utterance of thanks for a loving and liberal collection closes . Here is another case of the phenomenon we have seen already  --  the beautiful skill with which a local and personal incident is used as the occasion for a whole revelation of grace and truth . We can easily imagine a gift like that which came from Philippi acknowledged with a few cordial words which would adequately express gratitude and pleasure , but would otherwise terminate wholly in themselves . How different is this paragraph ! Throughout it , side by side , run at once the most perfect and delicate human courtesy and considerateness , and suggestions of eternal and spiritual relations , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of the Lord , and the promises of grace , and the hope of glory . This message of thanks gives us , just in passing , such oracles of blessing as , " I can do all things in Him that strengtheneth me , " and " My God shall supply all your need . " It is on one side a model of nobility and fineness of human thought and feeling , on the other an oracle of God . This is just in the manner of Scripture . " Never book spake like this Book . " Now the close comes . The greetings which those who are one in the Lord can not but send to one another in His name , have to be spoken , and then the scribe 's pen will rest . Ver . 21. +Salute every saint in Christ Jesus+ , every holy one of your circle , holy because in Him ; pass the greetings round from my heart to each member of the Church . And as I write , the Christians now around me , my personal friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +there salute you all the brethren who are with me+ . And not they only , but all the believers of the Roman mission , represented around me in my chamber as I dictate , do the same ; and among them one class asks to join with special warmth ; +there+ Ver . 22. +salute you all the saints , but particularly those who belong to ( oi ek ) +the household of the Emperor+ ( kaisaros ) ; the Christians gathered from the retainers of the Palace ; peculiar in their circumstances of temptation , and quickened thereby to a special warmth of faith and love. 11 Nothing is left now but the final message from the Lord Himself ; the invocation of that " grace " which means in fact no abstract somewhat but His living Self , present in His people 's inmost being , to vivify and to bless . Ver . 23. +The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. 12 Amen. + The voice is silent ; the pen is laid aside . In due time the papyrus roll , inestimable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps as it now lies drying the Missionary and his brethren turn to further conversation on the beloved Philippian Church , and recall many a scene in the days that are over , and which are now gliding far into the past of the crowded years ; and they speak again of the brightness of Philippian Christian life , and the shadows that lie on it here and there ; and then , while the Praetorian sentinel looks on in wonder , or perhaps joins in as a believer , they pray together for Philippi , and pour out their praises to the Father and the Son , and anticipate the day of glory . It is all over now ; it all happened very long ago . But though that blessed group of our elder brethren " are all gone into the world of light " these many more than eighteen hundred human years , that Letter is our contemporary still . " The word of God liveth and abideth for ever " ( 1 Pet . i. 23 ) ; it is never out of date , never touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of farewells , and waxings old , and vanishings away . To us to-day , so near the twentieth century , the Epistle to the Philippians is immortal , modern , true for our whole world and time . And what is its secret , its elixir of undying life ? It is the Name of Jesus Christ . It is that these pages are the message of " the chosen Vessel " about that Name . Our studies in the Epistle shall close with that reflexion . The incidental topics and interests of the document are numerous indeed ; but the main theme is one , and it is Jesus Christ . From first to last , under every variety of reference , " Christ is preached . " Let me quote from a Sermon preached many years ago , the last of a series in which I attempted to unfold the Epistle to a Christian congregation in the beloved Church of Fordington , Dorchester , then my Father 's cure and charge . " The mere number of mentions of the Saviour 's name is remarkable . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is to say , it occurs , amidst all the variety of subjects , on an average of about once in every two or three verses . This is indeed perfectly characteristic , not of this Epistle only but of the whole New Testament . What the Apostles preached was not a thing but a Person ; Christ , Christ Jesus , Christ Jesus the Lord . " But let us not look only on this frequency of mention . Let us gather up something of what these mentions say ' concerning the King . ' " The writer begins with describing himself and his associates as the servants , the absolute bondmen , of Jesus Christ . And truly such servants witness to the worthiness of their Master . " He addresses those to whom he writes as saints , as holy ones , in Jesus Christ . Their standing , their character , their all , depends on Him ; on union with Him , on life in Him . Without Him , apart from Him , they would not be saints at all . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of Jesus Christ . ' My bonds in Christ ' is his remarkable description of captivity . And the result of that captivity was , to his exceeding joy , just this , amidst a great variety of conditions in detail , including some exquisite trials to patience and peace : ' Christ is being preached ' ; ' that Christ may be magnified in my body , whether by life or death . ' He is kept absolutely cheerful and at rest ; and the secret is Jesus Christ . " He has occasion to speak of his trial , with its delays , and its suspense between life and death . The whole is full of Jesus Christ . ' To me to live is Christ ' ; He fills , and as it were makes , life for me . ' And to die is gain '  --  why ? Because ' to depart and to be with Christ is far , far better . ' The dilemma in which he stands ( for he is ' in a strait betwixt the two ' ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ more , Christ by faith and Christ by sight . " He dwells , in various places , on the life and duties of the Philippians . His precepts are all this , in effect  --  Christ applied to conduct . ' Let your life-walk be as it becometh the Gospel of Christ ' ; ' Filled with the fruit of righteousness which is through Jesus Christ ' ; ' It is granted to you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for His sake . ' " In particular , he has to press on them the homely duty of practical self-forgetfulness . He takes them for model and motive to the heaven of heavens , and shews them ' Christ Jesus ' there , as for us men and for our salvation He prepares to come down , and comes . ' Let this mind be in you , ' as you contemplate the original Glory , the amazing Incarnation , the atoning Death , of Christ Jesus . " He expresses hopes , intentions , resolutions , as to his own actions . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus , ' ' I trust in the Lord to come myself shortly . ' " Does he speak of the believer 's joy ? ' We rejoice in Christ Jesus , ' ' Rejoice in the Lord alway , and again I say , Rejoice . ' Does he speak of pardon and of peace ? ' I counted all things but loss that I might win Christ , and be found in Him , having the righteousness which is of God by faith . ' Does he speak of knowledge , and of power ? ' That I might know Christ , and the power of His resurrection , and the fellowship of His sufferings , being made conformable unto His death ' ; ' I can do all things in Christ which strengtheneth me . ' " He speaks of a holy immortality , of eternal glory , and of pleasures for evermore . It is no vague aspiration ; it is a sure and certain hope ; and it is altogether in Jesus Christ . ' Our home , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ , who shall change the body of our humiliation into likeness to the body of His glory , according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto  --  Himself . ' " He bids his beloved converts stand fast ; it is ' in the Lord . ' He bids them be of one mind ; it is ' in the Lord . ' He bids them be always calm , always self-forgetting ; ' the Lord is at hand . ' He assures them of an all-sufficient resource for their every need ; ' My God shall supply all , according to His riches , in glory , in Christ Jesus . ' " His last message of blessing brings together their inmost being and this same wonderful Person ; ' The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen . ' . . . " What a witness it all is to the glory of our beloved Redeemer ; to the majesty of His Person ; to the fulness and perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strength , of the faith which is in Him ! There is no inflation or rhetoric in the language of the Epistle about Him . Glowing with love , it is all clear and calm . Yes , for Christ Jesus is not a phantom of the fancy ; a hope floating on the thick waves of a wild enthusiasm . He is an anchor , sure and steadfast . Blessed are they who ride secure on the deep , held fast by Him . " The Epistle witnesses to Him as to a Treasure worth all our seeking , at any cost ; infinitely precious to our joyful finding ; infinitely deserving of our keeping , of our holding , our ' apprehending , ' as He in His mercy has laid hold of us , and will keep hold of us , even to the end ; ' unto the day of Jesus Christ . ' As then , so now ; ' He help 'd His saints in ancient days Who trusted in His name ; And we can witness to His praise , His love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring home to our spirit this great witness of the Epistle ; it has its perfect adaptation to each heart , to every life , to every hour . " Then hereafter we shall give God thanks yet better for ' Philippians , ' as we too enter , late or soon , into that world where the Apostle , and Timotheus , and Epaphroditus , and Euodia , and Syntyche , and Clement , and the saints of Caesar 's household , have so long beheld the Lord . In that land of light we , who have believed , shall rest with them . We shall know them . In the long leisure of endless life we shall enjoy their company , amidst the multitudinous congregation of the just made perfect . There we shall understand how , under the infinite differences of our earthly conditions , the one Hand led them and led us along the one way of salvation to the one end of everlasting life . Above all , we there , with them , shall know JESUS CHRIST , even as we are known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him , and to Him alone , from all His servants , from Hebrew , and Roman , and Philippian , and Englishman , and African , from ancients and moderns , wise and ignorant , of all kinds and times , was due the whole praise of their whole salvation . ' Conflicts and trials done His glory they behold , Where JESUS and His flock are one , One Shepherd and one fold . ' " 1 Anethalete to huper emou phronein . Literally , " you shot forth ( as a branch ) thought in my behalf . " ( The English perfect best represents this aorist . ) The phrase is unmistakably pictorial , poetical . If I read it aright , it is touched with a smile of gentle pleasantry ; the warm heart comes out in a not undesigned quaintness of expression . 2 tapeinousthai is used in classical Greek of the falling of a river in drought . Perhaps such an image is present in the language here . 3 Memuemai : the verb whose root is that of mysterion , mysterium , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were systems of religious belief and practice derived , perhaps , from pre-Hellenic times , and jealously guarded from common knowledge by their votaries . Admission into their secrets , as into those of Freemasonry now , was sought by people of all kinds , from Roman consuls and emperors downwards ; with the special hope of freedom from evil in this life and the next . St Paul 's use of this phenomenon to supply language for Christian experience is beautifully suggestive . The knowledge of the peace of God is indeed an open secret , open to " whosoever will " " learn of Him . " But it is a secret , a mystery , none the less . 4 The word Christo should be omitted from the reading , though perfectly right as a note or explanation .  --  The iochus is the forth-putting of the dunamis  --  the action of the faculty . He is ready to act ( or to bear ) in a power always latent , always present , through his union with his Lord . The " all things " so met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of God , the choice of the Master for the servant in the way of circumstance and trial ; not the all things of the mere wish or ambition of the servant . 5 Philippesioi : the Greek form represents a Latin Philippenses , by which the residents in the Roman " colony " would call themselves . So Corinthiensis means not a born Corinthian but a settler at Corinth.  --  Greek tends to represent a Latin syllable - ens by - es : so Klemes , Clemens. 6 See Acts xvii. 1-15. 7 On the Egnatian road . He made three stages of the distance ; Amphipolis , Apollonia , Thessalonica. 8 Ton karpon ton pleonazonta eis logon hymon . I venture to render these words as above , as a monetary phrase , relating to principal and interest . It is true that karpos is not found used in the sense of interest , for which the regular word is tokos . But it would easily fit into the language of the money-market . And St Chrysostom 's comment here seems to show that he , a Greek , understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tokos ) . 9 For osme euodias see Eph. v. 2 . The phrase is common in the Septuagint to render the Hebrew " savour of rest , " the fume of the altar pictorially represented as smelt by the Deity . 10 This reference of doxa seems better than that which would connect it only with the eternal future , the glory of heaven , and make the sentence mean that He would hereafter requite them there . He would indeed do so . But the phrase pleroun pasan chreian hardly suggests that thought here . 11 " Bishop Lightfoot . . . ( Philippians , pp. 171-178 ) has shewn with great fulness of proof that ' the household of Caesar ' was a term embracing a vast number of persons , not only in Rome but in the provinces , all of whom were either actual or former slaves of the Emperor , filling every possible description of office more or less domestic . The Bishop illustrates his statements from the . . . burial inscriptions of members of the ' Household ' found . . . near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of coincidences with the list in Rom. xvi . . . . Amplias , Urbanus , Apelles , Tryphaena , Tryphosa , Patrobas , Philologus . . . . Bishop Lightfoot infers from this whole evidence the great probability that the ' saints ' greeted in Rom. xvi . were , on the whole , the same ' saints ' who here send greeting from Rome . . . . Their associations and functions , not only in the age of Nero but in the precincts of his court , and probably ( for many of them ) within the chambers of his palace , give a noble view in passing of the power of grace to triumph over circumstances , and to transfigure life where it seems most impossible " ( Note in The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges ) .

" ( THE SOLDIER loquitur . ) Father , the dawn is near ! the shield Of Luna sinks remote and pale O'er Tiber and the Martial field ; The breeze awakes ; the cressets fail : This livelong night from set of sun Here have we talk 'd : thy task is done . But yesterday I smil 'd or frown 'd To watch thy audience , soon and late , With scroll and style embattl 'd round In barbarous accents ply debate ; While this would chide , and that would start Sudden , as sword-struck in the heart . I laugh 'd aside , or , tir 'd , withdrew From the strange sound in waking dreams To Umbrian hills  --  the home I knew  --  The cottage by Mevania 's streams : ' T was hush 'd at length : the guests were flown , And thou wast left and I alone .

These ears were dull to Grecian speech , This heart more dull to aught but sin ; Yet the great Spirit bade thee reach , Wake , change , exalt , the soul within : I 've heard ; I know ; thy Lord , ev'n He , JESUS , hath look 'd from heaven on me .
