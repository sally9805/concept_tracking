AND YALE REVIEW . No . CCLX . NOVEMBER , 1891 . ARTICLE 1. - THE OFFICIAL BALLOT IN ELECTIONS . THE compulsory use in elections of a single official ballot known as " the blanket ballot " has now been adopted in thirty States not including New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut , where " multiple ballots , " or a separate ballot for each political organization , are required . It may therefore be regarded as having substantially superseded the former methods of suffrage in this country , and its operation and probable effect are matters of deep importance and interest . Ever since its introduction some four years ago , its advocates have claimed that it has given universal satisfaction wherever tried , and that it has in every State worked with perfect facility and success . Nevertheless each successive legislature in those same States has been kept busy in altering and amending it , and the process seems still not quite perfected . The New York Tribune , a conspicuous advocate of the official ballot , has been unremitting in such assertions editorially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to news and corre // spondence by no means confirms these enthusiastic generalities . We have before us a collection of clippings taken almost entirely from those columns and exhibiting by actual facts complications and defects in the system at every stage of its operation . It is upon these hard facts of experience thus collected that the present Article is principally founded . Without expecting to dampen the zeal of those who laud the sovereign efficacy of the official ballot as a panacea for all political evils , and at the risk of being ranked among the traitorous enemies of all " genuine ballot reform , " we propose to give very briefly some of our reasons for believing that its use , whether in a blanket or multiple form , is wrong in principle , and must sooner or later be abandoned in practice . We venture to add the prediction that instead of purifying and simplifying our elections it will sow them with dragon 's teeth which will spring up in abundant future crops of corruption , controversy , and danger . The first noticeable feature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes which it professes primarily to seek , viz : the right of independent voting , and the overthrow of " the machine " in politics . As the very first step in its operation , it elevates the caucus into a position of despotic and legalized sovereignty and fastens " bossism " like an old man of the sea on the shoulders of party politics ! This effect is unavoidable from the very nature of the system . In order to keep the official ballot within practical dimensions the law necessarily requires that it shall contain such names only as have been regularly nominated by the established parties and by duly organized independeiit political associations . Thus the manipulation of primaries and nominating conventions becomes as important and exact a science as the management of the election itself . None can vote in them by law except regularly enrolled members of the party , and none can enroll except such as are of recognized partisan fidelity . The rules for calling , organizing , and conducting caucuses are all prescribed by law , or under legal sanctiOn , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " regular , " have legal validity . Not only is the composition of the caucus thus in the control of the // " machine , " but the time for calling it is in its hands , and ordinarily that time is fixed at as late a day as possible so as to leave the least opportunity for the organization of independent movements . These movements in order to secure a representation on the official ballot must be supported by a certain number ( specified by law ) of duly qualified and certified electors , signing their names to the independent nominations . The number required varies in different cases , but is necessarily placed high enough to save the ballot from being encumbered with an undue number of tickets , thus practically preventing dissatisfied independents from placing a ticket in the field except through the organization of a new political party within a period of time which is ordinarily entirely insufficient . Of course this effectually checks the progress of any genuine revolt within the party against the machine . It does not however prevent pretended independent nominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraudulent purposes . This as we learn from the 7*ilnine was done in Massachusetts . So-called independent tickets were framed by political opponents , and signed by the requisite number of electors for a place on the official ballot , in which certain names appeared similar to but not identical with corresponding names on the regular ticket , the object being to deceive the voters and defeat the regular nominees . We might multiply reasons and illustrations to show that the system not only suppresses real independence in voting but facilitates intrigue and fraud in its name . But we must pass hastily to other branches of the sublect . The nominations having been duly received by the designated State officials it devolves upon them to prepare the official ballot , a most delicate and dangerous power , and one which may enable them to practically determine the result of the coming election . If rival factions of the same political party have sent in conflicting tickets each claiming to contain the " regular " nominations of the party , the determination by these officials of the question which ticket shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although they may be personally as well as politically interested in the decision . A complaint bearing on precisely this point was made some // months ago by a correspondent of the New York fliri6une who claimed to have been the regular nominee of a iRepublican caucus . He asserted that one of the State officials who took part in the preparation of the official ballot was the candidate of the opposite party for the same office , and placed upon the ballot instead of the correspondent 's name that of an irregularly nominated candidate as the weaker competitor . Can the political virtue of a board of State officials be always trusted under such opportunities to cripple their opponents ? After all controversies have been decided with regard to the names entitled to appear on the official ballot , the next step relates to its arrangement . If a blanket ballot is prescribed by law , the question arises whether the different candidates shall be grouped according to party or according to the offices to be voted for ? In other words shall each party ticket be printed separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the ballot , all candidates for the same office being placed together ? . If the former method is adopted secrecy in voting is likely to be defeated as will be shown hereafter ; if the latter , the effect will be to confuse the voter and to cause him to commit innumerable errors . Passing by these and the various ingenious plans that have been suggested to solve them as among the unsettled problems of the system , we pause for a moment to refer to the critical character of the task confided to the State authorities in preparing a ballot containing perhaps hundreds of names , to see that every name is so accurately printed that no dispute can arise over it after election . Suppose one name , important or not , should prove to have been omitted from the ballot or to be so incorrectly printed as not to be legally identifiable , or supp6se the ballot to contain any other material defect , not discovered until after it has been distributed . Once issued , it can not be recalled , and as no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to prevent a dispute as to the legality of the eiitire ballot , and the validity of the election ? So also if a fire or other accident in the printing office should prevent a full supply of ballots in time for the election ; or if , through a railway disaster , or the failure of an express messenger , a single town or precinct should be without ballots on election day for even a few hours . Any of these occurrences // in a close presidential election as in that of 1884 might prove to be a matter of national importance and peril . That these suppositions are not entirely fanciful is apparent from the fact reported in the Tribune , that at the last State election in New York , at least one town in the interior was from some oversight entirely unsupplied with official ballots and was compelled to use , in defiance of the law , the usual party tickets . The official ballot when completed is a fearful and wonderful thing both to taxpayers and voters . The enormous cost of its printing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its staunchest advocates . It is claimed , however , that had the official ballot been of the " blanket " instead of the " multiple " kind the expense would have been less , and this is urged as a strong argument for the change . On the contrary , there would seem to be every reason why it should be greater . The amount of printing and the quantity of paper would be exactly the same in both casea while multiple ballots being smaller would use paper in a more economic*d shape , and be printed more rapidly and cheaply on smaller presses . The Tribune states that at the town election of a small town on Long Island the official ballots supplied to each voter when placed together were twelve feet in lengthy and that over a ton of paper was used in preparing them . Would it have been less expensive or more convenient if these twelve feet of tickets had all been printed on one piece of paper , to be handled and pondered over by the voter and afterwards stuffed bodily into the ballot box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next Presidential election . There are thirty-six electors to be voted for and there are likely to be at least five tickets in the field , viz : IRepublican , Democratic , Prohibition , Labor , and Alliance . There will therefore be 180 names upon the ballot and a blank space sufficiently large for 36 names more for independent voting . Such a ballot , allowing room for the party headings and margins , would be at least one foot wide and four feet long . A State election is to be held at the same time , and if as is probable the nominations for this are also to be placed on the same official ballot with those for Presidential electors , the number of names and the size of the document will both be largely increased . // A blanket ballot truly , and likely to act as a wet blanket on the spirits of many an independent or deliberate voter who finds himself with it , in a dim closet required to select and mark the 50 or 60 candidates of his choice , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his ballot in legal form , all within the fewest possible number of minutes or lose his vote . The process of voting the official ballot is admitted even by its admirers to be complicated and slow . The Tribune , in describing the first elections in New York and Rhode Island , reports that many voters , " inclnding the most intelligent , became so rattled and confused that they either deposited their ballots insufficiently marked or became disgusted and refused to vote altogether . " And this , notwithstanding the luminous and voluminous directions which had been published officially and unofficially prior to the election , to explain to the voters how very simple a proceeding it is and how unnecessary to have the slightest trouble about it . But there are thousands of intelligent electors who are not very ready scholars ; not prepared at a moment 's notice to pick out promptly from among hundreds of printed unfamiliar names a particular dozen or two as unfamiliar as the rest , and mark them with precision ; many whose eyesight is more or less defective ; many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flustered in the consciousness that their time is limited and that others are waiting to vote ; and all these classes , as well as careless and stupid voters would be extremely liable to mark wrong names or leave some unmarked or to commit other gross errors which might invalidate their ballots . Accordingly , we learn farther from the Tribune that after the elections above referred to , " a surprisingly large number of the ballots cast proved to be blank or defectively marked . " In Indiana , the rejected ballots were estimated at twenty thousand , and six thousand more were protested as doubtful . In Rhode Island , they amounted to from five to ten per cent . of the whole number polled , and in some districts of New York to a similar proportion . The evil was greatly reduced in New York , however , by the general use of blanket pasters in evasion of the law . These pasters were simply complete party tickets to be plastered bodily over the // face of the official ballot in order to save trouble and confusion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in voting by the increased thickness of the ballot and by the shortness of the time in which it enabled the voter to emerge from the voting booth . For these and other reasons the friends of " genuine ballot reform " demand the abolition of pasters altogether , thus compelling the voter to personally mark every selected name as the law requires , and to make all changes in writing . Whatever other effect such a change might have it would be an additional discouragement to independent voting . it would greatly protract the time required by voters in the booth , probably causing many to lose their votes from inability to write the desired number of names in the time allowed ; it would ensure the loss of many votes through the misrecollection or misspelling of names , and it would facilitate schemes for detailing parties to keep the booths occupied , especially toward the close of the day , so as to exclude or tire out waiting voters of the oppo*ite party . One curious feature of the official ballot as a device to secure absolute secrecy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large class who are ranked as " ignorant or infirm " to disclose their votes for the purpose of having the names properly marked by an election official . Were they allowed to bring their ballots with them already prepared , as under the former methods , this would be unnecessary . In Montana , as reported in the Tribune , this peculiarity was availed of on a large scale with the connivance of " bribed or intimidated voters " to destroy all secrecy in voting in a very simple way . ( The readiness of the voters to defeat the law may perhaps be explained by the fact that the official ballot containing 84 names and 42 spaces was a yard long by twelve inches wide . ) Gangs of men were marched to the polls in charge of party bosses , each voter bearing in his hand a printed slip of the following purport : " II can neither read , write nor speak the English language , and I wish to vote the straight Democratic ticket . " Upon presenting this slip the election officials , in compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot and saw that he voted it . Such an evasion of the law is not easy to be defeated . Election officials in such a case would hardly delay the election // in order to catechise every applicant , nor take the responsibility of making difficult and perhaps dangerous discriminations . True the fraud was punishable in every individual case , provided it could be individually proved , but after the votes are cast and the election is over , the wrong is done and is to all intents and purposes remediless . After the voting comes the counting , a proceeding which experience shows to be perhaps the most critical of any , and where there is the greatest necessity for guarding against fraud , doubt , dispute , or delay . Unfortunately the official ballot system in these particulars is conspicuously deficient . When separate tickets have been voted in the old-time way the counters rapidly sort them into " straight " and " scratched , " and the counting is then a matter of simplicity and despatch . But with the official ballot and especially with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be first inspected , after which almost every separate name must be scanned to distinguish and allot the various markings . These will be often indistinct , often uncertain in position or intent , often double or otherwise fatal to the validity of the vote , as is made evident by the " surprising number " of defective and doubtful ballots reported in the State elections already referred to . The discussions , comparisons , and disputes which must inevitably take place over these among the counters , of course protract the proceeding to an inordinate length . At the last State election in little Rhode Tsland it was forty-eight hours before the result could be ascertained . In Boston the election precincts contained only three hundred voters each , yet it was from three to four hours before the counting was completed . Not only does this long delay in counting give abundant opportunity for the well known fraud of swelling the returns in some districts in order to meet deficiencies in others , but the correctness of the result actually arrived at must depend very largely upon the fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes which will arise over questionable markings or foldings , and upon the validity or invalidity of more or less doubtful ballots . Moreover if the counters , whose office is much like that of a jury , separate during the period of their tedious and exhausting labors , there // is a strong liability to the inroad of outside influences . Apd if they keep together , there is opportunity to tire out the weaker ones into carelessness or undue acquiescence . In any case , if the reported majority is small , there will be abundant grounds for disputing the result upon the ground that the count was inaccurate , that valid ballots were rejected or invalid ones admitted . So many and so complex are the questions of* this sort that can be raised when thousands of votes have been thrown out as defective or doubtful that the majority must be large indeed to preclude that most odious and profitless of all controversies , a disputed election . Then the courts are dragged into the political mire : perhaps legislative deadlocks ensue : and thus the deplorable evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Connecticut are liable to be repeated in every closely contested State . Our limits have greatly narrowed our discussion of the subject and forbid us to extend it further . Enough has been said to indicate why many who earnestly desire such methods of suffrage as will secure an honest vote and a fair count do not believe the official ballot to be in the line of " genuine ballot reform . " Its general adoption is to be regretted not merely on account of its intrinsic defects and dangers , but because it stands in the way of another system which has been tested by experience and been proved to combine the merits of simplicity , efficiency and economy , with that absolute secrecy which the official ballot fails to secure . We mean the compulsory universal use of the official envelope in connection with the retiring booth , as the only apparatus supplied by the State to the voter . Among all the complaints and wr*ngles which have grown out of the late election in Connecticut and which have without one exception been caused by the official ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official envelope and the booth which were also in use . With these provided , the official ballot is superfluous . The infirm and ignorant , even the blind voter needs no assistance and not more than a moment of time , for he brings with him to the polls any baliot that he pleases , prepared if he chooses in the privacy of his own home , and has only to enter the booth and enclose it in the official envelope . He may be furnished with other // ti*kets by bribers , or intimidators , or zealous advisers , and lie may take them all with him into the booth , but when he emerges with his vote enclosed in the sealed envelope no person but himself knows or can know what is contained in that enclosure . As the official envelope renders an official ballot unnecessary , it abrogates also with it those attendant evils which we have considered ; the legal supervision of caucus proceedings , the exclusion of independent tickets from the field unless authorized by State officials , the power in State officials to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk and enormous public expense of printing and distributing ballots , the inevitable confusion and difficulty and delay in the process of voting , the unduly protracted and disputatious work of the counters , and reduces to a minimum the dangers of a disputed election . When every desired object can be attained by so simple a device , a device completely in consonance with our previous electoral methods , why resort to a complex , cumbersome , and impracticable confusion of machinery , which is foreign in origin , foreign to our customs , and not originally designed or adapted to the kind of service to which we apply it ? From the time when the official ballot machinery was imported from Australia and set up in this country , its promoters ' have been incessantly occupied in altering and amending itt , and , like the inventors of perpetual motion contrivances , in adding new devices to improve its operation . We believe the difficulty with it as with the mechanical delusions referred to is that it is founded on an erroneous principle ; and we shall be profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in an exciting and close Presidential election , it does not collapse with a mighty crash and bring general disaster in its ruin .
