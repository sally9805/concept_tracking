txt The suffering Profit destitution among the scattered population of Western Nebraska , of which accounts have appeared in our columns during the last two or three weeks , is the result of poor crops in 1893 and ' an almost total failure of crops last year , in consequence of severe drought , but there are general ' conditions back of this cause which put that section in a position of inability to tide over any temporary stress . Whatever criticism may be involved in the examination of these conditions , which are not confined wholly to that State , need not blunt our sympathy for the suffering people or interfere with generous efforts for their relief . Their need is great , and there is a commission which has now been brought under effective directioh for meeting it with such resources as may be supplied . The people not only need to be saved in many cases from starvation and from exposure to the rigors of a Winter climate , but it is essential that they should obtain in some way seed for new crops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that country , even with a favorable season . Experience has proved that there are large areas in Western Nebraska and Kansas , as in some other regions of the West , upon which crops are uncertain . From the character of the country this was known to be the case before it was settled , and yet it did not deter settlers from occupying it too rapidly and depending for subsistence upon a fair crop every year . No doubt this haste was somewhat stimulated by railroads and land companies , which were eager to " build up the country , " and many of the people started in with a burden of debt , and interest to pay upon mortgages . They were also apt to follow the Western custom of devoting themselves too exclusively to a single crop or a narrow range of crops , and depending too much upon the natural resources of the soil . Variety of crops and skillful cultivation are almost unknown upon the broad reaches of Western land , and that is one reason why ? there is so much up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to move on to unoccupied areas - without much regard to steady productiveness . An oversupply of the wheat market is especially apt to produce distress and discontent , because there is practically nothing to offset a depression in the price of that single staple . The product per acre is much less than it might be under better methods of cultivation , which causes an unnecessary spread of population , and with the small farmer there is little chance of accumulation to tide over a bad season . All this may not appear to have much application to the destitute people in Nebraska , with whom , possibly , no crop would have survived the severe drought of last Summer . But it goes far to account for so many of them being where they are , without having considered the chances of success , and being in no condition to tide over a bad season . With greater variety of crops and with methods of cultivation which would produce better results from the same area , there would be no such haste to occupy land of uncertain value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , upon lands that may produce good crops one year and poor ones another , and occasionally hardly any , there would be a better chance for getting something ahead . Out of this haste for scattering and Spreading , and this depending upon the natural resources of the soil for returns from the one . or two crops for which it is best adapted , have come land " booms " and mortgages , which intensify the condition that follows upon reactions . And out of all these things comes the feverish discontent that craves delusive remedies for an unhealthy state of industrial affairs . On the top of distress in Nebraska we have reports of improvidence in public expenditures , which springs from the same spirit , of multiplied offices to furnish employment at the general expense , of empty Town and County Treasuries , and inability to float bonds for the purpose of affording present relief and supplying seed to the farmers . There is in it all the malady of too much haste in grasping landand reaping the II first fruits of its virgin fertility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural malady in the development of a " new country , " but a preventable one .
