txt The representatives in Washington of the six powers signatory to the Berlin treaty  --  Great Britain , France , Italy , Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Russia  --  have in concert notified this Government of the blockade of Crete , the respective notes of Sir Julian P ; , uncefote , Patenotre , Baron de Fava , Baron von Thiellman , M. Hengelmulle von Hengervar , and M. de Kotzebue having been delivered to Secretary Sherman to-day . They were almost identical , and consisted Of a mere formal announcement of a blockade to Cretan ports against ships under the Greek flag , commencing at 9 o'clock this morning . Merchant vessels of neutral powers , including those of the United States and of the treaty powers , while subject to overhauling by the blockading warships of the concerting fleets , are not to be disturbed in their ordinary commercial occupations if they carry no merchandise Intended for use of the Greeks or insurgents on the island . It is a question whether this Government will give its assent to this form of blockade , which involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a precedent abolishing rights that the United States might not desire to surrender . There is little or no likelihood of an Ame:ican vessels in the Mediterranean are practically ade , for the Stars and Stripes on merchant vessels in the Mediterranean is practically unknown . An indication of this is plven in the records of the Suez Canal , the American flag having passed that highway only three times in 1895 , on two private yachts and one man-of-war , while in 1896 not a single vessel showed our flag in the canal . This year the passage of the cruiser Detroit early next month will probably be the only occasion for showing the American colors in the Red Sea . Around Crete an American ship is rarer than at Suez . Nevertheless , if the United States should even tacitly consent to being kept out of Crete , where there is no pnoclaitned condition of war , any more than there is in Cuba at the present time , such action , it is anticipated by those familiar with international precedents , may establish an awkward precedent in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where American merchant flags are more numerous .
