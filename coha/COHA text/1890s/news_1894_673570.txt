txt The State Democracy seems to have constructed a very good practical working machine . It is a machine of the right kind , based on an enrollment and an actual vote in the election districts . The vote at the primaries held on Tuesday evening was a large one in proportion to the enrollment , and its results are satisfactory and encouraging to the leaders . The three delegates chosen in each election district will meet as Assembly district committees next Monday night to chosise an Executive Committee of sixty , consisting of two members from each Assembly district , and the sixty thus chosen will elect forty more members at large . This will give the organization an Executive Committee of ? Fie hundred members , chosen in such a way as fairly to represent the character and the purposes of the enrolled voters of the party . Some of the best-known Democrats in the city are engaged in the State Democracy movement , men of the highest character and conspicuous for their devotion to the cause of good government . It is avowedly the intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammany as its first work . The form of the declaration signed by all of the enrolled members , in which they declare that they are Democrats and pledging themselves not to support " for municipal office the nominee of any party or faction whose antecedents or practices prove it to have been inimical to the cause of honest city government , " seems to us to shut the way to any alliance between the State Democracy and the Republicans in the municipal field , excepting , of course , an alliance in support of a Democratic candidate . There are several new organizations in the field , however , notably the German-American Union , which is entirely independent of party , and through a coalition with some of these the State Democracy may build up a formidable anti-Tammany party . Much depends upon its management .
