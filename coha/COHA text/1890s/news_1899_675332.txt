txt Richard Croker thinks that the Mazet committee is a good thing for the Democrats . As campaign material , he regards it as the best vote-producing argument that Tammany can possibly mare use of . He said yesterday that the Republicans had an idea that the investigation would result in bringing upon Tammany such public odium that the people would rise up , as in the case of the Tweed ring , and cast it out of office . The sword has been turned upon those who first drew it , according to the Tammany chief , and he is of the opinion that the public inquiry into the city administration has cost the Republicans so dear that it will insure their defeat in this campaign . " I see , " said Mr. Croker yesterday afternoon , " that Mr. Moss now says he will call Gen. Tracy , though the committee still seems to fight shy of Senator Platt . Now , the Senator is the man for them . If they Were honestly engaged in the work of investigation , they would have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal about affairs in this city . It is ridiculous for Mr. Moss and Mr. Mazet to say that if any one can give them a good reason for calling Platt they will examine him . The people have n't got to supply the committee with reasons for its action . It is there to make the investigation , and should conduct it so that it will develop the whole truth . " The members of the committee say that they will examine Gen. Tracy on Ramapo . They refused to call him for a long time , and now they say that he will be examined thoroughly about the whole affair . This is another of their tricks . They are only seeking to throw the public off the scent of Mr. Platt . They think that if they get Tracy on the stand the people will forget about Platt ; but they wo n't . They know that Platt is the one to tell some interesting facts that can not be told so well by any one else , and they will not feel that ' the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stand and puts him through a searching examination . " They say Platt knows nothing about the city administration . Does n't he ? The committee could , if it wanted to , make him give up some mighty interesting information . The-e is that Ramapo deal , and the Astoria Gas bill . Platt and Platt 's firm fathered both schemes . Platt and his firm were in control of the Legislature and of the Governor . Both of those schemes closely affected the interests of this city . Why do n't the committee have Mr. Platt tell about how they were hatched , and how his firm tried to have them rushed through ? " The Republicans got up the committee as a campaign committee . It was one of that party 's ways of having its campaigning ' work clone at the expense of the people . I think they realize now , however , that the committee has been the best thing , Politically , for Tammany , that could have happened . It has attempted to besmirch this organization , but it has only helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The whole affair is a curious mixture of Republican politics . The - Mazet committee is only a sub-firm of the Platt Legislature , and the sub-firm will report to the Legislature , and the Legislature will report to the big firm of Tracy , Boardman &; Platt . " The reassembling of the Mazet investigating committee next Tuesday is expected to be marked by the development of a much more aggressive attitude on the part of Tammany Hall . Mr. Croker has determined to force the fighting in the very ranks of the committee itself , it is said , and Benjamin Hoffman , the Tammany representative on the committee , will be expected to offset the efforts to furnish Republican campaign material in the week preceding election , which Messrs . Quigg , Moss , and Mazet are accused of planning . Speaking of the proposed calling of Gen. B. F. Tracy to testify concerning the Ramapo Company , Mr. Hoffman said yesterday that he should insist on Senator Platt and ex-Gov . Morton being calied  --  also , as material witnesses in the Ramapo inquiry . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , " said Mr. Hoffman , " I intend to see that they are cross-examined thoroughly . What we want to get at is the truth , and the whole truth , about this Ramapo business . We ca n't see any justice in Mr. Moss 's examining Democratic witnesses in one way and Republican witnesses in another . The difference in Mr. Moss 's manner when Democratic heads of departments were on the stand and when Frank H. Platt and certain other Republicans were there , was notorious . If Mr. Moss does not do his duty in examining Gen. Tracy , I shall have some questions to ask myself . I do n't intend that his examination shall be as one-sided as was Frank Platt 's . " Mr. Hoffman also wanted to know why the committee did n't look into the WillisPhilips scandal in the old City of Brooklyn . " I can tell you why , " he said . " It was because these men were defended by Tracy , Boardman &; Platt . " Some of the Tammany leaders have an idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , as a last expiring effort to influence the election . QUIGG DRIVES AT CROKER AGAIN . Says He Receives Corruption Funds from Illegal Resorts . President Lemuel E. Qutgg of the Republican County Committee yesterday directly charged Richard Croker with receiving corruption funds from illegal resorts . Mr. Quigg said that Mr. Croker might as well deny his own existence as to deny his Organization 's collusion with criminals . Then he made these specific charges : " Mr. Croker undertakes to say , in the face of all the evidence produced before the Mazet committee , that these poolrooms , gambling houses , and other infamous resorts do not exist . It is part of the Tammany plan of government for such places to exist . They are necessary to the Tammany system . Their employes are appointed by the Tammany district leader as directly as he appoints watchmen on the Amsterdam Avenue improvement . He fixes their salaries , too , and the poolroom keeper pays them , and then he sends them up in the Nineteenth Assembly District to hire a room and register from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the Tammany plan of conducting the town and its affairs . " Tammany could no more get along without the poolrooms and the gambling houses than they could get along without Tammany . Mr. Croker asks me to give the name of the man who is getting the $300 subscriptions from those places for Tammany Hall . I do not know who is getting the money , but I do know who has earned it . and if he is letting any one else get it he is a bigger fool than the people of New York take him to be . " TRIAL OF ELECTION CASES . Mr. Crolcf , r Says .. he Republicans ' Will Want Both Judge and Jury . Mr. Croker was frank yesterday in the expression of his views upon the action of Gov . Roosevelt in selecting a Republican Judge to come to this city to try election cases . " This is another instance of Republican I interference in the affairs of this city , " he said . " I suppose they will want a Republican jury to pass upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violating the laws . After a while the Republicans , failing to get control of this city by open and honest means . will try to manage the interests of the municipality from up the State , having their farmer legislators gekrern us , as if we were unable to govern ou ) - i selves .
