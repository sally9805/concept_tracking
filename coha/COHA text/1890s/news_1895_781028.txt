This made Mr. Hamilton angry , and he insisted on going to court , but finally concluded to accept the Sergeant 's disposition of the case . Shotwell sent for several friends to give bail , but as none of them could be found , Mr. Hamilton went on his bond , and he was released to appear in the Jefferson Market Police Court this morning .
