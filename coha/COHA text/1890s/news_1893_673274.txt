txt A peculiar accident has taken place NEW-ORLEANS.in the United States Mint here . 1 In one of the vaults of the building -- about a Million dollars in gold , silver , and greenbacks are stored . When the vault was opened to-day there was an escape of gas from the room and the odor denoted plainly that there was a smouldering fire somewhere . An investigation showed that many of the packages in whion money was stored were blackened and partially burned . Within the last few years electricity has been introduced as a means of illumination . One of the lamps burst or burned out and exploded , and the carbons fell to the floor still in an ignited condition and continued burning for some time , causing considerable damage to the packages . The Mint authorities say that the vault is a new one , was constructed under the supervision of the Government architect , has a cement floor , is supposed to De dre-proof , and has all the latest Improvements . They hardly think that they can be held responsible , and say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not turned on except when the vault is open . The vault is air tight , has rubber-lined doors , and no draft is possible . The lamp fell into a box in which there was some paper , and the paper ignited , the flames communicating to a pile of paper money consisting of about $20,000 in small bills . The top bills are doubtless scorched so as to make them use/eas for circulation , but the Superintendent thinks that the denominations and numbers can be recognized so that they can be replaced without loss to the Government other than the cost of printing* , A speolui Treasury agent has been dispatched here to make an investigation , and nothing will be touched until his arrival .
