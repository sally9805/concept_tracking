THE OUTLOOK IN CUBA . WE must base our dealings with the Cubans on the understanding that they are as yet but children . The word describes them almost exactly . Ignorance , delight in seeing or owning pretty trifles , curiosity , the tendency to tell an untruth whenever telling the truth may have unpleasant results , cruelty , wanton destruction of inanimate things which bave been obstacles in their path , fondness for personal adornment , intense desire for praise , and a weakness for showing off , - these are the attributes of children . Savages display them , too ; and many observers have put the Cubans down as barbarians . But , on the whole , they wear these qualities as children wear them . Docility , except under abuse , is their most marked trait . They yield without opposition or question to the strong hand ; and our government has made its chief mistake in dealing with them weakly , and allowing its policy to seem shifting , vacillating , and uncertain . Most Americans in Cuba maintain that if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the stand that we were going to assume permanent control of the island , put it in good order , and govern and develop it ourselves , the great majority of the Cuban people would have accepted the arrangement and been satisfied with it . This was impossible ; but the uncertain manner in which the campaign of regeneration in Cuba has been conducted from Washington , and the fact that the administration did not show any definite policy , have been serious drawbacks . Everything done seems to be decided on with an eye to the two possible futures , - independence and American sovereignty . Our government seems to be trying to ride two horses , to prepare for two contingencies , and to do nothing which shall militate against either . The Cuban country people are natural , - in all senses of the word , - kind , simple-hearted , and generous , except on occasion . They have many fine qualities , including that kind of disinterested hospitality which springs from the heart , and beautiful manners which amaze foreigners . Finally , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savages , almost anything can be made of them . We have before us the task and the responsibility of training them up in the way they should go . Under suitable government , education , treatment , and guidance , they can be developed and uplifted to an extent amounting to transformation . Their extreme teachableness , and their quickness to adopt new habits of mind and action which promise to benefit them , render it not impossible that the children of another generation may be fit for citizenship . The Cubans are not a religious people , either outwardly or inwardly . They have the sort of religion natural to children . It is undeveloped . So is their moral sense . The approach to paganism is astonishingly general . This is a far-reaching fact which throws much ligbt on the Cuban character . The Spanish priests represented the Spanish government ; in other words , oppression . They bought and sold benefices , and tried to make the maximum of money out of their parishioners . These things drove the Cubans out of the Church . The priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few Cuban babies , it would seem , are baptized nowadays , except in the centres of population . Marriages are usually performed by the alcalde , and a Cuban burial is too barbarous and revolting for description . From all accounts , the priests whom the Spanish government sent to Cuba , and paid well because they aided to keep up V // the Spanish power , were men of unsavory lives and ambitions . The Cubans naturally forsook a church whose representatives violated its most sacred precepts . Some of them found in Freemasonry a refuge , a ground of union , and a medium for transmitting political secrets . In a recent walking trip from Santiago to Havana , I saw , outside of eight large towns , only one building that had been designed for a church , until I reached Matanzas province . That one had evidently not been so used for many years . In Manzanillo , perhaps the prettiest , the brightest , and the most attractive town on the island , a very persistent bell called fifty women , out of fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exceptionally quickwitted , even for a race of Latin descent , and if American sovereignty were brought to pass they would take as readily to our ideas of government as they are doing to our ideas of business . But the change to be made is very great . The quartermaster of one of our regiments tried lately to buy some supplies from a Cuban firm . The provisions were all right , but several amicable conversations with the members of the house failed entirely to bring about anything like an arrangement concerning the price . He grew impatient at what seemed to him their stupidity and tardiness . At last one of them came to him and made a clean breast of it : " You see , captain , we ca n't specify any price until we know how much we shall have to pay you . " Another firm deposited in the post office a large number of letters , unstamped . They were returned , and the head of the house called to make an indignant protest . A small steamer employed by his house had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near port , and in return all letters bearing the firm 's label had been delivered , unstamped . He was told that he must stamp all his letters , and that if we wanted to send mail to that port by his steamer we would make a contract with him . He thought a moment , and exclaimed in amazement , " Why , that s getting things down to a cash basis ! " He was told that that was the intention : whereupon he took to the new idea with delight , and made a contract to carry the mail . The Cubans are not far-sighted , and they have little desire or regard for knowledge for its own sake ; but , like all people whose entire resources in the way of information are in their own heads , they are shrewd , and quick to perceive all the bearings and operations of any innovation which affects or promises to affect themselves . Mentally , they are a remarkable combination of keenness , intelligence , and readiness to learn new things , with ignorance so dense as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to construct a rancho of small trees , branches , and palm leaves , which will keep out the floods of rain that fall in the rainy season ; how to make the best coffee in the world ; how to dig boniatos and yuccas , clear scrub , cut cane , capture bees , and do other little things in the way of agriculture ; in short , they know how to exist in their environment . Also , they know the local gossip and a few echoes of doings in the world beyond half a day 's ride . But further than this most Cubans living outside of the towns know absolutely nothing . The United States is to them a vague tract of land in the north , more or less the size of Spain , from which come minnows in yellow cans , and roast beef , which may be bought at the cantinas , where even bread can sometimes be obtained ; likewise big men in blue shirts and felt hats , who ride colossal horses and drive the biggest mules in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesies . These Amencans take kindly to the remark , " Americano mucho bueno , Espagnol mucho malo ; " not less kindly than the Cubans take to American silver , which they find // preferable to Spanish money . But the average Cuban never goes from home further than he can ride his little singlefooter in three or four hours . He exists , in the cheerful contentment which is one of his worst traits , on what he can pick up around his hut . Even if he be a man of unusual energy , and take split palm leaves or boniatos or tobacco to the village to sell , he comes in contact only with the few people who have always lived within two or three leagues . I was repeatedly amazed and dumfounded at the number of men and women who did not know the path to the nearest village , or even whither the trail led which went past their own doors . Getting out of the towns was a long , tedious , and exceedingly annoying matter . You might ask man after man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that led to the next village . Unfortunately , a Cuban hates to admit that he does not know ; and he will give you , with perfect confidence and abundant courtesy of manner , a direction that has no discoverable relation to the right path . Cubans never travel in their own island for pleasure , and very rarely for business : to ninety-nine out of a hundred of them any province but their own is unknown except by hearsay , - unless in the case of men who accompanied Garcia 's raid through the island . Townbred Cubans differ from their rural fellows chiefly in being cleaner , in meeting more kinds of people , and in the fact that they sometimes see a tiny Havana newspaper with its short , unreliable cablegrams . It is often hard to tell whether a Cuban lies to you from ignorance or from malice . On ordinary occasions , and about matters that do not promise to affect himself , he is fairly truthful ; but he seems to know no reason why he should not tell a lie if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on his own island , a lie is a thing to tell whenever it will serve any useful purpose . Here the absence of a moral sense becomes apparent . With the Cuban , lying is a matter , not of right , but of policy , his shortsightedness preventing him from perceiving that to-day 's advantage may be to-morrow 's loss . Though the Cubans usually tell the truth , nearly all of them dissimulate or equivocate whenever they see occasion . Hence it is not always easy to tell what a Cuban thinks or how he feels about the future of the island . He sometimes tells you what he thinks you want to hear . Every man of property wants Cuba to be under American control , but he will not admit it before a crowd , or even to another Cuban , unless convinced that he too is heartily in favor of it . It is needless to say that the glowing descriptions given by the Cubans of the performances and the glorious victories of their somewhat mythical army are not intentional , deliberate , cold-blooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil of their island , they believe their own monstrous inventions . For , after all , the Cuban loves better than all other things on earth to strike an attitude , to pose , to strut and brag and make himself out a great man and his fellow islanders a great nation . Thousands of Cubans firmly believe that there was once a band of men worthy to be called a Cuban army , and that they fought battles . Others say that there were merely little companies of starving stragglers , who sometimes fired their two cartridges apiece from ambush at Spanish scouting parties , and then scattered . But they all think they did great execution . Get some American or Englishman who was with them to give you his view of it . It will be discouragingly different . Cuba is infested with " after the war " soldiers , braggadocio mock heroes who took no part in the fighting . If one can keep his face straight , it is worth while to start one of these " brigadier generals , " and say " Whew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the hour about the battles he has fought , the victories he has won , and the Spaniards he has killed . It is one of the pleasant features of the unconventional life of Cuba , at present , that you can chat with anybody . When you tire of these fairy tales , and your eyes begin to wander , perhaps you will notice in a corner of the caf 6 a little wizened negro , who does not look too clean for work , and whose machete scabbard is short , plain , old , and dirty . Go over and talk with him , if you want to know how the Cubans saved themselves from total annihilation and made the conflict drag along . But do not believe all he says ; he is touching it up for your benefit , too . It is not best to dispute assertions . It may be there was once a Cuban army , properly constituted , which occasionally stood up to its opponents ; and possibly the " Conquering Army , " the " Army of Liberation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought three years against the Spaniards . Do not admit that you have been credibly informed that a Cuban regiment consisted of twenty-five men , of whom seventeen were officers , or that a Cuban warrior of rank below sergeant is an object of extreme interest for his rarity . It is too hot to dispute ; besides , it is not worth while . As a matter of fact , there is a formidable army in Cuba to-day . It does not quite correspond to the aggregation of men who are looking for shares of our three-million-dollar gift , though most of the latter also belong to it . This is the " Army of Expectation , " as it has been well called , - the men who are making all the money possible out of the United States , as interpreters and in other ways , and doing all they can to browbeat Cubans who favor permanent American control and to hasten our removal from the island , to the end that they may get office under the Cuban republic . They are formidable because they all pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are animated by a common desire for gain . They are masters of grandiloquent phrases and specious arguments and false yet persuasive assertions , and they have just brains enough to delude the well-meaning , generous , ignorant peasants and workingmen . Native shrewdness and the habit of taking for granted that every one has an axe to grind may lead the peasants to discount some shams , but they also prepare them to regard shams as things to be expected . Pretense , unhappily , plays a large part in the Cuban character ; and there is , one is sadly disposed to admit , some warrant for the statement that the Cubans are to some degree like a race of slaves . Their villainous faces , their habit of suspicion , and a sullen , resentful manner , developed under habitual subjection , all go to give one the impression which an ill-concealed and deep-seated subserviency strengthens . A Cuban 's face , at first sight , looks sinister and defiant , as if he were ready to commit murder solely by reason of the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will not attack you in fair fight ; so you bid him good-day without the slightest trace of deference , and your greeting straightway transforms your murderous-looking pirate into a courteous gentleman , who will chat with you , offer you a cigarette , interest himself in your affairs , and give you any help in his power , and at parting commend you to God , - all with the most beautiful and appropriate manners and the most graceful gestures in the world . Most Cubans , by the way , " talk from their hips up ; " their hands move as fast as their tongues . As soon as you get below the surface you find this kind of man , and he will remain just about the same as long as you know him . But you will shortly perceive that there is a third stratum , the nature of which you can only guess at . You wonder what the man really thinks ; how lie really feels toward // you ; whether he means what he says about the future of Cuba and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company for some time , however , and if he has no military leanings , you will gradually come to perceive that he is a sincere fellow at heart . Converse with him alone , and he will tell you his real sentiments , which will correspond closely to what he told you offhand when you first met him . All things seem to have conspired to bring to the surface the potential bad traits in the Cuban character . The Spaniards treated the Cubans as slaves , thereby implanting in them the characteristics of slaves , including falsehood , meanness , and vengefulness . The American common soldiers , who , during the past winter , have not been the best behaved people in Cuba , found them devoid of the fundamental qualities that we demand of men , and treated them correspondingly ; with the result , in many cases , of confirming the worst side of their disposition . You will not make a better man of any one by calling him a rascal , or by treating him with continued and overbearing contempt and insult . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is perfectly true that many Cubans have behaved very badly since we took possession of the island , and some of them were amenable to no other treatment than physical compulsion ; but the race as a whole is peaceable and well disposed , and it is not fair to estimate it from a few ref ractory or dishonest examples . It is unintelligent , moreover , to blame the Cuban people for the bad qualities forced upon their character during Spanish rule , when deception became almost necessary . Ungratefulness is the charge that has been most often brought against the Cubans since Santiago . After it had been borne in upon them that they were not to be allowed to demolish , for pure spite , all the Spanish fortifications and official buildings , they still had to learn that they would not be permitted to maltreat civilian Spaniards as they chose . Even after they had learned this much of our character , and had indisputable proof , in the work of cleaning up cities and improving streets , of our disinterestedness , their only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could out of our people . Prices were doubled , tripled , and quadrupled for Americans , as they always are in foreign countries for American tourists ; but they speedily came down , thanks to the poverty and the shrewdness of the American common soldier . Though the Cubans are doing what they can , in these ways , to make money , less can be said for their industry in more laudable directions . Three years of enforced idleness and guerrilla warfare have unfitted most of them to settle down and cultivate the land . Lack of tools accounts for part of this disposition to let the land lie undeveloped ; temperament and their recent habit of life for most of it . The owners of sugar mills complain bitterly of the impossibility of getting laborers enough to run their mills at full capacity , and say that the gangs are constantly changing . Meantime , on the streets of Santiago two thousand unemployed men clamor for work . None of these went to the mines at Guantanamo , when work was offered ; instead , the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not all , of whom were badly needed on the neighboring sugar plantations . Perhaps work in the cities for the government has spoiled these men for the less exciting life of the country . By far the greater part of the island presents the spectacle of extremely fertile cleared land with which absolutely nothing is being done . You may travel through miles and miles of just such country , particularly in Puerto Principe and Santa Clara . It is so in Santiago , also , except that the scenery is more varied and the land more wooded , so // that you do not notice so constantly the prevalence of flat , uncultivated country , and do not so quickly tire of seeing nothing else . Offhand , you would say that the eastern two thirds of the island had never been brought under cultivation . In Matanzas and Havana provinces the case is only a little less pronounced . Except in spots Cuba seems virgin soil , just as its people offer an unbroken field to the missionary . Where agriculture used to be carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins of houses and huts and Cuban camps and hospitals . Piiiar del Rio , the famous tobacco country , is said by those who have traveled through it to present the same aspect of desolation . Left to themselves , the Cubans would never develop their country , - not in centuries . They are not shiftless ; every man of them can shift for himself so long as he stays in the country . The trouble is that it is so easy to get along and have plenty to eat without doing much work . The women and children dig boniatos and yuccas , which are said to grow year after year where they have once been planted ; the men shoot deer or agouti or guinea hens ; one who happens to be passing a field of sugar cane takes along a few stalks , the juice of which goes to sweeten the coffee . Perhaps the husband and father finds a swarm of bees in the woods . He brings it home on his shoulder , and installs it in a hollow trunk behind his hut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian coffee , dried fish , a lump of pork , possibly even a couple of rolls as a special treat . The wax , manipulated by deft fingers , becomes candles , and solves the entire lighting problem . Why work when one can live so well without ? During the war almost the entire rural population had to live on boniatos , which are an exceedingly watery and innutritious kind of yam , not unlike our sweet potato . One result of the struggle was seen in the excessively distended stom achs and the spindling arms and legs , from which , as from a widespread epidemic , the people are recovering . There was another and more striking result . The Cubans multiply rapidly , as do all tropical peoples . INow , the mortality of the war among the adults was horrible enough , but among the children it resembled extermination . During nearly two months spent in traveling in Cuba I saw but one child between the ages of one year and five . That frail little creature of two years might have weighed twelve pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortality among the babies was less sweeping . The lack of facilities for transportation - one might almost say the absence of such facilities - of course discourages agriculture ; still , it is used rather too much as an excuse . The few railroads charge high rates ; as for the highroads , all but a few of the eaminos reales are mere trails , only wide enough for men on horseback to travel single file . The camino real seems to be so called on account of its resemblance to the palma real . It is about the width of the trunk of the palm tree , and sooner or later it disappears among the foliage . Lack of confidence , however , is the chief obstacle to progress , because it lessens ambition , and prevents residents and foreigners with capital to invest from taking up more land or undertaking new enterprises . An astonishing number of Cubans now working in the cities are land poor . You often meet men in humble circumstances who own thousands of acres of land , highly valuable for its timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tobacco , or coffee , which is entirely unsalable because no one has sufficient confidence to develop it . Hence every man of property in Cuba , as well as every merchant or shopkeeper , is an earnest advocate of permanent American control . He knows that it is for the good of his country , and that it will enhance enormously the value of // his land and the volume of his business . Ask any intelligent man in Cuba , of whatever nation , " What is the chief need of Cuba ? " He will instantly reply , " Annexation . " ( This word , by the way , is used throughout Cuba to signify permanent American sovereignty and occupation , and does not carry with it the idea of statehood . ) Ask him to tell you the other needs of Cuba , and he will answer that this is the whole story . Security , confidence , capital , immigration from America , intelligent development , railroads , and highways that can properly be called roa ( ls , which comprise all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy land now , though miles and miles of it are offered at various prices from fifteen cents to twelve dollars an acre , because everything is uncertain . Conditions are even worse than they were five years ago . We made a pledge that we would give the Cubans a chance to govern themselves ; but the events of every day make it increasingly doubtful whether they will ever be able to establish , still less to maintain , a strong government . Cuba under a republic would be a very unsatisfactory place to Americans . The Cubans can not be judged by one who brings them to the touchstone of the virtues which Anglo-Saxons regard as essential . If we leave out the best of them , which means those who have come into contact with American life , the Cubans are sometimes good servants , but they are utterly unfit to be masters of themselves or of anybody else . They are by inheritance unfit for responsibility ; and in this respect they will change but slowly , if ever . Americans in Cuba have seen this so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , they are not making investments ; for , cheap as most of the land is now , it would be worthless if Cuba should be handed over to its inhabitants . There are certain other significant VOL . LXXXIII. - NO. 500. 53 phases of the economic condition of Cuba to-day . Some of these are the scars of the long war ; others are the results of the imperfections of American control . In some places sugar mills have been burned , so that it is impossible to grind the cane ; in others all the oxen have been killed , so that it is impossible to convey it to the mills . Weyler carried off nearly all the cattle ( two hundred and forty thousand , according to general estimates ) from Puerto Principe and Santa Clara provinces , and shipped them to Spain , to be sold for his own benefit . During the war Garcia swept through this part of the island , destroying or carrying off the remaining cattle and all other eatable tImings , with the ostensible aim of starving out the Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief occupation in these two provinces ; and to-day hundreds of square miles of the finest grazing land in the world are lying idle because there are no cattle to feed on them . These are the fairest and most orderly parts of Cuba , though they are under very slight cultivation . The local rural guards have been chosen out of the best of the Cubans who took part in the insurrection , and they make active and efficient police . The people seem to be of a better sort than those in Santiago province . They have much pleasanter faces , and the negroes are few in number and well disposed . Moreover , Puerto Principe offers special attractions to Americans , because a large number of the men in business in its chief city have been educated or trained , or both , in the United States . In these provinces the people like us very much , and are thoroughly satisfied and pleased with American rule . They want us to stay . Hundreds of people in Puerto Principe have said that they would go out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cleaning up the cities has been more appreciated , and our soldiers have been more orderly , than almost anywhere // else on the island . The country people IL found friendly and disinterested , in most cases ; and some of the roads are passable for wagons , which must sooner or later replace the heavy , cumbersome bullock carts that are now the only vehicles of transportation . In other portions of the island American control has been less effectually established . In Matauzas province , where there are as yet no rural guards , I heard dolorous tales of brigands . One man said that he knew of fifty in his neighborhood , who kept the country in a state of terror , and robbed and raided at will . He added that he did not dare to complain to the authorities in the city , because they would do nothing about it , and the brigands would kill him . The next day we were surrounded by a band of sixteen men , who conversed with us awhile , learned that we were Americans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most impassable , and the most mountainous of the six provinces , the brigands have been committing depredations of late . One of the eternally funny things about Cuba is the strong rivalry between the provinces . The people in each section think that theirs is the best and the richest province , that its people are the finest in the island , and that its men did all the fighting in the late war . Now , everybody else will tell you that the people of Santiago are the worst in Cuba , - the scum , the refuse , of the island ; but the Santiagoans insist that they are the most intelligent , since the insurrections have all started in their province . It would seem that they are predisposed to rebel against the established order . General Wood has done a great work in the city and the province under his control ; but he had a far harder task , in proportion to the resources at his disposal , than any one else , and he has been hampered in various ways not necessary to detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their former companions-in-arms . The mountainous regions of the province seem to have attracted thieves and other unruly members of society from various parts of Cuba , and it is too big and too wild a province to be easily overrun by our soldiers . The people are more disposed to be surly in Santiago than elsewhere in Cuba ; and the city was in so horrible a condition last August that far more of intelligent effort than has been expended elsewhere has not brought it up to the level of other Cuban cities . Permanent American control seems to be the most probable future for Cuba . We are responsible for good government in the island , and it is doubtful if this can be established in any other way . This becomes clearer every day , even to people at a distance ; down there , anything else is seldom thought of or suggested , save by the unruly elements and by those persons who have nothing to lose and everything to gain by a state of affairs in which the shrewdest and most unscrupulous man wins , arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libre . " It is so doubtful whether the Cubans can ever govern themselves that few Americans who have been to Cuba and know the conditions expect them to do it . Under American direction , Cubans have performed some of the work incidental to government in a more or less satisfactory manner . Some of the post-office clerks are less inefficient than the majority . The city police and the rural guards are vigilant , energetic , and determined , and they have kept order to the best of their ability ; but they are sometimes cowardly , and often disposed to bully and browbeat . They are inclined to be arbitrary and domineering , simply because they have always seen authority exercised in that manner . Doubtless they will gradually outgrow this disposition ; but it is a good illustration of the fact , of almost universal application , that the vices forced upon these people by the Spaniards have become // part of their natures , and will have to be slowly and painfully outgrown . It will be a slow process , because , among other reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example are not all paragons of honesty , truthfulness , and probity . The negroes , who number at least one third , and possibly one half , of the population , are said to belo*xg to the party which clamors for independence . Those in Havana are probably antagonistic to the Americans and to the upper classes of Cubans , because they have not been given places on the police force ; the riots of a few weeks ago would lead to this opinion . rrhose in Cienfuegos also have a standing grudge against the whites , because they are not allowed on the Plaza in the evening . The negroes in Santiago province are of a very different stamp from ours or those in the western end of the island . By comparison , they are gentler , better - mannered , and more intelligent and docile . According to the best authorities , they are sprung from a different African race , and they have always been kindly treated , except by a few British and American slaveowners . As for the lowest class of white Cubans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked over to the Army of Expectation . The opinion seems to be generally held that the poor , hospitable , courteous , much-abused , cheerful , kind-hearted peasant is on that side , too ; but this I believe to be largely an error . A number of them , all the way along the road , asked me , " Is the United States going to take us ? " in a way which intimated a desire in that direction . The sentiment is certainly growing among them that it would be a very good thing for Cuba to be under our protection . Several times I heard the same argument advanced , - that if Cuba should become a republic , she would be at the mercy of any foreign power with a gunboat and a citizen who thought himself injured . For the rest , there are a good many Cubans who will go with the crowd ; if the matter comes to a vote , they will side with whichever party they think likely to win . Two ways in which our control may be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say to the world : " The Cubans are unable to govern themselves , and incapable of learning self-government within any . reasonable time ; we will therefore keep the island under our control , and govern it as we have governed our territories. ** Or we can take the ground that , since we have pledged ourselves to give Cuba independence , we are bound to put the island into reasonably good working order , and then to remove our troops and officials . The result , as every one except a few Cubans will admit , will be disorder , fierce contention between the leaders , and then civil war of the old familiar guerrilla kind , degenerating into butchery ; and we shall have to come back and take up again the regeneration of Cuba from the beginning . It is hard to decide which is right of these two plans , and whether the one that is right is also expedient ; and an honest man may be excused for hesitating between the two courses . Most people favor the former plan , which represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say ; the work of regeneration has been well begun , and is going on satisfactorily ; and all the best people want us to stay , - the people of property and intelligence , the men whose opinions and desires deserve attention and respect . What is the sense or the necessity of throwing overboard all that has been gained for Cuba , and leaving the island to its own ill devices , when we know perfectly well that we shall have to come back and do our work all over again ? It would *be an unintelligent and a foolish proceeding . There was once a popular idea to the effect that the long-suffering Cubans // were models of all the virtues , and that if the yoke of Spain were removed they would form at once a stable government which would make Cuba an ideal place for residence ; but that was exploded long ago . Why should we feel obliged to sail away from the island , pretending that we had established a government , and allow the Cubans to massacre one another ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negroes , and the other inflammable elements of the populace which the demagogues will stir up , the resident Spaniards , the other foreigners ( including our own people ) , and the Cubans who have proved friendly to us ? The first thought of the Cubans , after the protection of the Spanish troops was withdrawn , was to murder the Spanish civilians , particularly in the small towns where the Spaniards , being men of honesty , industry , and stamina , kept the stores and owned most of the property . Are we to learn nothing by experience ? Have we a right to wash our hands of a responsibility which we assumed not only voluntarily , but aggressively , and march away from that powder magazine , when we know beyond a reasonable doubt that there are those who only wait for our departure to fire it ? Europe has already taken it for granted ( unofficially ) that we are in Cuba to stay . Putting aside the enormous expense and the disturbance connected with moving our troops away from Cuba and then sending them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercy of a half-barbarous rabble , with the inevitable result of having to go back there in force , reconquer the island , and do all over again the splendid work of the past year ? To be sure , it may be said with much plausibility that if a vote were taken tomorrow , the people of Cuba would by a large majority request us to leave the island , and that we ought not to go into the business of government without the consent of the governed . It is probably true that the Cubans who want us to go outnumber those who want us to stay . The point is that if all , or nearly all , the people whose convictions deserve respect are on one side , mere numbers should not be allowed to decide the matter . If we set theories aside , and look at the situation squarely , it becomes evident that the event will not be determined by any logical or a priori considerations . Our possession of the island is growing more firmly rooted every week , and Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of things . With every life and every dollar we send to Cuba our hold on the island is being strengthened . We shall stay to take care of our own , and thus , by imperceptible stages , the present situation will glide into permanent control .
