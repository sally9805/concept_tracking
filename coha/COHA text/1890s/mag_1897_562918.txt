txt ABOUT five and forty years ago Admiral Sir Charles Napier published a book on the state of the navy , in which , through some pages , he deplored the decadence of the junior naval officers of his day . In 1847 the greatest admiral of his time , the nephew of Earl St. Vincent , and known as " the last of Nelson 's captains , " Sir William Parker , thus wrote : I feel more than ever the necessity of judicious , steady and firm officers being kept afloat , who will , on the one hand , check the absurdities and presumption of modern innovations which are undermining the discipline of the service , and , on the other hand , avoid the severity and harshness which characterized the organization of some ships in former days . The midshipmen , mates , and junior lieutenants all require a strict but courteous control , and if a stand is not made determinedly against their flippant and conceited demeanor , we may witness a navy as brave , but in its efficiency lamentably degenerated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary war . " These two great officers only followed the fashion of their time in so regarding their juniors . Most officers of forty to fifty years ' standing can easily recall how universal this sort of feeling was amongst the senior ranks , and how long it continued . But now there is not probably to be found one single officer of the higher ranks who could think , much less write , so of the rising generation . The feeling of the seniors towards the juniors is unquestionably one of respect . There is a tendency clearly marked to draw comparisons between what we remember of the officers who were our fellows in the gun-rooms and ward-rooms of the sailing ships , or of the steam and sailing ships , of our past , and what is now seen in those mess-rooms of the steaming present , to // the disparagement of the former . During the last half century we have witnessed a complete revolution in the regards which the leaders of the navy throw down upon their followers . It is often a subject of reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Why is it that the inner or fundamental elements of discipline stand on such a different footing now to what they did then ? How much of the change is subjective in the minds of senior officers ; and how much objective , or real , in the conduct and character of the juniors ? I think it is possible to trace the causes , as of material surroundings acting on moral character and moral character inter-acting amongst the different ranks . The subjective thought of the seniors has not been without its effect on the character of the juniors . The conduct of the juniors has confirmed the thought of the seniors . In any case a naval man of to-day whose experience stretches back to the navy of fifty years ago can evolve from his inner consciousness a series of mental surprises if he recalls situation after situation of his distant , but not dim past , and imagines the possibilities of re-establishing any of them to-day . The theory of discipline amongst those who were building it up and maintaining it then , was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better man he was likely to become . The " smart " officer was often , if not generally , noted for his skill in the use of contemptuous adjuration as applied to " the young gentlemen " of his midshipmen 's berth . Epithets such as " qualified young ass , " " qualified young fool , " " qualified useless trash , " flew about in those days backwards and forwards over the decks of the ship as the ball flies over the net on the tennis ground , if we assume that it is all serving , and no ball is taken . The youngster speedily learnt the practice and the language , and " passed it on " like Sheridan 's Trip , so that the supply of practitioners never failed . Of course the habit developed a great number of men who were mere verbal bullies , men who never considered for a moment the effects of what they were doing or saying , and out of whose mouths the appropriate language flowed like steam out of the spout of a boiling tea-kettle . But whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether the practice grew out of the theory , it is certain , that it was cultivated as useful to the partly feathered naval fowl . I remember in my youngsters days , // having sometimes a difficulty in establishing congruity between the language of some of my seniors toward me when " on duty " ; the distinct regard that J felt for them ; and the certainty I had of their real regard for me . It was a revelation and a shock to my whole system , when , after years of shaken self-confidence , generated by the belief that the language as applied to me was true , the key to the enigma was supplied . I loved my captain of those days with a love which was only imperfect in its failure to cast out fear . I had been subject to the steam of the tea kettle for perhaps two hours-at any rate nutil I was limp from its effects , and a subsequent summons to closer interview with my commander did not tend to put much stiffening into me . But what my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being a transgressor of orthodox limits in the language of contempt . I was not to take too great note of the official practice , designed in the first instance to make me " smart , " and exceeded in the heat of debate , as it were . Naturally , officers whose habitual official language expressed contempt for the character , intellect , and powers of their juniors could scarcely hope to have much respect for them in their hearts . But we must clearly understand that there was in those days a condition of knowledge in the senior officer which , if it did not justify the extravagance of his language , did justify a sense of personal as well as of official superiority . For the sailing navy , just when the advent of steam was about to upset it , was wholly based upon experience and authority . Seamanship , the profession of which was almost the be-all and end-all of the naval officer 's pride , was an affair of precedent . There are men perhaps yet amongst us who went to sea in ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his captains to the victory of Quiberon Bay . Men studied the seamanship of the author of the Sh4nvreck in a new edition of the Marine Dictionary , commended by Collingwood . D'Arcy Lever copied him , and the friend of our naval youth , the disappointed , but not broken Lieutenant Martelli , copied him again in the accurate language of the Boatswain of that day . Falconer had told the navy of his time that " He who strives the tempest to disarm Will never first embrail the lee yard arm . " // And whether his seamanship was wrong or right ( in the revolutionary epoch heralded by steam , I used to employ the condemned method alternately with the other ) was a matter of serious debate even fifty years ago . But in this state of subservience to authority , when " I have seen it done " clinched every argument and concluded every debate ; when we were aghast at the proposal to abandon " reefpoints " in our topsails , and to adopt the French system of " reeflines , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea was almost certain to have more knowledge of sea work than the later comer . The older officer was personally , as well as officially , the superior of the younger . Unless the captain was one of the favorites of fortune he was the oldest man in the ship , had been longer at sea , and was more versed in the precedents than any one else . It might be true that the doctor knew more about medicine and surgery than the captain did , but then that was none of the captain 's business . Neither was the " soldiering " of the marine officer-that was a thing to be despised . So there was no one who could possibly know more of the captain 's business than the captain himself . The first lieutenant might stand next in knowledge , but he only had less knowledge of the same kind of which the captain had more . The captain might direct him , but could not consult him without some sacrifice of dignity and some breach of theory . The same conditions worked down through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man above him . The man below him did not share the duty with him : he did what he was told by the man who knew better . The general result was inevitable . From the very first the officer who had a superior in the ship came to consider he was working for that superior , and depended for his success upon the way the superior regarded his service . Personal service predominated generally . The sense of combining for a common end was greatly or wholly lost . The personal character of the captain . or perhaps of the second in command as his mouth piece , determined the character of the ship for discipline and moral efficiency , and it was scarcely possible for her junior officers to consider themselves in any way affected by , or responsible for , a state of things due to the initiation of the higher authority . Here was the action and reaction . The work of the ship fell // on the shoulders of the second in command . All waited for his orders , were not interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small an extent as was consistent with keeping out of " trouble . " There were no departments in the ship . If the second in command was not everywhere at the same moment , if he did not superintend everything , everything fell to pieces . The officers junior to the second in command were really more or less of a trouble to him ; they rather considered he was more or less of a trouble to them . They became hardened to the use of contemptuous terms , the younger officers to being exhibited in ridiculous and degrading public positions as a punishment for failures . They accepted the condolences of the seamen , who , nominally under their command , were sharers in their ignominy . The lieutenant , as officer of the watch , and the captain 's representative in his absence , grew accustomed in his presence , when " carrying on the duty , " to have his orders to the men of his watch suspended midway by the free criticisms of the more experienced captain , and the men not seldom waited a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain would not disallow the order . The whole system which , it must be admitted , sometimes worked splendidly in the hands of exceptionally able men , was insidiously undermined by the arrival of the engineer on the scene . There is no doubt that , long after its introduction , steam propulsion was despised and hated by the ablest and best amongst our naval officers . Men went so far as to pride themselves on profound ignorance of everything relating to the steam engine . Years elapsed before the study of it became a road to promotion . Less than fifty years ago a rising young officer , who deliberately quitted a smart sailing frigate for service in a paddle-wheel steamer , did a thing which almost shocked his contemporaries . " Steamer 's Lieutenant " and " Steamer 's Midshipman , " were well-known terms of opprobrium , for the majority governed public opinion . But when the engineer came on board he possessed a knowledge with regard to the ship which it was at first no disgrace to the captain-rather to his honor , iudeed-not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the lesser experience of sea-life , was the superior in a knowledge which was necessary to the ship . The captain was the official , but no longer the personal superior of the engineer in his peculiar department . But the engineer // was not like the doctor , professor of a science of which the captain was not intended to know anything . The steamer 's captain soon discovered that though he might not be an expert he could not place himself wholly in the hands of his engineer . For ttie first time the conduct of the ship became the consequence of a consultation between the captain , with a general but incomplete knowledge , and the engineer , with a special and complete knowledge . The ship was worked in departments . Invention was stirred in many ways by the advent of steam , notably in the matter of guns and gunnery . The paddle-wheel usurped the broadside position for generations allotted to the gun . The artillery , being crowded thus to bow and stern , it became necessary to increase the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The heavier gun demanded altered mountings . The Elizabethan " truck gun-carriage " no longer sufficed . Improved shooting was obtained by locks , disparts , and tangent-sights . The shell , and the improved shell to burst by concussion on striking , added immensely to the force of the gun , but invaded its simplicity . The gunnery literature necessary to be supplied to the navy could no longer be contained in the half-dozen pages to which it had for generations been confined . The school of naval gunnery  --  the Excellent at Portsmouth-arose and grew , and the " Gunnery Lieutenant , " even the " Gunnery Mate , " invaded the warship as the exponent of the views and knowledge of the school . Here it was again . Here was the younger officer , with the less experience , coming as it were between the captain and his ship with an expert and special knowledge of a very important part of her , of which he , the captain , could only have a general knowledge . It was not possible to despise the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engineer , it was only possible to disparage it , and the owner of it . The majority , unconscious of how it was being driven , yet instinctively revolting , smiled contemptuously at Sir Thomas Hardy 's fancies , and the pretensions of his successors in command of the Excellent and their scholars . Those men from the Excellent , it was held to be shown , had not the knowledge they claimed . They might be able to throw dust in the eyes of their superiors at sea ; but they were empty vessels as far as real gunnery service went . it was // years , of course , before the Excellent scholars rose to the higher commands in any numbers competent to influence the current of thought . But whether or not , here was a new feature . Gunnery lieutenants and mates owed an allegiance to the Excellent which crossed their allegiance to their captains . They became and were admitted to be centres of action as the engineers were , not wholly subordinate to the captain 's influence . The advent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further addition of electricity , created yet another department afloat of the same general character as that born of the corn plexities of gun nery , and introduced yet another officer , perceiving a divided duty . The great difference between the older special departments on board a man-of-war , namely those of the surgeon , the marine officer , and , perhaps , the purser , and the new ones , those of the engineer , the gunner , and the torpedo officer , was , that of the former the captain was officially held to know nothing ; and of the latter he might be supposed to know a great deal . The change could only develop him in one way . His will was bounded by want of knowledge , and he had to consult his subordinates before be exercised it . The fact altered his tone in a hundred ways ; and the alterations reacted upon his subordinates , not only as regarded himself , but as amongst themselves . The junior officer had his department ' and was practically supreme within it . The mere fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , to the creation of other departments by custom . It began to be instinctively felt that it was the correct working of each department in harmony with all others th ' *t made the ship and gave her a good name . As the captain grew , of necessity , more and more a constitutional monarch , casting off continually his despotic hahiliments , so did he grow to recognize responsibilities amongst his officers which were not known to him directly , even where no real department bounded his knowledge . It was inevitable that there should arise within him a sense of respect for so many of his subordinates who were specially informed where he was but generally informed . In sympathy with this , it was natural to allow that other officers not ostensibly experts in any particular branch of naval knowledge , might possibly be so , and there was a certain hesitation in attributing to them an inefficiency which had not been proved . // Then , again , contact with so many men who owed the double allegiance to him , and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subordinates had aims of duty apart from himself indeed , but equally with himself . In the face of that conviction , the feeling of a personal moral superiority could not well exist side by side with a complete admission that superiority in knowledge could no longer be claimed , however much judgment might be matured by experience . Subjectively , therefore , the senior officer 's view of the junior was attacked , and the junior , whether better or worse in reality , gained the credit of being better . But it was impossible that the junior officer could avoid responding to the improved estimate of himself exhibited in the superior 's tone . If he had formerly felt a responsibility which scarcely extended beyond the will of his superior , it became impossible to doubt that that superior perceived a something beyond his will which affected himself and his junior alike . The idea of personal service was weakened on both sides . It was less demanded on one side , and less rendered on the other . The superior officer grew continually in his own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of a principal . The junior went on to discover how much an agent he himself was . The whole theory of discipline as resulting in a well-ordered ship was gradually overturned and reversed . The old theory had been that everywhere-except , of course , in the case of the admirals , captains , and their seconds in command , on the latter of whom the chief burden of carrying out the theory fellthere was sure to be failure and collapse if the compelling and sustaining power of the senior was to be for a moment withdrawn . Such a theory is clearly set forth in the words of Sir William Parker already quoted . Comparing things major with things minor , it was the theory applied to creation before the time of Darwin . There was a creation groaning and travailing which only a sustaining hand could hold together and prevent from collapsing . It was a theory the practice of which grew by what it fed on . Originally subjective in the mind of the superior  --  and Sir William Parker 's intense admiration for all ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly became objective in the conduct of the inferior ranks . The opposite theory , which now governs the relations afloat , // is the Darwinian theory of creation . The ship is bnrsting with the energy of life . There is a struggle for efficiency in all ranks and departments . Everything is initially stable , and all that is wanted to maintain order that is natural is the reign of law . We have , indeed , in our warships to-day a cordiality of cooperation generally pervading all ranks which is new to the navy , unless Sir Charles Napier and Sir William Parker were right , and there was in their time a real decadence , and the tone which has been recovered is that of the temporis acti . But this may well be doubted . There is enough on record of those days to make us believe that the tone of a ship , or a fleet , was that personally impressed on it by the commander , and that the equilibrium so maintained was not stable . It is much more likely that the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands is a new creation which could not have existed when the warship was driven by the winds , and was , internally , a simple and unchanging production . But if the mechanical environment of fifty years ago was mainly responsible for the naval officer it produced , and if the changed environment must be *charged with altering a private firm to a limited liability company , it must also be charged with greatly changing the individual character . It has done so , not merely by gradually raising the standard of an outwardly impressed education-much of that , as of softness of manners , has come into the navy from outside , and would perhaps have come into it had the marine steam engine never been invented  --  but by distinctly modifying the instincts , it has been like a great roller pressing out individnalities and levelling all into one smooth plane . Remarkable personalities are comparatively rare in the navy of our time . There is no place for the superb eccentricities which almost inevitably distinguished equally the great and the little man who trod the man-of-war 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a certain air about the naval officer which marks him in the eyes of those who know . But such an air is a subtle surrounding , impossible to describe in detail , so that even on the stage the naval officer is a very fine fellow merely , without any foibles for the dramatist to take hold of . How impossible is it now to imagine the admiral in command of the Mediterranean fleet ( say ) leading his division // into action while munching an apple , and alternating bites and puns , which was Collingwood 's individuality at the battle of Trafalgar ? Or who will conceive that the captain of the " Royal Sovereign " pacing the bridge of the " Majestic " beside the admiral within full but distant view of the enemy , and hearing him speak of his determination to fight at all hazards , should give him a hearty slap on the back and exclaim , " That 's right , Lord Walter , and a d -- n good licking we 'll give them ! " - which was Captain Hallowell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall believe that the greatest man of the navy to-day could sit himself down to write a solemn dispatch to the Admiralty , ascribing the bad state of health in his fleet to fresh beef and vegetables and too great relaxation , and abstention from salt provisions ! - which was the individuality of the great St. Vincent . Or , to drop at once to the small thingsis there now a living midshipman who has had to awake the lieutenant in charge of the watch at sea , and get him to sit up in order to award a proper punishment to the look-out-man caught in the same breach of the articles of war ? That was an individuality within my own experience . It would be very easy to infer from all this that the machinemade naval officer of to-day might fail where the hand-made o*licer of yesterday so wonderfully succeeded . It is easy to suppose , on comparing the freedom and frankness of intercourse between senior and junior , which obtains to-day , with that extreme deference on one side and demand for it on the other which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has suffered . It appears to me to be all the other way . In the past the junior obeyed the senior chiefly because he was afraid of him . Now he obeys because loyalty to a great cause demands it . I am sure that the latter will prove the more stable principle if it ever comes to be severely tested . It ma** be more plausibly argued that this kind of constitutional practice without a real choice may hinder decision at those momentous cross-roads which war alone offers without sign posts , and where the wrong choice leads to destruction . The inference would be wholly wrong . The steam officer of today has a sonstant experience of such mental and nervous strains in the management of his machines as were comparatively rare in the life of the sailing officer . If there is less choice in decision , there is // not the twentieth part of the time allowed for acting on it that was allowed fifty or one hundred years ago . Rush , hurry , and speed , with a splendid co-ordination and order in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the modern naval officer . Action with the enemy may b* a change in degree , but in kind it is no change . And the machine-made officer will prove at least as unerring as the machines which control him and have modified his personality.
