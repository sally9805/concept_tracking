txt An exception to the ordinary run of annual reports is that of Commodore George W. Melville , the arctic hero , Engineer in Chief of the United States Navy . It is in dealing with that feud of long standing between the officers of the line and the Engineer Corps that Commodore Melville writes most interestingly , and he deals with the subject in language which , while respectful and dignified , is not to be misunderstood . " Corning to the question of conferring positive rank , instead of the meaningless ' relative ' rank now held by members of the Engineer Corps , " says Commodore Melville , in introducing the subject , " I earnestly trust that the department will recommend to Congress some measures looking toward this just and proper recognition of the service performed by the officers of this corps . Why officers devoting their lives to the service , who have always had a certain portion of the crew to organize , muster , discipline , station , anti drill in the various manoeuvres intended to make the vessel efficient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have under their control from 25 to 60 per cent . of the entire ship 's company , should be denied recognition as a military element in a fighting organization would be incomprehensible to any one not familiar with the inside workings of the navy . " In the naval battle of the future , " Commodore Melville says , " a ship will fight with her engines as well as with her guns ; the ram will be a more dangerous weapon and one more feared than the battery , and if her boilers or her engines fail , the vessel will become a drifting mass , absolutely at the mercy of the enemy . " And then Commodore Melville proceeds to clinch his argument by reference to the Victoria disaster in this way : " Let those who decry the engineers as ' non-combatants ' take home the lesson to be learned from the loss of the Victoria . It was not powder that there worked destruction ? it was steam ; and if such a horror can occur in peaceful manoeuvring , what might not happen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact conditions of battle ? rammed by another  --  and see how the ' noncombatant ' engineers came out of it . ' The whole engine-room staff on watch perished , to a man , ' so says London Engineering . " That the engineers are influenced by sentiment is admitted as perfectly true , for what are honor and courage and patriotism and other feelings that distinguish men from brutes , but sentiment ? " asks the Engineer in Chief . An increase in the number of engineer officers is earnestly recommended in the report . New ships are taking most of the available men , " and , unless something is soon done , " it is stated , " our navy , now practically an engineering one , will be crippled for want of engineers . " During the last fiscal year the Bureau of Steam Engineering expended $617,933 , and , subtracting outstanding obligations , has $15,518 remaining to its credit . Of the former amount , $150,718 was used in work at the New-York Navy Yard ; $14,241 at the League Island Yard , Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $66,163 at the Portsmouth Yard , New-Hampshire , and $21,159 at  --  the Boston Yard , Massachusetts . Repairs to the United States cruiser Atlanta , which was so much neglected that several of her officers were reprimanded and narrowly escaped court-martial , cost $26,093 for her boilers , machinery , and other mechanical apparatus alone . It will require 120 days from July 18 last to remedy her disgraceful condition and fit her for sea . The estimates submitted for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1895 , aggregate $997,990 . This sum includes $675,000 for steam machinery , stores , and incidentals , which is $20,000 less than the appropriations for the current year . Since the date of Commodore Melville 's last annual report six new naval vessels have had official trials and have satisfactorily fulfilled contract requirements , except the Monterey , which is somewhat short of the required horse power . But she was the only vessel where the contract called for a given horse power , all the others being " speed " ships .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
