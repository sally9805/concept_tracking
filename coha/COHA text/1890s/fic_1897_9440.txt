" ... Amphitryon , banished from Tiryns , established himself at Thebes . Herakles , brought up in that city and skilful in physical exercises , surpassed all other men in the strength of his body and the greatness of his soul . He was scarcely adolescent when he delivered Thebes from the tyranny of Erginus and the Minyans , and thus paid his debt of gratitude to his country . ... The fame of this exploit spread through the whole of Greece , and every one admired it as a prodigy . Creon , the King , himself impressed by the courage of the young man , gave him his daughter Megara in marriage ; and , treating him like his own son , confided to him the government of his kingdom . But Eurystheus , King of Argos , jealous of the growth of the power of Herakles , summoned him to appear before him , and ordered him to perform his labours . At first Herakles refused , but Zeus commanded him to obey Eurystheus . Herakles went to Delphi , and , having consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to perform the twelve labours , and that , after their completion , he would receive immortality . " On receiving this command , Herakles fell into great distress of mind ... he was seized with a frenzy . ... Madness took possession of his sick mind ... in one of his ecstasies of fury , ... Herakles pierced with arrows the children which he had had by Megara . ... Having recovered from his madness and become aware of his error , he was greatly afflicted by the excess of his misfortune ... he remained quietly withdrawn in his house for a long time , avoiding all human society . Time having calmed his grief , Herakles went to Eurystheus , determined to affront every peril and perform the labours . ... " Zeus kept Prometheus chained for having given fire to mankind , and caused his heart to be devoured by an eagle . Herakles , seeing that Prometheus was punished only for having done good to men , ... saved the common benefactor . " Diodorus Siculus , IV , 10-11 , and 15 .

FIRST SCENE The Agora at Thebes . Sunset . The Agora is empty except for the WOMAN , who is seated on a bench against the wall of a house , and the POET , who stands before her , facing the sunset . The POET The POET The birds go home at sunset , and my heart Goes home . The day closes its tired wings , And in the violet evening there are stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The best of us we left undone to-day , Now like a warrior worn with doubtful wars , Waits for the morrow , heart-sick yet resolved . The sense of life is secret and serene At twilight , and the flame of life  --  The WOMAN The WOMAN Is love ! The POET turns as tho ' suddenly recalled to a sense of her presence , and looks at her for a moment in silence . The POET The POET Of old your eyes persuade the heart like peril ..... You are the Siren of the seas of life . What stately ships , full-sailed for Paradise , Captained by young , superb adventurers , Haughty in hope , impassioned in resolve , Thrilled with a mystic wonder in the mind , Drawn from their course , lie shipwrecked on your shores !  --  What is your wish with me ? I saw your eyes Call to my heart across the crowded square . Now in the sunset all the crowd is gone . We are alone . Why did you summon me ? A moment 's pause . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ? The POET The POET Since yesterday . The WOMAN The WOMAN What race and place are yours ? The POET The POET In Athens was I born , and there my youth Was spent , and there , if home there be , is home . The WOMAN The WOMAN Why are you come to Thebes ? What hope of good , What fear of ill impels your feet so far ? The POET The POET My hope is nameless , and the ills I dread Are housed within me !  --  but the restless mind While there is life , affords us no reprieve ; The impatient heart , eagerly and beyond The daybreak and the dark , drives us afar Over strange oceans and unvisited lands ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN The impatient heart !  --  O Heart of man that yearns After the Stranger Woman of young dreams ! ..... The POET The POET I know ! I know !  --  young dreams ! ..... But mine are old , Tragic and old , divine and real as life , And dwell within me like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part is the flushed heart 's desire . What tho '  --  as inwardly my blood believes  --  You were the Stranger Woman  --  The WOMAN The WOMAN I am She ! And anciently and now I am the one Inveterate quest of life 's dream-haunted days . In myriad ways you seek me , and you find Me !  --  tho ' you think to find a lordlier thing . Yet , tho ' you find me , you shall know me not , And I am strange to you forever ! The POET The POET To me Nothing of you is strange  --  unless your name ! I have had many lives before , where you Were something more to me than life itself ; And after all my youth 's vexed years with you , I know you and your secret  --  and the soul Within you , dark and undivined , I know ! I am so long possessed of you I seem To have you as I have the voice of song , Clear in my heart and brain . There is no phrase Of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your voice , Various as wind , no silver gayeties , No cries , tense and tear-laden , strange to me . There is no perfume , bounty , brilliancy Or pleasure of your body , nor the least Stir of your subtle silks I know not of . I know the grave , smooth silence of your brows ; And when your lips are eloquent and flushed With hunger and with thirst of love , I know you ! I know the swift , sweet motion of your hands When they are fain of touch and tenderness ..... And I have long explored and learned to know The deep , dark twilights of your eyes and hair , The young , pale profile of your breasts  --  and how You are all warm and lustrous and superb ! Neither within the house of ivory , The house of rose and pearl , am I a stranger : Your thought is in my brain , your mighty heart Is in my heart ,  --  your soul is in my soul ! I know the chaste reluctance and the wild Appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love will ! ..... And I have seen and celebrate in you The patient , tender truth and trust and care , The soul 's perfection breathing into life Thro ' love 's obscure and elemental ways ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN You love me ! I am she ! I am the quest , I am the goal !  --  You love me ! The POET The POET I have learned How , in the last fulfilment of the spirit , There is a nobler end for life than love , There is a nobler end for love than you ! The WOMAN The WOMAN You have not well beheld me , who I am ,  --  The Stranger Woman , even the truth of dreams , Splendid and strong and secret ..... The POET The POET Fairer still Is the celestial bride , and statelier ! ..... I have so greatly loved you that my love Is grown out of its childhood , which you are , To more than you can welcome  --  more than all Your love and you can freely welcome home ! I am alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none love me now ..... Time was when you received me , when your heart Was radiant and a refuge to me !  --  then I uttered and was heard !  --  and I devised To set the sunset-coloured gem of song Upon your brows , to make your raiment of The unquiet silver of calm , moonlit seas , To give you sandals hued like flowers , and fill Your eyes with daybreak , and transfuse your hair With forest-twilights when the leaves are young And it is morning ! ..... Then I said the new , The utmost things , and all things of you ; kissed The wine-cup and your lips  --  straitly to feel The sacred frenzy shake this heart that bears The sacred flame , until I sang to you The wonder-song of the primeval earth  --  How Eros was first-born of all the Gods , And first made Chaos pregnant of the world . O there was that to rouse me in a woman !  --  The beauty that is wanton as life is ; The candour that is crystal-clear as stars ; The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that has no other end but love ; And all she is not , and the secrecy She is ,  --  and life 's lost wisdom , pure of thought , Which rises in her from what sunless springs ! .. But now the ecstasies of thought advance The torch beyond the precincts of your love , Beyond the human pale of your dominion . The WOMAN The WOMAN So does life weary when its youth is spent  --  And you count weariness a kind of wisdom ! O you are wise  --  in words ! You are a poet ! The cheat is not too plain . Yet one discerns How you are chafed and sharpened with desire ! The thrill strikes thro '  --  and you make poems of it , Since there 's imagination left at least To prove us how we are not respectable And give to lust a lyric rapture :  --  Yes ! Tamed tho ' he be , the animal will sing ! The POET The POET The animal will sing and drink and lust And lie with you and love you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hilarities Of the hot blood are still and anciently The same  --  they share their excellence with you ! It is alone the spirit which is chaste ; Which is austere and high ; which is not eased By all old pious and pleasurable things ; Which is athirst for news !  --  and in the search Is ventured out of your horizons , far Gone past you and beyond you , to return No more ..... whether the quest prove real or vain ! I guess myself is more than you suppose , And excellent even beyond my dreams !  --  Who shall instruct me further what I am And shame my aspiration by their own ? Not you , indeed ! I know your message to me . You tell me nothing : for it is not I , The lyric voice , the florid animal , The lover , who is yours  --  as he must be Who asks neither advancement nor the news ! The WOMAN The WOMAN What are you more than sense and sentiment , Like other men ? I have known men enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men Strained to a singular high attitude Like yours ,  --  and I have found where lust was laired In all of them ! You leave me undeceived : The brute nurses his passions at your breast , And at the heart of your humanity There is the weak , wild longing of all men Merely for love and life 's companioned joys And the mild fruit of happiness . The POET The POET Not I Am minded any more for facile things . For the indwelling God stirs in his sleep Within me , seeing in dreams the early light Of dawn blur the blind casement of his room ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN Poor windy man , so grandly , with God 's name , Mystic and eloquent ! O you are desolate As a dead mind ! I may not well believe Laughter stirs nowhere in you  --  as in me It leaps to shatter down your dreams ..... The POET The POET Of all Sad things I least can laugh with you . Despise , Pity me as you will , yet so it is : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not once so naked to the truth , So daring and defenceless ; I was keen- Sighted to see the humour of the thing And none outlaughed me !  --  but at last I felt Something more terrible than ridicule Strangely and stern as justice in myself ! Then your alert and cherished humour-sense Sickened and all died out in me , died utterly Away ..... and left me with an abject smile , Which , like a threadbare cloak , can scarce afford Decent concealment to me from the world ,  --  And something that still serves for laughter when The wine is in me ! ..... But my secret is That I am serious ! You will think me mad ! But there have lightened to my inward eye Spacious and radiant serenities Wherein there is a voice calling me on ! ..... My heart is shaken with the power of it ! Before my citadel it sounds a challenge To wake the audacious virtues of the soul , Which are themselves their own sole arbiter !  --  Therefore I can no longer laugh with you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate the joke , And sort my mood with yours . A moment 's pause . And so all 's said , And I will leave you with your life , your love , Your laughter  --  which I neither serve nor share . Night has fallen . The POET pauses a moment and then starts to go . The WOMAN rises suddenly and prepares to follow him . The WOMAN The WOMAN It shall not be  --  I will not leave you now . A moment 's silence while the POET looks at her intently . The POET The POET Why do you follow me ? The WOMAN The WOMAN I have no light . The POET The POET And have I any you are witness of ?  --  You know not what I am nor where I go . The WOMAN The WOMAN I have discerned that you are something more Than other men , to me . You give my life Serious , at last , and strange significance . And there is latent in your words to me Expression of supreme and secret things , Phrases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of adventure to the soul ! And what I have received of other men You give me not  --  the love , the lust , the gold , Which are a woman 's price to the whole world . O , I am curious of the fellowship Of one who will not love me lest he lose The marriage-kiss of the celestial bride ,  --  Lest being my master he is not his own , And gaining me he lose himself thereby . Therefore I will not leave you  --  for a little ..... It may be I shall one day touch the term And find the worth of words , as now I am Not curious of love nor eager any more . Then I shall leave you ..... and go on with life , Satiated anew and hungry as of old ! The POET The POET Hungry ?  --  for news ! for news ! ..... You know it too , The hunger and the thirst that drive us on , As once the gad-fly drove across the world The paranymph of God , delirious Io ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whither we can not tell , nor to what end ! End of the First Scene . SECOND SCENE A later hour of the same night as in the first scene . A feast in the palace of CREON . About the feast-table are CREON , HERAKLES , AMPHITRYON , ALCMENA , MEGARA , IOLAUS , and other men and women of noble Theban families . A HERALD stands behind the King 's chair . The feast is served by slaves and the door guarded by soldiers . CREON CREON to the HERALD The feast is ended . Call for silence ! The HERALD The HERALD Silence ! Silence ! The King will speak ! There is silence . Then is heard a murmur as of a great throng outside the palace . A moment 's pause . CREON CREON Hearken ! ..... To-night There is a rumour in my porticoes Of multitudes . It is my people . I Have called them , and this hour would straitly speak With them and you . I have not lightly caused Assemblage of yourselves and all the sons Of Cadmus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I charged to-night . To the guards Therefore set open wide the doors and bid My Thebans enter ! I have words to say And deeds to do that must not longer wait . The doors are thrown open and the people enter without confusion . Gradually the entire hall is completely filled . When they are all entered and silence is restablished , CREON CREON without rising ; in an even , clear , quiet voice Children of Cadmus  --  Thebans  --  Citizens  --  My people !  --  Hear me for your own concern ! And rest assured I treat to-night with you No less a matter than the commonwealth . Yet I beseech you to be patient with me Also for some small business of my own  --  Some phrases of a life 's apology That I 've matured with life itself for you , And now at last have ordered and prepared  --  Briefly , at least , and cheerfully !  --  to suit Your understanding  --  and my own as well ! A moment 's pause . I am your King ; and I am old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of life Becomes indeed a luminous and large Tranquillity , as of some afternoon Of Autumn and calm weather by the sea  --  Inures at last  --  after so many years ! ..... At least there is a fine unfettered sense Of liberality which leads me on To say that I am wise  --  and you will judge And disapprove me if you must ! You may Believe me that I know what must be done While there is hope and Fortune 's face is toward ;  --  And I can now afford your censure ! Yes , I can afford at last expensive things Which cost a man the kingdoms of the world And all their glory ! I have lived my life ; And there is nothing now can make it worth My while to shirk by any cant or creed , Enthusiasm or expectancy , Silence or sentiment , the free , extreme Analysis , the unrelenting , clear , Calm vision of a disenchanted mind . You can not bribe me now by any threat Or ruin to my life 's high edifice , Or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may one day grow Statelier and all my dreams come true of it !  --  To keep the old , pathetic , pitiable Conspiracy of silence and pretence That barely saves the faith on which you build ! I know that you must build while there is hope Of profit , while the Bride is beautiful , While Fortune 's prize , in whatsoever coin The world receives , inflames you to the task ; And while you build you can not help but say Your architecture is the noblest art  --  The only art that life can labour at ! You see the torch of life held high and bright Over my disillusion , and your hearts Are sad for me  --  but I rejoice with you ! For I have built  --  and care not very much What happens ! I am patient of all fools Who leave the why unasked ; and I am mild With knaves , who teach the bawdy , blatant beast Pious and pleasant ways ,  --  for I am old And unimpassioned and contemplative . I think , despite these sceptical strange words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your King , And I have proved myself among you all An architect . Therefore you will not say , " This is the voice of failure ! "  --  yet I know That you will find some other things to say Not half so true ! For when a man is old , He knows , at least , how utterly himself Has failed ! But say what things of me you will  --  And be assured I sympathize ! Indeed , A voice like mine is no-wise terrible , As might be the tremendous voice of truth , Should it find speech that you could understand ! Yet it may vex and dreadfully distress Reflective men  --  if such indeed there be Among you all  --  and therefore be assured I sympathize ! A moment 's pause . And so I give you thanks ..... And take my leave . I think you almost guess The public business which is your concern  --  And mine , since I concern the state and you . Briefly ' t is mete that I advise you of it : I am your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave of me , my people ! for at last I have divined a man more apt than I To wage your wars and guide your policies .  --  A moment 's pause . The King rises . All those seated at table follow his example . To him , Children of Cadmus , O my people , I yield your government , as I bequeath , When I am dead , my crown and realm to him ! His praise is in your hearts ; and by my will , And with your leave and loving welcome , he Shall be your Lord and govern in my place , Who slew Erginus and delivered Thebes  --  My grandsons ' father and in love my son  --  Herakles ! The HERALD The HERALD Hail ! All hail to Herakles ! A storm of enthusiasm breaks out among the people . When it has subsided and quiet is restored , all eyes turn to HERAKLES . A moment of silence . Then he begins to speak , finding his words with excitement and difficulty . HERAKLES HERAKLES Children of Cadmus !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but mine you shall not know Till all is known and there is Justice in me ! ..... Justice  --  and Truth ! ..... Nothing is yet resolved  --  Nothing ! ..... And who can tell what Truth shall be ? The adventurer departs ; the tidal drift Clutches his keel ; his eyes are dazed and dark ; Strange are his dreams ;  --  and the discovery Is far ! ..... But should I find myself , be sure That I will be a guide unto you all ! ..... A moment 's pause . I 'll say no more !  --  Nothing is yet resolved ..... A moment of silence . At last the people applaud . Then , at a sign from the King , the doors are again thrown open and the citizens pass out . The King remains standing after they are gone . MEGARA , ALCMENA , AMPHITRYON , IOLAUS and the other guests at the feast surround HERAKLES , pouring forth congratulations and applause . HERAKLES , deeply moved , withdraws violently from the embraces of his family and the acclamations of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with profound passion . HERAKLES HERAKLES Is this your wisdom , Sire ? and is it wise , Lightly , and thus with calm complacency , Now to believe that I , that Herakles Should hold himself so cheaply as your price ? How have you come to think me , whom you love And praise , so vain a thing and spiritless , That I , like any rash , rapacious man , Should seize this brief preferment and renown And block with brilliant insufficiencies The fair-way of ambition ?  --  By the Gods , How pitiable a thing is man 's regard ! Since you , who count yourself matured in truth , Can guess no nobler destiny for man Than all his life to be as you have been , Public and proud , constrained and crafty-wise , As fortune served and chance was bountiful :  --  Himself , the while , illiberal and unknown , Captive and undelivered and deceived ! Turning to the others And you ! I marvel who it is you name , With tears and praise and passion , Herakles ! By God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanly , and rejoice to see me sold Like any common man for a small thing ? Have I not loved you all , incessantly Loved you and lived with you ?  --  yet in despite Of all love 's witness and the test of time You dare to hold me in so little honour That you have thought me apt to be content In these safe human mediocrities  --  That you have deemed my hope so temperate , For what I am , as fortune and renown Or all the world 's casual supremacies ! For my whole life long , with my whole heart 's love , I have been with you  --  and you have not known me ! ALCMENA ALCMENA What ails you , child ? ..... My child ! I love you , know you  --  You are my son ! HERAKLES HERAKLES My self is yet unborn , Which was not when your womb conceived and bore ! AMPHITRYON AMPHITRYON What rage is this ? Implore the King 's forgiveness ! Pray to the Gods who have shown favour to you ! HERAKLES HERAKLES turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gods or you ! Sire , I will not rule by grace of God Or by your grace ! I will be Lord of none , And thus unto myself be Lord and Law !  --  No longer speaking directly to the King You think to bribe and browbeat Herakles , Force his desire and cheat his hope :  --  at last Learn from my lips that I will not be less In hope or longing than a man must be ! I , with the soul 's immortal thirst to slake , How shall I down into the shallow stream Where beasts and many men have drunk together And left foul waters strangled in their course ? Nay , by this cup I am not comforted , I am not stayed !  --  Rather , I swear to you Thirst shall consume me unappeased until I fill my pitcher at the living source , The secret , spiritual springs that rise , Radiant and crystalline in the deep light , Far on the utmost heights unvisited ! You know me not  --  and scarce have I begun To know myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the florid animal Which laughs and longs , is pleasured and distressed  --  The heart that feels and feigns , that faints and dreams , That sorrows and is glad  --  the facile brain That schemes and lies and is alert to seize Success and is ambitious of no more Than serviceable ingenuity Can aptly compass  --  that supremely serves To methodize the waste of the world 's work To profitable order and endow Life 's labour with a seeming worth and end  --  These are not I ! CREON CREON Your pardon !  --  and be sure I have no angered heart nor outraged pride To vex you with !  --  I pray you answer me One idle question :  --  after all , what else Is there of you save life and heart and brain ? You are what feels and thinks and is . What else Is Herakles ?  --  are you ? HERAKLES HERAKLES I am what knows ! I am myself , that knows  --  and shall be known ! ..... End of the Second Scene . THIRD SCENE Later of the same night as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calm night of moon and stars . A public street near the city wall . At regular intervals the wall is rendered accessible by flights of narrow stone steps . The inner face of the wall is in a deep shadow which stretches out almost to the street . HERAKLES appears , emerging from the shadow , as he climbs the nearest flight of steps . He reaches the top of the wall and pauses a moment in silence . HERAKLES HERAKLES I know them now ..... but me they shall not know , Even at last ! My youth was spent with them ; They were my most familiar and my friends  --  My lovers and the lights of welcome to me ..... Yet they discerned me not , they knew not me ! ..... And never shall they know what I become ! Death is between us now : my youth is dead , And I am dying ! ..... and I shall be reborn Beyond their understanding and their love ..... Even now I was a very stranger to them ! How shall it be when all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? ..... I dare not yet believe how utterly I shall be loveless then  --  even when love is A better thing to give , and , to receive , A more exalted thing ! ..... Then I shall know , And be unknown ; I shall be friendless then However I am heart-sick and alone !  --  O tender twilights of the days gone by , Peopled with those we loved and leave behind !  --  O secret , great departures , shared by none , Cheered by no friendly voices from the shore , No lamps set seaward for the ship 's return !  --  O irremediable solitude Of him who sails , adrift and harbourless , Far out into the distance and the dawn !  --  Speak to my heart  --  when shall my lover come ? Where is my friend ? and how shall I be known ? And who shall know me ? ..... When the Child is born , The desolate immortal Child , I know That in the night of his tremendous birth , And in the dreadful solitude , he wails And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child ? Am I at once The knower and the known ? Is there no light From soul to soul , no love from heart to heart Can span the abyss and flame across the cold , Dark , dreadful spaces of my isolation ? ..... I need assurance , now since love has failed So far , and life has so far failed to prove Myself or make me manifest to men . Who shall assure me and bear witness to me ? Whence shall the signal  --  as from star to star Rings the clear cry of the celestial choir  --  Sound thro ' the tragic taciturnities Of solitude , to me ? ..... to me at last !  --  Love to the Lover , welcome to the Friend , Raptures of recognition to the Lord ! ..... HERAKLES pauses a moment ; then turns and slowly goes back down the steps by which he ascended . As he descends he becomes gradually engulfed in the deep shadow . Before he reaches the ground , the POET and the WOMAN appear ascending to the wall by another flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pause a moment gazing over the landscape . When at last they begin to speak , the sound of their voices causes HERAKLES to stop ; and he continues to stand attentive and stirless in the shadow of the wall . The POET The POET ..... Where is Endymion ? The moon replies , Hence is my lover ! ..... and the heart cries , Hence ! ..... And hence the soul discerns the perfect friend ! ..... They lure us hence , the patient hills and fields ; The streams persuade us hence  --  hence to the sea , Where as of old the mythos of the life Of man enacts its endless destiny , And vast horizons indicate the soul ! ..... Hence is the furtherance of hope  --  The WOMAN The WOMAN The song You lately sang cries to the spirit , Hence ! Sing me the song again , for I would learn The words and have it in my heart alway . The POET The POET I made it on a day of happiness , And I am glad to-night  --  of life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , who is Lord and Life and Lover , He is forward in the fair-way , he is secret , swift and far ; And our eyes shall wake to find him and our hungry hearts discover , As he leads us , where we follow ; as he loves us , what we are ! Where the winds are shouting seaward , where the sea is streaming onward , Where the Voice calls down to find us , fearless on the starlit way , We who watch shall make the land-fall as the ship drives shoreward , sunward , Where the mountains rise resplendent , rose-wreathed in the dawn of day ! There his heart shall be our father-house , his arms receive and hold us ;  --  As he knows us we are equal ; as he trusts us we are free ! We shall learn surpassing secrets that no lips but his have told us , We shall find in his embrace ourselves transformed to more than we ! And thereafter in his house shall he alone be Lord and Master ; Life shall yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; We shall go with him together up the pathway fast and faster ; We shall see the stars surround us as his eyes dissolve the cloud ! We shall see the skies stand open ; we shall hear the stars in chorus ; From the shining peaks of thought his voice shall answer , pure and high ; And the spacious gates of light shall stand asunder full before us ; And , as all alone we enter , we shall know the Lord is I ! The WOMAN The WOMAN How mystic , mad and possible it seems , How like a clearance of life 's tangled skein , To dream , to say , to sing , " I am the Lord ! " Poet ! you know me better than myself ..... The POET The POET My poems are made of more than all I know ..... A moment of silence . The WOMAN The WOMAN Shall we go farther on ?  --  no matter where , So we go on ..... The POET The POET How the heart melts with song ! ..... How the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us go ! The light is there ..... The POET and the WOMAN turn and go down the wall , away from the spot where HERAKLES is standing . The two figures seem to disappear in the distance . HERAKLES HERAKLES emerging from the shadow into the moonlit street The light !  --  There where my dreams discern an excellence Unrealized , which I am  --  whither I go ! ..... I have but matched the beast with other beasts , The man with other men ; and when my strength , Impatient and unused , challenged me on , I have but guessed that haply , with the Gods At strife , God was within me , to defy Their curse and prove their equal and prevail ! Now let me learn to say , I am the Lord ! Since in the forward vistas of my hope , There is the Lord , the Saviour  --  there am I ! For thus I am assured my end is not Where the world ends and humble hopes go home ; Where men are crowned and beasts are satiated ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The serpent , wolf and jackal , ape and cur , Lion and hog :  --  of old the beasts are laired In life 's primeval wilderness , the dark , Trackless and devil-haunted waste within me ! ..... Yet , in the mind 's rapt outlook , I discern That in the jungle is the Householder , Whose patient labour has made room and home And let the light into his dwelling-place ! Now , while he sleeps , it may be , in his stead Garrulous ghosts and fauns infest the gloom And in his name accomplish shameful deeds , Shallow and eloquent sincerities , Profession of all faiths that falsify , And threadbare fashions of a masquerade  --  While from the teeming dark they snarl and whine , Chatter and roar and laugh , gibber and grin With greedy eyes and fangs  --  the beasts , the beasts Who harbour where his realm is unreclaimed ! ..... Yet I believe he shall not sleep alway ! Nay , he shall wake and witness  --  and suspect Himself is otherwise than all of these ! ..... O he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall wonderfully at last contrive To bring the outlawed beasts into dominion And hold them captive  --  having levelled down The dark recesses where they crouched untamed ! He shall dispel the spectres , and return The jungle to a fruitful harvest-field !  --  And then  --  O then , after the victory , He shall go forth in power and look abroad Over the spacious acres of the soul , All drowned in azure and tranquillity , Where , all bearing his harness and subdued , The mighty beasts labour and drive afar The ploughshare of his will , and spread the seed , And reap the harvest  --  and proclaim the Lord In word and deed , and celebrate the Lord ! ..... Then shall he know the Lord is I ! and feel That ecstasy of knowledge which is truth , Which is religion , which is self and soul ! ..... The voice of IOLAUS IOLAUS calling in the near distance Answer me , Lord ! ..... Where art thou ? ..... Speak to me ! ..... IOLAUS appears . Lord , is it thou ? ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End of the Third Scene . FOURTH SCENE Toward midnight of the same night as in the first three scenes . Street before the house of HERAKLES . MEGARA and the THREE SONS OF HERAKLES are in the house . The voice of MEGARA MEGARA low and sweet from within the house The rose-wreathed lattice opens wide , Beyond , the night is calm and deep ;  --  My little doves lie fast asleep Like lilies fallen side by side . They laid them down at evening ; Their eyes were clear as moonlit dew ; Across their brows the sunset threw The golden shadow of its wing . HERAKLES and IOLAUS enter slowly . They pause and listen . They kissed my face , with tender words ; Their eyelids closed as flowers close ; In dreamless , motionless repose They fell asleep like tired birds . HERAKLES HERAKLES Iolaus ..... IOLAUS IOLAUS Lord ? HERAKLES HERAKLES So Pyrrha in the dark Sang to the children of Deukalion ..... So long as there is life it shall not cease , It shall not change , this tender lullaby , This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or human grief or life 's immortal will , The inviolate serenities of night Shall hear the woman singing to her sons , Her little doves  --  my children , Iolaus ! Who shall be men , as they shall wake from sleep , Radiant in the morning , and the might Of manhood ! ..... The voice of MEGARA MEGARA as before My children sleep , whose lives fulfil The soul 's tranquillity and trust ; While clothed in life 's immortal dust The patient earth lies dark and still . No rumour rises from the street ; The stars in silence dawn and die ; The moon goes up the violet sky And treads the sea with silver feet ; And calm as inward joy , and deep , Moonlight and starlight flood the room Where close beside me in the gloom Softly my little children sleep . All night they lie against my breast And sleep , whose dream of life begins : Before the time of strife and sins , Of tears and truth , they take their rest . HERAKLES HERAKLES ..... They take their rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can you not feel  --  as I To-night bore witness to you all  --  that we , Who seem to wake in the large light of life So sensibly , in pure reality Lie in the shadow of sleep , lie prone and still On the parental breast of life like children , And take our rest ? ..... IOLAUS IOLAUS Yet we have witness , Lord , Who have so wrought in the substantial world ,  --  Yet we have witness that we wake indeed : Is not Erginus slain , Orchomenos Razed and enslaved , and Herakles  --  HERAKLES HERAKLES Enough !  --  Not by the world 's coarse manifest I am ! To me no voice but mine can testify : The violence and the glare of deeds and things Report me in no wise :  --  myself alone Proves and reveals myself : no other sign Is there at all of me save only I ! Have I not ceaselessly been here and there , Come hither and gone hence , ambitiously And humanly lived out my works and days ? Have I not gone abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned Weary and without wisdom after all ? When have I known myself , who know the world ? When have I felt , in trial or victory , The choir , the torch , the festival of truth Gladden the soul 's inviolate dwelling-place ? ..... Now am I no more eager of many things ; Neither am I much curious of proof , Save as some still conviction , secretly Wakes in the inmost mind and justifies New lights , new values , new coherencies , New strengths and virtues up the endless scale . For well I know how anciently and long The massive Sphinx has stood as now it stands , A veiled , portentous shape of shadow and silence , Against the nightfall in the mind 's dark highway ; And well I know that , anciently as now , To the inscrutable mystery of being There is no voice shall answer save the clear Silences singing in the awakened soul ! ..... IOLAUS IOLAUS There is no voice shall answer ! ..... Is there more Of man 's inheritance than all we know ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain light , in the gross world ; who rest By night ; who fall asleep at last in death ; Who feel , invincibly , darkly over us , The harsh dominion of the inconstant Gods ? HERAKLES HERAKLES Nay ! We are adepts of a mystery ! ..... The secret is at hand  --  how shall we sleep ? We are as men in awful expectation Before the threshold of a sanctuary ,  --  Whose eyes grow sometimes clear in the long vigil , Whose hearts grow sometimes mild , till they discern The glamour of a glory on the veil , The murmur of a music thro ' the portal  --  The secret , incommunicable signs Of the God 's radiant presence in his house ! The voice of MEGARA MEGARA as before My little doves , the nest is warm  --  Lie close ! the dawn shall come too soon . Sleep , in the quiet of the moon ! Sleep , in the hollow of my arm ! For yesterday is all we are , To-morrow all we yet shall be ; The end is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far ! We only know men grow and grieve And die ..... And death is strange and sore ! O sleep , my darlings , sleep !  --  before The time returns to wake  --  to live ! A moment of silence . HERAKLES HERAKLES The ancient , patient , perfect love of women ! ..... The service and the sacrifice of life To life ! ..... But to what end of life ? ..... Her voice Is clear and quiet as moonlit well-water In a vessel of shining silver ..... This is home ! A moment of silence . IOLAUS IOLAUS Let us enter , Lord . HERAKLES HERAKLES I shall not sleep to-night . I know not how it is , there is within me To-night a stern , unquiet intensity , The strangeness of a secret unrevealed  --  Almost , it seems , a fear of what I am ! ..... I am as some itinerant by night , Ignorant of his purpose and his path , Curious of both , vigilant , fearful , fain , Sleepless and sightless till the dawn is there ! ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me The rash and resolute activities Of manhood sound to-night their martial challenge Into the bright arena of the world . I am this hour inviolably alone , And like a stranger in my solitude ..... A glitter of far lights is in my brain , And in my heart something that is not hope , And in my life a hushed suspense ..... To-night , Beyond the threshold and the fire-light , Beyond the brief , familiar place of being , Held by the narrow candle-flame of life Against the invasive , dark , immense unknown , I am abroad ! ..... The heart 's unrest is nameless And absolute the mind 's uncertainties ! Ask me not whither , where or why I go : The spacious night surrounds me , and my spirit Ranges magnificently unappeased ! ..... IOLAUS IOLAUS Why must you go abroad seeking a dream When here at home all is so bountiful ? Here the King 's daughter croons your sons asleep ; Here Creon has given over to your hands His kingship by your mighty hands secured ; Here in all Greece your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed in praise ;  --  Here your estate is grown so high and splendid That hardly can the range of man 's ambition Compass a nobler destiny than yours ! HERAKLES HERAKLES So is the range of man 's ambition brief And scanted of his true divinity ! IOLAUS IOLAUS Why is your speech so strange to-night ? HERAKLES HERAKLES ' T is I Am strange ! ..... And now I think my heart would break To hear her sing again , to feel once more The tenderness and the tranquillity And sweetness of her love ,  --  the delicate Freshness of life 's warm wonder in my house . Come , let us go !  --  I shall not rest to-night . IOLAUS IOLAUS Where shall I follow , since you will not sleep ? HERAKLES HERAKLES Let us go down into the human city , Iolaus , where men and women with their sins Stray in the festive street ; where harp-players And harlots and young men sit in the taverns , And feel , all night until the daybreak stands Pale and relentless in the waking world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us go down into the human city And see how men and women love and live , Whose feet go forward to the sepulchre , Whose hearts are sick with tender syllables Unspoken , and desires unsatisfied , And liberalities no heart receives ..... Let us go down !  --  perchance they wait us there , The meaning and the sign !  --  let us go down ! End of the Fourth Scene . FIFTH SCENE Before dawn of the next day . A street before a tavern . At intervals is heard the sound of music and voices and occasional bursts of laughter from within . HERAKLES and IOLAUS enter . IOLAUS IOLAUS Now nothing more is left to seek or see . Let us return . We have been long abroad ; We have been up and down the sleepless city And far afield from where is happiness ..... Let us return . HERAKLES HERAKLES Here 's still a last , least place Where laughter is , where there is light and wine And song ..... IOLAUS IOLAUS And this is last , of all : beyond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the city wall . Here we are come to the road 's end . The earth Lies out beyond , spacious and tranquil , where The moonlight , like the nimbus that surrounds A sage in meditation , quietly And vastly and serenely luminous , Lies , pale as dreams are pale , over the world ! ..... Laughter is heard within the tavern . Then there is a moment of silence . HERAKLES HERAKLES Hark ! ..... How serene is silence ! ..... How austere ! .... How spacious ! ..... And how small and sad a thing Is laughter  --  and how sometimes terrible ! ..... There is no rumour save the sound of mirth When souls are lost ! ..... I know not how it seems To you , but I believe the Minotaur Kept out of sight and sound like a good fellow , And there was laughter in the labyrinth , And it was pleasant for them who were lost  --  Lost without hope , nor any vision of hope , Nor any faith to vex them with ambition ! Hark ! ..... How they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the panders , and the singing-women , The harlot and her ruffian !  --  And ourselves , Iolaus , ourselves , who keep so delicate , Who live so chaste and private  --  who are we , Who fill with rumour as of a festival The public precincts of the House of Life ?  --  Who vex the soul with gilt caparisons And go in power and pride and policy , Panders to profit and the world 's applause , About the brilliant business of the world ? Are we not of this ribald company , These toilers for the selfsame prize as we , Only of less profession and renown  --  These merrymakers in the labyrinth , Who singing sit beside the sallow tapers , Derelict , dispossessed , delinquent ,  --  dead ? Why so we are , by God !  --  king , soldier , priest , Cut-purse and prostitute  --  in fact the same Poor men and women , all of us  --  so kin , So far adrift , so dark , so solitary ! ..... Then let 's within and claim our fellowship ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied ! IOLAUS IOLAUS Nay , we have seen to-night too much of this . Let us return ! The street and the night end . Let us return  --  my heart is sick for home ! ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES O we are very far from where is home To that within us which is comfortless  --  The heart that is not patient of our thrift ; The soul that is not pleasured as we are In safe , substantial mediocrity ! To-night , in street and tavern , anxiously , Like children fatherless and dispossessed , We were come out to seek our heritage ; We were come out to seek for more than all Our lives have variously informed us of , And more than all we know !  --  What rest is there , Or where shall we go home , who have not found Ourselves or what is ours ? Whither away And in what casement stands the lamp for us Who drift as might a helmless derelict , Errant with wind and tide over dark seas ? This shall we hardly learn at last to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our eyes find fire along the forward way , Till that reprieve of freedom , peace and power When we have saved the grain and strawed the chaff With a most jealous fan throughout the ripe Acreage of the spirit 's harvest-field ! ..... Truly I am not now as once I was , Replete , exultant , proved , resistless , proud , When all the Sons of Cadmus hailed me victor ! Rather my joy is quelled of all my deeds ; For worth is of myself , and I have none ..... Yet do they rate me by no means , whose choice And crown proclaim me Lord ! It well may be You doubt me . True , I know not what it means  --  And all is doubt ! ..... Yet there is born within me To-night a sense of outcast solitude , The darkness of a flame-rent thunder-cloud , And peril and devastation in my brain ,  --  While in my heart , like devious , distant fire , The thread of hope leads thro ' the labyrinth ! ..... What is the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized ; when the mind unlocks The treasure-house of truth ; when , loosed and winged , Ambition ceases of itself to be So gross , so measured , so commensurate With possible and perishable things ? ..... The voice of the WOMAN WOMAN singing in the tavern I know not why we drink and feast Unless it be to make us laugh , Who waste the grain and store the chaff , Who starve the God and glut the beast ! Yet know I not how wine can make , Of all sad things , a woman smile ; For what is wine to so beguile The heart that bleeds and will not break ? I know but this  --  we can not bear The truth that laughter hides so well ! ..... And all the damned dead souls in Hell Scream with eternal laughter there ! A rumour of voices in the tavern . IOLAUS IOLAUS Poor wanton wretch !  --  God pity her ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Not so ! Bravely she sings her heart out , and in tune , And strictly to the measure of its truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their worth ! And briefly she has made a song of how Her life is bankrupt for some scraps of tinsel . No God is wise enough to pity her , Nor sad enough ! Her tragedy is yours And mine ;  --  O verily this alone is all Life 's tragedy , that in the strict account Of truth we find  --  whose lives were cheaply sold At the world 's price in chaplet , coin or crown  --  Such meagre profit , such tremendous loss ! And be assured it is not pitiable To sing one 's heart out , as she sings , of it : Bravely , and not too sadly  --  and in tune ! The rumour of voices is renewed in the tavern . Then silence . A pause . The voice of the POET POET singing in the tavern I know not what it is appears To us so worth the tragic task :  --  I know beneath his ribald masque Man 's sightless face is grey with tears ! I know not why it is we dread To lie in death 's embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone Who asks with all his love for bread ! I know not how , I know not why We save the hope that naught fulfils :  --  I know that life constrains and kills The dying soul that will not die ! ..... The rumour of voices breaks out in the tavern , louder than before . HERAKLES HERAKLES Hearken ! ..... and hear the voice of human woe , Crying aloud and crude and comfortless ! Hark , from the cheated and distempered mind , This harsh and ancient outburst of despair Proclaim we are all perdurable men And perjured souls and hearts that still conserve A pitiable efficiency of pain ! Then question of yourself , and you shall find His voice is mine and yours  --  if we could sing ! In each of us the serpent of despair Sleeps  --  or is roused and strikes his poisoned fangs Deep in the heart and brain , till one must die , The serpent or the soul ,  --  unless we charm Serpent and soul with song ! For song alone Makes tolerable to us the acrid lees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , Which , undiluted , in thought 's crystal cup , Are of too cogent anguish to the soul . He charms who is not strong enough to slay ! He sings who is not brave enough to know , And in himself feel truth exemplified ! Thus , I believe , the tragic poet sings Because he fails to do a better thing : Up from the ruins of his failure starts The phoenix-bird of song :  --  he knows the while How far aloft God 's eagle eyes the sun ! ..... Had we the will , the strength , the hardihood To let the light inform us utterly , And so transfuse and interchange with all Gross elements that we were born again , Perfect and true ;  --  had we the stern resolve And power and passion of our sacred cause To bear the pangs of childbirth to the end , And die to live ;  --  in such comparison What were a life 's magnificence of song ? ..... God is within the soul  --  and who has been A little toward Him , sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves the best undone ..... The poet wakes , indeed ,  --  but merely sings ! Yet therefore is he more than other men ; For they come hardly into wakefulness , And briefly , and in terror and great pain , Soon to relapse , latent and lost in sleep ..... Are we not all , in silence and alone , Sepulchred living under dreams and dust ? ..... And if at last we dreadfully revive , Straitened and gagged in death 's caparisons , Within the unspeakable solitude and dense Silence and brutal blackness of the grave , ' T is but to glimpse the shining star of hope With false persuasion of transcendent joy  --  And then , as faith 's uplifted face dislimns , To die immobile in the narrow night , Our hearts constricted with a frenzied fear Of death 's deceit ,  --  with life 's supreme appeal ! The poet sings  --  and lives ! And I believe , Should one audacious rebel  --  even the soul 's Champion  --  who was not eased with poems , essay His strength against the terror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yea ! till he went his way from us ,  --  perchance To prove the Saviour of us , on his way ! A rumour of voices ; then loud applause in the tavern . A chorus of MEN and WOMEN A chorus of MEN and WOMEN singing in the tavern Dionysos ! God begot thee , woman bore thee , Dionysos ! Now before thee Dance the Mnads who adore thee , Who are of thy fellowship ! Every heart is frenzied for thee , Dionysos ! every lip Glisters with the wine we pour thee , Crimson as the sacred stain When the sacrifice is slain  --  Dionysos ! Wild laughter and applause within the tavern . IOLAUS IOLAUS Let us go hence , go hence ! Behold , the night Grows pale and passive as a sick man 's face At daybreak as he lies asleep . It dawns . The livid light comes down the dreadful street Timidly as a tired vagrant child , And stand between us here before the tavern , Naked and shivering in its threadbare dress . HERAKLES HERAKLES When shall it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horizons , dark with dreams , The Child of Light shall rise from sleep and stand Radiantly in the silent place of peace ? ..... When shall it be that he shall venture down The strange , remote , dark thoroughfares of thought , And stand with shining feet before the tavern , Where all night long his servants brawl and feast , In pale and passionless severity ? ..... When shall it be his presence shall eclipse The flickering , brief , clandestine candle-light That lust has kindled in the House of Life ? ..... When shall he enter by the dolorous door Of love and faith , where death at last comes in , And bind the slaves by his resistless will , Who made his house a place of harlotry And lies and lamentations and vain deeds And vice and violence and vociferation ? ..... When shall he rise from sleep and go abroad ? ..... We know not when  --  yet surely they shall know Who keep his vigil ! And , within that hour , At last the slaves ' ignoble revelry , Their spectral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they shall learn How little is the Lord indeed from home ! And men shall witness and the Gods shall know That he is risen  --  the grave and gracious Lord Is risen , and on his way ! And they shall see His light go forward , and about his feet The flowers of spiritual trust and truth Wake in the silent meadows deep in dusk Beside the stream-course of the spirit 's life ! And they shall hear his voice , serene as stars , Strengthen to song , like scattered birds who wake Crying in wet tree-twilights , as with hands Lustrous and loving he dilates the gloom With muffled splendour ; while , superbly winged , The deep-eyed virtues of the soul 's perfection Rise like essential perfumes , sweet and strong ! ..... The voice of the POET POET singing in the tavern Her eyes were dark as violet ; Her face was white as sunburnt sand ..... Because we could not understand , Love turned and left us , hand in hand  --  Her lips surrendered , red and wet ! I saw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voice of the WOMAN WOMAN singing in the tavern He laid his brows against my breast ; He kissed my breast with lips of flame ; His voice made music of my name ; And in the sunless house of shame Between his arms he held me pressed !  --  He knew not what it was to me , Or what to him , thereafter , love might be ! The voice of the POET POET as before I felt her heart beat hard and high ; I saw her eyes grow blurred and blind ;  --  There came a mist across my mind ..... Her hair fell round me soft as wind And lustrous as a moonlit sky ..... For pleasure of her was my breath Broken , as one who labours near to death ! ..... The voice of the WOMAN WOMAN as before The desolation ; the despair ; The hope ; the love ; the will to be Spendthrift of the heart 's treasury ; The soul 's inviolate chastity Were all of me he could not share ! He asked no more of love than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss ! The voice of the POET POET as before I held her all the dumb night long , And still at daybreak she was there , When , groping thro ' the dark , dense air , The dawn 's chill fingers touched her bare Pale body , clear and smooth as song ! ..... The stealthy light fell , grey as dust , Silently in the sordid place of lust ! The voice of the WOMAN WOMAN as before Love can not enter by the door Where lust comes fierce and florid in ! They play no game that love can win , Who stake the outlawed coins of sin ,  --  Yet love can lose one heart the more ! For truth lies deep beneath the lie ; And Death has digged no grave where souls can die ! The voice of the POET POET as before And silently I went my way ; The heart within me wailed and wept ! ..... I would have kissed her as she slept  --  And dared not ! Like a thief I crept Scared and alone into the day ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the dreadful street ! The voice of the WOMAN WOMAN as before Quenched is the flame in us whereof Love 's sacred lamp is lit ; and we Are captives as damned souls must be ; And hence from Hell shall none go free Whose lives have lost the key of love !  --  Who neither asked nor sought nor knocked , To them alone Truth 's treasure-house is locked ! A confused tumult of voices in the tavern , which gradually subsides until at last there is silence . IOLAUS IOLAUS ..... On broken heartstrings is their music made To hear them laugh and sing I half believe , As you declare , that laughter broke their hearts ..... And they have fashioned of all shattered things The phrase of an incomparable grief , And called it song  --  which is indeed a cry Something more strangely sad than any tears . O come with me to the still house of joy !  --  There is a sorrow in the vacant street , And even the light is like a lamentation ..... He pauses . HERAKLES neither speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us return ! There is a kind of judgment in the light  --  Something austere and chaste and pitiless , Dealing impartial justice to us all ..... Let us return  --  for God 's sake let us go ! I can no longer bear to hear them sing ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Hark  --  there is silence ! Hark  --  and you shall hear , Vast and inviolate , while they seem to sing , The inveterate silence of the sepulchre  --  Where he is lying inert as dead men lie , Who is the deathless holy spirit of man  --  Massively overwhelm their melody ! There is a sound , a semblance as of song , A quiver of rhythmic motion in the air ..... But then and still thereafter there is silence , Strictly distinguished to the inward ear . Hark  --  and your soul shall hear it as I do ! They sing not  --  neither can they sing at all , Who are as we in bondage to this world ! Their music is a shallow counterfeit , The unsubstantial echo of a voice ;  --  Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul 's Deep seas of elemental harmony ! ..... Hearken within yourself ! Hearken within , And hear how still , how gaunt and dumb it is ! ..... O there is silence , silence in us all ! We are some handfuls of gross clay assembled , Wherein there is a tremor and a tone , A pitiable vibration which is song As men rate song in their discordant lives ..... And far within is silence !  --  Otherwise , Otherwise is the full free voice of man , The one true voice , our own voice !  --  when there is No silence by the altar any more ; When there , in strength and in tranquillity , The hieratic , consecrated soul Intones its canticle of self-reprieve , And all its powers and liberties proclaim The chaunt of the divine awakening ! ..... The tavern door opens . A little crowd of men and women stumble noisily into the street . Among them are the POET and the WOMAN . They all pause uncertainly , staring vaguely about them . A MAN A MAN Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's name , How cold it is ! The POET The POET As chill and chaste as death ! A MAN A MAN Let 's go back ! There 's no hospitality And nothing comfortable in all this world Save , there within , the wine and candle-light . The POET The POET Save drunkenness and dark !  --  Is there not death ? Poor ghost ! Poor tomb-dweller !  --  Is there not death ? A MAN A MAN I would to God there were death  --  for all poets ! And silence for all singers , save of some Small mirthful songs of bawdry and pleasant things ..... A HARLOT A HARLOT Truth is , Stranger , your songs are keen as pain . A MAN A MAN His songs are serious  --  and most damnable ! Wine brings susceptibility  --  and dawn 's A desperate hour , when a mere song 's grief May tragically rouse the heart to tears And vain misgivings ..... A HARLOT A HARLOT As for me , I love To weep when there is music . Give me songs Of noble sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No tearful wench for me , nor tearful song ! Poets and whining women  --  damn such fools ! Gay hearts , gay women , gay good-fellowship , Wine and gay music  --  so a man is pleased ! The POET The POET Eyes of the deathless Gods , look down , look down ! Behold this tragic masque of marionettes ! ..... And laugh because we weep , and laugh the more Because we laugh  --  and lie , and dare not live In the confession of reality ! A MAN A MAN Damn you , be silent ! and deliver us Of all your tedious solemnities ! Already you have robbed the night of mirth , And now , despite the wine , nothing is left But daylight and despondency ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN In truth I 'll not believe a poet could so far Vex and subdue your wanton hearts with words . Are you not men of business and affairs , Hard men of worldly practice and the world ? And he 's  --  merely a voice ! and such a voice As you shall hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe you 're out of tune With laughter for a song 's worth of strange words ! Even a poor wench can laugh !  --  The end of mirth Comes only when the cheerless heart is cracked And the frail spark of life flutters and fails ! ..... The POET The POET ..... Comes only when we learn there is more hope Than life can give ; more truth than words can say ! A HARLOT A HARLOT Enough ! It 's bitter cold here in the dawn , And I 'll no longer wait and freeze and tire To hear you snarl and curse at one another !  --  Let 's all to bed ! A MAN A MAN The wench is right  --  let 's go ! They all start off and move , in a straggling group , toward HERAKLES and IOLAUS , whose forms are hardly distinguishable in the grey twilight . Suddenly one of the women halts . A HARLOT A HARLOT There are strangers here  --  yonder ! A MAN A MAN Two men ..... Calling Who 's there ? HERAKLES takes a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN Your pardon ! ..... If a man may question you , My Lord , and since we chance to meet  --  who are you ? A moment of silence . HERAKLES scans the faces before him almost anxiously . HERAKLES HERAKLES I am a man who seeks  --  and has not found ; Who asks  --  and is not answered ; who has knocked Yet none has opened to him the secret door . Do you bring news  --  and welcome  --  and the alms ? The WOMAN separates herself from the group and draws nearer to HERAKLES . A HARLOT A HARLOT What says he ? A MAN A MAN I can hardly tell ..... A MAN A MAN He seems In some delusion  --  The POET The POET Then perhaps he 's drunk !  --  Are we not all at dawn a little drunk ? The WOMAN The WOMAN Be still ! ..... The POET The POET What now ? Why do you stare and stare ? ..... I say his wine has been to many a man Persuasion of delirious things and words , And specious dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOMAN Be still ! Look in his eyes ! ..... The POET The POET to HERAKLES Your pardon , Sir ! The wench has drunk her share  --  He turns to the WOMAN . The sight of her thrills and startles him . His whole mood and manner change . He draws close to her and speaks to her alone . Tell me the news : Is it the Secret ?  --  Speak ! The WOMAN The WOMAN speaking as tho ' entranced ..... There is within His eyes a candid infancy of light  --  A birth of splendour  --  and a mystery ! A vigil  --  and a voice !  --  the light that leads , Convinces and absolves  --  like sunlight ! Far , Far in his eyes it dawns ! ..... I seem to see So far within  --  so far ! His eyes are like Some sudden window , opening in the night ..... Thence may the soul stare skyward  --  to the stars ! Look in his eyes , if you have will to see ! All other eyes of men are closed and dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , I know ! There , in the utmost distance , there is God ! ..... There is the light of God , splendid and strange ! ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES with passion Are you the herald and the messenger ? The POET The POET Herald of hope and messenger of news ! ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES heedless of all save the WOMAN Is there indeed light in the window  --  light To prove the Lord is in his house and wakes , Who has slept overlong ? You say the light Is lit , the sign is there to show he wakes At last  --  and feels across his solemn brows The rose-winged wind of venture and vast skies , And in the chamber where he darkly slept , Gradual and pale , the calm , sane light of dawn ? ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN Yours is the sign ! You are the light ! HERAKLES HERAKLES At last ! ..... How I have sought you ! O is it you indeed ? And do you bring me news at last and welcome  --  News of myself and welcome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now The Lord wakes in his chamber silently , And like a stranger and athirst for love , And all aflame to know and to be known ? ..... Know you indeed the Lord ? and is he there , The one true perfect friend , who is most friendless ;  --  The matchless lover , whose love none receives , And who is loved of none ? Look in my eyes ! Tell me the light is there  --  that I am He ! ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN .... You are the strength , the light , the life ,  --  the Lord ! What shall I do that I may love you ? The POET The POET Speak ! Have you the strength ? Have you the light  --  the life ? HERAKLES HERAKLES speaking to the WOMAN alone Only believe and all shall yet be well ! Love and believe ! I have no more than faith To guide me , and no more to comfort me Than love ,  --  and mine is still the greater need ! Mine is the greater need , for mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The strength is there  --  The secret strength I almost fear to feel ! Measureless is the strength and merciless  --  And like a child whose eyes are vague with sleep , Haunted with dreams and dazed with real light ;  --  Whose mind , with dark pre-natal memories , Is still perplexed , and hardly yet evolved From ancient error and the brutal grasp Of fear , force , falsehood , destiny , and death ;  --  Who is not yet self-realized , self-assured , Conscious and calm in thought , in aim , in will . Yet , as I must believe , do you believe , And all shall come to pass , and all be well ! ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN I love and I believe ! I see the light ; I feel the strength that will not stay or spare ; I know the Lord ; I know that he shall come To bring me the good news ! HERAKLES HERAKLES O be assured Of victory ! I love you ! I shall come Again to you ..... Be faithful till I come ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARLOT A HARLOT He bids her " Be thou faithful Until I come ! " All laugh except HERAKLES , the WOMAN , and the POET , who remain thrilled , startled , and absorbed .

How shall I know ? ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN conscious only of HERAKLES You will not leave me  --  now ? HERAKLES HERAKLES I leave with you one who is more than I  --  Even the soul  --  even the Spirit of Truth ! ..... He shall be with you always to the end , Who is the guide , the way , the comforter ! I may not rest : I love you and must go . He shall bear witness in my stead .

My soul is an invaded citadel , A precinct where contending armies wait , Fierce and resolved ,  --  the death-grip is still toward ! ..... And if I win at all it shall be hard ! This very hour all is in jeopardy :  --  The dark whirls in my vision even now ; And like the rumour of resurgent tides I hear the ancient curse of error cry Up well-worn estuaries of the shaken mind ! ..... Suddenly voices are heard crying in the distance , and a confused rumour as of some great commotion in the city . IOLAUS IOLAUS Lord !  --  do you hear ? Some mischief is afoot ! The city cries as with a single voice !  --  What can it be ? Some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and come again . IOLAUS hastens away . HERAKLES HERAKLES .....

In my heart I hear their cries resound ! They are my soldiers and my people ! Hark ! ..... There in this hour my plumed battalions wait Their leader , and my citizens their King . They know not and they will not understand Whither away I am gone on so far Without them ,  --  I , who shall not now return ! ..... The die is cast , and , come what may , I take The bounty of ambitious destinies To be my birthright , nor shall Gods or men Force and delude me from my utmost goal !

HERAKLES HERAKLES Go on before me , I will shortly come ; Leave me , for I have need to be alone . The WOMAN The WOMAN Lord ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES For a little , leave me , I will come . This much is certain , that I will be free ! And therefore I will come to bid farewell To rank and power and every servitude . I will not heed the cost of what may bring Deliverance . Leave me ! I will shortly come  --  And find you there where the world waits for me ! ..... After a moment of hesitation they all depart : the POET first , then the WOMAN and IOLAUS ; lastly the little crowd from the tavern . As these last are leaving they pause a moment to look at HERAKLES . A MAN A MAN My Lord , forgive me if I question you  --  What is your name ? HERAKLES HERAKLES Men call me Herakles . The men and women depart , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCENE This scene immediately follows the preceding in time . The sun is only just risen . Thebes . Before the house of HERAKLES . MEGARA stands upon the threshold of the open door . MEGARA MEGARA The golden wings of light beat up the sky ; The stars are set ; the dew-fall and the dawn Are everywhere , quiet as benediction ; The earth 's fresh perfumes , like an incense , rise Into the windless , universal air ; And even the old , blank city ways are still And flushed like pathways in love 's paradise ..... It is morning !  --  and my lover is not come ! A pause . MEGARA MEGARA sings . She waited in the bride-chamber ; Her face was young and clear as light ; Her lips were sensuous and bright ;  --  The Bridegroom came not unto her . She kept fresh flowers in the room ; Her eyes were spacious as the sea ; And thro ' the open casement she Kept vigil till her Lord should come . She saw the stars go up the sky ; The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair ;  --  She would not break her faith to die . She set a signal in the day ; She set a beacon in the night ; The guarded flame of love burned white And single in her heart alway . She waited in the bride-chamber : Her hair was soft as sleep ; her breast Was tranquil , like a place of rest ..... The Bridegroom came not unto her . " His heart , " she said , " is here at home ; His love , I know , abides with me ; And he would choose his bride to be Prepared and perfect should he come . " She waited in the lonely years ; The bride-chamber was all her room ; She dreamed not of another doom ; She had no thought or time for tears . And when the Bridegroom came at last And found his Bride serene and strong , He said , " Beloved , I tarried long , But now despair and doubt are passed . " She said , " I know not what you mean ; I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better thing Life can not be than mine has been ! For I have lived with Truth and Love , And all my life was beautiful And strong and fortunate and full And great and good and glad thereof ! " A pause . Friendless he seemed  --  inimical and strange And splendid , when his angered strength cast down The diadem and scorned the pride of kings ! Yet wherefore were his rapture and his rage ? Why was he so tremendous and estranged And resolute last night against us all ? Where is he now  --  and when shall he return ..... My heart is like a place of desolation , And like a lost child in a woful place ; The jealous depths of love are calm no more , After last night , but shaken and dismayed ..... I would to God he were come home to me ! She pauses to gaze about her and then returns slowly into the house . A moment after , HERAKLES appears . HERAKLES HERAKLES O bland and tranquil human habitation , Fortunate house of happiness and love , Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is very tender and exquisite as song , And where the meaning of the Mystery Is simply and ineffably revealed !  --  O treasure-house of kind and serious joys , Hushed , holy house of peace , my house , my home !  --  I know not in my heart what nameless fear Afflicts me as mine eyes behold you now ! Is it perhaps the dread that hence from you Lies the new promise of the forward way , And hence the issue , and the sunrise hence ? Yet , in the clear accounting of all things , I have no guess what voyage of the soul Could take me hence from you , O tranquil house !  --  O mother of my children , O my sons ,  --  My little sons , so fair and young ,  --  from you ! Is not the best of being here at home ?  --  The candour and the loveliness of life ; Beauty and innocence of days ; and all The wise , warm , ancient virtues of the heart , And all the peace of the prodigious soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flowers Perfumes the quiet chambers where you sleep ! ..... My love is with you , and my dearest thought Is of you , and where you are there am I In spirit and in love ! ..... I will not fear ! This is the loveliest and most bountiful Of all good fortune of man 's mortal life : Surely it shall not for the truth 's sake pass Out of the sum of real prosperities ! Rather my loved ones and my love shall share , Always with me and to whatever end , The days and ways of the enfranchised soul ! A moment 's pause . Then he calls : Megara ! MEGARA appears in the doorway . MEGARA MEGARA Herakles !  --  at last ! at last ! She runs forward to greet him . My love  --  my dear , dear love  --  at last come home ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Is not my whole heart always here at home ? MEGARA MEGARA O welcome , welcome !  --  As it was with me When I first loved you , so it is to-day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , anxious , heart-sick days of doubt ..... My heart was like a house of mourning : now There is rejoicing and the sound of song , The light of festival !  --  The Well-beloved Returns at last , the Bridegroom is at hand ! HERAKLES HERAKLES O come into my arms ! I seem to feel Beat in your breast the strong and simple heart , The faithful and inveterate heart of life , Which animates with the bright blood of being The diverse fruit of earth 's vast pregnancies ! ..... They embrace . A slight pause . Where are my sons ? MEGARA MEGARA They hardly wake from sleep . One called you in the night , speaking your name . HERAKLES HERAKLES My children ! ..... And my Love ! O Megara , Say that you love me always to the end ! MEGARA MEGARA I love you to whatever end may come , Ever and always and without reprieve ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Then , and in silence , hear me to the last . I know how little truth is speakable ; And I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express the soul ;  --  Yet it may be your love shall understand !  --  Last night you saw me and you heard me speak . Wonder no more because I cast away The crown !  --  for even last night I was assured That in the compass of the soul 's ambition , In the resources of man 's utmost strength , In the dim , secret treasure-house of thought , There were perfections more supreme , desires More absolute , achievements more divine , Than any that the world is witness of ! ..... Then did I blindly wreak my inmost will , And had no understanding of my deeds . But in the dawn ,  --  O , in the morning ,  --  then I found the very truth , as in a vision !  --  The light !  --  and I was plainly justified , And perfectly ; for this is truth 's first lesson , And easiest , and least of price ,  --  that all Business and pleasure and preferment , fame And government and grandeurs of this world Are but the toys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infancy . Who knows the mind 's austere maturities , The heart 's full-grown intensities ;  --  who sees The treasures of the Spirit , fabulous Beyond imagination ;  --  I believe Naught else , to him , is profitable at all  --  No triumphs , glories , kingdoms , amplitudes Of fortune , pleasures , majesties , dominions ! I am but newly waked into the light ; My way begins ,  --  my way , my hope , my hazard . For truly I have found myself at last , And in myself a promise more supreme And an inheritance more bountiful Than thought can understand or faith believe ! ..... Self-mastered to some purpose more than mine , In the first morning , with the soul 's first-fruits I come to you !  --  O brave wise heart of love , Surely you shall not fear to share with me The best , hereafter , and the best alone : Love , labour , and the fierce incertitudes ! ..... MEGARA MEGARA Hardly I guess the meaning of your words . And well it may be that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ..... Yet take me  --  keep me  --  lead me to your light ! My sons and you and I ,  --  we are one life , One love , one being ,  --  naught shall make us twain ! HERAKLES HERAKLES I also know not what my words may mean ..... I know not what the price of truth may be , Or what the cost of man 's perfection is To man , or how the soul is satisfied . I know but this : that ever and evermore I shall not rest ! ..... O it may come to pass That if you love me you shall die of it  --  As who shall not before the Journey 's end ? For thus we die to live perpetually ! ..... And even it well may be , for all I know , That only in exceeding bitter sorrow Are we so slain and sacrificed and saved !  --  That all with heavy labour and cruel cost The soul must reap in life 's neglected fields The living bread , and in untended vineyards Press from ripe fruit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard The truth 's divine imperatives shall prove ? Courage , strong heart ! Be sure there is no more That must be done than man at best can do ! And if you find yourself , as well you may , Best in the strong sublimity of love ,  --  O then come with me to the perfect end ! ..... MEGARA MEGARA What have I else in all my life to do ?  --  Your spirit is my strength , your heart my refuge ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Megara ! ..... O it may be we shall win , And come into the heritage ! At least We shall go on in the fair-way till death , Serious and stedfast and supremely one ! The SONS OF HERAKLES appear in the doorway of the house . MEGARA MEGARA ..... In the fair-way till death ! HERAKLES HERAKLES My Love ! He perceives his children , who issue from the doorway . My sons ! HERAKLES tenderly embraces the children . A MESSENGER appears . The MESSENGER The MESSENGER Herakles !  --  Lord !  --  The envoys of Eurystheus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERAKLES Why are you come to me ? The MESSENGER The MESSENGER They will not speak Their master 's message save alone to you . Therefore the summons of the King is sent To bid you straightway to the Agora . HERAKLES HERAKLES The Agora ! ..... Liberty is beyond ! ..... Thro ' and beyond my path of freedom leads . He turns to MEGARA and the children . Come , Well-beloved  --  let us go down together . For they must take farewell of the rank world Who walk their own ways into Paradise ! ..... End of the Sixth Scene . SEVENTH SCENE Early morning . The beginning of this scene and the preceding scene are contemporaneous . Thebes . The Agora . In the Agora are CREON and ALCMENA , seated and surrounded by a body of soldiers . Immediately before the King stands AMPHITRYON ; at some distance beyond stand the MESSENGERS OF EURYSTHEUS , three in number . The rest of the Agora is filled by a vast concourse of people . AMPHITRYON AMPHITRYON They come safe-guarded as Ambassadors , As envoys of Eurystheus  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMPHITRYON With insolence and pride They dare recall our kinship and proclaim Herakles subject of the Argive King ; Yet sworn to silence save to him they seek , By no persuasions will their lips disclose The serious purpose of their embassage . AMPHITRYON seats himself beside the King . CREON CREON These are strange tidings ; and the veil that masques The face of destiny seems dark indeed ..... AMPHITRYON AMPHITRYON I fear their silence and their proud reserve . What can their message be to Herakles ? CREON CREON What to their message shall your son reply ? Not in the vulgar press of circumstance Is fate concealed , but in the soul of man ! And we have seen , last night , into the soul Of Herakles enough , at least , to make The question poignant and the doubt supreme ! ALCMENA ALCMENA Last night ! ..... I thought a stranger stood before me Clothed in the likeness of my son ..... To-day I dare not guess what dark catastrophe The Gods prepare to try his secret strength , To thwart his undivined , misguided will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stroke Of adverse fortune , nor the coward heart Or evil purpose of Eurystheus ' hate , Nor dark catastrophe ;  --  I fear the man Who struck the crown of kingship from his brows And gave us earnest of the soul 's ambition ! Man fashions fate after his own design ; And in his likeness , as a mirror is , The face of life is featured and expressed ; And he deciphers on a vacant page His sense , his story , his significance . Who can predict what Herakles shall see When he lays bare the future 's shrouded face ? Who can foretell what sense his soul shall find , What stately meaning , what majestic myth , Inscribed on life 's familiar palimpsest ? ALCMENA ALCMENA He is beyond recognizance ! ..... My love 's Maternal arms feel vacant of my son ! CREON CREON ..... I have played the game out to its mean mild end , And won the world 's prize , in a certain measure . Now , being quit with fortune and grown old , I am no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake is in the game ,  --  But , disabused of life 's persuasions , which O'erbalance justice in its own defence , I sit apart in the clear empty light Of wisdom , as in some pale aftermath , And grow , in justice and serenity , Clearly and patiently contemplative . Therefore I find for this emergency Some thoughts which come not all inaptly in To help our understanding of the man Who yesternight was strange unto us all . For I have lately , in the liberal years , Foregone the lore of cheap philosophies Which find an ultimate identity In all the souls and destinies of men . Crowds are but numbers ; and at last I see There are not merely players of the game ; There is not , high or low , only the one Sensible and substantial prize to which The fiat of the world gives currency ,  --  And which , in various ways , is always won ! There is besides the one , estranged , rare man , Whose light of life is splendid in the soul , Burns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such special grandeur to ambition , That he will make no terms with fortune , nor Play for whatever prize the game affords . He thinks to vanquish destiny , enforce The Gods , and , by transcendent strength and toil , Earn  --  what alone of all things must be earned  --  The soul 's prize  --  which is always just the soul !  --  The soul , self-mastered , self-assured , self-known , God-like ! and with the deathless Gods co-heir Of truth 's ineffable eternities ;  --  The soul , despised , neglected and concealed ,  --  And yet , in truth , as in his raptured mind , Perhaps the great prize  --  which is always lost ! And therefore , wisdom says , no prize at all ! But merely , for the common use of life , A fatal lure , a frenzied hope , a dream And madness of imaginative minds ..... So is the world 's work justified ! And last , Now , when the game of life is played  --  and lost ,  --  Lost in the main , yet somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  The humour of the thing comes quietly home , As we discern how wise we were to take The loss for granted  --  and enjoy the game ! We learn our weakness ; learn to thank the Gods That we were weak and had no prospect of The prize , no lonely and supreme ambitions ; Learn , at the last , on what fantastic terms Life is a conflict , since in fate 's despite All men may yet prove victor  --  save the strong ! The irony , to man 's maturer mind , Sorts with his ancient pleasant sense of things . He marks the stress of gross necessities , Immedicable and unalterable , Which shape the trifling destinies of man ; He finds an average of circumstance , Equal to all men in the true last test ; He learns how much , by temperance and fear , The weak men of the world persuade the Gods ; And smiling with a mild and undeceived Despair , he sees the strong men of the soul Enforce the times to their discomfiture , And , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a common man Is very comfortably compromised , Contrive their stately and remorseless ruin ! Yes ! ..... he discerns , beyond his private fault And failure ,  --  when the game is played , and lost ,  --  Where thought turns sick and dizzy and dismayed On the black borders of its own abyss ,  --  How all men living are not ever free , But straitly prisoned in the Mystery , Burdened beneath the universal strength , Merged in the flux of dark infinities ..... Which are the Gods !  --  in whose relentless grasp The strong man strives and strangles and is slain . Then , to his humour , men resemble most Dull creatures who live down at the dense , dark , Fathomless , dumb foundations of the sea ,  --  Who , if they are not pliant , and too weak , Too yielding to resist , are broken and burst , Crushed out of life under the passionless , Insuperable weight of the element In which they live and move and have their being . Are we not justly , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  Cautioned to bear with wise humility The utmost rigours of unyielding chance , And meet the serious issues of the soul As I have done  --  with a mild gayety , An unambitious mind and a lax will ! So may we prosper to some worldly end ; So may we gain assured maturities And aptitudes for a well-ordered life ; So , in the lesson of many years , at last , We earn some sense of what the Gods can do , At best or worst , to ruin or redeem . And therefore , by the witness of his words Last night , I find our Herakles imperilled Not by the Gods but by himself alone !  --  For the strong man no calculus computes , No reason reckons , no arithmetic Demonstrates or foresees by any means . Only we know there is no mortal peril So dire , so desperate as to be strong ! AMPHITRYON AMPHITRYON You are the King ! and may , by word and deed , Give aid and counsel to my son . CREON CREON Alas ! ..... Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hinder , if a man 's free will Furthers and guides and justifies his being ? The strong receive no help as they are strong ; They spare not  --  and they are not ever spared By Gods or men ; the counsel of the wise , The tender tears of love 's solicitude , Can not deter them or persuade them home ! Alas ! Strength is a hazard none may share , A genius none may caution or advise . The strong man and the humble man are twain By the one real division of men 's lives And destinies : there a great gulf is fixed , A dark abyss no rainbow-bridge can span , Between life 's level places of brief hopes , Familiar ways , and measurable ends , And the starred skies of thought 's imagination . To you my kingship seems a proper prize For life 's fulfilment ;  --  but last night we learned How the ambitious soul scorns to deserve Life 's facile , fortunate prosperities . I think to such a one the purpose of His will , the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion  --  as a vision Of truth , which gives his strange soul liberty To flame its furtherance thro ' the wise world ! ..... Vainly for his advantage we discern How , soon or late , with ancient irony , The wise world , sitting at the spectacle , Hails his surrender or his helpless ruin . For when the mad light dawns , the waking soul Endures no lesson save its own , receives No truth save what itself exemplifies ! Suddenly the POET and the WOMAN appear in the open space before CREON . They are so self-absorbed that they seem unconscious of the world about them . The POET The POET My heart is nervous like a place of peril ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN My heart is quiet like a place of peace . I see the light ; I know he is the Lord . The POET The POET Faintly I feel the promise of the Dawn Pale on the prison windows of the soul ; And I believe , secluded in his strength , Dazed in his light , it well may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whose faith shall perfectly shine out to help My unbelief ? ..... Whose witness is at hand To certify the Truth and prove the Lord ? ..... He looks about him and realizes where he is . This is the Agora ..... The King  --  the world  --  The envoys of Eurystheus  --  all are here ! And we are here , who keep his vigil !  --  and Hither , at last , the man shall grandly come ! ..... CREON CREON Stranger , be welcome ! By your chance strange words I dare surmise you come from Herakles ? The POET turns and faces CREON . The POET The POET After a moment 's silence O King !  --  you , who are old ; whose eyes have seen , Borne on the shoulders of subjected men , The little pageant of the world go by , Pontifical and proud , with Gods and gold And bright caparisons of victory  --  And nothing come of it !  --  whose ears have heard , Beyond the high , hard music of the march , Beyond the chorus and the canticles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , Crushed and subdued against the iron breast Of life 's obscure , supreme necessities ,  --  The wailing and the bitter , broken cry Of souls disconsolate and lives foredoomed To ruin and intolerable wrong From Gods and men  --  and nothing come of it !  --  You , who may haply , in your whole long life , Once and at last have dreadfully discerned The infinite , inscrutable darkness Bounding the narrow precincts of the mind , And the old , awful taciturnities , Against whose smooth , impenetrable walls The shouting and the singing voice of life Shatter and die and are not heard beyond  --  And nothing come of it !  --  O you , whose mind Is wise with the long audience and vigil Your life has been  --  and nothing come of it !  --  What is your faith , and what shall be my hope Of Herakles ? Is it the very light Of truth , the very strength of the soul 's cause , This woman has discerned radiant in him ? Is he the very guide our souls have sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Give me your faith , for I am sick with doubt ..... Are not the dire , dark Gods , the bitter Gods , Ranged , leagued and armoured with the common world Of crowds and Kings to work the man 's undoing ? Well I discern where the blind , brutal hand Of fortune stretches at him from the shadow ..... And soon the stroke shall fall ! ..... Is it too soon ? Speak !  --  can he bear the blow ? and is he yet Full-grown in strength , and , like a God , become Invulnerable ?  --  or must he yield at last ? Or die far on the frontiers , overwhelmed ? ..... Speak ! Speak ! My spirit is irresolute , Swift and unstable as a wind-swept flame ! Give me your faith ; the crucial hour is near ; He comes ! He comes !  --  and wilful of his cause , Here shall the soul take issue with the world ! CREON CREON After a slight pause ; in his most temperate tones Stranger , be welcome none the less because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose age and whose estate Give him some reason for the world 's regard . Patience may suffer ; but my sole concern Is with the perfect humour of the thing ; And since you variously enhance the joke , Be gladly welcome ! I discern in you That taint of a poetic eloquence , Which is perhaps the fashion of your youth , And therefore to be leniently endured , Yet gives a special tinge of irony To the reflective mind which hears you speak . Believe me , you might well be rid of it , And of your flourish and intemperance Of fancy , which the sane sense wearies of . Whatever hazard of man 's life is toward , The facts are still sufficient to the end In sight ,  --  and ends invisible are just Mere myth ! That you impute to me a faith , And , for yourself , indulge some fervent hope In what vague ventures of the frenzied mind No soothsayer of dreams can clearly tell , Charms me  --  as youth will charm us !  --  but we find A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some serious cause to fear That the unhappy mind of Herakles Is raptured and estranged  --  resolved to take Some final issues with the Gods and men . But we have seen , what you at last may learn , How such pretensions of the spirit fail ,  --  Whose victory , I take it , is your hope . Life , like a candle in a starless night , Brightens and burns , or flutters and is spent , As man 's wise weakness spares the guarded flame , Or man 's rash strength resolves in all despite To lift his torch into the spacious winds , To blaze his path across the darknesses , And force the elements to his own undoing ..... Only the strong go forward  --  and are slain ! Only the strong , defenceless , dare  --  and die ! Only the strong , free , fain and fearless ,  --  fail ! Remember this ! lest a worse thing than mere Passion and ecstasy of poems befall you . The POET The POET Old man , old vain mild phantom of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Your cowardly smooth wit , no attitude Of yours I have not learned and wearied of ! Poor ancient , philosophic humourist ! I know you as you pitiably are : Wise as the world is wise ,  --  and ignorant As only the dull , blatant world can be ! Tell me your lies no more , your clever lies ! Is there a man so dull he has not felt The countless soldiery of circumstance Charge down out of the dark against us all ? Is there a man so blind he has not seen How fearfully the timid citizens Of the wise world that you are master of Armour their nakedness against the foe ? Is there a man so false he has not learned How all in vain men dress against the shafts Of truth their shadow-shields , and all in vain Shape for their lives ' defence the seeming gold Of faith , the shallow silver of a sane Philosophy ,  --  to fit the cultured mind !  --  The dull , stern bronze of patient hardihood , Or any base alloy or mean deceit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forge Of the remembered usage of the world , Fed with felled branches from the tree of time ? Is there a man so false and blind and dull He does not know how all confinements yield , All fashions of defence are overborne , When the real truth 's Redeemer is at hand ,  --  When , midst the very ruins of the House Of Fear , the mighty soul finds place and room ? ..... In the great game where each man 's stake is set , They only lose who dare not ever play For the one prize that is not counterfeit  --  And they must always lose !

He confronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tumult subsides . Meanwhile the MESSENGERS OF EURYSTHEUS draw near the throne of CREON . AMPHITRYON AMPHITRYON Welcome , my son ! CREON CREON Thrice welcome , Herakles ! Messengers are come hither from the King Of Argos , and will speak alone to you . HERAKLES HERAKLES It will not help that I should hear them now . I have renounced all profits and concerns And servitudes of proud and politic men ; For , in the strong fulfilment of my vision , I am resolved hereafter to be free ! Therefore the envoys of Eurystheus Now may depart in silence : I no more Regard them , and I will not hear them now . I must be diligent about my business , Which brooks no more delay !  --  And know you well , If you behold me now it is because I have one thing in all the world , one thing To all the world , and only one , to say : Farewell ! Rumour among the people and soldiers . The King and those about him listen with anxious concern . My heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where it once went proudly home And daily dwelt ,  --  knowing no better place , No more majestic mansion of desire , No costlier love ,  --  to bid you all farewell ! Farewell ! I linger but to take my leave Of all I loved ; my soul is on its way ; I am impatient to begone ;  --  farewell ! Farewell ! My road is hence and hard and far ; And where it leads me I may haply learn ; And whither , if at all , it takes me home ! ..... Now I but know I will be free to follow In the steep way , my soul 's way , to the light  --  The light which dawns within me ! O my friends  --  Kin , soldiers , citizens  --  be well assured That even in this mystic and majestic hour The Lord is in my house  --  and wakes ! ..... At dawn , Solving the heart 's incertitudes , one came To witness to the Lord and specify His advent  --  and he wakes  --  and all is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sought  --  and I have wonderfully found ; I knocked  --  and now the spacious and sudden doors Splendidly open to my furtherance ! ..... I must begone ! Farewell , at last , farewell ! My heart is fain ; my will is on the way ; And , from the soul 's eternal secret source , Issues a strength I hardly dare to feel Within me and upon me !  --  such a strength As drives the ploughshare of its great resolve Across the little limits of this world , And may endure no let of God or man Cast in the fair-way of its rash ambition ! ..... CREON CREON Now sounds the dread , mad voice whose sense is peril . The POET The POET Now sounds the trumpet-call of hope , the cry Of the enfranchised , strong , expectant soul ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Comrades and friends  --  companions of my youth  --  Lovers of mine , whose love was health and home , Honour and happiness to me ,  --  farewell ! Now may your eyes discern the mystic change ! Him you behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the temple walls , And captained you across the battlefields , In the dark way of death , to victory ! I am no more , no more ,  --  O valiant sons Of Cadmus ! O my soldiers !  --  as I was That day we wrapped in winding-sheets of flame Palace and parapet and pinnacle And all the bastioned power of proud Orchomenos ! I go away into the light from you ; I leave you ; I return no more ..... And yet You shall remember how it was with us That day the hero and the host returned Full-flushed , in triumph , with the Minyan spoil !  --  When the pale women caught our dreadful hands , Where the red blood dried black , and wreathed our swords  --  Our sinister , soiled swords of victory  --  With bridal flowers , and kissed our fierce , parched mouths , And , weeping , laughed into our shining eyes With eager lips , song-spent and tremulous ! You shall remember !  --  and I leave with you That Herakles who bids you now farewell ! An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cries of devotion and dismay , rush forward and surround HERAKLES . They even seize his garments with restraining hands . O manhood  --  memories  --  mood of many days Of well-companioned tasks and victories And exultations and familiar joys , Evoked , impassioned in your hearts and mine !  --  How shall I bear to say farewell to you ? Brothers-in-arms  --  O comrades  --  faithful friends  --  It is not as my heart wills  --  not my heart Is turned from you-ward !  --  for God knows my heart Is yearning and irresolute and aggrieved , And will not leave you , and laments and loves And dares not lose what life has held so dear ! Only I know there is no way for me But my way , and no way but yours for you ; And all ways of the world are false and blind And barred and bounded to a mean ambition , Which knows no more magnificent prize than mere Exclusive profits and prosperities ; And all ways of the soul are ways of truth , Which whoso treads them out shall learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope or having tolerable That all men may not share on equal terms ! But since , when once revealed , the truth forever Is irremediable ; and since I know You will not come with me out of the world ; And since I may not go away with you , Back from my prospect and my path ;  --  farewell ! What tho ' the strong heart breaks to feel your love ? Yet will the soul , the waking soul , be free ! ..... Turning swiftly to MEGARA O let us hasten hence ! Turning again to the soldiers and people , and speaking as though to all the world Farewell ! Farewell !  --  Now and forevermore ! Meanwhile the MESSENGERS OF EURYSTHEUS have approached . Now one of them advances alone toward HERAKLES . The MESSENGER The MESSENGER O Herakles , Wise is your purpose now to bid farewell To all the world ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Long since I took my leave Of Kings and of the Messengers of Kings . The MESSENGER The MESSENGER Wise is your purpose  --  for the proud fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Are changed and ended to return no more . Farewell  --  O bid farewell indeed to all These high commandments , riches , fame and friends , Honour and eager glories of the world ! Farewell  --  O bid farewell to happiness ; To home and wife and child a last farewell ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Rashly you speak of what you know not of . No man alive is justified to say What things are fit for the self-centred soul . I bid farewell to all that is not truth And all enslavements of the soul ,  --  but love Of two hearts blent together to one end Of ecstasy and truth 's eternities , Is a great thoroughfare of liberty Wherein the soul may walk its way well-pleased ! I bid farewell to none who go their ways , Strong and resolved , wherever the light is . To you , but not to them whose way is love , Whose love is truth , I bid a last farewell . The MESSENGER The MESSENGER Vain are your words , and all your thoughts are vain , And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to friendship and to hope farewell ,  --  Farewell , a long farewell to liberty ! No more of all these things your life shall be Made glad and great and good !  --  no more ! no more ! But rather inconsolable solitude , Hardship and hunger , shame and ill-report , Vile words and bitter usage of the world , Labour and servitude and sacrifice , Vigil and vagrancy shall be your lot , Your strength 's achievement and your life 's reward ! The POET The POET to the WOMAN , grasping her arm Watch ! for the death-grip comes ,  --  more terrible Than fear can image or despair conceive ! ..... Watch ! for the dark , fierce , dread , revengeful Gods , Out of the shadow of the Mystery , Launch the lean lightnings of their utmost wrath ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Farewell to love ? ..... Farewell to liberty ? ..... And what of truth ? ..... And what of life itself ? ..... Enough ! Enough ! These idle , senseless words Merely perplex my purpose . Go your ways !

The MESSENGER The MESSENGER By strict enforcement of Eurystheus ' will And stern commandment of the deathless Gods , Yours are the labours of a subject man , Yours are the tasks and toil of servitude ! For where Eurystheus bids your strength to serve , There shall your works be done ; and all shall reap Plentiful harvests of your sowing , all Shall profit where your single strength has earned ! And , from the world 's avid and thrifty hand , No wage shall you receive , even at last ,  --  And no thanksgiving ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES Silence !  --  The MESSENGER The MESSENGER Herakles !

Begone !  --  To himself What voice of prophecy Cries in my heart ? ..... I dare not know the truth , Nor hear the secret answered in my soul ! It were too monstrous if the worst were true  --  Too monstrous ! I will doubt no more  --  and yet Where is the light  --  my light ? ..... Where is the voice , The one puissant voice of the soul 's song ? ..... Why am I left in darkness and alone , Deserted and betrayed ? ..... Why do I feel Shudder within me like a dreadful ghost The superstition of a fatal thing ? ..... The POET The POET I know the truth , I read the secret now ! .....

Surely it must be so ! I know but this , I can not see the light  --  and suddenly All the serene and mighty symphonies Of heart and brain and being are silent ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN Lord ! ..... Lord ! ..... I believe ! HERAKLES HERAKLES ..... The light returns  --  the voice ! ..... I dare not understand ! ..... I dare not yield ! ..... The MESSENGER The MESSENGER striking HERAKLES with his staff Down in the dust , and do your master 's will ! The people and soldiers cry out with a mighty voice . With the swiftness of passion , HERAKLES wrests the staff from the hand of the MESSENGER and strikes him to the ground , where he lies insensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intolerable !  --  Beware , O Gods , O Kings , O men who try me thus ! You play like children with a deadly thing ! That heart may learn to hate you which should love ; That strength may ruin which might best redeem ! Turning upon the MESSENGERS who still confront him Back to your kennel and your currish king ! I spare your lives which are not worth my pains ! Say to Eurystheus I may well return From exile !  --  and should Herakles return , Not one in Argos would survive to tell The monstrous story of its devastation ! ..... I would tear Tiryns from its base and cast Its burned-out ruins on the Argive plain ; And in its place I would rear up a tower Of the charred corpses of its citizens , Welded in blood ; and on its pinnacle The pale head of Eurystheus should display How he went down to death beneath my hand , Frenzied with fear , forsaken , false , accursed !  --  Go ! while there still is mercy in me , go ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people . The POET springs forward and confronts HERAKLES face to face . The POET The POET shouting at HERAKLES Coward and traitor !

O faithful heart !  --  Woman !  --  We are betrayed ! Alas ! Alas ! He is as one of us , Who all are slaves and dare not undergo The mighty labours of our liberation ! He too is abject , feeble , and afraid ; He too with mean economy prefers The helot 's hovel to the master 's house ; He too will not afford the price of truth Nor earn the soul 's full freedom by his pains ! HERAKLES HERAKLES fiercely , but dismayed Whose voice assails me ? The POET The POET Mine !  --  which might have sung Pans and poems of you in exultation ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Now by the Gods you well may die for this ! ..... The POET The POET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he Who slays himself in spirit and in truth , Has done more murder than a sword can do ! I fear you not !  --  but fear me well you may , Since I am one whose lips have learned to phrase The truth 's tremendous syllables of song ! Coward and traitor !  --  you have quenched the light Of truth and shut the door of liberty ! HERAKLES stands , sobered and dizzy as from a blow . The soldiers begin to drag the POET away ; he turns once more to the WOMAN . Daughter of desolation , mourn your loss ! Weep , for the Child is slain ! He slays the Child , The Child of Light , about whose mystic birth You were the mid-wife and the ministrant ! ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN to HERAKLES , with agony Lord , I believe ! HERAKLES HERAKLES What faith can make me whole ? .....

End of the Seventh Scene . EIGHTH SCENE Later of the same day . An open space before a Temple situated on an acropolis in Thebes . The gay tumult of a public holiday rises from the city , which lies out in panorama not far below . The POET and the WOMAN , alone . The POET The POET We two in all the world have tears for him ! ..... Hark ! how they make a public festival And cry thanksgiving that the God is slain ..... He pauses . The WOMAN is silent . The rumour from the city sounds louder than before . Yes , they rejoice !  --  an excellence is lost , And so their triumph is securely won ! Hark ! how they mock with mirth the soul 's defeat , These dreadful , dread majorities of men Who shout into the air and beat their hands At pageants , tragedies , and crucifixions ;  --  Who , when a soul surrenders , sound across Truth 's broken harmonies their rank applause ! The cries of the multitude sound nearer . Hark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unashamed ! Their drums sound hither where the mourners sit , Sanctified , silent in their mystic grief , About the gravestone of the earth-born God ! And whensoever , from the huddled homes , The congregations and the courts of men , One , rising up from where he sat so long In darkness with the wise men of the world , Finds God incarnate in his inmost soul , And feels across the vision of his eyes The unimagined , strong , seraphic light , And speaks his mystic message thrilled with song ,  --  Then will you hear sound out against the man The world 's ironic , base , and vacant voice ,  --  The tuneless tumult of democracies ! So , when the soul is crushed , defeated , slain ,  --  O then as now , toward the crystalline Unmindful heaven 's serene immensity , From all the nameless numbers of the world Thunder their triumph and their acclamations ! ..... A great , gay multitude of men and women , with CREON and AMPHITRYON at their head , appear on their way from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ..... Behold ! They come to thank the Gods that God is slain ! CREON , on his way , perceives the POET and pauses . CREON CREON Here ' s our poetic , pale enthusiast , Changed from his madness , sobered , let us hope , And somewhat wiser . Ah , how vain were all Our hopes and fears ! He merely boasted ! What ?  --  Believed his boast , you say ?  --  I grant you ! Well , And what of that ? True faith ' s the only harm ! For much as Herakles was crazed by dreams , So in their lives are many men deceived ,  --  And by their disenchantment much matured ! Thus we discern when excellence is lost How much is saved ,  --  our hero first of all ! And last , but not , good sir , believe me , least , We now may pleasantly observe how well Our sense of humour and our quiet smile Of irony still vindicate their use , And prove life 's ablest critics after all ! The POET listens with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMPHITRYON . The multitude follow . The POET and the WOMAN are left once more alone . The WOMAN The WOMAN I will not now believe that all is lost ! ..... The POET The POET Nothing is lost !  --  for he was not the Light ; He was but one whose strength had momently Uplifted in his hand the kindled torch Whereof the spark lives quenchless in the soul . Fail not in faith because the torch-bearer Is fallen !  --  the sacred flame still lives in splendour , Tho ' the lax hand let fall the lamp that made To our gross sense the glory visible ! ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN I know no light but his , no faith but him . He held the torch up in my darknesses ; He gave me light where the long path went on ; And where his strength made room , there was my way ! ..... Strong and serene as sunrise , I beheld His advent ; and , the little while he tarried , The common clay I am of life 's admixture Seemed all suffused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become if he is gone ? ..... And what is truth ? ..... and why are all the free Fine faculties of the impassioned mind ? ..... And wherefore has the heart such wings of faith , Such springs of love , such hardihood of hope , If he is gone ?  --  I will not so believe ! He is still forward , still sublime , still strong ! ..... The POET The POET Alas ! Alas ! I dare not hope  --  I saw The Spirit labouring in him , as life labours In one who dies too young ..... The light was spent ; The voice was still ! Alas ! I know too well The secret signs :  --  how often , in my house Daily rekindled , daily have I seen The light dying , dying ,  --  the sacred flame Burn small into the common day of life ! How often I  --  I also , silently And suddenly have seen those walls , that make The mansion of the Spirit 's isolation , Wear thin as light , and , like a prodigy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till all This mortal man was like a lantern held Aloft , alight in the vast night of being ; And wayfarers might find their way withal ! I too have lit my candle at the sun , And made my poems of it till the light failed ! ..... Made only poems !  --  yet more than he shall make , Who is grown dark as any proud glad man ; Whose light is quenched in passion and fierce deeds ; Whose soul is spent in purchase of this world ; Whose strength is small ; whose truth is partisan ! Alas ! Alas ! there is no room for hope ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN I will not so believe ! They are not dark , His eyes , where once my sightless eyes discerned Spacious and grave nativities of light ! He is not , in the dust with other men , So all inexpiably and weakly fallen From where he stood , aureoled , invincible ! ..... The POET The POET You love him ! The WOMAN The WOMAN I ? ..... I dared not ! Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor grace of soul Nor grandeur in my heart to love him with ! Could I have loved him all might now be well ! ..... The POET The POET Can you imagine of the human heart Such prodigies ?  --  that love could so avail The soul once purposed to the ends of truth , Which fears and palters with the price ? ..... Enough ! Let us go hence before the worshippers Return to vex our grief and solitude . Let us go hence . The WOMAN The WOMAN ..... and seek for Herakles ! The POET and the WOMAN depart . A moment later HERAKLES appears , coming up from the city . He pauses by the Temple steps , gazing abroad over the immense prospect . HERAKLES HERAKLES I dimly see how far perfection is , And what the utmost price of truth must be , And how the strong soul is companionless ..... And I am heart-sick in my hour of weakness ! I have been much and soon and fiercely tried , And now the process of the pregnant past Yields to my sense its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose house Of life seemed so securely locked and barred That at the feast and in the pleasant mansions How should he fear to find the fatal guest  --  The Truth , whose voice sings out the wonder-song Of life and death adventured to one end ; Whose eyes are clear , whose brows are pale with stars , Whose nakedness is bright and terrible ? ..... Yet , in the rashness of my discontent , My hands , impatient of the tasks and toys , Breached the blind walls of life 's secure defence And gave glad welcome to the ambushed foe ! Now am I pressed and overborne , as one Beleaguered in a ruined citadel ; I am invaded , violated !  --  all The doors stand open of my dwelling-place ; My heart is sacked and spoiled without reprieve , For all may pillage in its treasuries ; The feast no more is spread but Truth is there To consecrate the wine of human love And transubstantiate life 's daily bread ; And in the mansions I can sleep no more Because of one crying " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbandman who tilled With patient labour life 's familiar fields , And gathered in the harvest to his small And well-approved and insufficient needs ;  --  But when the narrow bounty of my tillage No more sufficed to give me nourishment , Eager of more superb prosperities , I drove my ploughshare with a reckless hand , Furrowed the fallow acres of the soul , And in new soil of strange fertilities Cast down the good seed of a great ambition ! Now in my soul the ripened harvest stands , Waiting the sickle ,  --  and my hands must reap And earn perfection 's lordlier livelihood !  --  Leaving unsown , unscythed , unharvested , The humble fruit of human happiness Which was the substance of my daily bread , And all my life long made the staff of life . I was a happy lover , innocent And candid in the paradise of love ; And love was human and was happiness  --  Until I dreamed of the celestial Bride ! ..... Then were my heart 's inviolate secrecies Disclosed  --  and I beheld her fabled face ! ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew her love 's ineffable ecstasies ! ..... And all the lesser loveliness of earth Was in my sight no more desirable . Then , like a bridegroom , heedless on his quest If the dark way be strange and unexplored Or if the bridal chamber have no light , I hastened to my Paramour  --  I kept Love 's secret assignation with my soul ! Now of that whispered , dark embrace is born , In the deep womb of thought , a prodigy Whose strength shall dispossess me of this world ! ..... CHORUS OF RESPONDENTS CHORUS OF RESPONDENTS from within the Temple We fear Thee and we know Thee not ! ..... We know but this , when all is said : That life is false and forfeited , And love foregone and truth forgot To serve Thee whom we dare not trust ; While , vexed with very sore distress , We go nowhither in the trampled dust Of life , companioned yet companionless ..... Yet still we serve Thee  --  as we must !  --  Serve Thee and suffer and atone And daily fear Thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are only Thine  --  not ours but Thine alone ! For we are meek in spirit , And live like creatures of the transient hour Who dare not strive and suffer to inherit The birthright of the soul ,  --  who dare not be Perfect as Thou art and , as Thou art , free ! No hopes may tempt us ; and for us in vain , Globed like a golden lamp suffused in rain , The candid , living fruit upon the tree Of knowledge , and the prime , pressed grapes of love Which brim with sacred wine life 's earthen bowl , Ripen in sun-steeped orchards of the soul ! ..... We are incurious , pious and afraid And have no care thereof , So the small price of all we lose is paid . Therefore , as Thou art just , Give and forgive !  --  Forgive our trespasses , and as we humbly live , Give us our daily bread ! By Thy small mercies we confirm our trust : And since so much is forfeit that perchance Man might reclaim as his inheritance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask instead ! But , in abundant measure , Give us the trifle of our hire ,  --  The pride , the fame , the kingships and the gold , The paltry profit and the hasty pleasure , For which , to further and fulfil The dark stern process of Thy secret will , The soul , the truth , the strength of man are sold ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Pathos  --  humility  --  surrender  --  fear !  --  Starved , sterile , satisfied , supremely sad Human vociferation and appeal !  --  O frightened children , crying in the dark !  --  Be well assured this hour of lamentation , Of weakness and despair shall pass away ! Unconquerable is the strength within me  --  soon , Soon to revive !  --  and spares not , neither counts The cost ! ..... O I begin to be afraid Of what I am !  --  for if I live at all , I must reclaim the Birthright and redeem The Spirit and the Truth from servitude ! Servitude ?  --  then , the labours ?  --  and Eurystheus ?  --  No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne ! And in the very thought of that abasement Lies only madness and a black despair ! ..... The voice of the POET POET from below How shall we learn to bear what must be borne ? How shall the heart not break when love is lost ? How shall life earn enough to pay the cost Of all the tears , the solitude , the scorn ? How shall we not be utterly forlorn When they deny us whom we cherished most ? When all life was becomes a dreadful ghost , How , from such pangs of death , is life reborn ?  --  How shall we live at all ? ..... Thou canst not say , O Heart , whose voice is lamentation ! Where , Where are the nobler virtues that repay , When all is gone that gave us most delight ? When shall the soul , from what supernal height , Witness the truth and save us from despair ?

For all his life is lost to save his life ; And all he loved is sacrificed and slain To make love pure and perfect in his heart !  --  Until at last , released from servitude By long , incredible labours and the strength That sleeps not , neither spares , the soul is left Naked with knowledge , where the lapse of time Leaves its eternity unhazarded , Solitary in a waste and desert place ,  --  Where once the friendly cities rose in towers , And , rich with harvests , hills and pleasant gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tidings of the soul ! ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES O breaking heart !  --  Is there no hope at all Of any tolerable issue ? ..... TEIRESIAS TEIRESIAS Peace ! Hear me , for I declare the words of God !  --  I stood upon the mountain , and the voice Of God spoke in my soul , saying : " It dawns ! ..... My light dawns in the soul of Herakles ! ..... Faint and afar his eyes have seen the Light ; His heart receives the gracious and divine Nativity , and radiant is his mind With rapture , and he hails the light with joy ! He feels a splendour in his strength ; he sees Burn with clear flame the torch of his resolve ; The door of his deliverance stands wide Asunder in the vista of his vision ; His hope is on the way ; his faith is full ; His winged ambition soars into the sun ! ..... " HERAKLES HERAKLES So , in the Dawn of Light , it was with me ! ..... TEIRESIAS TEIRESIAS The voice of God spoke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he sees the truth : He must be true before his task is done ! Dawn crimsons on the mountain crest of thought , While still inert , disfranchised , unredeemed , The substance and the self of human being Lie far below in that sepulchral night , Wherein , like spectres moving in a trance , Like candles briefly kindled and consumed , The countless unambitious multitudes Of mortal men exist at all adventure , Timid and credulous of what they seem , Fostered or blasted by the winds of chance . Therefore , tho ' Herakles has seen the Light , The long captivities of ignorance And pain and force and fear constrain his soul : He has not even reckoned with the price , Nor counted with the cost of liberty ; He has not learned how much the flame consumes Which purifies ,  --  how much the light dissolves Which shows the truth ,  --  how much perfection is , To all imperfect , happy , human things , Ruin and desolation ! ..... " HERAKLES HERAKLES Desolation ..... Ruin ..... And then , redemption ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cries out in my spirit , saying , " More light ! More light ! More truth for Herakles !  --  Light to dissolve , perfection to destroy , Truth to lay waste and ruin and make smooth , Make straight and smooth the pathway of the soul ! ..... Haste !  --  lest the saviour and the soul be lost , Man 's birthright forfeit , and the soul 's supreme Ambition bartered for a little thing ! Haste !  --  and exhort the man enslaved to wear No more the chains of his captivity ! There is no virtue he shall not forego Who fears and palters with the price of truth ; There is no excellence or liberation He shall not earn who dares to undergo The mighty labours and the sacrifice Which win the soul 's way out of servitude ! " HERAKLES HERAKLES Where is the God who bade your steps come hither , Your voice speak out the doom of Herakles ? Where is the God ?  --  unless within the soul Of man divinity resides unborn ..... Why do you seek to cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? It is your voice I hear and yours alone !  --  Blind , wretched Soothsayer  --  where is the God ? TEIRESIAS TEIRESIAS Bear with him , Loxias , for his agony Is more than mortal grief ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Where is the God ? Where is the God ?  --  if God there be at all ! CREON CREON Haply at Delphi , in his sacred house . TEIRESIAS TEIRESIAS God dwells wherever He is well received And welcome in the life and soul of man . HERAKLES HERAKLES Delphi ? ..... At Delphi I will seek the God ! And if He is , and man may find him out , There will I meet him face to face at last ! ..... End of the Eighth Scene . NINTH SCENE Before the Temple of Apollo at Delphi . HERAKLES stands alone near the steps of the Temple . HERAKLES HERAKLES I left them in the quiet house  --  my sons , My woman and my whole heart 's happiness ! ..... And all my life , and all my self that was The world 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , I left behind ! Now , standing here by this prophetic shrine , I am alone and exiled and bereaved , I am forsaken , heart-sick , comfortless ,  --  I am resolved to read the riddle out And search the secret till I understand ! ..... Lost am I  --  lost ! I know not where I am ; I know not where I go ;  --  but whence I come I know too well !  --  O this is all my guidance : The passion to be other than I am And realize self in the strict terms of truth ! The light is not  --  and yet the twilight is About me , glimmering like a moonlit mist ..... And like a ghost I walk unreconciled , Dubious and undetermined and forlorn , Fearing the day , yet longing for the light ! O promised Dawn !  --  when you are come at last , What shall your light disclose ?  --  some spectacle Of tragic desolation ,  --  lonely days And loveless nights and long , laborious , Monstrous , intolerable servitudes ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed , With all I love in the high place of Peace , Dilate as with the Universal being , Filled and fulfilled with your serenities ? ..... The great doors of the Temple slowly open . In the dark twilight of His house the shrine of the God and the veil behind it are dimly visible . The PROPHETES appears upon the threshold . HERAKLES turns his face toward him . The PROPHETES The PROPHETES What voice of wretchedness and wild unrest Cries out before the House of God ? HERAKLES HERAKLES My voice Knew not the tones and tears of grief till now ! After a life of strength and high resolve This is my hour of doubt and blind appeal , This is my hour of agony ! ..... The PROPHETES The PROPHETES The God Knows neither lamentation nor unrest : His calm perfection hears no human voice . HERAKLES HERAKLES There is one voice He shall not choose but hear ! The voice of the PYTHIA PYTHIA as before sounding in ecstasy from behind the veil within the Temple . As she speaks a CHORUS of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Temple steps . Before the House of God They grieve and they rejoice Whose utmost light is of the common day , Whose aimless feet along the trampled sod Tread the strait precinct of the public way , Whose lives are like a pageant passing by ..... Within the House of God No ear receives their incoherent voice ; No eye Is witness to the deeds their days have done ! Like mummers at a carnival They flaunt their scant disguise , and one by one Go out into the dark in silence , after all ..... The CHORUS The CHORUS Only a windy light no eye perceives ; Only a thrill of joy , a pang of grief ; Only a voice crying where silence is , Where none respond and the brave song is brief ; Only the plaything of blind destinies , Which ends in nothing as it once began ;  --  So is the life of man ! The PROPHETES The PROPHETES There is no shadow of imperfect things Cast on the glory of God 's excellence : Filled with eternal light , His rapt regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is one face He shall not fail to see ! The CHORUS The CHORUS We live upon the threshold of His house , And there like children sport with idle things ; We are a voice that weeps , a voice that sings , A hand that traces in the senseless dust The little hazard of our happenings . Ours is a time for turmoil and carouse ; Ours is a time for sickness , sleep , and tears , Labour and laughter , love and lust ; Ours is a time to come , a time to go ! ..... Yet fearfully we feel , dimly we know That all the while we live , thro ' all our years , Which run out , futile and disused , before The threshold of His holy House , the door , Dark with the gloom of unfamiliar fears , Behind us , ever and alway , Waits to receive us ! ..... Yet we dread To turn our feet from the strait way they tread ! Yea ! tho ' our hearts , unsatisfied , are rife With doubts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seek or knock Or lay strong hands on the unguarded lock . Rather from day to day We cheat the mind with work and dreams and strife , We cheat the love-sick heart With passion and blind love that perisheth ,  --  Until from all our toys we are taken away , And in unspeakable loneliness depart ! ..... Then , thro ' the door of destiny and death , Which is the door of truth 's eternal life , We men , whose times were squandered on the sill Of the soul 's dwelling-place ,  --  Who found not virtue , strength , or will To slant the door and meet Him face to face ,  --  Unborn , unwaked , unwise , and comfortless , Pass from life 's nothing into nothingness ! ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES Children of men , there is one voice of power He shall not choose but hear ; one fearless face He shall not fail to see !  --  My voice shall call To rouse the Lord ; my hand shall slant the door ; Mine eyes shall meet Him face to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure the grandeur of His gaze ; None can receive the splendour of His speech ! HERAKLES HERAKLES There is one eye His glance shall not confound ! There is one soul His speech shall not appeal ! The CHORUS The CHORUS Behind us and before us The shadow is , Whose incommensurable silences Never make answer to life 's thundered chorus ..... And in our hands we bear the little light Of life across the huge and haunted night A windy mile or so ; And whence we come and whither we shall go We know not and we fear to know ! ..... The voice of the PYTHIA PYTHIA as before Yet may the inward eye perceive , Hardly , and thro ' the darkness faint and far , Truth 's single , stedfast star ; And learn , by vigil , to receive The light ; and , careless of the goal , In the divine impatience of the soul , Forfeit all hopes and fears to follow on ! ..... Yet may the heart 's unuttered love believe That somewhere the majestic sun Of knowledge shines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinities ! ..... Yet may the restless mind at last devise Some scale and measure for the worth of things , And rise , and valorously depart , Led by the vision of the inward eyes , Flushed with the rapt assurance of the heart , Wearied and scornful of their parleyings , Their dreams and games and profits , who before The threshold of the shadowed door , Build of base earth their human paradise !  --  Yet may a man , at length , Feel in the secret sources of his strength The power to ask , to seek , to knock , To force , if need be , the unguarded lock , And , in the solitude where none else are , To set the great , dark door ajar , And live , and enter , and with words of power rouse The Master of the House ! The CHORUS The CHORUS It may be , as the Spirit saith , That whoso slants the shadowed door , Thereafter , deathless at the core , Pursues his way thro ' life and death As one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to some ineffable abode ! ..... It may be , as our dreams aver , Beyond the door which none have passed , The asker and the answerer , The seeker and the truth , at last , Are single and supremely one ! ..... It may be , when the gate is won , That whose stands within the door Exults with love 's transcendent youth In calm eternities of truth Where , as with God 's immortal breath , The soul forever and forever quickeneth ! ..... But we , whose lives are spent before The threshold of the House of God , We only know it is not thus Ever for one of us ! Rather we know not what is worst or best , And we are wearied , and we find no rest ,  --  And there is haply rest beneath the sod ! ..... Therefore , as life has taught us , so we deem Time is the little way from birth to death Which flowers and stars and countless men have trod And found no reason of their wretchedness , No pondered justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour to redeem ! So , in the passion of our heart 's distress , Our minds inert , incurious , and afraid , Receive the witness of the woful past And worship at the shrines our fathers made . And well we know , when all is said , Tho ' faith and hope caress their dream , That life and death and sorrow and loneliness Do something more to us than merely seem ! HERAKLES HERAKLES O Children !  --  O my frightened Children !  --  Peace ! Children of men , it is not as you deem !  --  Hear me !  --  I say life palters with the price Of Truth 's for-everlasting gift and grace !  --  I , in my hour of weakness , I have dealt In mean economies , and sapped my strength , And vexed the soul 's resolve with lamentation ! I too have feared and suffered !  --  and even now I am afraid  --  I suffer  --  I am not strong ! I see before me with a black despair The prospect of my desolation !  --  Yea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come true !  --  The prospect of a life 's intolerable , Infamous servitude ! ..... And in my mind There is a kind of madness without name Even to think of it ,  --  and a red mist Of blood drowning the vision of mine eyes ! ..... He pauses ; then speaks again . As he speaks , he mounts the steps and crosses the threshold of the Temple . Children of men , I bring you somewhat more Than hope ! Mine eyes have sundered darknesses ..... I have beheld the star of truth and seen The sun of knowledge dawn over the soul ..... I have devised ascending gyres of thought , And climbed into the prospect of perfection ..... I have turned inward from the spectacle And florid insignificance of what The rank world reckons as the life of man , And set my strength against the shadowed door , And come at last living into his house , And called the Master with a mighty voice ! Him will I meet with face to face , and feel His power , and hear His secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall return , And bring you news and tidings of the Lord ! ..... The PROPHETES The PROPHETES Forbear ! No man may trespass in the House Of God , lest desolation worse than death Leave him bereaved and naked to the soul ! Forbear !  --  Inflexible as knowledge is , Calm as perfection , merciless as truth , So is the God  --  and no man may endure His real presence and thereafter live ! The voice of the PYTHIA PYTHIA as before His Spirit is Like a vase of diamond Brimmed with eternal springs of living light ..... His heart of clear religious ecstasies , Tranquil , transfigured , true humanities , In love 's grave gardens of divine delight , Feels the immortal heart of life respond ..... His thought is spacious and serene And like a consecrated place Where knowledge is the soul of grace , And truth alone is heard and seen ..... And who , with undiverted will , As He is perfect dares to be , And , in despite of grief and fear , Has crossed alone the sacred sill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face He shall not fail to see : To him the very God is near !  --  And , as his soul shall understand , To him the Spirit and the Truth are close at hand ! ..... HERAKLES makes a motion to advance into the Temple . The PROPHETES The PROPHETES Forbear ! HERAKLES HERAKLES Stern guardian of the Sacred Door , I know the shining garments of the soul , Which all must wear who enter in His house , It well may be are robes of hueless flame In which my human being and heart and even This rugged vesture of mortality , Which tempers truth and makes perfection mild , Must perish away and all be quite consumed ..... Yet is there that within me which compels , And will not rest , and is resolved to go ! While all wait in silence , HERAKLES enters the Temple , approaches the altar , rends the veil , and discloses the PYTHIA seated upon the tripod . He disappears into the darkness of the inner Temple . A moment later he reappears , overthrows the tripod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging with him the PYTHIA . He thrusts the PYTHIA forth upon the steps , and himself remains standing within the Temple door . The shrine is empty ! Speak , false prophetess ! Where is the God ? The PYTHIA The PYTHIA Where else but in His house ! HERAKLES HERAKLES I am alone within the House of God ! ..... The PYTHIA The PYTHIA in utmost ecstasy Melt in His arms ! Resist not ! Care not ! Strive No more , for He is quiet and merciless ; And by His means shall naught grow less , But all that is shall greater grow ! ..... For , save with His transcendent life , Within His mansions none may live ; And , as He prospers , even so All thoughts and things , transfigured , thrive ! His truth is like a shining knife Which slays , in sense and heart and brain , Till what was perishable is slain  --  And lives !  --  transmuted , born again Dilate with His immortal breath ! ..... He keeps no least account with pain , With desolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , He has no private end to gain ; No covenant , no terms to make ; No silences To keep ; no death to fear ; no heart to break ! ..... Man 's eyes are clouded with distress ; The heart of man is vexed and twain ; The mind of man is caged and caught , Nor dares with lifted wings go free ;  --  His eyes are quiet as calm dawns at sea , And single , and His heart is one ; His perfect love is pitiless , And asks no less than all that man can give , And will not suffer that man come to naught , And will not punish or forgive ; His mind , like some majestic sun , Centres the vast , expanding gyres of thought ! ..... Melt in His arms and cease from strife ! ..... He wakes ! ..... He lives ! ..... The Lord has come , And all is glorified thereof ! Melt in His arms !  --  and , for the larger life , Forfeit the life you cherished and the love That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord of Love and Life appears , And , in His being 's excellence , The little life of hopes and fears , The little love of self and sense Dissolve  --  exalted to magnificence ! HERAKLES HERAKLES to the PYTHIA , almost in appeal Who is the Lord  --  the God ?  --  and where is He ?  --  The PYTHIA The PYTHIA as before Who asks is answered by His voice ; Who dares advance is on the road ; Whose soul is free and fain to choose , Has made the truth 's transcendent choice ; Who seeks the God has found the God ; Who knocks is Master of the House ! HERAKLES HERAKLES with a great cry Mine is the desolation and the death ! The PYTHIA The PYTHIA as before Yours is the resurrection and the life ! HERAKLES HERAKLES I am the God ! The PYTHIA The PYTHIA as before There is no God but I !  --  I am whatever is !

And hark , my Children !  --  O my Children , hark !  --  For nearer now , and yet more near , And still afar , and wordless still , I hear The music of the soul 's puissant voice Rejoice With festival in the heart and ecstasies For man 's deliverance !

Cry welcome ! for the Lord of all , The Love , the Life , the Strength is come  --  The rightful Heir , the Prodigal , After long exile , now returneth home !

Antistrophe I Yet love is false , and life is brief , And youth and health and hope depart , And troubled is the human heart With fear and agony and grief . Strophe II And why life is we dare not ask , And what is death we dare not guess ; In doubt , despair , and weariness We shirk the truth 's unending task . Antistrophe II It may be that the truth repays Thought 's endless toil to reach its goal ; It may be God is in the soul , And wakens after many days ..... Epode But we have neither part nor lot With truth 's far-sought and fabled grace : Wherever is God 's dwelling-place , In all our lives we find Him not !

What more is death ?  --  and what can death do more Than rob the Spirit of its resting-place , Its refuge of insensibility , And leave it outcast , as my soul is left , Doomed to incessant vigil and unrest ? What more is death ?  --  for what is life , indeed ,  --  The life I lose to gain death 's larger life ,  --  With all its needs and greeds and appetites , Its florid hungers , its satieties , Its humble hopes and gross credulities , Than the dark cup of Lethe to the soul ?  --  A prison-house , in whose captivity The soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more ! no more !  --  O nakedness !

Where shall the soul go home ? ..... And , even when At last the mind 's abysmal darknesses Fill with some huge tranquillity of light , How , in that revelation , shall the soul Find place and reason and the forward path ? ..... Where is there rest or comfort any more ? And whither shall the tasked adventurer Find respite or reprieve ? O nevermore , No-whither shall he find the breast of sleep ! And know you well it is a bitter thing To die  --  and in the thrilling solitude Of death , to live  --  and labour , ever and ever Afoot and sleepless with the vision of truth ! Life is a bitter thing to lose , and love And home and wife and child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And small achievements and brief brilliant glories :  --  These all are welcome and pleasurable things , And bitter things to lose ! .....

The PYTHIA The PYTHIA as before God knows , and I , who dwell with God , I know Truth is a bitter thing to undergo ; ..... And life 's perfected metamorphosis From man to God shall hardly come to pass Save in exceeding travail and grief and pain . Only in anguish man is born again , Other and more and mightier than he was ! ..... Only with strange and tragic ecstasies Of body and being , mind and heart , Life 's human chrysalis Is torn asunder , and ruined , and rent apart , To loose man 's winged divinity Into the light of truth , the skies of liberty ! ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which will live perfectly With labour in its own eternity , Are as the very agony of death ,  --  God knows no fraction of the human whole Is there that wholly perisheth !

The CHORUS The CHORUS Strophe I How , when , and wherefore does he profit most Who pays the utmost cost  --  Tears and blood , Labour and sacrifice , Anguish , bereavement , fear ? How does he gain his life whose life is lost ? For life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief and time is like a flood Which no man has withstood ; And God is silent , and He is not here To prove such ill things good . Antistrophe I How , why , and wherefore is it manifest How of these worst things can derive the best ?  --  Joy from despair and strength from sacrifice ; Freedom and clear tranquillities and faith From doubt and long , enslaved , laborious years ; And gain from loss and God from man and life from death ? What can be worth to man so great a price ? Whence comes his profit when this price is paid ? When all is over and done , is sung and said ,  --  When life is waste and barren with blood and tears ,  --  Whence shall the soul receive sufficiently ? ..... What shall the soul receive for life 's enforced catastrophe ? ..... Strophe II There is no answer ! God , if God there be , Hears not our voice or hears it silently .

Have we not found , whatever price is paid , Man is forever cheated and betrayed ?  --  So shall the soul at last be cheated after all ! Antistrophe II Therefore we care not what the soul may gain Or what the soul may lose : Theirs be the doubt , who dream ! We take the plain , Hard , certain way , and ask no great reward ,  --  Knowing how much ' t is certain , plain , and hard That by no wise invention or device May we in the least measure change or choose What our to-morrow brings .

Before the house of HERAKLES . Nightfall . ALCMENA and MEGARA are seated by the threshold in the last , low light of sunset . The POET and the WOMAN stand in shadow by the house-wall . The CHORUS OF OLD MEN are seated by the steps of the Temple of Hera , at some distance . ALCMENA ALCMENA My life burns dimly , like a famished lamp Wasting at midnight , for my son 's return ..... MEGARA MEGARA My life burns , and my love burns stedfast !  --  clear And calm and candid as a guarded flame Of assignation and of sacred vigil , Quietly in the casement of his home ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN My life burns keenly , like a glutted fire Set at the pier-head by a wind-swept sea To be his land-fall and his harbinger ! .....

Yet , in despite of all I do , my life Seems like a fruitful field unharvested While he is far adventured and in peril About such secret business of the soul ..... ALCMENA ALCMENA It is the virtue and necessity Of women , with such courage as we use , Thus , by the threshold and the fire-light , To serve life 's large intent , and wait alone , Strong and undaunted , for the man to come , Who is abroad , eager with lusts and dreams And pastimes ..... Thus the sane and serious strength Of life 's true cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall prevail . The WOMAN The WOMAN It is the virtue and necessity Of every soul to watch and wait alone , Patient and faithful , till the Saviour comes ! ..... The POET The POET Many shall come with gospels of salvation , Mysterious and august ; with ecstasies And partial laws and rapt , peculiar creeds . Many shall come , with mystic loves and faiths , With strange conversions and perverted lusts , With formal beauties and facilities . Many shall come  --  the foolish , false and fond , The mystic and the meek shall come  --  in vain ! And He , at last ,  --  surely He , too , shall come ! And we , who know him not ,  --  what secret signs Shall prove him to our sense , shall specify The Knower of the secrets of all hearts , The single Truth Incarnate ?  --  When He comes , How shall we know the Saviour ?  --  we , who learn , With all our pains , such scant and partial things !

The WOMAN The WOMAN Sternly and curiously of whoso comes , Well may we ask ; for He shall surely bring The unimaginable and perfect proof ! The POET The POET Not He alone  --  we too must undergo The stringent doubt ! Well may we ask , indeed , What tidings of salvation and the soul Has any man after his Great Adventure ? ..... Well may we ask !  --  for in our several hearts Surely the selfsame question probes us all , We , the Departed , who must soon return To that strange nameless Nothing whence we came ..... Shall we return impoverished or , at last , Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow or to-morrow , turn Into the sunset and the early stars Brows branded with dishonour and defeat , Or , with the sacred monstrance of the soul 's Excellent victory , elate and calm ? Shall we return from life dismayed and dazed , Or quiet with an exceeding majesty , As God is in His garden of great stars , Where all things , each in its eternal kind , Minister to the welfare of the soul ? ..... The WOMAN The WOMAN He is the Son of God ; he is gone forth To find his Father in a better place ; And he shall come with tidings of salvation And news of great concern for every soul . He is the Saviour : he shall fortify , He shall bear up and nourish and sustain All weakness , fears , and insufficiences  --  All incapacities like mine , and all Scrupulous infidelities like yours . He shall return so free that he shall find In you , in me himself exemplified , And give our wingless , anxious pilgrimage The audacious , free , far furtherance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of the Temple Strophe I Verily , Thou and I And all men whatsoever who live and die , We are of one humanity ; We are of one supreme infirmity , One gross resemblance , one result , one cause ; We are as man has been before , And no man of us all is more , And no man of us all is free And master of the inexorable laws ;  --  And all is always as it was , And so it evermore shall be ! ..... We are  --  who were not nor shall be again ! Yet do we vainly live and vain are we ; Vain is contentment and desire is vain And hope is fruitless as a blasted tree ; Vain are the powers and labours of the brain ; Vain are the pangs that shake the human breast ; Vain is the body 's brief felicity ; Vain was our youth !  --  and when the sober years Leave us bereft and spent ,  --  when more and more We feel , upon life 's darkening , lonely shore , Violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vainly we seek for refuge , long for rest ! ..... Antistrophe I There is no refuge and no rest for us ! Tho ' in a myriad tongues and ways The old , wild voice of legend says , " Thither He dwelt , and here of old He trod ! " Yet does the thought and the desire of God Leave us impartial and incredulous . For we have seen how all things pass In sorrow , infirmity , and pain ; How all is dust that comes to dust ; How nothing is where nothing was ; How thick beneath the pleasant grass Are strewn the corpses of the slain ;  --  And strive however much we will We can not find God 's justice just ! How shall we call Him Father still , Our Father , who returns us ill For good , and when we ask for bread Gives us a stone instead ? How shall we weep to Him ?  --  He does not care ! How shall we sing to Him ?  --  He does not hear ! How shall we love Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know if God , indeed , be there ? ..... Rather , by God forsaken and forgot , Let us believe , at last , that He is dead , Or never was and now is not ! ..... Strophe II Yea ! to our sense , in life 's fantastic trance , Nothing there is apparent more than blind Chance and mischance ..... We drift like derelicts with the aimless wind Across the darkness of our ignorance ..... Our lives were kindled like a flame ; Nameless out of the nameless dark we came ; And like a flame that will no longer burn Into the selfsame darkness we return ! ..... Were we not then enraptured and unwise , Should we believe What the soul 's secret whisper says , And strive to find , with vision-haunted eyes , Paths into Paradise , Where we might walk with God in all His ways ? Shall we not rather patiently perceive , And with an unambitious mind , Man 's witness to mankind Touching these matters of the soul 's concern ? Shall we not rather strive at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For we have seen , since human life began , How inconsiderable is man , How weak his mind 's resolve , how brief his love , How vain his strivings and his flights have been , To find the freedom that he knows not of , The light of Truth his eyes have never seen ..... Antistrophe II Did not , of old , Bellerophon Drive his winged courser up the stagnant night To find if in God 's house there was any light , Or any welcome in God 's house ?  --  He said , " There , in my Father 's house , is home . There , in His love 's illimitable dome , Are many mansions  --  and I am His son . And on my Father 's breast There will I rest ; There will I lay down my exhausted head , My broken heart , and there be cheered and stayed There will I walk with God In the calm ways that He is wont to tread , Quiet and undismayed ..... There will I live , and live no longer here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , When all of life is questioned thro ' and thro ' , Save with a solemn joy to question God and hear The splendour of His speech sing in my ear ? ..... I am the Son of God !  --  and well I know The Son can do no trespass if he go Hardily where his Father 's feet have trod . I am the Son of Man !  --  and I shall be Welcome within the Paradise of God . There shall He bend the Sacred Tree Of Knowledge , and auspiciously Gather the ripened fruit for me , And strike the rock of Death , and spread The waters of eternal life , and break the bread Of Truth 's ineffable communion ! "  --  Thus he believed , and thus alone , Bellerophon , Launched on the quest , superbly rose , and rode All the long lonely way , almost to God 's abode ! ..... Till , at the threshold of eternity , He turned , and saw , and could not bear to see The veiled and voiceless vacancy of death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath ! ..... His brain reeled and his heart failed !  --  Suddenly He knew his own shrill insignificance ! Then , from the very sill Of the Unattainable Place , The lightnings of the blind and nameless Will Struck him down headlong thro ' uncharted space ; Until at length  --  By the divine , immitigable fire Sapped in his spirit 's inmost strength , Seared and corrupted to the core Of love and life and hope and all desire  --  He lay dying by the sea 's lamentable shore ! ..... Thus was it then ; with man ' t is always thus !  --  So was it once with Icarus Who eyed the sun , And rashly took unto his spirit wings , And dared into the darkness , up and on , To find the secret and the sense of things , Where , in the eye of God , all stood revealed ! ..... But , when the springs of knowledge were unsealed And Truth towered flaming on his sight , His pinions shattered in the light  --  And like an eagle slain in flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down the deep darkness , smooth and blind as glass , Irretrievably Into the all-receiving sea ! ..... Epode Thus was it then  --  yea , thus it always is ! Man is an eyeless worm whose chrysalis Never , despite his utmost strength , is riven ! In no rebirth , no metamorphosis , Is it to man 's imperfect nature given To slough his gross humanity , and rise Godlike , and walk with God in Paradise  --  Free as God is , unconquerable and wise ! His mind is like a haunted house Where veiled , vain figures walk in sleep ; His heart , where death 's bereavements weep , Where life 's large , florid lusts carouse , Is aimless , like a withered leaf Vexed with love 's vital wind of song ; The purpose of his soul is long ; The days of all his life are brief ! And since we know not what is death  --  Since life is  --  since the end is near  --  We care not who may come , we hear No longer what the Spirit saith ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep Within the soul ,  --  as well may be  --  There where the peaks of thought rise steep And stedfast in eternity , Truth murmurs at its fountain-head ?  --  We care not  --  for our faith is dead ; We hear not  --  lest our faith return ;  --  Lest we believe the truth  --  and learn ; Lest we believe the heart  --  and love ; Lest we believe the soul  --  and dare , And strange disaster come thereof , Of pinions shattered in mid-air , Of ruin and desolation and despair ! ..... Rather , since life is fugitive , And truth 's assurance none can give , And no redemption makes us free , We care not , hear not , nor believe !  --  We live as man must always live ; We are as man must always be ..... The POET The POET It is not , up the shoreless seas of night And thro ' far twilights of the Mystery , The rash adventure and the reckless flight Of winged desires and dreams of liberty , Veered to no lodestar at truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , ambition of the soul . The wings of man 's brave ecstasies are frail ; The passions native to the human breast  --  The secret raptures which persuade  --  The unutterable longings which prevail  --  Tried in the truth 's tremendous test , Prove weak and daunted and dismayed . There is no swift and violent way , There is no near and friendly goal ; There is a certain price to pay And certain profit for the soul , And certain justice !  --  when , at length , Clad in the heart 's clear , human flame , Phrased in the mind and conscious of its aim , Man 's inmost spiritual strength  --  No more wind-driven and sea-spent On the waste waters of his ignorance  --  Interprets life by his significance , And lives , and earns his true enfranchisement ! .....

End of the Eleventh Scene . TWELFTH SCENE The Caucasus . A lofty mountain-peak rising in pinnacles of naked rock . On a narrow ledge , PROMETHEUS stands erect , chained to the face of the cliff . Before his feet the mountain falls sheerly away to green pastures far below , which slope steeply to a narrow beach of bright sand . The horizon of the sea closes the vast prospect . On either hand the trend of the coast , bordered by mountains , meadow and forest , field and stream , stretches in a vast curve indefinitely outward into the distance . Landward , as far as the eye can reach , rise high mountains clothed with forests and interspersed with fertile valleys . It is a calm , clear evening , about half an hour before sunset . The sun hangs flaming over a windless sea and in a cloudless heaven . The moon just shows over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . The vast figure of the TITAN stands motionless and superb in the full splendour of the setting sun . In the time elapsed between this and the preceding scene , HERAKLES has accomplished all his great Labours except the voyage to the Hesperides . PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS The night returns  --  and still Prometheus Wears on his limbs the chains He forged in Hell . The night returns  --  and soon the Bird of God Returneth ravening to his massacre . The night returns  --  and God is in His Heaven , Throned in the world 's dominion ..... Once again , As when I fared up the prodigious night And seized the Torch out of His Holy House , Round his resplendent Being in Paradise , I seem to feel the everlasting Light Blend with the voice of the invisible choirs Thro ' mansions of perennial festival ..... The night returns  --  and God is in His Heaven , And fear and anger vex the heart of God , Brooding on me and my indomitable Rebellion and the soul 's validity ; While far below men kindle in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ! These were my works ! I have achieved , God knows , Somewhat of everlasting worth and real Significance !  --  God knows and life records My hazardous and unalterable deeds ! Mine was the cosmic issue  --  and in me The purpose of the inexorable will Of life , the process of the endless flux , The motion of the universal being , Found its assured , victorious utterance ! I was , in the beginning of the world , Where there was only desolation , death , Dismay and darkness ,  --  where the lives of men Were vile and violent like the lives of beasts ;  --  And I alone found out the Great Idea , Found the supreme and secret meaning out ; And I alone found out the forthright way Of man 's deliverance , and restored the light , And made of life a lovely and human thing , And gave the soul divine and pregnant dreams ! ..... Man was reborn in me !  --  and therefore God , Jealous and fearful , came in wrath against me , Binding me captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff , where His malignant hate , Burning thro ' ons of unrecorded time , Visits me with intolerable wrongs . Yet , tho ' I wear His chains , and even now The Eagle wheels aloft , scenting his carnage , Still is my heart 's inviolate hope serene And undismayed ; still life reveals its trust ; Still and forever I keep the Faith , and still Bear and believe the testament of Truth . The victory was mine and mine shall be The victory !  --  the first and last and best Are mine ! I saved mankind and now , in turn , Man shall conceive , in his maturity , My Saviour and my Comrade and my Lord ! Therefore I stand , invincible , and wait , Solitary and august and unafraid , As he must be whose witness to mankind Is of the free divinity of man . Therefore I wait  --  for He shall surely come !

HERAKLES appears somewhat higher up in the mountain . He advances to the sheer edge of the precipice and pauses , gazing out over the world . From where he stands PROMETHEUS is invisible . HERAKLES HERAKLES Hither away are the Hesperides  --  Hither away is hope  --  hither away The heart of life yearns unto Paradise ! ..... Hither away the insatiable will Of life , grown conscious of its aim , intends New liberations , new supremacies , New powers and new ineffable dominions And new aggrandizements of being and life 's New utterance of the soul 's new testament !

O not in vain I served and sacrificed , Loved and was lonely , and , in mighty works , Extolled the Spirit , and practised and professed Tender and excellent humanities And the victorious virtues of the soul !

Nothing is vain of all that I have done ! I have prevailed by labours and subdued All that man is below his utmost truth , His inmost virtue , his essential strength , His soul 's transcendent , one preminence ! Yea , I have brought into the soul 's dominion All that I am !  --  and in the Master 's House There is no strength of all my mortal being That does not serve Him now ; there is no aim , There is no secret which He does not know ; There is no will save one , which is the Lord 's ! .....

Only , for you All has been long postponed ; but now , at last , To-morrow and the labour and the truth Are here at hand  --  and truth is terrible ! Courage , O Titan ! O Prometheus , Courage , courage !  --  you shall more need it now That I am come to strip you of your chains , Your lifelong honour and your happiness , And leave you real and bare in the real world , Than ever when all alone , incessantly , You stood superb against the power of God And took no ease of the remorseless pain ..... You shall more need it now to , gloriously , And more magnificently than God , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , serious strength Which He had not , who thundered and was hidden , Assume  --  resume , perhaps , after so long !  --  Dominion over more than ever He Held under various rule of fear and love . Courage , Strong Heart , courage !  --  for now , at last , You shall recover what you gave away Such countless vague millenniums ago :  --  The Kingdom and the Power and the Glory , The strength , the will , the clear eternities Of truth , the sacred miracles of love , The widening skies , the calm infinities Of liberty  --  the inherent heritage of man , So long estranged under God 's usurpation ! ..... PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS I shall recover ? ..... My inheritance ? ..... Mine ? ..... What betides ? ..... O what shall come to pass ? ..... Where is my victory  --  the full , the flushed And mystic consummation of my dreams ? ..... The voice of the POET POET somewhat nearer Courage ! for thus and only thus  --  As we are prompt and hazardous , As we are rapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the strange , steep way , and hear The airs rush into song before our flight , And pass out of the night , Persuaded by a single star , And learn that where the soul 's adventures are The truth 's discovery is near , And the delight Of liberty , and pans , and pageantries of light ! ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES Courage !  --  PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS My strength and courage shall suffice , HERAKLES HERAKLES You shall be more victorious than you dreamed , Prometheus !  --  for your victory is truth , Only conceived in the unfettered mind Which , of the gross amorphous element Of life , in its alembic subtly fused And wonderfully transfigured , makes the clear Cogency of the universal laws . Yea , God has long enough stood in the plain , Noble and forthright way of man 's ambition , Wielded his regency , and for a mess Of pottage bought his vast inheritance ;  --  And man shall come into his kingdom ! ..... God , As truth discerns , is of the infancy Of man  --  the primal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large , On the vast shadow of his ignorance , His sense of the inevitable Unknown , The chance , blind sum of nameless energies , Amid whose secret peril he walked in darkness , Bearing the light of life 's concentred fire , The pure , fine flame of the self-realized soul , Fearfully on its way , windy with doom ..... For thus , in symbols , fables , parables , We are expressed ; we hear some vague report Of what we know not , and our minds devise Some image that shall well enough suffice To methodize to thought 's austere command , To reason 's quiet , inevitable terms , The garbled jargon that the senses speak  --  Which are persuaded of the Something there ! ..... Thus rose the myth of God , when time was young , When , curious of whatever strictly shaped The horror and hardship of his destiny , Man 's fear and ignorance conceived the cause In his own likeness , and believed  --  and wept ! Now we have looked abroad and looked within , Straining the symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , its secret sense , Shadowed and insufficiently set forth , Is , in the meaning and the truth , ourselves !  --  We are the Gods ! We are the Householders Of heaven and earth and all that in them is ! It is your Self , your universe and mine , Prometheus  --  yours and mine and man 's forever ! PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS Mine is God 's burden of the universe ? ..... Mine the relentless energies of God , Which lurk beneath this candid and benign Masque of perennial nature , and conspire To compass man 's destruction and despair ? ..... I am alone ? ..... I am responsible ? ..... O nothing , nothing of all my dreams comes true ! The voice of the POET POET nearer than before Brave , spiritual , and strong , Let us take wings and will , O Soul ! for we , We have too long , too idly and too long , In fate 's relentless grip , Lain like a derelict ship Cast from the shining circles of the sea High on the shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  perchance To-day , the least of life 's impartial days , In unpremeditated , common ways , We shall achieve deliverance  --  And wake , and hearken , and hear The rush of the changing tide And the shout of the flood returning , deep and wide , Over the reefs of doubt and fear , Over the shoals of change and chance , Over the shores of time  --  and feel , Under our keel , The old ecstatic buoyancy , The strong , smooth , spacious , sun-starred breast of the Sea ! ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES Prometheus ! Prometheus ! Prometheus !  --  The soul of man can never be enslaved Save by its own infirmities , nor freed Save by its very strength and own resolve And constant vision and supreme endeavour ! You will be free ? Then , courage , O my brother !  --  O let the soul stand in the open door Of life and death and knowledge and desire And see the peaks of thought kindle with sunrise ! ..... Then shall the soul return to rest no more , Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul shall go with great resolve To dwell at last upon the shining mountains In liberal converse with the eternal stars ..... O let the soul feel the unhindered wind Blow out at sunrise to the dazzled sea , Strain in its sails and urge its enterprise ! ..... Then shall it tarry in the anchorage , By teeming wharves of vulgar merchandise , No more  --  but rather choose to go abroad Into the great , gold morning , and afar , Where , from new skies , new seas receive the light ..... O let the soul , at truth 's persuasion , wake And understand !  --  it shall not then endure To fail and be at peace and profitless : For little glory has it of all this world , And all its strength is nervous and disused In the low , little labours of mankind . It is alone and understood by none ; Its speech is not of vain , vile , violent things ; But on its lips the dominant , great voice , Which is the one true voice , cries out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the soul of man  --  and can not stay ; It is the soul of man  --  and may not rest ; It is the soul of man  --  and will not fail , And shall not cease to labour evermore , Until at last its own infinity Is in its own perfection all conceived ! ..... Prometheus ! Prometheus !  --  God is dead , And man is overcome !  --  and you and I And all men whatsoever whose minds report The truth , whose lives exemplify the soul  --  We are the Heirs of all the universe , And of ourselves supremely , all in all ! Yea !  --  for the Lord , who dreamed of regencies Too little perfect and resplendent , and Set over them celestial deputies In His own image , feigned and fabulous , Is come into His kingdom out of sleep ! Yea !  --  for the hour is come , the Lord is roused  --  And all is His , and all is victory ! ..... A scant moment 's silence . Then , his voice sounding like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prometheus !  --  PROMETHEUS raises his arms . The fetters fall from his limbs . He takes a step forward to the edge of the precipice . PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS Free ..... His face turns skyward . In the last , dark flush of the sunset the EAGLE appears , swooping swiftly down . God 's winged blood-hound falls to his quarry ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES Your eagle comes as a tamed hawk returns ..... The EAGLE sweeps down and lights on the shoulder of PROMETHEUS , where it folds its great wings and remains motionless . The voice of the POET POET close at hand And then !  --  O then it is , after the deed is done , And the Great Gates stand open , and we are gone , Who shall no more return , Foundered and tempest-driven , As drift and wreckage on the shores of time  --  O then and thus it is we learn How all the soul was skilled to ask is given ! And wonderfully and nobly we discern A sense of life transcendent and sublime , A knowledge that we shall by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we earn ! For then and thus it is The soul achieves its metamorphosis , The Sleeper wakes within the House of Dream , And , deep within the vision of his eyes , In the starred , silent heights of heaven The incommensurable night is riven , And in the blinding beam Of dawn across unfathomable skies , His wings flash skyward from their shattered chrysalis ! ..... Thus do we end our exile ; then it is We find the last release , and rise , Knowing the truth which testifies That pain and time and long captivity And life and death and destined circumstance Are only phases of our ignorance ! ..... And thus it is at last that we , After great love and long adjournments , see The pinnacles of thought lighten with song  --  And all the spirits of the Free , Calm and majestic , move along In an ascending theory ! ..... While we stand with wings and will Nerved to the task before us still ; While we watch with stedfast eyes , Clear and valiant as a bell , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret none can tell ; While we prepare , in tense tranquillity , For the inveterate miracle , The soul 's perennial truth , the truth 's perennial liberty ! ..... Ascending from below , the POET and the WOMAN appear , faint and exhausted , on the level where HERAKLES and PROMETHEUS are standing . The WOMAN The WOMAN Herakles ! ..... She falls fainting to the ground . The POET The POET Love has spent its strength ..... and I Am hardly come so far after my vision ..... He falls on his knees beside the WOMAN . HERAKLES HERAKLES O human heart of love !  --  O Visionary , Filled with the sacred utterance of song !  --  Welcome ! The hour is come and gone . Behold !  --  Yours is the victory , for man is free ! PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS Free !  --  I hear Pyrrha crying in the darkness ..... And Epimetheus calls me ..... and Pandora Sings in the total night desolate songs And strange , old legends , dim with secrecies ..... I see Deukalion 's face , fierce and afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a thing of terror and of tears To them  --  more sad and terrible than death !  --  When , with my hollow reed of the pure flame Of everlasting , living light , I came Among them , flushed , triumphant , fabulous ,  --  Came as the herald of life 's endless task , With trumpet-calls and splendid exhortations , Eloquent in my hour of victory ! I was a thing of terror and of tears To them  --  my turn has come to fear and weep ! For now I stand in the beginning  --  I , Prometheus !  --  as they stood in the beginning  --  Pyrrha , Deukalion , Hellen , mortal men And women  --  with the life they had not asked ! ..... I stand in the beginning , stand and weep Here in the new , bleak light of liberty , As once they stood and wept , seeing the light ! ..... I stand in the beginning  --  I , who once Believed fond fancies of the mystic end  --  The unimaginable , fantastic , dim Apotheosis of my hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is dead , And man is overcome , and I am free !  --  And who am I ? ..... And what is liberty ? ..... HERAKLES . HERAKLES . Liberty is the freedom to become Free ..... The POET The POET The soul 's long day 's work is liberty . HERAKLES turns and begins to ascend the mountain . PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS Mine is the long day 's work ..... Mine is the soul ..... Mine is the freedom to be free ..... I know At last and without question , suddenly , There is no Power in whose almighty hands I can lay down the burden of this world ; And I am all alone and utterly Real and responsible ; and now my house Of life is ruined , and I am left alone , Shelterless and at large , like a poor beast ..... All that I was  --  my value and my worth , My sense and strength  --  is gone ! ..... The mind 's defiance , The heart 's indomitable rebellion , are No more ; no more the tortures and the chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were my virtue , these my hope and faith , These were my own , my life 's , significance :  --  They are no more ! ..... And in the stead of them , What is my meaning , aim , and end ? ..... HERAKLES HERAKLES standing higher in the mountain , in the place where he first appeared To you , As you to Pyrrha and Deukalion , Now I renew , appraised and amplified And more sublime , more glorious , more secure , The one true , perfect , and profitable gift !  --  All that there is at all I give you !  --  Lo , Yours is the Universe and yours the Soul , And life and labour and liberty are yours To understand and blend them into one ! ..... All that there is I give you , and no less , And nothing more !  --  no phantoms and vain dreams , No spectral fears and false expectancies , No empty honour , no vainglorious joy . These are destroyed  --  but not that , in their stead , Other , tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things Should fill the shadows whence their shapes are gone ;  --  Rather are they destroyed that in their room The soul of man may go abroad at last , Gravely and quietly , as befits the soul ; And freely , masterfully and wisely dwell In the waste , spacious realm , withheld so long ! PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS I understand at last . The end is come Of all my dreams , for now the new bleak light Of the Beginning is upon mine eyes , And I am wakened ! ..... And I understand At last ..... And Truth is grave and chaste as death  --  And radiant as life is in its whole strength ! So , as I may , I take the stern , great gift : Mine is the Soul , and mine the Universe ; Mine is the burden , mine the task . I know The price of Truth , the worth of Liberty . I understand at last  --  and now my strength Returns !  --  Where are the labours and the life ? ..... Where is the conflict ? ..... Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! When all Is understood , all is subdued , received , Possessed and perfect . For the soul of man Is , in the universe of force and change , Of blind , immeasurable energies , Subtile and secret and supremely one , The sole self-realized power , the single strength Aimed and reflective and perfectible . Therefore alone the mind 's conception turns Chaos to cosmos , ignorance to truth , Force to the freedom of articulate laws  --  Giving to phases of the senseless flux , One after one , the soul 's identity . Yea , of the soul is all our hope ! To know Is truth and freedom !  --  Therefore , O my Brother , Therefore beyond us , in the vast Unknown , Waiting the power and conquest of the mind , Is the far prospect of our enterprise ! ..... And should we come into dominion !  --  then , O then , at last , when all is lived and learned , Loved and received in its eternal kind  --  When we are Gods and Saviours , every one  --  When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , impermanent star , And in the inhospitable vacancies Are welcome and securely domiciled  --  When we are strangers nowhere in the earth Or sea , and nowhere in the being of man  --  When the long life of all man 's endless lives , Its gradual pregnancies , its pangs and throes , Its countless multitudes of perished Gods And outworn forms and spent humanities ,  --  When all the cosmic process of the past Stands in the immediate compass of our minds  --  When all is present to us and all is known , Even to the least , even to the uttermost , Even to the first and last  --  when , over all , The widening circles of our thought expand To infinite horizons everywhere  --  Then , tenoned in our foothold on the still , Supernal , central pinnacle of being , Shall we not look abroad and look within , Over the total Universe , the vast , Complex and vital sum of force and form , And say , in one , sufficient utterance , The single , whole , transcendent Truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The POET The POET rising to his feet Come ! I will lead you down , Prometheus ! PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS Down ..... My Son !  --  My Brother !  --  must we say farewell ? HERAKLES HERAKLES Hither away are the Hesperides ..... The POET The POET Come ! I will lead you down , Prometheus , down , Where , in reality , in deed , in truth , Your work begins ! PROMETHEUS PROMETHEUS Where does the work begin ? HERAKLES HERAKLES There , wheresoever the soul 's dominion ends ! For a moment no one moves . Then PROMETHEUS slowly gathers the WOMAN in his huge arms , and begins to descend the mountain , the POET leading the way . The last vestige of sunset is gone . The night is calm and perfect . The thin figure of the POET and the vast stature of the TITAN , with the insensible WOMAN upon his breast , and the great EAGLE still perched upon his shoulder , loom vaguely in the still moonlight . HERAKLES stands motionless on his eminence ,  --  clear , strong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
