txt Many persons are asking when work will actually be begun on the great bridge that Is ' proposed to be built across the Hudson River from New-York to Weehawken . Others are speculating how long a time will be required to build the structz ure , the plans for which are beyond any ever undertaken before . Engineer Charles Macdonald of the Union Bridge Company , who designed the plan for the bridge that was approved Tuesday by Secretary of War Lamont , to whom , therefore , the details of the bridge are almost as familiar as tholigh it really spanned the Hudson , estimates that ten years would be ample time to perform all the work . Mr. Macdonald said to a reporter for The New-York , Times last evening : " I saw In an afternoon paper that expert engineers say the bridge can be built in five years . I do not consider that a safe estimate . I think that , allowing for all unforeseen delays , it would be wiser to say that the bridge could be completed in ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun . " It would be misleading to say that the work of construction will be begun at once . Only a relative statement can be made on that point . All the work that has been done thus far is purely preliminary to the actual . task . It has resulted in securing the necessary legal basis for carrying on the project . " The hard nut that is to be cracked during the next year is to make the bridge an attractive investment to capitalists . That is the chief question now before us . When it is settled the work on the bridge will be begun , and not a moment sooner . " In making plans for this bridge we were confronted with conditions before unthought of . It is necessary that a bridge be built across the Hudson , and yet the requirements of commerce also demand that the river chanel be left open . That means a single span across the river . No one would have dreamed of such a span twenty years ago , and I myself should not have thought it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had to be met . I think , still , that a cantilever bridge with a pier in the river would be more economical . But this being out of the question , I set at work to plan a bridge that should fill all legal requirements and at the same time be within a cost that would make it attractive to investors . I think I have succeeded . There is much to be done , though , yet . Everything will have to be figured out on a strict basis of dollars and cents before anything else can be accomplished . That means a great deal of work . " Everything is secondary to this one problem . We are now working for its solution . I do not apprehend that the question of obtaining sites for the terminals will cause very much trouble or delay . In the actual construction of the bridge , too , there is really less in the way than there was in the case of the Brooklyn Bridge , although the proposed North River Bridge represents an undertaking of a magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few years made such progress that questions that were puzzling when the Brooklyn Bridge was begun are clear now . " The time seems opportune for the project of the New-York and New-Jersey Bridge . During the time the building of the bridge has been under consideration , the lowest point of financial depression was reached . Now business is looking up , and capital is again seeking investment . I think that we shall be able to dembnstrate to capitalists that the proposed bridge is worthy their attention as an investment . Until capitalists have been made to understand its real value , it is futile to attempt to say when the work on the bridge will be begun . " The plan submitted by the Union Bridge Company of 1 Broadway was the only one that was accompanied by a guarantee that the company would build the bridge at a cost not to exceed 25,000,000 . The Union Bridge Company also agreed to undertake the construction on a percentage-of-cost basis .                 @ @ @ @
