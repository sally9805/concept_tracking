ARTICLE 11. - AN UNTOUCHED FIELD FOR MISSIONARY LABOR . IT is always a grave misfortune to the world when its moral energies are misapplied . The student of social progress must always be pained to see that power , which should tell for the lessening of human wretchedness , wasted in vain beatings of the air , and seeing the unsatisfactory rate of that progress , he has a right to inquire whether there be any reason , in the nature of things , why a maximum of effort should produce a minimum of result . Perhaps no other form of human activity affords so conspicuous an example of self-denying devotion to duty , as that branch of philanthropic labor usually denominated " missions . " Whatever any one may think concerning the value of missionary work no one can deny that their supporters and devotees have furnished convincing proof , that there is in poor human nature that which can be successfully appealed to . They are striving without reward or hope of gain , for the uplifting of men and the upbuilding of society on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire one with the hope that some day the well-directed efforts of the more public spirited will redeem the race . Without belittling or questioning the dignity or usefulness of what is generally known as missionary work , " one may be permitted to suggest that so far as home missions are concerned , the efforts of our various philanthropic agencies are nullified by forces which are practically unopposed , but which should be attacked first of all . Granting , therefore , the beneficial effects of home missionary efforts , I would appeal to that same missionary spirit for work in another direction , where it is sorely needed and where , doubtless , it would speedily bring forth fruit an hundred fold . The plea is not merely for home missionary work , but for a work that seldom is thought of , I fancy , when home missiomis are spoken of , and which rarely is , if ever , suggested to mission bands as a proper subject for discussion or even for contemplation . This work will not be among earth 's vilest // and darkest corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel and where the tree of knowledge bears its richest fruits . The individuals whom it is here sought to commend to the care of our missionary workers are not those commonly regarded as the proper subjects for missionary effort , but are to be found chiefly in the more cultured walks of life . The work here hinted at may seem to be somewhat out of the ordinary , but it is equal in dignity and importance to any missionary work in which one could engage . It is at the same time as distinctively Christian as the Golden Rule , and as thoroughly practical as ma qua eharta . While it calls for the exercise of the higher qualities of our nature , it touches , in a thousand ways , the material interests and the physical comforts of our daily lives . It is , or it should be , at once the touchstone of religious sincerity and the test of an intelligent conception of practical affairs . It involves , in a word , labor to secure the application of the commonest rules of morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private life shall be honorable in public life as well . lit calls for an uniform standard of honor , whether a man kneels before an altar or stands around the polls . It denounces with equal indignation the man who knowingly degrades another to win a vote , and the man who degrades another to gain a dollar . It knows no difference , it can make no distinction , between him who panders to the weaknesses of men for the sake of party triumph , and him who stimulates man 's lower appetites for the sake of private gain . It holds that the moral law is not special but universal , and that the jurisdiction of conscience is co-extensive with the activities of men . it assumes that government was established for the good of the many and that the work of administering that government is the highest employment that can fall to man . It holds further , that he who treats that work other than as the most sacred of trusts must be either morally base or morally blind , and it insists that to prostitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is asked , then , is that the ordinary moral forces of society employ their energies in the creation of a public conscience ; that the Christian seek to implant in the breasts of // his associates a Christian sentiment concerning public affairs ; that the enlightened citizen strive to impress his fellow citizens with an intelligent understanding of the responsibilities which citizenship imposes , and that the virtuous endeavor to inspire the multitude with some regard for simple honesty in politics . I am aware that I shall be met with the answer that the various moral agencies of the country are already doing all that lies in their power , to combat the forces of evil in this as in other fields of labor , but I know of no subject so sadly neglected , while seeming to be so abundantly cared for . I can think of no other matter concerning which there is such moral obtuseness among those who rank with the first in their various communities or who stand conspicuous among the highest in the land . Undoubtedly one should be slow to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local standards and conduct . It will gladly be conceded that there are sections of this country where an active public sentiment has preserved a decent system of politics , and that there are other sections where decency is in active and hopeful revolt . But where like causes of public demoralization exist , one may rightfully look for similarity in the condition of the public mind , and where one finds similarity in the character of public men and in legislation , one has a right to infer that this similarity is due to a corresponding state of public sentiment . Applying this test , one is abundantly justified in concluding that while the deplorable condition here referred to , happily , is not universal , it yet is sufficiently widespread to be called general , and that over vast sections of this country the difference in regard to public demoralization is one of degree and not of kind . What is here said must therefore be applied by individuals according as their local surroundings may warrant . Certain it is , however , that in more than one State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be indignation at fraud or corruption elsewhere , such crimes are accepted with a chuckle in the domain of politics . While public sentinient requires of the holder of a position of private trust , a just and honest performance of duty , one who holds a similar public position is permitted , by that same public sentiment , to abuse // his trust for the private benefit of himself or of his associates . The same conduct which in private affairs would disgrace him forever , does not even lessen the esteem in which he is held as an exemplary or even pious citizen . To participate in politics , to engage in the conduct of public affairs , is , under the standard of public morals now quite generally tolerated , to enter a realm where moral rules are reversed or ignored altogether , and he who will receive the severest public condemnation and be visited with the most unrelenting punishment from indignant citizens will not be he who devises the most schemes of public plunder , but will be he who is so rash as to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravely though vainly endeavors to protect the interests entrusted to his care . Men who would be insulted , were one to intimate that they are not the very pink of honor , in politics do not know what honor is . A generation of voters is now in existence which has been taught the baleful lesson that everything is fair in politics . Professed politicians and selfappointed leaders of opinion have by their example taught that lesson with a cynical indifference to the certain consequences that is simply appalling . They have impressed this notion upon the weaker voters who looked to them for guidance and direction , smiling contemptuously , all the while , at those who were clear headed enough to remonstrate . The natural results of their action we have before us , in a degraded and deteriorating electorate . There are to-day multitudes of voters , jealous of their reputation in business pursuits , who have yet to learn , absolutely for the first time , that the ordinary rules of honesty have any place in politics , or that as citizens they owe a duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kept honest and pure . They read in the public press incitements to political activity , and the only interpretation of which their perverted minds are capable is that some candidate must be chosen whose " boodle " will supply the means for a " lively campaign , they hear from the stump appeals for " earnest work " and the only construction they can give is that as many votes as possible must be purchased . The very means of preserving a healthy political life become , with such material , mere agencies of corruption . The young men who thus unwittingly become // the foes of free government , would under the pressure of a normal public sentiment be the very flower of our political parties . Under that system of politics , which our so-called leaders of both parties , in many States , espouse to-day , ability , fitness , and , above all , that force of character which asks no leaders , which can direct itself , so far from being a recommendation to favor is a positive hindrance to success . Tnstead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a leadership based upon superiority in corruption and intrigue . Party spirit has degenerated to a fanaticism , which seeks to rally the citizens in two great hostile bodies , each trying to plunder the other , in utter blindness to the fact , that their respective managers are industriously engaged in plundering both . This partisan frenzy has so distorted the moral vision of many of our otherwise best citizens , that hundreds of communities are practically under the control of their baser elements . The corrupt and venal set the pitch to which our political concert is tuned . From time to time , a voice , like one crying in the wilderness , may be heard for simple honesty , but the swell of the chorus drowns its faltering tones , and the rank and file march to the polls keeping step to the music of the spoilsmen . With those whom many of us are compelled to own as rulers the idea is , politics " for revenue only , with incidental protection ' * to the public interests . But what has all this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this to do with it . It shows unmistakably to what line of work effort should first be chiefly confined . The local mission work of our church societies is defeated and turned to naught by no other power so much as by our recognized methods of canvassing for votes . The design , the purpose of that method , is to deaden the consciences and dwarf the souls of men . Its efficiency depends upon success in destroying public spirit in the individual , and the means employed are those which antagonize every good influence . Twice a for weeks too'ether there is a free supply of year , b intoxicants to the voters who select our rulers and decide the policy of the State . All the evil that comes from excessive drinking , all the demoralization that free rum entails , are the // inevitable accompaniments of an exciting campaign . The wealthy candidate too often leaves behind him a trail of homes darkened by shadows that were not there before , of youth debauched , of manhood corrnpted , and of citizenship polluted . The obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad struggle for place and power . The kind neighbor , the gentle citizen , the professing Christian , is by some subtle power metamorphosed into one careless of the harm he may do to individuals or of the havoc he may work in public morals . What should be simply a periodical ascertainment of the popular will , becomes , to a deplorable extent , a prolonged public debanch . Multitudes of voters look forward to election days , merely as the time when they can get money without labor and whisky without price . The candidates are regarded by them simply as individuals officially selected to stand treat for the crowds , and gin-mills that otherwise would starve live on the harvest which candidates for office bring to them . Conld anything be more destructive of the work , which church and other philanthropic societies are seeking to accomplish among the unfortunate of our population , than these regularly recurring orgies , these incitements to unrestricted indulgence in this form of animalism ? Is it natural , is it sensible , is it possible for a community which supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising in indignant protest against its continuance ? Side by side , we have two kinds of home missions , the one for good , the other for evil . With one hand society seeks to raise the low , while with the other it drags men down . Organized philanthropy labors to Christianize the subjects of a Congo chief , while at the same time organized politics , practically unrebuked , labors to heathenize the citizens of our own Republic . The same society embraces both organizations ; and membership in one is no bar to active membership in the other . The same man who " for the love of Christ , " gives his money to send the missionary among depraved humanity in India to lift it up , " for the sake of the cause ' gives , with equal cheerfulness , his money to send the " worker ' * among the degraded of our cities to make them more degraded still . // This is not an exaggerated picture of our politics of to-day . It is not a fancy sketch but is drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will say that is not as bad as is here described . Honorable exceptions are many , but the general tone of our public life is exceedingly low . He who is to-day , " in the swim with our so-called politicians , is swimming in a dirty pool , and he who pulls against the current receives but slight encouragement for his pains . But it will be asked , what have our churches , our schools , and colleges to do with this ? They are not corrupt . They d* not encourage such practices , but , on the contrary , exert their influence against them . If public morals are bad , it is because the individuals who make up the public refuse to submit themselves to the influence of the agencies referred to . Were it not for the work of these bodies , matters would be far worse than they are . All this may be granted . It is not the purpose of this Article to arraign the churches or the schools of the country , but to ask for their deliberate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected ; to ask that their support of the good in politics shall be more positive , more aggressive , and their opposition to the bad more pronounced and determined . It is to express the wish that their attitude may become so plainly manifest that certain of our worthy citizens can no longer be mistaken as to what is permitted and what condemned , and that the time may come when the man who personally or by procurement debauches his fellows , shall not feel easy in the society of the good and true . An intelligent reading of signs will suggest that the evil results not so much from individual wickedness as from a lax public sentiment , not so much from moral baseness as from moral cowardice . The main strength of political corruption comes not from the acts of those who share in its gain or who practice it as a congenial employment , but from the silent acquiescence of those who would scorn to participate themselves . Public demoralization is caused less by the actor in a crime than by the beneficiary , who by assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deprived of the countenance of the reputable , the disreputable would speedily sneak from the public gaze . The work , then , for our educa // tional and moral forces , is the creation of a public sentiment that will demand better things , a sentiment that will hold it unfit that a man who employs the venal as his tools , shall at the same time possess the npright as his friends . Snch a sentiment does not exist to-day , and that it does not proves that our churches and our schools fail to do their full duty . ft shows that however earnest their efforts , however strong their good will , their methods must be ill chosen or their energies misapplied . The better elements of any community set the standard of morals in business and in social life , and they could set that standard in politics , if they would . If that standard is fixed by the ignorant and corrupt , it is because the educated and the honest offer but little opposition to their rule . Between the positively base and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent itself , but ready to practice virtue if the command be laid upon it or to indulge in vice if no restraint be imposed . To that large class the virtuous may give a standard of conduct if they will . When men must choose between the purchased support of the profligate and the respect of the honest , they will not be long in choosing . So long as they can win the one , without losing the other , it were vain to hope for better times . It is idle to look for improvement , through a change in the law or in the organization of new parties . Parties are no better and no worse than the men who belong to them and the charactey of the in en would not be altered by a change of name of the party with which they may act . Without a change of method , change of parties would be useless , while of laws we have plenty and to spare . We are not governed by statute but by public opinion . The only really effective law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by statute or by judicial decree , possesses vitality , only as it lives and breathes in the character of living men . A healthy public sentiment , therefore , not reformatory legislation , is what is needed . The work of educating public sentiment should be easy . The same power which teaches a sense of duty to one 's neighbor as a neighbors surely ought to be able to teach as high a sense of duty to one 's neighbor as a citizen . The same force which can inspire a man with a jealous regard for his church or for his // alma mater , surely ought to know how to inspire as keen a regard for the welfare of his State . It is not proposed to discuss methods within the limits of this Article , but to urge the need of doing something , if our great missionary bodies would not give rise to questionings of their sincerity . When that need is fully recognized , the rest will be easy . For where there is a will , patriotism , like love , will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we need to treat this matter of government seriously , as something not to be juggled with , but as one feature of our social life , to be treated precisely as other features of that social life are treated . The same rules , the same standards , should be applied in public as in private life . There is , in the nature of things , no reason why the conduct of men in politics should differ from what it is elsewhere . There is no occasion , no excuse for Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes . No one should expect to see a political career change a man dishonest in private business into one punctilious of honor in public life , and there is no more reason why a man careful of his honor in private business should change his code of morals the instant he touches public affairs . That this latter transformation does take place , shows beyond question that public sentiment concerning this matter is radically wrong , that there is a moral blindness in regard to it that does not exist where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not lie in the character of our institutions , for we are not alone in our irrational view of public life . Said an English journal , some three years ago : " Things are done every day in public offices by perfectly respectable men , which would bring disgrace and ruin to the perpetrators , if they happened to be engaged in private business . " There is the key to the solution of this question ! So soon as our respectable elements resolve that the same acts which would bring disgrace and ruin upon the perpetrators , if they were engaged in private business , shall as quickly and as surely bring disgrace and ruin upon them in public life , the work of political regeneration will have been practically accomplished . There is no mystery about political reform . It is as simple and as difficult as common sense . No less , no more . But the purpose of this Article is to urge upon those whose sense of duty leads them to interest // themselves in other forms of philanthropy , that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the management and conduct of our political parties , that the same spirit of self-sacrifice which impels one to forego ease and comfort for the sake of the brother of India or of Zululand , should compel one to make the sacrifice of ease and comfort involved in a participation in politics for the sake of the brother who should be the dearest of all , because the nearest to onr home ; that in moral as in physical life preventive action is more efilcient than restorative treatment ; that infinitely more good may be accomplished by removing stumbling blocks from another 's path than by assisting him to rise after he has fallen ; and , that the practical , the rational , the only way to stop the wickedness of so-called politicians is to take their places in the community , and to substitute duty for their intrigue as a basis of public life ; patriotism for their greed as a motive to action ; ability and character for their skill in manipulation as qualification for position ; and , more important than all else , appeals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving party success . Personal inconvenience at home should not be permitted to count for more than personal inconvenience abroad . If love of the case far away is sincere , it should be manifested by an active interest at home . Without touching upon the perils to the nation which result from loose public morals , the thought which is here sought to be impressed upon church men and women is that indifference to politics is infidelity to the cause which they profess to have at heart ; that the work of imparting an honest character to our political contests is directly in the line of true Christian endeavor ; that while the present low standard of morals prevails , their efforts to create , in the depraved of our city or coum try population , a desire for higher and better living will necessarily be futile , because all that they can do by a year 's painstaking effort will be undone by the political " hustler ' * in a single week or a single day ; that they are , like Sysiphus , with infinite pains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill of moral improvement , only to have it annually hurled down again by our so-called public leaders and their half crazed dnpes ; that the man who , in disgust , // withdraws himself from all lot or part in political conflicts and devotes his energies wholly to religious and charitable works , becomes by such withdrawal , and in spite of such consecration , the efficient though unconscious ally of the hosts of sin ; and that , in short , the best way to reform the habits and character of a people is , first to destroy those practices which regularly degrade those habits and make that character more depraved.
