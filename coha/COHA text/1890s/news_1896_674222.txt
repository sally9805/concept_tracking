txt The Roman Catholic priest who officiated on . Sunday at the funeral of the striker who was killed in the disorders of last week in Cleveland seized the occasion to deliver a wholesome lesson to the assembled multitude of laborers upon the rights of others . He told them plainly that the owner of capital had a right under the laws of State and Nation to manage his capital and to direct the conduct of the business in which if was employed . If he abused that right , the remedy was not in passion or violence , but in public sentiment and law . Still more pointedly the priest declared that those workmen who were . not " banded together " had their individual rights , which those whe administer the laws are bound to protect , and condemned the scenes which had been enacted during the week , one of the consequences of which was this funeral . The courageous words of truth uttered by this fearless preacher formed a wholesome offset to the overwrought sympathy for the striker who had met his death only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do work which he refused to do . Regardless of the cause of the Cleveland strike or the merits of the contest between the Brown Hoisting Works and their workmen , every law-abiding citizen , and especially every teacher of the moral duties of men , must condemn the violence and disorder that occurred , and sustain every effort to vindicate the law and public authority in protecting the peace of the community and the rights of the owner of capital and the owner of labor alike . Mgr . THORPE 'S bold and wholesome words are worthy of special recognition .
