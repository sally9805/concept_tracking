txt " Jesus Himself . " BY THE REV . ANDREW MURRAY . Author of " Abide in Christ . " FLEMING H. REVELL COMPANY . NEW YORK CHICAGO TORONTO . Publishers of Evangelical Literature . COPYRIGHT 1893 BY FLEMING H. REVELL COMPANY . PREFACE . The following brief messages comprise a revision of two addresses , which originally appeared in the South African Pioneer , the organ of the " Cape General Mission " ( Rev. Andrew Murray , Pres. ) , and are published by arrangement , the Mission participating in the proceeds . " Jesus Himself . " " Their eyes were opened , and they knew Him . " I The words , from which I want to present a simple message , will be found in the Gospel according to St. Luke , the 24th chapter and the 31st verse : " And their eyes were opened , and they knew Him . " Some time since , I preached a sermon with the words " Jesus Himself " as the text ; and as I went home I said to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Jesus Himself with us and never to know it , and how possible to preach of , and to listen to , all the truth about Jesus Himself and yet not to know Him . " I can not say what a deep impression was made upon me as I thought over it . Now these disciples had spent a most blessed time with Jesus , but if they had gone away before He revealed Himself that evening , they would never have been sure that it was Jesus , for their eyes were holden that they should not know Him . That is , alas , the condition of a great multitude in the Church of Christ . They know that Christ has risen from the dead . They believe , and they very often have blessed experiences that come from the risen Christ . Very often in a time of Convention , or in time of silent Bible reading , or in a time of the visitation of God 's grace , their hearts burn ; and yet it can be said of a people whose hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Jesus Himself . And now if you ask me what is to be the great blessing to be sought , my answer is this : Not only should we think about Jesus Himself and speak about Him and believe in Him , but we should come to the point that the disciples in the text arrived at , " and they knew Him . " Everything is to be found in that . If I read that story of the disciples on the way to Emmaus , I get from it four stages in the Christian life . Just think ! How did they begin the morning that day ? With Hearts sad and troubled , because they thought Jesus was dead . They did not know that He was alive , and that is the state of very many Christians . They look to the Cross , and they struggle to trust Christ , but they have never yet learned the blessedness of believing that there is a living Christ to do everything for them . Oh ! that word of the angel to the women ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the difference between a dead Christ , whom the women went to anoint , and a living Christ ? A dead Christ , I must do everything for ; a living Christ does everything for me . The disciples began the morning with a sad heart . I fancy very possibly they spent a sleepless night . Oh ! the terrible disappointment ! They had hoped that Christ would be the Deliverer of Israel , and they had seen Him die an accursed death . On the morning of that first day of the week , they rose with sad hearts  --  the bitter sadness can not be expressed . That is just the life of many Christians . They try to believe in Jesus and to trust Him , and to hope in Him , but there is no joy . Why ? Because they do not know that there is a living Christ to reveal Himself . Then there is the second stage . What is that ? The stage of which Christ speaks : " Slow of heart to believe . " They had the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them : " Certain women have astonished us , telling us they have seen an angel , who says He is alive . " And Christ replied to them : " Oh ! fools , and slow of heart to believe . " Yes ! there are many Christians to-day who have heard and who know that they must not only believe in a crucified Christ , but in a living Christ , and they try to grasp it and take it in , but it does not bring them a blessing , and why ? Because they want to feel it and not to believe it . They want to work for it , and with efforts get hold of it , instead of just quietly sinking down and believing , " Christ , the living Jesus , He will do everything for us . " That is the second stage . The first stage is that of ignorance , the second stage is that of unbelief  --  the doubting heart that can not take in the wonderful truth that Jesus lives . Then comes the third stage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after He had reproved them and said : " Oh ! fools , and slow of heart to believe , " He began to open the Scriptures to them , and to tell them of all the wonderful things the prophets had taught . Then their eyes were opened , and they began to understand the Scriptures . They saw that it was true that it was prophesied that Christ must rise . As He talked , there came out from Him  --  the living risen One  --  a mighty influence , and it rested upon them , and they began to feel their hearts burn within them with joy and gladness . You still say perhaps : " That is the stage we want to come to . " No ; God forbid you should stop there . You may get in that third stage  --  the burning heart  --  and yet something is still wanting  --  the revelation of Christ . The disciples had had a blessed experience of His divine powers , but He had not revealed Himself , and oh ! how often it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in blessed fellowship with God 's saints , our hearts burn within us . These are precious experiences of the working of God 's grace and Spirit , and yet there is something wanting . What is that ? Jesus Himself has been working upon us , and the power of his risen life has touched us , but we can not say , " I have met Him . He has made Himself known to me . " Oh , the difference between a burning heart , which becomes cold after a time , which comes by fits and starts , and the blessed revelation of Jesus Himself as my Saviour , taking charge of me and blessing me and keeping me every day ! This is the stage of The satisfied heart . Oh my brother , my sister ! It is what I ask for you , and it is what I am sure you ask for yourself . I ask it for myself . Lord Jesus ! may we know Thee in thy divine glory as the risen One , our Jesus , our Beloved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad ones who can not take this in , and who say , " I have never known the joy of religion yet "  --  listen , we are going to tell you how you can . All will center round this one thing , that just as a little child lives day by day in the arms of its mother , and grows up year by year under a mother 's eye , it is a possibility that you can live every day and hour of your life in fellowship with the Holy Jesus . He will do it for you . Come , and let your sad heart begin to hope . Will He reveal Himself ? He did it to the disciples and He will do it to you . Perhaps there are some who have got beyond the sad heart and who yet feel , " I have not got what I want . " If you throw open your heart and give up everything but just believing and allowing Him to do what He wants , it will come . God be praised ! it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the stage of the burning heart , and can tell of many blessed experiences , but somehow there is a worm at the root . The experiences do not last , and the heart is so changeable . Oh come , my beloved ! Follow Christ . Say , " Jesus , reveal Thyself that we may know Thee Thyself . We ask not only to drink of the living water , we want the fountain . We ask not only to bathe ourselves in the light , we want the Sun of Righteousness within our hearts . We ask not only to know Thee , who hast touched us and warmed our hearts and blessed us , but we want to know that we have the unchangeable Jesus dwelling within our hearts and abiding with us forevermore . " Now comes the question which I really wanted to put ,  --  What are the conditions under which our blessed Lord reveals Himself ? Or , put it this way ,  --  To whom is it that Jesus will reveal Himself ? We have only to see how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the answer ? First of all I think I find here that Christ revealed Himself to those disciples Who had given up everything for Him . He had said to them : " Forsake all and follow Me , " and they had done it . With all their feebleness and all their unfaithfulness they followed Christ to the end . He said to them : " Ye have continued with Me in My temptations , and I appoint you a kingdom , as I have received a kingdom from My Father . " They were not perfect men , but they would have died for Him . They loved Him , they obeyed Him , they followed Him . They had left all , and for three years they had been following hard after Christ . You say " Tell me what Christ wants of me , if I am to have his wonderful presence . Tell me what is the character of the man to whom Christ will reveal Himself in this highest and fullest way ? " I answer : " It is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If Christ is to give Himself wholly to me , He must know that He has me wholly for Himself ; and I trust God will give grace that these words spoken about the consecration and the surrender , not only of all evil , but of many lawful things , and even , if necessary , of life itself , may lead us to understand what the demand is that Jesus makes upon us . The motto of the Cape General Mission is , " God first . " In one sense that is a beautiful motto , and yet I am not always satisfied with it , because it is a motto that is often misunderstood . God first may mean " I " second , something else third , and something else fourth . God is thus first in order , but still God becomes one of a series of powers , and that is not the place God wants . The meaning of the words , " God first " is really " God all ; God everything ; " and that is what Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit to Christ to teach him what to say and what to do , is the first mark of the man to whom Christ will come . Are you not ready to take this step and say : " Jesus ! I do give up everything ; I have given up everything ; reveal Thyself . " Oh , brother ! oh , sister ! do not hesitate . Speak it out in your heart , and let this be the time in which a new sacrifice shall be laid at the feet of the blessed Lamb of God . There is a second thought . There is first the idea of having forsaken all to follow Him ; of having given up everything in obedience to Him , and living just a life of simple love and obedience . But there is a second thing needed in the man who is to have this full revelation of Christ . He must be Convicted of his unbelief . " Oh ! fools , and slow of heart to believe what the prophets have said . " Oh ! brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of unbelief in the hearts of God 's children , barring the door and closing the heart against Christ , how we should stand astonished and ashamed ! When there is not unbelief but where there is faith , Christ can not help coming in . He can not help coming where there is a living faith , a full faith . The heart is opened , the heart is prepared ; and as naturally as water runs into a hollow place , so naturally Christ must come into a heart that is full of faith . What is the hindrance with some earnest souls , who say : " I have given myself up to the Lord Jesus . I have done it often , and by His grace I am doing it every day , and God knows how earnestly and really I am doing it , and I have the sanction of God upon it , I know God has blessed me " ? They have not been convicted of their unbelief . " Oh ! fools , and slow of heart to believe . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother a fool ? Yet here the loving Son of God could find no other word to speak to His beloved disciples : " Oh ! fools , and slow of heart to believe . " You want the Lord Jesus to give you this full revelation of Himself ? Are you willing to acknowledge that you are a fool for never having believed in Him ? " Lord Jesus , it is my own fault . There Thou art , longing to have possession of me . There Thou hast been with Thy faithful promises waiting to reveal Thyself . " Did you ever hear of a man loving another and not longing to reveal himself ? Christ longs to reveal Himself , but He can not on account of our unbelief . May God convict us of our unbelief that we may get utterly ashamed and broken down , and cry , " Oh , my God , what is this , this heart of unbelief actually throwing a barrier across the door that Christ can not step in , blinding my eyes that I can not see Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for ten or twenty years , from time to time giving me the burning heart , enjoying the experience of a little of His love and grace , and yet I have not had the revelation of Him , taking possession of my heart and dwelling with me in unbroken continuity . " Oh ! may God convict us of unbelief . Do let us believe because all things are possible to him that believes . That is God 's word , and this blessing , receiving the revelation of Jesus , can come only to those who learn to believe and to trust him . There is another mark of those to whom this special revelation of Christ will come , and that is , They do not rest until they obtain it . You know the story . Their hearts were burning as they drew nigh to the place they were going to , and Christ made as if He were going farther . He put them to the test , and if they had allowed Him quietly to go on , if they had been content with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost something infinitely better . But they were not content with it . They were not content to go home to the disciples that night and say , " Oh , what a blessed afternoon we have had ! What wonderful teaching we have had ! " No ! The burning heart and the blessed experience just made them say , " Lord , abide with us , " and they compelled Him to come in . They constrained Him to come in . It always reminds me of the story of Jacob , " I will not let Thee go , except Thou bless me . " That is the spirit that prepares us for the revelation of Jesus . Oh ! my dear friend , has this been the spirit in which we have looked upon the wonderful blessing that we have sometimes heard of ? " Oh ! my Lord Jesus , though I do not understand it , though I can not grasp it , though my struggles avail nothing , I am not going to let Thee go . If it is possible for a sinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every moment in resurrection power dwelling in his heart , shining within him , filling him with love and joy ,  --  if that is possible , I want it . " Is that your language ? Oh ! come then and say : " Lord Jesus , I can not let Thee go except Thou bless me . " The question is asked so often : " What is the cause of the feeble life of so many Christians ? " What is really the matter ? What is actually the want ? How little the Church responds to Christ 's call ! how little the Church is what Christ would have her to be ! What is the cause of all the trouble ? Various answers may be given , but there is one answer which includes all the other answers , and that is , each believer wants the personal Full revelation of a personal Christ as an indwelling Lord , as a satisfying portion . When the Lord Jesus was here upon earth , what was it that distinguished His disciples from other people ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes , and He gathered them about Himself , and they knew Jesus . He was their Master , and guarded them , and they followed Him . And what is to make a difference between Christ 's disciples  --  not those who are just hoping to get to heaven , but Christ 's whole-hearted disciples  --  what is to make a difference between them and other people ? It is this , to be in fellowship with Jesus  --  every hour of the day ; and just as Christ upon earth was able to keep those people with Him for three years , day by day , so Christ is able in heaven now to do what He could not do when He was on earth  --  to keep in the closest fellowship with every believer throughout the whole world . Glory be to God ! You know that text in Ephesians : " He that descended is the same also that ascended , that He might fill all things . " Why was my Lord Jesus taken up to heaven away from the life of earth ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the life in heaven is a life in which there is no limit and no bound and no locality , and Christ was taken up to heaven , that , in the power of God , of the omnipresent God , He might be able to fill every individual here and be with every individual believer . That is what my heart wants to realize by faith ; that is a possibility , that is a promise , that is my birthright , and I want to have it , and I want by the grace of God to say , " Jesus , I will not rest until Thou hast revealed Thyself fully to my soul . " There are often very blessed experiences in the Christian life in what I call the third stage  --  the stage of the burning heart . Do you know what another great mark of that stage is ? Delight in God 's word . How did the disciples get their burning hearts ? By that strange opening of the Scripture to them . He made it all look different ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen before . They could not help feeling , How wonderful , how heavenly was that teaching . Oh ! there are many Christians who find the best time of the day is the time when they can get with their Bibles , and who love nothing so much as to get a new thought ; and as a diamond digger rejoices when he has found a diamond , or a gold digger when he has found a nugget , they delight when they get from the Bible some new thought , and they feed upon it . Yet with all that interest in God 's word , and with all that stirring of the heart with joy , when they go into business or attend to their daily duties , there is still something wanting . We must come away from all the manifold and multifarious blessings that Jesus can bestow from time to time , to the blessed unity of that one  --  that Jesus makes Himself known , Jesus Himself is willing to make Himself known . Oh ! if I were to ask , " Is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of us have been longing for ? " I am sure you would answer , " That is what I want . " Think what the blessedness will be that comes from it . You often sing :  --  " Oh ! the peace my Saviour gives ! Peace I never knew before , And my way has brighter grown , Since I 've learnt to trust Him more . " I recently had a letter from some one in the Free State saying what a wonderful comfort and strength that little verse was in the midst of difficulties and troubles . Yes ; but how can that peace be kept ? It was the presence of Christ that brought the peace . When the storm was threatening to swallow up the disciples , it was the presence of Christ Himself that gave the peace . Oh ! Christian , do you want peace and rest ? You must have Jesus Himself . You talk of purity , you talk of cleansing , you talk of deliverance from sin . Praise God , here is the deliverance and the cleansing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we have this resurrection of Christ , this heavenly Christ upon the throne , making Himself known to us . Surely that will be the secret of purity and the secret of strength . Where does the strength of so many come from ? From the joy of a personal friendship with Jesus . Those disciples , if they had gone away with their burning hearts to the other disciples , could have told them wonderful things of a man who had explained to them the Scriptures and the promises , but they could not have said , " We have seen Jesus . " They might have said , " Jesus is alive . We are sure of that , " but that would not have satisfied the others . But they could now go and say , " We have seen Himself . He has revealed Himself to us . " We are all glad to work for Christ , but there is a complaint throughout the Church of Christ , from the ministers in the pulpit down to the feeblest worker , of lack of joy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether this is not the place where the secret will be discovered  --  that the Lord Jesus comes and shows Himself to us as our Master and speaks to us . When we have Jesus with us , and when we go every footstep with the thought that it is Jesus wants us to go , it is Jesus who sends us and is helping us , then there will be brightness in our testimony , and it will help other believers , and they will begin to understand ; " I see why I have failed . I took the word , I took the blessing , and I took , as I thought , the life , but I was without the living Jesus . " And if you now ask , " How will this revelation come ? " Brother , sister , that is the secret that no man may tell , that Jesus keeps to Himself . It is In the power of the Holy Ghost ; Christ , the risen One , entered into a new life . His resurrection life is entirely different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : " They knew Him . " He revealed Himself , and then He passed away . And was that vision of Christ worth so much ? It was lost in a moment . It was worth heaven , eternity , everything . Why ? Because henceforth Christ was no longer to be known after the flesh . Christ was henceforth in the power of the Spirit , which fills Heaven ; in the power of the Spirit which is the power of the Godhead ; in the power of the Spirit , which fills our hearts . Christ was henceforth to live in the life of Heaven . Thank God , Christ can by the power of the Holy Ghost reveal Himself to each one of us ; but oh ! brother , it is a secret thing between Christ and yourself . Take this assurance , " Their eyes were opened and they knew Him , " and believe that it is written for you . You say , " I have known the other three stages ; the stage of the sad heart , mourning that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slow heart to believe , when I struggled with my unbelief ; and I know the stage of the burning heart , when there are great times of joy and blessedness . " You say that ? Oh come then and know the fourth stage of The satisfied heart , of the heart made glad for eternity , of the heart that can not keep its joy in , but goes away back to Jerusalem , and says , " It is true . Jesus has revealed Himself . I know it , I feel it . " Oh ! brother , oh ! sister , how will this revelation come ? Jesus will tell you . Just come to the Lord Jesus and breathe up before Him a simple child-like prayer , and I , His servant , will come and take you by the hand and say : " Come , now , my work is done . I have pointed to the Lamb of God , to the risen One . My work is done . " Let us enter into the Holy Presence and begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to plead : " Oh ! Saviour , that I might have this blessedness every moment present with me  --  Jesus Himself , my portion forever . " " Jesus Himself . " " Lo , I am with you alway . " II When I think of all the struggles and difficulties and failures of which many complain , and know that many are trying to make a new effort to begin a holy life , their hearts fearing all the time that they would fail again , owing to so many difficulties and temptations and the natural weakness of their character , my heart longs to be able to tell them in words so simple that a little child could understand , What the secret is of the Christian life . And then the thought comes to me , Can I venture to hope that it will be given to me to take that glorious , heavenly , divine Lord Jesus and to show Him to these souls , so that they can see Him in His glory ? And can it be given to me to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almighty Christ , who does actually come into the heart and who faithfully promises , " I will come and dwell with you , and I will never leave you ? " No ; my words can not do that . But then I thought , my Lord Jesus can use me as a simple servant to take such feeble ones by the hand and encourage and help them ; to say , Oh , come , come , come , into the presence of Jesus and wait on Him , and He will reveal Himself to thee . I pray God that He may use His precious Word . It is simply The presence of the Lord Jesus . That is the secret of the Christian 's strength and joy . You know that when He was upon earth , He was present in bodily form with his disciples . They walked about together all day , and at night they went into the same house , and sometimes slept together and ate and drank together . They were continually together . It was the presence of Jesus that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Him by that wonderful intercourse of love during three long years , and in that intercourse they learned to know Christ , and Christ instructed and corrected them , and prepared them for what they were afterward to receive . And now when He is going away , He says to them : " Lo , behold , I am with you always  --  all the days  --  even unto the end of the world . " What a promise ! And just as really as Christ was with Peter in the boat , just as Christ sat with John at the table , as really can I have Christ with me . And more really , for they had their Christ in the body and He was to them a man , an individual separate from them , but I may have glorified Christ in the power of the throne of God , the omnipotent Christ , the omnipresent Christ . What a promise ! You ask me , How can that be ? And my answer is , Because Christ is God , and because Christ after having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Life of God . And now that blessed Christ Jesus , with His loving , pierced heart ; that blessed Jesus Christ , who lived upon earth ; that same Christ glorified into the glory of God , can be in me and Can be with me all the days . You say , Is it really possible for a man in business , for a woman in the midst of a large and difficult household , for a poor man full of care ; is it possible ? Can I always be thinking of Jesus ? Thank God , you need not always be thinking of Him . You may be the manager of a bank , and your whole attention may be required to carry out the business that you have to do . But thank God , while I have to think of my business , Jesus will think of me , and He will come in and will take charge of me . That little child , three months old , as it sleeps in its mother 's arms , lies helplessly there ; it hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the mother thinks of the child . And this is the blessed mystery of love , that Jesus the God-man waits to come in to me in the greatness of His love ; and as He gets possession of my heart , He embraces me in those divine arms and tells me , " My child , I the Faithful One , I the Mighty One will abide with thee , will watch over thee and keep thee all the days . " He tells me He will come into my heart , so that I can be a happy Christian , a holy Christian , and a useful Christian . You say , Oh ! if I could only believe that , if I could think that it is possible to have Christ always , every hour , every moment with me , Taking and keeping charge of me ! My brother , my sister , it is just literally this that is my message to you . When Jesus said to His disciples , " Lo , I am with you always , " He meant it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullness of the divine love , and he longs to-night to reveal Himself to you and to me as we have never seen Him before . And now just think a moment what a blessed life that must be  --  the presence of Jesus always abiding . Is not that the secret of peace and happiness ? If I could just attain ( that is what each heart says ) to that blessed state in which every day and all the day I felt Jesus to be watching and ever keeping me , oh , what peace I would have in the thought , " I have no care if He cares for me , and I have no fear if He provides for me . " Your heart says that this is too good to be true , and that it is too glorious to be for you . Still you acknowledge it must be most blessed . Fearful one , erring one , anxious one , I bring you God 's promise , it is for me and for you . Jesus will do it ; as God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Crucified One to keep you in perfect peace . This is a wonderful fact , and it is the secret of joy unspeakable . And this is also The secret of Holiness . Instead of indwelling sin , an indwelling Christ conquering it ; instead of indwelling sin , the indwelling life and light and love of the blessed Son of God . He is the secret of holiness . " Christ is made unto us sanctification . " Remember that it is Christ Himself who is made unto us sanctification . Christ coming into me , taking charge of my whole being ; my nature and my thoughts and my affections and my will ; ruling all things . It is this that will make me holy . We talk about holiness , but do you know what holiness is ? You have as much holiness as you have of Christ , for it is written , " Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one ; " and Christ sanctifies by bringing God 's life into me . We read in Judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you know that there is in the New Testament an equally wonderful text , where we read , " Put on the Lord Jesus Christ , " that is , clothe yourself with Christ Jesus . And what does that mean ? It does not only mean , by imputation of righteousness outside of me , but to clothe myself with the living character of the living Christ , with the living love of the living Christ . Put on the Lord Jesus . Oh ! what a work . I can not do it unless I believe and understand that He whom I have to put on is as a garment covering my whole being . I have to put on a living Christ who has said , " Lo , I am with you all the days . " Just draw the folds closer round you , of that robe of light with which Christ would array you . Just come and acknowledge that Christ is with you , on you , in you . Oh , put Him on ! And when you look at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's word , " Let this mind be in you which was also in Jesus Christ , " and it tells you He was obedient unto the death ; and then you answer , Christ the obedient one , Christ whose whole life was obedience , it is that Christ whom I have received and put on . He becomes my life and His obedience rests upon me , until I learn to whisper as Jesus did , " My Father , Thy will be done ; lo , I come to do Thy will . " This , too , is the secret of influence in witness and work . How comes it that it is so Difficult to be obedient , and how comes it that I so often sin ? People sing , " Oh , to be wholly Thine , " and sing it from their hearts . How comes it then that they are disobedient again ? Where does the disobedience come from ? And the answer comes , It is because I am trying to obey a distant Christ , and thus His commands do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's Word . When God wanted to send any man upon His service , He first met him and talked with him and cheered him time after time . God appeared to Abraham seven or eight times , and gave to him one command after another ; and so Abraham learned to obey Him perfectly . God appeared to Joshua and to Gideon , and they obeyed . And why are we not obedient ? Because we have so little of this near intercourse with Jesus . But , oh , if we knew This blessed , heavenly secret of having the presence of Christ with us every day , every hour , every minute , what a joy it would be to obey ! We could not walk in this consciousness ,  --  My Lord Jesus is with me and around me ,  --  and not obey Him ! Oh , do you not begin to long and say , This is what I must have , the ever-abiding presence of Jesus ! There are some Christians who try not to be disobedient , who come to their Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a blessing , and they complain of so little blessing and power , so little power ! And why ? Because there is not enough of the living Jesus in their hearts . I sometimes think of this as a most solemn truth . There is a great diversity of gifts amongst ministers and others who speak ; but I am sure of this , that a man 's gifts are not the measure of his real power . I am sure of this , that God can see what neither you nor I can see . Sometimes people feel something of it ; but in proportion as a man has in reality , not as a sentiment or an aspiration , or a thought , but in reality , the very spirit and presence of Jesus upon him , there comes out from him an unseen silent influence . That secret influence is the Holy presence of Jesus . " Lo , I am with you always . " And now , if what I have said has sufficed just to indicate what a desirable thing it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then let me now give you an answer to the question that arises in more than one heart . I can hear some one say , " Tell me how I can get this blessed abiding presence of Jesus ; and when I have got it , how I can ever keep it . I think if I have this , I have all . The Lord Jesus has come very near to me . I have tried to turn away from everything that can hinder , and have had my Lord very near . But how can I know that He will be with me always ? " If you were to ask the Lord , " Oh , my blessed Lord Christ , what must I do , how can I enjoy Thy never-failing presence ? " His first answer would be , " Only believe . I have said it often , and you only partly understood it , but I will say it again  --  My child , only believe . " It is by faith . We sometimes speak of faith as trust , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trust : but when people say , as they sometimes do , that it is nothing else but trust , that is not the case . It is a far wider word than trust . It is by faith that I learn to know the invisible One , the invisible God , and that I see Him . Faith is my spiritual eye-sight for the unseen and heavenly . You often try hard to trust God , and you fail . Why ? Because you have not taken time first to see God . How can you trust God fully until you have met Him and known Him ? You ask , " Where ought I to begin ? " You ought to begin with first believing ; with presenting yourself before this God in the attitude of silent worship , and asking Him to let a sense of His greatness and His presence come upon you . You must ask Him to let your heart be covered over with his holy presence . You must seek to realize in your heart the presence of an Almighty and all-loving God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him as the omnipotent God , to feel that the very power that created the world , the very power that raised Jesus from the dead , is at this moment working in your heart . We do not experience it because we do not believe . We must take time to believe . Jesus says , " Oh , my child , shut your eyes to the world , and shut out of your heart all these thoughts about religion , and begin to believe in God Himself . " That is the first article of the Creed  --  " I believe in God . " By believing I open my heart , to receive this glorious God , and I bow and worship . And then as I believe this , I look up and I see the Lamb upon the Throne , and I believe that the Almighty power of God is in Jesus for the very purpose of revealing His presence to my heart . Why are there two upon the Throne ? Is not God enough ? The Lamb of God is upon the Throne in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throne is Christ Himself , with power as God to take possession of me . Oh , do not think you can not get that realization . And do not think of it as now only within your reach ; but cultivate the habit of faith . " Jesus , I believe in Thy glory ; I believe in Thine omnipotence ; I believe in Thy power working within me . I believe in Thy living , loving presence with me , revealing itself in Divine power . " Do not be occupied with feelings or experiences . You will find it far simpler and easier just to trust and say , " I am sure He is all for me . " Get rid of yourself for the time ; do n't think or speak about yourself ; but Think what Jesus is . And then remember it is believe always . I sometimes feel that I can not find words to tell how God wants His people to believe from morning till night . Every breath ought to be just believing . Yes , it is indeed true ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to evening , and you must begin to make that the chief thing in life . In the morning when you wake , let your heart go forth with a large faith in this ; and in the watches of the night let this thought be present with you  --  my Saviour Jesus is round me and near me , and you can look up and say , " I want to trust Thee always . " You know what trust is . It is so sweet to trust . And now can not you trust Jesus ; this presence , this keeping presence ? He lives for you in Heaven . You are marked with His blood , and he loves you ; and can not you say , " My King , my King , He is with me all the days ? " Oh , trust Jesus to fulfill His own promises . There is a second answer that I think Christ would give if we come to Him believing , and say , " Is there anything more , my blessed Master ? " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always obey . " Do not fail to understand the lesson contained in this one word . You must distinctly and definitely take that word OBEY and obedience , and learn to say for yourselves : " Now I have to obey , and by the grace of God I am going to obey in everything . " At our recent exhibition at the Cape , Mr. Rhodes , our Prime Minister , went to the gate , thinking he had got the fee in his pocket . When he got to the gate , however , he found he had not enough money , and said to the door-keeper , " I am Mr. Rhodes ; let me in and I will take care you do not suffer . " But the man said , " I can not help that , sir , I have my orders , " and he refused to let Mr. Rhodes in . He had to borrow from a friend , and pay before he could pass the gate . At a dinner afterward Mr. Rhodes spoke about it , and said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order like that . That is it . The man had his orders , and that was enough to him , and whoever came to the gate had to pay his fee before he could enter . God 's children ought to be like soldiers , and be Ready to say , " I must obey . " Oh ! to have that thought in our hearts  --  " Jesus , I love to obey Thee . " There must be personal intercourse with the Saviour , and then comes the joy of personal service and allegiance . Are you ready to obey in all feebleness and weakness and fear ? Can you say , " Yes , Lord Jesus , I will obey ? " If so , then give yourself up absolutely . Then your feeling will be , " I am not going to speak one word if I think that Jesus would not like to hear it . I am not going to have an opinion of my own , but my whole life is to be covered with the purity of His obedience to the Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have my whole life , my whole heart , my whole character . I want to be like Christ and to obey . " Give yourself up to this loving obedience . The third thought is this : If I say , " My Master , blessed Saviour , tell me all , I will believe , I do obey , and I will obey . Is there anything more I need to secure the enjoyment of Thine abiding presence ? " And I catch this answer : " My child , close intercourse with me every day . " Ah , there is the fault of many who try to obey and try to believe ; they do it in their own strength , and they do not know that if the Lord Jesus is to reign in their hearts , they must have close communion with Him every day . You can not do all He desires , but Jesus will do it for you . There are many Christians who fail here , and on that account do not understand what it is to have fellowship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : God has given you a loving , living Saviour , and how can He bless if you do not meet Him ? The joy of friendship is found in intercourse ; and Jesus asks for this every day , that he may have time to influence me , to tell me of Himself , to teach me , to breathe His Spirit unto me , to give me new life and joy and strength . And remember , intercourse with Jesus Does not mean half-an-hour or an hour in your closet . A man may study his Bible or his commentary carefully ; he may look up all the parallel passages in the chapter ; when he comes out of his closet he may be able to tell you all about it , and yet he has never met Jesus that morning at all . You have prayed for five or ten minutes , and you have never met Jesus . And so we must remember that though the Bible is most precious , and the reading of it most blessed and needful ; yet prayer and Bible reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning is to meet Jesus , and to say , " Lord , here is the day again , and I am just as weak in myself as ever I was ; do Thou come and feed me this morning with Thyself and speak to my soul . " Oh , friends , it is not your faith that will keep you standing , but it is a living Jesus , met Every day in fellowship and worship and love . Wait in His presence , however cold and faithless you feel . Wait before Him and say : " Lord , helpless as I am , I believe and rest in the blessed assurance that what Thou hast promised Thou wilt do for me . " I ask my Master once again , " Lord Jesus , is that all ? " And his answer is : " No , my child ; I have one thing more . " " And what is that ? Thou hast told me to believe , and to obey , and to abide near to Thee : what wouldst Thou have more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have redeemed thee for My service ; I have redeemed thee to have a witness to go out into the world confessing Me before men . " Oh , do not hide your treasure , or think that if Jesus is with you , you can hide it . One of two things will happen  --  either you must give all up , or it must come out . You have perhaps heard of the little girl , who , after one of Mr. Moody 's meetings , was found to be singing some of the hymns we all know . The child 's parents were in a good position in society , and while singing those hymns in the drawing-room her mother forbade her . One day she was singing the hymn " Oh , I 'm so glad that Jesus loves me , " when her mother said , " My child , how is it that you sing this when I have forbidden it ? " She replied , " Oh , mother , I can not help it ; it comes out of itself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out . Remember , it is not only our duty to confess Him ; it is that , but it is something more . If you do not do it , it is just an indication that you have not given yourself up to Jesus ; your character , your reputation , your all . You are holding back from Him . You must confess Jesus in the world , in your home ; and in fact everywhere . You know the Lord 's command , " Go ye into all the world , and preach the Gospel to every creature ; " " and , lo , I am with you , " meaning , " Any one may work for Me , and I will be with him . " It is true of the minister , the missionary , and every believer who works for Jesus . The presence of Jesus is intimately connected with work for Him . You say , " I have never thought of that before . I have my Sunday work , but during the week I am not doing work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , and let this continue to be the case . I do not believe you could have the presence of Jesus all the week and yet do nothing for Him ; therefore my advice is , work for Him who is worthy , His blessing and His presence will be found in the work . It is A blessed privilege to work for Christ in this perishing world . Oh , why is it that our hearts often feel so cold and closed up , and so many of us say , " I do not feel called to Christ 's work " ? Be willing to yield yourself for the Lord 's service , and He will reveal Himself to you . Christ comes with His wondrous promise , and what He says , He says to all believers : " Lo , I am with you always ; that is My promise ; this is what I in My power can do ; this is what I faithfully engage to perform ; will you have it ? I give Myself to thee , O soul . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I give Myself to thee , to be absolutely and wholly thine every hour of every day ; to be with thee and in thee every moment , to bless thee and sustain thee , and to give thee each moment the consciousness of My presence ; I will be wholly , wholly , wholly thine . " And now , what is the other side ? He wants me to be wholly His . Are you ready to take this as your motto now , " Wholly for God " ? O God , breathe Thou Thy presence in my heart that Thou mayest shine forth from my life . " Wholly for God , " let this be our motto . Come let us cast ourselves on our faces before His feet . Our missionary from Nyassaland says he has often been touched by seeing how the native Christians , when they are brought to Jesus , do not stand in prayer ; they do not kneel ; but they cast themselves upon the earth with their foreheads to the ground , and there they lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes feel that I wish we could do that ourselves ; but we need not do it literally . Let us do it in spirit , for the everlasting Son of God has come into our hearts . Are you going to take Him and to keep Him there , to give Him glory and let Him have His way ? Come now and say , " I will seek Thee with my whole heart ; I am wholly Thine . " Yield yourself entirely to Him to have complete possession . He will take and keep possession . Come now . Jesus delights in the worship of His Saints . Our whole life can become one continuous act of worship and work of love and joy , if we only remember and value this , that Jesus has said , " Lo , I am with you all the days , even unto the end of the world . "
