txt George M. Bradley , who was the first patient in this country to receive the lymph inoculation , died to-day , and the son of Prof. Blake , another lymph patient , who has been under treatment for nearly two months , is at the point of death , Bradley was a man but little over thirty years of age and was not in an advanced stage of consumption when he began receiving treatment . Previously he Was not confined to the house , but during his treatment he has been . During the past few weeks he suffered intensely , as the treatment had a distressing effect upon his throat , making it difficult and extremely painful for him to take any nourishment . His physicians state that his death was undoubtedly hastened by the condition of his throat , as his strength disappeared very fast because of his Inability to take food . He had been receiving injections since early in De . cewber . Prof. R. H. Chittenden of Yale University , who received the first supply of lymph from Dr. Koch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Bradley : " I can not see how Bradley 's death can have any effect upon the value or use of lymph . It is , perhape , natural that the public will at first look upon it as showing the failure of the lymph , but among doctors and people who will consider it intelligently I can not see how it can have any effect . The case was a particularly bad one for the use of the ' lymph . One of the man 's lungs was nearly gone and the other was in bad condition . He was also suffering from laryngitis , and it was for this that the lymph was especially used . The lymph did a great deal of good for this trouble . A. man with Bradley 's trouble would probably have died of strangulation . It is possible that the lymph had some remote effect upon the lungs . but I do n't think that It hastened his death . The amount of lymph used all told was very smalL "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
