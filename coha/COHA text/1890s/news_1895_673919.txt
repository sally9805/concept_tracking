txt There are hundreds of saloons in this city that are within 200 feet of a school or a church , and it has been , perhaps , the general impression than in every such instance a plain provision of the law was violated . That such is not the case is made painfully plain by a decision rendered yesterday by the General Term of the Superior Court , ordering a mandamus to issue compelling the Excise Board to renew the license of one Cairns , whose saloon is only eighty feet from St. Agnes 's School . The court holds that the statute does not apply to places that were in existence at the time of its passage , in 1892 , and that the board 's refusal to renew this particular license was illegal . The law is somewhat obscure , but its wording seems to sustain the present interpretation . That being the case , an amendment of the law is evidently needed . Whatever may have been the intention of the Legislature , there is no doubt that public sentiment is agp.inst the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is offensive for a score of reasons . In a more superstitious age than this , the Defender 's refusal to enter the element in. which she is expected to win so much glory for herself , her owners , and the country in general would have been considered a most unlucky omen . Even now , the accident is not quite without significance . To assert that some one has been careless would probably be unjust , but that some one has been something that does not promise well for victory is too obvious to be denied . The date of the great races is so . near that there is no time to be wasted if the yacht is to be hi perfect condition when the day of trial comes . There will , therefore , be a shade of impatience in the commiseration which the boat 's builders and owners receive on account of their misfortune . We have made earnest but unsuccessful efforts to imagine what President Eliot meant by telling the educators assembled at Albany that arithmetic is the most useless thing that children study in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is astounding , but neither is it true for that reason , and probably it will take a vast amount of argument to convince the general public that arithmetic is either relatiNely or intrinsically useless . Some of the figures of the Kentucky Democratic State Convention are worthy to be borne in mind by those who are distressed because the outcome promises to be a united vote by the sound-money and silver Democrats . The platform reaffirming the National platform of 1892 and the National Administration was adopted by a vote of 647 to 233 . Hardin , the candidate for Governor , was nominated by a vote of 40S1 to 4091/4 for three other candidates . Civil administration of the National Weather Bureau has been cheaper than military administration . The expenditures for four years under civilian control and direction . were about $3,400,000 , for which appropriations of $3,032,953 were made . Out of $878,439 appropriated for the present Year , only $835,000 was expended , leaving a surplus of about $43,000 . The comparison in favor of civilian control is striking . The average cost per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for four Years of civil management the average was $849,523.
