txt The excitement and interest at Military Department Headquarters here over the Garza revolutionary movement have been revived by the ambushing of a scouting party of the United States troops by the revolutionists near the Soledao Ranch , Duval County , which resulted in the killing of Rufus Glover , formerly Clerk of that county and a very prominent man on the frontier . Orders were issued to-day by Gen. David S. Stanley , commander of the Military Department , for the other troops in the field along the lower part of the Rio Grande border to at once concentrate their forces in the section where the recent conflict occurred . The following dispatch was received by Gen. Stanley to-day from ; Capt . W. 13 . ? Wheeler of Troop E , Eighteenth Infantry , who is in temporary command at Fort Ringgold : " As both cavalry troops from here were in the other direction from the place where the conflict occurred . I went to the camp of Capt . Francis H. Hardie and turned what information I had received concerning the late outbreak over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George ' Hunter ' a camp . " A dispatch was also received from Major Louis -T . Morris , in command at Fort . It reads : " I have just received a telegram from Capt . George F. Chase , who Is at Benevides . He Bays : ? remains of Rufus Glover , the scout , have been found . He was shot in the back from ambush . It is clearly a case of foul murder . I have not reached Soledao Ranch , but will be there at 2 o'clock this afternoon . I win then see what can be done about this trouble . There was a pile of cartridges behind the rooks near which . Glover was killed . They tell the story of ambush . Our scouts returned the sire , but the revolutionists lied . One of Garza 's men is reported killed . I am writing this dispatch while riding On the wagon which contains the dead body of poor Glover . ' " Gen. Stanley Said to-day that the Garza followers , who have their rendezvous in the section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . " I have , " said he , " a reliable list of the names of the revolutionists , which shows that there are eighty murderers among them , persons who had committed bloody crimes in Mexico and found refuge on this side of the border . It is no wonder with such a band of cutthroats that troops are ambushed and foully murdered . " In a letter to a newspaper here Jos() Valonoio , one of the most prominent citizens of Mier , Mexico , makes sensational charges against the United States troops and other officers on the border . Valenoio was a former citizen of Rio Grande City , Texas . It is not likely that he will remain long in Mexico it the Government of that country learns that he entertains touch sentiments as are contained in his letter , which is as follows : " For the interest that you might have , as the good name of this country is involved , and also the tranquillity of the inhabitants of this section on the American side , where I have resided , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take the liberty to address you the present letter , giving you some information as to the actual situation , as the outcome of the revolutionary movement of Catsrine Garza . I refer to the American side . The troops and several officials are committing acts that lower the dignity Of the United States Government , a country in who liberal institutions are fostered . In several scouting expeditions they went to the ranches in a hostile attitude , frightening the families , and they go so far as to open the trunks of the families without any regard whatever . " They arrest parties merely because they have been Catarina Garza 's followers , and , in short , they are acting as if military rule was established on the frontier . They allow armed and mounted men from the Mexican side , who come as spies or guides . The inhabitants are afraid to complain . At the Grange Ranch , forty-two miles from Rio Grande City , the troops arrested the owner of the place , Ignacio Itaimrez , simply because some of Garza 's followers visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was almost deprived of conversing with any one . They arrested some other peaceable citizens . " It a reliable person was sent to make investigations in places ? Where the troops and rangers and civil officers have been , he would find out the injuries caused by them . It has been very seldom that they have conducted themselves prudently . " Col. Hernandez was not ? the commander Of of the garrison at this place when Catarino Garza attempted to take it . The military commander then and now is Gen. Lorenzo Garcia , chief of the troops in the field from Nueva Laredo . to C 001 . Hernandez was detailed with part of-hd the Fifth Auxiliaries , in Los Gurros , where he recalved orders to go in pursuit of Garza. and left very hurriedly . When he arrived where the revolutionists were , the horses were very tired , and ' he was Obliged to force his men of the Sixth and Tenth Cavalry and Runde of Nuevo Laredo to fight the enemy , they having already turned their backs to fly . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their acts in several places on the frontier , and from this circumstance has originated the hostility toward this officer .
