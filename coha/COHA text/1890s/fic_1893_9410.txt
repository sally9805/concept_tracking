Main text I. Mr. and Mrs. Willis Campbell . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Now this , I think , is the most exciting part of the whole affair , and the pleasantest . She is seated at breakfast in her cottage at Summering-by-the-Sea . A heap of letters of various stylish shapes , colors , and superscriptions lies beside her plate , and irregularly straggles about among the coffee-service . Vis -- vis with her sits Mr. Campbell behind a newspaper . How prompt they are ! Why , I did n't expect to get half so many answers yet . But that shows that where people have nothing to do but attend to their social duties they are always prompt  --  even the men ; women , of course , reply early anyway , and you do n't really care for them ; but in town the men seem to put it off till the very last moment , and then some of them call when it 's over to excuse themselves for not having come after accepting . It really makes you wish for a leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American life that make our men seem wanting in the convenances ; and if they had the time , with their instinctive delicacy , they would be perfect : it would come from the heart : they 're more truly polite now . Willis , just look at this ! Campbell , Campbell , Look at what ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : These replies . Why , I do believe that more than half the people have answered already , and the invitations only went out yesterday . That comes from putting on R. S. V. P. I knew I was right , and I shall always do it , I do n't care what you say . Campbell : Campbell : You did n't put on R. S. V. P. after all I said ? He looks round the edge of his paper at her . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Yes , I did . The idea of your setting up for an authority in such a thing as that ! Campbell : Campbell : Then I 'm sorry I did n't ask you to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they 'll come to a garden-party from four till seven or not . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : A shame ? How can you provide if you do n't know how many are coming ? I should like to know that . But of course I could n't expect you to give in gracefully . Campbell : Campbell : I should give in gracefully if I gave in at all , but I do n't . He throws his paper down beside his chair . Here , hand over the letters , and I 'll be opening them for you while you pour out the coffee . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Indeed you wo n't ! Campbell : Campbell : Well , pour out the coffee , then , anyway . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , No , I shall not do it . I 'm going to open them every one before you get a drop of coffee  --  just to punish you . Campbell : Campbell : To punish me ? For what ? Mrs. Campbell hesitates , as if at a loss what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Yes I do : for saying I ought n't to have put on R. S. V. P. Do you take it back ? Campbell : Campbell : How can I till I 've had some coffee ? My mind wo n't work on an empty stomach . Well  --  He rises and goes round the table towards her . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Willis , if you dare to touch them , I 'll ring for Jane , and then she 'll see you cutting up . Campbell : Campbell : Touch what ? I 'm coming to get some coffee . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Well , I 'll give you some coffee ; but do n't you touch a single one of those letters  --  after what you 've said . Campbell : Campbell : All right ! He extends one hand for the coffee , and with the other sweeps all the letters together , and starts back to his place . As she flies upon him , Look out , Amy ; you 'll make me spill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Campbell , Oh , Willis , how can you be so base ? Give me my letters . Do ! Campbell , Campbell , You may have half . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : No ; I shall have all . I insist upon it . Campbell : Campbell : Well , then , you may have all the ladies ' letters . There are twice as many of them . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : No ; I shall have the men 's too . Give me the men 's first . Campbell : Campbell : How can I tell which are the men 's without opening them ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : How could you tell which were the ladies ' ? Come , now , Willis , do n't tease me any longer . You know I hate it . Campbell , Campbell , I want to see if I can guess who wrote them . Do n't you like to guess who wrote your letters before you open them ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , I do n't like to guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table-cloth with a menace of tears , and Campbell instantly returns all the notes . Campbell : Campbell : There , Amy ; you may have them . I do n't care who wrote them , nor what 's in them . And I do n't want you to interrupt me with any exclamations over them , if you please . He reaches to the floor for his newspaper , and while he sips his coffee , Mrs. Campbell loses no time in opening her letters . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : I shall do nothing but exclaim . The Curwens accept , of course  --  the very first letter . That means Mrs. Curwen ; that is one , at any rate . The New York Addingses do , and the Philadelphia Addingses do n't ; I hardly expected they would , so soon after their aunt 's death , but I thought I ought to ask them . Mr. and Mrs. Roberts , naturally ; it was more a joke than anything , sending their invitation . Mrs. and the Misses Carver regret very much ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very happy , and so am I ; he does n't go everywhere , and he 's awfully nice . Mr. and Mrs. Lou Bemis are very happy too , and Dr. Lawton is very happy . Mrs. Bridges Dear Mrs. Campbells me , and is very sorry in the first person ; she 's always nice . Mr. Phillips , Mr. Rangeley , Mr. Small , Mr. Peters , Mr. Staples , Mr. Thornton , all accept , and they 're all charming young fellows . Campbell , Campbell , Well , what of that ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Do n't eavesdrop , please ; I was n't talking to you . The Merrills have the pleasure , and the Morgans are sorrow-stricken ; the  --  Campbell : Campbell : Yes , but why should you care whether those fellows are charming or not ? Who 's going to marry them ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : I am . Mrs. Stevenson is bowed to the earth ; Colonel Murphree is overjoyed ; the Misses Ja  --  Campbell , Campbell , Look here , Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ewe-lamb of a foible ? You think too much of young men . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Younger men , you mean . And you have a multitude of perfectly mammoth peccadilloes . You interrupt . She goes on opening and reading her letters . Well , I did n't expect the Macklines could ; but everybody seems to be coming . Campbell : Campbell : You pay them too much attention altogether . It spoils them ; and one of these days you 'll be getting some of them in love with you , and then what will you do ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , What are you talking about ? I 'd refer them to you , and you could kill them . I suppose you killed lots of people in California . That 's what you always gave me to understand . She goes on with her letters . Campbell : Campbell : I never killed a single human being that I can remember ; but there 's no telling what I might do if I were provoked . Now , there 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time ; and he 's got a way lately of coming in through the window from the piazza that 's very intimate . He 's a nice fellow enough , and sweet , as you say . I suppose he has talent too , but I never heard that he had set any of the adjacent water-courses on fire ; and I do n't know that he could give the Apollo Belvedere many points in beauty and beat him . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : I do . Mrs. and Miss Rice accept , and her friend Miss Greenway , who 's staying with her , and  --  yes ! here 's one from Mr. Welling ! Oh , how glad I am ! Willis , dearest , if I could be the means of bringing those two lovely young creatures together , I should be so happy ! Do n't you think , now , he is the most delicate-minded , truly refined , exquisitely modest young fellow that ever was ? She presses the unopened note to her corsage , and leans eagerly forward entreating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as I can remember my own youth , no . But what does he say ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , I have n't looked yet . He writes the most characteristic hand , for a man , that I ever saw . And he has the divinest taste in perfumes ! Oh , I wonder what that is ? Like a memory  --  a regret . She presses it repeatedly to her pretty nose , in the endeavor to ascertain . Campbell : Campbell : Oh , hello ! Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Willis , you are delightful . I should like to see you really jealous once . Campbell : Campbell : You wo n't , as long as I know my own incomparable charm . But give me that letter , Amy , if you 're not going to open it . I want to see whether Welling is going to come . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Would you really like to open it ? I 've half a mind to let you , just for a reward . Campbell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Campbell : Oh , I do n't know . Being so nice . Campbell : Campbell : That 's something I ca n't help . It 's no merit . Well , hand over the letter . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : I should have thought you 'd insist on my opening it , after that . Campbell : Campbell : Why ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : To show your confidence . Campbell : Campbell : When I have n't got any ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Well , it 's no use trying any sentiment with you , or any generosity either . You 're always just the same ; a teasing joke is your ideal . You ca n't imagine a woman 's wanting to keep up a little romance all through ; and a character like Mr. Welling 's , who 's all chivalry and delicacy and deference , is quite beyond you . That 's the reason you 're always sneering at him . Campbell : Campbell : I 'm not sneering at him , my dear . I 'm only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Well , she 's the only girl who 's anywhere near it . I do n't say she 's faultless , but she has a great deal of character , and she 's very practical ; just the counterpart of his dreaminess ; and she is very , very good-looking , do n't you think ? Campbell : Campbell : Her bang is n't so nice as his . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : No ; and are n't his eyes beautiful ? And that high , serious look ! And his nose and chin are perfectly divine . He looks like a young god ! Campbell : Campbell : I dare say ; though I never saw an old one . Well , is he coming ? I 'm not jealous , but I 'm impatient . Read it out loud . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Indeed I shall not . She opens it and runs it hastily through , with various little starts , stares , frowns , smiles of arrested development , laughs , and cries : Why  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why , there 's some mistake . No ! It 's his hand  --  and here 's his name . I ca n't make it out . She reads it again and again . Why , it 's perfectly bewildering ! Why , there must be some mistake . He could n't have meant it . Could he have imagined ? Could he have dared ? There never has been the slightest thing that could be tortured into  --  But of course not . And Mr. Welling , of all men ! Oh , I ca n't understand it ! Oh , Willis , Willis , Willis ! What does it mean ? She flings the note wildly across the table , and catching her handkerchief to her face , falls back into her chair , tumultuously sobbing . Campbell , Campbell , Well , let 's see . He reads aloud : ' Oh , my darling ! How can I live till I see you ? I will be there long before the hour ! To think of your asking me ! You should have said , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ends of the earth . The presence of others will be nothing . It will be sweet to ignore them in my heart , and while I see you moving among them , and looking after their pleasure with that beautiful thoughtfulness of yours , to think , She is mine , mine , mine ! " Oh , young lord lover , what sighs are those For one that can never be thine ? " I thank you , and thank you a thousand times over , for this proof of your trust in me , and of your love  --  our love . You shall be the sole keeper of our secret  --  it is so sweet to think that no one even suspects it !  --  and it shall live with you , and if you will , it shall die with me . Forever yours , Arthur Welling . ' Campbell turns the note over , and picking up the envelope , examines the address . Well , upon my word ! It 's to you , Amy  --  on the outside , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Campbell , Oh , I do n't know ; I do n't know why he should address such language to me ! Campbell , Campbell , I never did . ' Oh , my darling  --  live till I see you  --  ends of the earth  --  others will be nothing  --  beautiful thoughtfulness  --  mine , mine , mine  --  our love  --  sweet to think no one suspects it  --  forever yours . ' Amy , these are pretty strong expressions to use towards the wife of another , and she a married lady ! I think I had better go and solve that little problem of how he can live till he sees you by relieving him of the necessity . It would be disagreeable to him , but perhaps there 's a social duty involved . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Oh , Willis , do n't torment me ! What do you suppose it means ? Is it some  --  mistake ? It 's for somebody else ! Campbell : Campbell : I do n't see why he should have addressed it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you see ? He 's been writing to some other person at the same time , and he 's got the answers mixed  --  put them in the wrong envelopes . Oh dear ! I wonder who she is ! Campbell , Campbell , Her curiosity gets the better of her anguish . Look here , Amy ! I believe you 're afraid it 's to some one else . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Willis ! Campbell : Campbell : Yes . And before we proceed any further I must know just what you wrote to this  --  this Mr. Welling of yours . Did you put on R. S. V. P. ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Yes ; and just a printed card like all the rest . I did want to write him a note in the first person , and urge him to come , because I expected Miss Rice and Miss Greenway to help me receive ; but when I found Margaret had promised Mrs. Curwen for the next day , I knew she would n't like to take the bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Campbell : Campbell : Did n't what ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Write to him . I just sent a card . Campbell : Campbell : Then these passionate expressions are unprovoked , and my duty is clear . I must lose no time in destroying Mr. Welling . Do you happen to know where I laid my revolver ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Oh , Willis , what are you going to do ? You see it 's a mistake . Campbell : Campbell : Mr. Welling has got to prove that . I 'm not going to have young men addressing my wife as Oh their darling , without knowing the reason why . It 's a liberty . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Ah , Willis , how funny you are ! Campbell : Campbell : Funny ? I 'm furious . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : You know you 're not . Give me the letter , dearest . I know it 's for Margaret Rice , and I shall see her , and just feel round and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell : Campbell : What an idea ! You have n't the slightest evidence that it 's for Miss Rice , or that it is n't intended for you , and it 's my duty to find out . And nobody is authority but Mr. Welling . And I 'm going to him with the corpus delicti . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : But how can you ? Remember how sensitive , how shrinking he is . Do n't , Willis ; you must n't . It will kill him ! Campbell : Campbell : Well , that may save me considerable bother . If he will simply die of himself , I ca n't ask anything better . He goes on eating his breakfast . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Oh , Willis , how perfectly delightful you are ! Campbell : Campbell : I know ; but why ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Why , taking it in the nice , sensible way you do . Now , some husbands would be so stupid ! Of course you could n't think  --  you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet you might behave very disagreeably , and make me very unhappy , if you were not just the lovely , kind-hearted , magnanimous  --  Campbell , Campbe ll , Oh , hello ! Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Yes ; that is what took my fancy in you , Willis : that generosity , that real gentleness , in spite of the brusque way you have . Refinement of the heart , I call it . Campbell : Campbell : Amy , what are you after ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : We 've been married a whole year now  --  Campbell : Campbell : Longer , is n't it ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell :  --  And I have n't known you do an unkind thing , a brutal thing . Campbell : Campbell : Well , I understand the banging around hardly ever begins much under two years . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : How sweet you are ! And you 're so funny always ! Campbell : Campbell : Come , come , Amy ; get down to business . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You wo n't go and tease that poor boy about his letter , will you ? Just hand it to him , and say you suppose here is something that has come into your possession by mistake , and that you wish to restore it to him , and then  --  just run off . Campbell : Campbell : With my parasol in one hand , and my skirts caught up in the other ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Oh , how good ! Of course I was imagining how I should do it . Campbell : Campbell : Well , a man ca n't do it that way . He would look silly . He rises from the table , and comes and puts his arm round her shoulders . But you need n't be afraid of my being rough with him . Of course it 's a mistake ; but he 's a fellow who will enter into the joke too ; he 'll enjoy it ; he 'll  --  He merges his sentence in a kiss on her upturned lips , and she clings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek . I shall do it in a man 's way ; but I guess you 'll approve of it quite as much . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : I know I shall . That 's what I like about you , Willis : your being so helplessly a man always . Campbell : Campbell : Well , that 's what attracted me to you , Amy : your manliness . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : And I liked your finesse . You are awfully inventive , Willis . Why , Willis , I 've just thought of something . Oh , it would be so good if you only would ! Campbell : Campbell : Would what ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Invent something now to get us out of the scrape . Campbell : Campbell : What a brilliant idea ! I 'm not in any scrape . And as for Mr. Welling , I do n't see how you could help him out unless you sent this letter to Miss Rice , and asked her to send yours back  --  Mrs. Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how perfectly delightful ! And it 's so delicate of you to think of that ! I will just enclose his note  --  give it here , Willis  --  and he need never know that it ever went to the wrong address . Oh , I always felt that you were truly refined , anyway . He passively yields the letter , and she whirls away to a writing-desk in the corner of the room . Now , I 'll just keep a copy of the letter  --  for a joke ; I think I 've a perfect right to  --  scribbling furiously away  --  and then I 'll match the paper with an envelope  --  I can do that perfectly  --  and then I 'll just imitate his hand  --  such fun !  --  and send it flying over to Margaret Rice . Oh , how good ! Touch the bell , Willis ; and then  --  as the serving-maid appears  --  Yes , Jane ! Run right across the lawn to Mrs. Rice 's , and give this letter for Miss Margaret , and say it was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fly , Jane ! Oh , Willis , love ! Is n't it perfect ! Of course she 'll have got his formal reply to my invitation , and be all mixed up by it , and now when this note comes , she 'll see through it all in an instant , and it will be such a relief to her ; and oh , she 'll think that he 's directed both the letters to her because he could n't think of any one else ! Is n't it lovely ? Just like anything that 's nice , it 's ten times as nice as you expected it to be ; and  --  Campbell : Campbell : But hold on , Amy ! He lifts a note from the desk . You 've sent your copy . Here 's the original now . She 'll think you 've been playing some joke on her . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , What ! Oh , my goodness ! It is ! I have ! Oh , I shall die ! Run ! Call her back ! Shriek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no ! It 's too late ! She 's given it to their man , and now nothing can save me ! Oh , Willis ! Willis ! Willis ! This is all your fault , with that fatal suggestion of yours . Oh , if you had only left it to me I never should have got into such a scrape ! She will think now that I 've been trying to hoax her , and she 's perfectly implacable at the least hint of a liberty , and she 'll be ready to kill me . I do n't know what she wo n't do . Oh , Willis , how could you get me into this ! Campbell , Campbell , Get you into this ! Now , Amy , this is a little too much . You got yourself into it . You urged me to think of something  --  Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Well , do , Willis , do think of something , or I shall go mad ! Help me , Willis ! Do n't be so heartless  --  so unfeeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and that is to make a clean breast of it to Welling , and get him to help us out . A word from him can make everything right , and we ca n't take a step without him ; we ca n't move ! Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : I ca n't let you . Oh , is n't it horrible ! Campbell : Campbell : Yes ; a nice thing is always ten times nicer than you expected it to be ! Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Oh , how can you stand there mocking me ? Why do n't you go to him at once , and tell him the whole thing , and beg him , implore him , to help us ? Campbell : Campbell : Why , you just told me I must n't ! Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : You did n't expect me to say you might , did you ? Oh , how cruel ! She whirls out of the room , and Campbell stands in a daze , in which he is finally aware of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veranda without . Mr. Welling , with a terrified and furtive air , seems to be fixed to the spot where he stands . II . Mr. Welling ; Mr. Campbell . Campbell : Campbell : Why , Welling , what the devil are you doing there ? Welling : Welling : Trying to get away . Campbell : Campbell : To get away ? But you sha' n't , man ! I wo n't let you . I was just going to see you . How long have you been there ? Welling : Welling : I 've just come . Campbell : Campbell : What have you heard ? Welling : Welling : Nothing  --  nothing . I was knocking on the window-casing to make you hear , but you seemed preoccupied . Campbell : Campbell : Preoccupied ! convulsed ! cataclysmed ! Look here : we 're in a box , Welling . And you 've got us into it . He pulls Welling 's note out of his pocket , where he has been keeping his hand on it , and pokes it at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine ; yes . May I ask , Mr. Campbell , how you came to have this letter ? Campbell : Campbell : May I ask , Mr. Welling , how you came to write such a letter to my wife ? Welling : Welling : To your wife ? To Mrs. Campbell ? I never wrote any such letter to her . Campbell : Campbell : Then you addressed it to her . Welling : Welling : Impossible ! Campbell : Campbell : Impossible ? I think I can convince you , much as I regret to do so . He makes search about Mrs. Campbell 's letters on the table first , and then on the writing-desk . We have the envelope . It came amongst a lot of letters , and there 's no mistake about it . He continues to toss the letters about , and then desists . But no matter ; I ca n't find it ; Amy 's probably carried it off with her . There 's no mistake about it . I was going to have some fun with you about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whom did you send Mrs. Campbell 's letter to ? Welling : Welling : Mrs. Campbell 's letter ? Campbell : Campbell : Oh , pshaw ! your acceptance or refusal , or whatever it was , of her garden fandango . You got an invitation ? Welling : Welling : Of course . Campbell : Campbell : And you wrote to accept it or decline it at the same time that you wrote this letter here to some one else . And you addressed two envelopes before you put the notes in either . And then you put them into the wrong envelopes . And you sent this note to my wife and the other note to the other person  --  Welling : Welling : No , I did n't do anything of the kind ! He regards Campbell with amazement , and some apparent doubt of his sanity . Campbell : Campbell : Well , then , Mr. Welling , will you allow me to ask what the deuce you did do ? Welling : Welling : I never wrote to Mrs. Campbell at all . I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come . It seemed so formal to write . Campbell : Campbell : Then will you be kind enough to tell me whom you did write to ? Welling : Welling : No , Mr. Campbell , I ca n't do that . Campbell : Campbell : You write such a letter as that to my wife , and then wo n't tell me whom it 's to ? Welling : Welling : No ! And you 've no right to ask me . Campbell : Campbell : I 've no right to ask you ? Welling : Welling : No . When I tell you that the note was n't meant for Mrs. Campbell , that 's enough . Campbell : Campbell : I 'll be judge of that , Mr. Welling . You say that you were not writing two notes at the time , and that you did n't get the envelopes mixed . Then , if the note was n't meant for my wife , why did you address it to her ? Welling : Welling : That 's what I ca n't tell ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great a mystery to me as it is to you . I can only conjecture that when I was writing that address I was thinking of coming to explain to Mrs. Campbell that I was going away to-day , and should n't be back till after her party . It was too complicated to put in a note without seeming to give my regrets too much importance . And I suppose that when I was addressing the note that I did write I put Mrs. Campbell 's name on because I had her so much in mind . Campbell , Campbell , Oh III . Mrs. Campbell ; Mr. Welling ; Mr. Campbell . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Yes ! She goes up and gives her hand to Mr. Welling with friendly frankness . And it was very nice of you to think of me at such a time , when you ought to have been thinking of some one else . Welling , Welling , Oh , thank you , Mrs. Campbell ! I was sure you would understand . You could n't have imagined me capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Of course not ! And Willis has quite lost his head . I saw in an instant just how it was . I 'm so sorry you ca n't come to my party  --  Campbell : Campbell : Amy , have you been eavesdropping ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : There was no need of eavesdropping . I could have heard you out at Loon Rock Light , you yelled so . But as soon as I recognized Mr. Welling 's voice I came to the top of the stairs and listened . I was sure you would do something foolish . But now I think we had better make a clean breast of it , and tell Mr. Welling just what we 've done . We knew , of course , the letter was n't for me , and we thought we would n't vex you about it , but just send it to the one it was meant for . We 've surprised your secret , Mr. Welling , though we did n't intend to ; but if you 'll accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wo n't let it go any further . It does seem so perfectly ideal , and I feel like saying , Bless you , my children ! You 've been in and out here so much this summer , and I feel just like an elder sister to Margaret . Welling : Welling : Margaret ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Well , Miss Rice , then  --  Welling : Welling : Miss Rice ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Oh , I 'm sorry if we seem to presume upon our acquaintance with the matter . We could n't very well help knowing it under the circumstances . Welling : Welling : Certainly , certainly  --  of course : I do n't mind that at all : I was going to tell you anyway : that was partly the reason why I came instead of writing  --  Campbell , Campbell , I supposed he had written . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Do n't interrupt , Willis ! Well ? Welling : Welling : But I do n't see what Miss Rice has to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see ! Why , is n't Margaret Rice the one  --  Welling : Welling : What one ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : The one that you 're engaged  --  the one that the note was really for ? Welling : Welling : No ! What an idea ! Miss Rice ? Not for an instant ! It 's  --  it 's her friend  --  Miss Greenway  --  who 's staying with her  --  Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Willis ! Get me some water  --  some wine ! Help me ! Ah ! Do n't touch me ! It was you , you who did it all ! Oh , now what shall I do ? She drops her head upon Campbell 's shoulder , while Welling watches them in stupefaction . Campbell : Campbel l : It 's about a million times nicer than we could have expected . That 's the way with a nice thing when you get it started . Well , young man , you 're done for ; and so are we , for that matter . We supposed that note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice  --  Welling : Welling : Ho , ho , ho ! Ah , ha , ha ! Miss Rice ? Ha  --  Campbell : Campbell : I 'm glad you like it . You 'll enjoy the rest of it still better . We thought it was for Miss Rice , and my wife neatly imitated your hand on an envelope and sent it over to her just before you came in . Funny , is n't it ? Laugh on ! Do n't mind us ! Welling , Welling , Thought my note was for Miss Rice ? Sent it to her ? Gracious powers ! They all stand for a moment in silence , and then Welling glances at the paper in his hand . But there 's some mistake . You have n't sent my note to Miss Rice : here it is now ! Campbell : Campbell : Oh , that 's the best of the joke . Mrs. Campbell took a copy  --  Mrs. Campbell moans  --  she meant to have some fun with you about it , and it 's ten times as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent off her copy and kept the original . Perhaps that makes it better . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , No ; worse ! She 'll think we 've been trying to hoax her , and she 'll be in a towering rage ; and she 'll show the note to Miss Greenway , and you 'll be ruined . Oh , poor Mr. Welling ! Oh , what a fatal , fatal  --  mix ! She abandons herself in an attitude of extreme desperation upon a chair , while the men stare at her , till Campbell breaks the spell by starting forward and ringing the bell on the table . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : What are you doing , Willis ? Campbell : Campbell : Ringing for Jane . As Jane appears : Did you give Miss Rice the note ? IV . Jane ; Mrs. Campbell ; Welling ; Campbell . Jane : J ane : No , sir ; I gave it to the man . He said he would give it to Miss Rice . Campbell : Campbell : Then it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Amy , you might have sent over for it , and said there was a mistake . Jane : Jane : He said Miss Rice was out driving with Miss Greenway in her phaeton , but they expected her back every minute . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Oh , my goodness ! And you did n't come to tell me ? Oh , if we had only known ! We 've lost our only chance , Willis . Jane : Jane : I did come and knock on your door , ma'am , but I could n't make you hear . Campbell : Campbell : There 's still a chance . Perhaps she has n't got back yet . Jane : Jane : I know she ai n't , sir . I 've been watching for her ever since . I can always see them come , from the pantry window . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Well , then , do n't stand there talking , but run at once ! Oh , Willis ! Never tell me again that there 's no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , I can never be grateful and humble enough  --  Goodness me , Jane ! why do n't you go ? Jane : Jane : But where , ma'am ? I do n't know what you want me to do . I 'm willing enough to do anything if I know what it is , but it 's pretty hard to do things if you do n't . Campbell : Campbell : You 're perfectly right , Jane . Mrs. Campbell wants you to telegraph yourself over to Mrs. Rice 's , and say to her that the letter you left for Miss Rice is not for her , but another lady , and Mrs. Campbell sent it by mistake . Get it and bring it back here , dead or alive , even if Mrs. Rice has to pass over your mangled body in the attempt . Jane , Jane , I will that , sir . V : Mrs. Campbell ; Welling ; Campbell . Campbell : Campbell : And now , while we 're waiting , let 's all join hands and dance round the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amy . And so am I  --  which is more to the point . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Dansons ! She extends her hands to the gentlemen , and as they circle round the breakfast-table she sings , Sur le pont d'Avignon , Tout le monde y danse en rond . She frees her hands and courtesies to one gentleman and the other . Les belles dames font comme a ; Les beaux messieurs font comme a . ' Then she catches hands with them again , and they circle round the table as before , singing , Sur le pont d'Avignon , Tout le monde y danse en rond . Oh dear ! Stop ! I 'm dizzy  --  I shall fall . She spins into a chair . while the men continue solemnly circling by themselves . Campbell : Campbell : It is a sacred dance : Sur le pont d'Avignon  --  Welling : It 's an expiation : Tout le monde y danse en rond . Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Stop , you crazy things ! Here comes Jane ! Come right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me , Jane ! Welling : Welling : I think it belongs to me , Mrs. Campbell . Campbell : Campbell : Jane , I am master of the house  --  nominally . Give me the letter . VI . Jane ; Mrs. Campbell ; Welling ; Campbell . Jane , Jane , Oh , how I did . run  --  Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Yes , yes ! But the letter  --  Welling : Welling : Did you get it ? Campbell : Campbell : Where is it ? Jane , Jane , I ca n't hardly get my breath  --  Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Had she got back ? Jane : Jane : No , ma'am . Campbell : Campbell : Did Mrs. Rice object to giving it up ? Jane : Jane : No , sir . Welling : Welling : Then it 's all right ? Jane : Jane : No , sir . All wrong . Welling : Welling : All wrong ? Campbell : Campbell : How all wrong ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : What 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , may I have a drink of water ? I 'm so dry I ca n't speak . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Yes , certainly . Campbell : Campbell : Of course . Welling : Welling : Here . They all pour glasses of water and press them to her lips . Jane , Jane , They thought Mrs. Campbell was in a great hurry for Miss Rice to have the letter , and they sent off the man with it to meet her . VII . Mrs. Campbell ; Welling ; Campbell . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Oh , merciful goodness ! Welling : Welling : Gracious powers ! Campbell : Campbell : Another overruling providence . Now you are in for it , my boy ! So is Amy . And so am I  --  which is still more to the point . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Well , now , what shall we do ? Campbell : Campbell : All that we can do now is to await developments : they 'll come fast enough . Miss Rice will open her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't understand it in the least ; how could she understand a letter in your handwriting , with Welling 's name signed to it ? She 'll show it to Miss Greenway  --  Welling : Welling : Oh , do n't say that ! Campbell : Campbell :  --  Greenway ; and Miss Greenway wo n't know what to make of it either . But she 's the kind of girl who 'll form some lively conjectures when she reads that letter . In the first place , she 'll wonder how Mr. Welling happens to be writing to Miss Rice in that affectionate strain  --  Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Willis ! Campbell : Campbell :  --  And she naturally wo n't believe he 's done it . But then , when Miss Rice tells her it 's your handwriting , Amy , she 'll think that you and Miss Rice have been having your jokes about Mr. Welling ; and she 'll wonder what kind of person you are , anyway , to make free with a young man 's name that way . Welling : Welling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell more than anybody . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Do n't try to stop him ; he 's fiendish when he begins teasing . Campbell : Campbell : Oh , well ! If she admires Mrs. Campbell and confides in you , then the whole affair is very simple . All you 've got to do is to tell her that after you 'd written her the original of that note , your mind was so full of Mrs. Campbell and her garden-party that you naturally addressed it to her . And then Mrs. Campbell can cut in and say that when she got the note she knew it was n't for her , but she never dreamed of your caring for Miss Greenway , and was so sure it was for Miss Rice that she sent her a copy of it . That will make it all right and perfectly agreeable to every one concerned . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : And I can say that I sent it at your suggestion , and then , instead of trying to help me out of the awful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasing me about it ! But I shall not say anything , for I shall not see them . I will leave you to receive them and make the best of it . Do n't try to stop me , Willis . She threatens him with her fan as he steps forward to intercept her escape . Campbell : Campbell : No , no ! Listen , Amy ! You must stay and see those ladies . It 's all well enough to leave it to me , but what about poor Welling ? He has n't done anything  --  except cause the whole trouble . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : I am very sorry , but I ca n't help it . I must go . Campbell continues to prevent her flight , and she suddenly whirls about and makes a dash at the open window . Oh , very well , then ! I can get out this way . At the same moment Miss Rice and Miss Greenway appear before the window on the piazza . Ugh ! E  --  e  --  e ! How you frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  glad to see you ! And you  --  you too , Miss Greenway . Here 's Mr. Welling . He 's been desolating us with a story about having to be away over my party , and just getting back for Mrs. Curwen 's . Is n't it too bad ? Ca n't some of you young ladies  --  or all of you  --  make him stay ? As Mrs. Campbell talks on , she readjusts her spirit more and more to the exigency , and subdues her agitation to a surface of the sweetest politeness . VIII . Miss Rice , Miss Greenway , and the others . Miss Rice , Miss Rice , What in the world does it all mean , Mrs. Campbell , your sending your letters flying after me at this rate ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , My letters ? She mechanically receives the extended note , and glances at the superscription : Mrs. Willis Campbell . Ah ! She hands it quickly to her husband , who reads the address with a similar cry . Campbell : Campbell : Well , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You 've sealed up one of your own notes , and sent it to Miss Rice . Capital ! Ah , ha , ha ! Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Oh , how delicious ! What a ridiculous blunder ! I do n't wonder you were puzzled , Margaret . Welling : Welling : What ! Sent her your own letter , addressed to yourself ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Yes . Is n't it amusing ? Welling : Welling : The best thing I ever heard of . Miss Rice : Miss Rice : Yes . And if you only knew what agonies of curiosity Miss Greenway and I had suffered , wanting to open it and read it anyway , in spite of all the decencies , I think you ought to read it to us . Campbell : Campbell : Or at least give Miss Rice her own letter . What in the world did you do with that ? Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : Put it in my desk , where I thought I put mine . But never mind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well . Come in here a moment , Margaret . She leads the way to the parlor , whither Miss Rice follows . Miss Greenway , Miss Greenway , Oh , may n't I know too ? I think that 's hardly fair , Mrs. Campbell . Mrs. Campbell : Mrs. Campbell : No ; or  --  Margaret may tell you afterwards ; or Mr. Welling may , now ! Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : How very formidable ! Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Willis , bring me the refusals and acceptances , wo n't you ? They 're up-stairs . Campbell : Campbell : Delighted to be of any service . Behind Miss Greenway 's back he dramatizes over her head to Welling his sense of his own escape and his compassion for the fellow-man whom he leaves in the toils of fate . IX . Miss Greenway ; Mr. Welling . Welling : Welling : Nelly ! He approaches , and timidly takes her hand . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : Arthur ! That letter was addressed in your handwriting . Will you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple  --  that is , it 's the most difficult thing in the world . Nelly , can you believe anything I say to you ? Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : What nonsense ! Of course I can  --  if you 're not too long about it . Welling : Welling : Well , then , the letter in that envelope was one I wrote to Mrs. Campbell  --  or the copy of one . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : The copy ? Welling : Welling : But let me explain . You see , when I got your note asking me to be sure and come to Mrs. Curwen 's  --  Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : Yes ? Welling : Welling :  --  I had just received an invitation from Mrs. Campbell for her garden-party , and I sat down and wrote to you , and concluded I 'd step over and tell her why I could n't come , and with that in my mind , I addressed your letter  --  the one I 'd written you  --  to her . Miss Greenway : Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No ; I merely called you ' darling ; ' and when Mrs. Campbell opened it she saw it could n't be for her , and she took it into her head it must be for Miss Rice . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : For Margaret ? What an idea ! But why did she put your envelope on it ? Welling : Welling : She made a copy , for the joke of it ; and then , in her hurry , she enclosed that in my envelope , and kept the original and the envelope she 'd addressed to Miss Rice , and  --  and that 's all . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : What a perfectly delightful muddle ! And how shall we get out of it with Margaret ? Welling : Welling : With Margaret ? I do n't care for her . It 's you that I want to get out of it with . And you do believe me  --  you do forgive me , Nelly ? Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : For what ? Welling : Welling : For  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you 'd be so vexed . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : I should n't have liked you to send a letter addressed darling to Mrs. Curwen ; but Mrs. Campbell is different . Welling : Welling : Oh , how archangelically sensible ! How divine of you to take it in just the right way ! Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : Why , of course ! How stupid I should be to take such a thing in the wrong way ! Welling : Welling : And I 'm so glad now I did n't try to lie to you about it . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : It would n't have been of any use . You could n't have carried off anything of that sort . The truth is bad enough for you to carry off . Promise me that you will always leave the other thing to me . Welling : Welling : I will , darling ; I will , indeed . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : And now we must tell Margaret , of course . X. Miss Rice ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice , Miss Rice , You need n't . Mrs. Campbell has told me ; and oh , Nelly , I 'm so happy for you ! And is n't it all the greatest mix ? Campbell , Campbell , You need n't tell me , either ; I 've been listening , and I 've heard every word . I congratulate you , my dear boy ! I 'd no idea she 'd let you up so easily . You 'll allow yourself it is n't a very likely story . Welling : Welling : I know it . But  --  Miss Rice : Miss Rice : That 's the very reason no one could have made it up . Miss Greenway : Miss Greenway : He could n't have made up even a likely story . Campbell : Campbell : Congratulate you again , Welling . Do you suppose she can keep so always ? Mrs. Campbell , Mrs. Campbell , Do n't answer the wretch , Mr. Welling . Of course she can , with you . Dansons ! She gives a hand to Miss Greenway and Welling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle round the table she sings , Sur le pont d'Avignon , Tout le monde y danse en rond . Back matter The End .
