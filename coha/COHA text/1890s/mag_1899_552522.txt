E are at the point of a cenXA/ tury from the birth of VV Washington , " - these were the memorable words of Webster on the centennial of the birth of Washington , in 1832 ; " and what a century it has been ! During its course the human mind has seemed to proceed with a sort of geometric yelocity , accomplishing for human intelligence and human freedom more than had been done in fives or tens of centuries preceding . Washington stands at the commencement of a new era , as well as at the head of the New World . A century from the birth of Washington has changed the world . The country of Washington has been the theatre on which a great part of that change has been wrought ; and Washington himself a principal agent by which it has been accomplished . His age and his country are equally full of wonders ; and of both he is the chief . If the poetical prediction , uttered a few years before his birth , be true ; if indeed it be designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human affairs shall be made on this theatre of the western world ; if it be true that The four first acts already past , A fifth shall close the drama with the day ; Time 's noblest offspring is the last ; ' how could this imposing , sxvelling , final scene be appropriately opened , how could its intense interest be adequately sustained , but by the introduction of just such a character as our Washington ? " We are at the point of a century from the death of Washington ; and it is profitable to go back to 1832 and read in solemnity the words which Webster uttered in buoyancy . The 767 whole world was looking on at the still new American experiment ; the career of the American government was " among the most attractive objects to the civilized world " ; " that love of liberty and that understanding of its true principles which are flying over the whole earth , as on the wings of all the winds , are really and truly of American origin . " He described the era as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudal principle " and " when society has maintained its rights against military power and established , on foundations never hereafter to be shaken , its competency to govern itself . " He would have been surprised indeed if told that at the centennial of Washington 's death we should be debating whether the military establishments which we are planning could be maintained without conscription , and describinc* the struggle at whose beginning , not end , we feel ourselves as the 5truggle between the social and the feudal principle . Imperialism , the forcible subjugation of foreign people , he did not dream of ; the republic was to be an eternal liberator . " The spirit of human liberty and of free government , nurtured and grown into strength and beauty in America , has stretched , its course into the midst of the nations . Like an emanation from heaven , it has gone forth , and it will not return void . It must change , it is fast changing , the face of the earth . Our great , our high duty is to show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of health as well as a spirit of power ; that its benignity is as great as its strength ; that its efficiency to secure individual rights , social relations and moral order is equal to the irresistible force with which it prostrate* principalities and powers . The world , at // this moment , is regarding us with a willing but something of a fearful adiiiiration . " Conscious of this " deep and awful anxiety " and of our peculiar responsibility for the weal or woe of " all the unborn races of mankind , " we should rise to a larger and loftier patriotism and a more solemn sense of our duties ; and our leaders , rising above " the little arts of party delusion , " should " act right , and trust the peol ) le . " " We can not wish better for our country nor for the world , " said Webster , " than that the same spirit which influenced Washington may influence all who succeed him . " He urged his America , as he would still more strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , especially the words of the Farewell Address , and ponder and obey them . " Washington 's Farewell Address is full of truths important at all times , and particularly deserving consideration at the present . With a sagacity which brought the future before him and made it like the present , he saw and pointed out the dangers that even at this moment most imminently thregten us . I hardly know how a greater service of that kind could now be done to the community than by a renewed and wide diffusion of that admirable paper and an earnest invitation to every man in the country to reperuse and consider it . " * * * We are of those who have an abiding faith in the American people . If they are making mistakes , they will correct them ; if they are wrong , they will right themselves ; and it is certainly true that they have few better helps at any time than the serious counsel of Washington . We are at the point of a century from the death of Washington . In 1832 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more eloquent and commanding still , and it is still more expedient and necessary than at the earlier centennial for the nation to turn back for fellowship with it . It is a kind Providence , as we said last month , which brings it to pass that in this year , when the need is more imperative than in any former year in our history , the American people will have their attention directed so constantly and emphatically , with the dramatic reinforcement of the great anniversary , to Washington 's words and work , to his political character and his high conceptions of what the political character and pur* of the republic should be . We wish that there might be given in every city and town in the country during this centennial year lectures upon the Life and Influence of Washington . The Old South Lectures for Young People in Boston the present summer are being entirely devoted to this subject . A hundred towns could do nothing better than adopt bodily this Old South programme . The course consists of eight lectures , the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington and the Constitution , Washington as President of the United States , Washington the True Expander of the Republic , Washington s Interest in Education , The Men who Worked with Washington , Washington 's Farewell Address , and What the World has Thought and Said of Washington . Among the Old South lecturers are such persons as John Fiske , Edward Everett Hale and Alice Freeman Palmer . Few places can plan to use these lecturers ; although Brooklyn for many years regularly and other places occasionally have arranged to have each sum.mer s course of Old South lectures repeated for their people by the Old South lecturers . Most places will use their own people-ministers , lawyers , editors , teachers-as their lecturers ; and it is better that they should . But many should be glad to follow this Old South programme ; and in connection can be used many of the Old South leaflets relating to Washington . For // attention to Washington is no new or occasional thing on the part of the directors of the Old South work . Each year there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Boston , with a strong address by some strong man upon some significant phase of Washington 's life and influence ; and among the hundred Old South leaflets already published are a dozen relating to Washington , almost all of them made up from Washington 's own papers . These include Washington 's Farewell Address , his Inaugurals , his Circular Letter to the Governors of the States in 1783 , his Letter to Benjamin Harrison on the Opening of the West , Henry Lee 's Funeral Oration on Washington , A ( ashing* ton 's Journal of his Tour to the Ohio in 1770 , his Account of the Army at Cambridge in 1775 , his Account of the Capture of Boston , his Addresses to the Churches , his Words on a National University , his Correspondence with Lafayette , and his Letters on the Constitution . These Old South leaflets are reprints of valuable original documents , accompanied by historical and bibliographical notes , prepared for the use of students in the schools and for the general reader , and furnished to all , through Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing . The Washington leaflets will be of special service at this time , and will direct students to the best books for their further studies . At the Old South , the life and influence of Washington not only form the subject for consideration in th summer lectures to the young people ; they also prescribe the topics set for the Old South essays for the year , the essays for which the annual prizes are given in the competition open to the graduates of the various Boston high schools . The two subjects announced for this Washington year are " The American Revolution under Washington and the English Revolution under Cromwell : Compare their Causes , Aims , and Results , " and " Washington 's Plan for a National University : the Argument for it a 1-lundred Years Ago and the Argument To-day . " It seems to us that much good might be done if the schools of the country generally would s*t their pupils to studying such Washington subjects and writing essays upon them in the course of their regular school work . The solid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any amount of spread-eagle celebrations , even celebrations of the virtues of Washington . We have somewhat too much spread-eagleism in our schools . Enthusiasm is a good thing ; it is always good to be zealously affected in a good cause ; but what we want in our schools is zeal according to knowledge - real and critical knowledge , and not superficial halfknowledge. * * * The student who wishes to learn everything about Washington 's writings and about the immense literature concerning Washington is fortunate in being able to refer to the great bibliographical volume ( five hundred pages ) by Mr. Appleton Griffin , published two years ago , one of the most thorough works of the kind in existence , beginning with a critical account of the books formerly in Washington 's library and now in the Boston Athen*um , and then passing into the wider field of Washingtoniana . The writings of Washington have been published in two fine editions , edited by Sparks and Ford . The almost numberless biographies of Washington-by Marshall , Irving , Sparks , Everett , Lodge , Woodrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of all sorts and conditions of men . From the time of 1-lenry Lee to the time of George William Curtis , almost every great American orator has upon some occasion or other delivered a Washington oration . From Burns and Byron to // Longfellow and Lowell , the poets one by one have paid their tribute . It were much to be wished that every American citizen , in this Washington year , might make his own little Washington bible , by going through Washington 's writings and culling the passages which seem to him most noble and didactic and most necessary for these times . It were to be wished that each , when he has made this little bible , would read , mark , learn and inwardly digest it , until it becomes a part of him . It were to be wished that all would study Washington with the eyes of the men of vision who were his contemporaries ; that they would ponder upon what the world 's great men have said of Washington during the century since his death , and diligently inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be desired and maintained in our national life . * 5 * It matters little with which words we begin our Washington bible . Open his letters , his journals , his messages to Congress , his inaugural address , his farexvell address ,  --  and the fitting and commanding words abound . We open to these : " Let me warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party . . . . Its common and continual mischiefs are si'fflcient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it . It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration . It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms , kindles the animosity of one party against another , and makes the public administration , according to the alternate triumphs of different parties , the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests . . . . However such combinations or associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , in the coursof time and things , to become potent Ciigines by which cunning , ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people . " " It is important , likewise , that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution , in those entrusted with its administration , to confine themselves withmu their respective constitutional spheres , avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another . The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one , and thus to create , whatever the form of government , a real despotism . " " Observe good faith and justice towards all nations ; cultivate peace and harmony with all . Religion and morality enjoin this conduct ; and can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it ? It will be worthy of a free , enlightened and great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence . Who can doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary a*antages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it ? Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue ? " These words , as all will recognize , are from the Farewell Address . It is interesting to turn back to the Inaugural Address and find that at the beginning as at the end of his administration his thoughts were on public morality . This word too shall go into our Washington bible : " The foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality , and the preeminence of a free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world . I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent , love for my country can inspire ; since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity ; since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right , which Heaven itself has ordained ; and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered as deeply , perhaps as finally , staked on the experiment intrusted to th' hands of the American people . " // The words on the sacred regard to public justice , from the circular letter to the governors of all the states in I 783 ,  --  that letter which was felt by him to be so important that , supposing himself to be then retiring from public life , he spoke of it as his " legacy , " - should go into our little bible ; so should his noble words on toleration , from various of his addresses to the churches ; so should his words upon education in good citizenship and the science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * The young people of America might profitably put together a little Washington bible of their own . It might begin with the maxims of conduct which he wrote down for himself in early life , including the injunction always to keep alive in his breast that little spark called conscience ; and it could embrace many of his sensible counsels for school and youth . The correspondence between Washington and his adopted son , George Washington Parke Custis , belonging to the period when young Custis was a student at Princeton , exhibits Washington in a relation in which few are familiar with him . It contains much that is entertaining , and the dozen or more letters from Washington himself give some sound advice on education . Here is a passage from one of them , to go into our young folks ' Washington bible : " You are now extending into that stage of life when good or had habits are formed ; when the mind will be turned to things useful and praiseworthy , or to dissipation and vice . Fix on whichever it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been said , and truly , that as the twig : s bent so it will grow . ' This , in a strong point of view , shows the propriety of letting your inexperience be directed by maturer advice , and in placing guard upon the avenues which ' lead to idleness and vice . The latter will approach like a thief , working upon your passions , encouraged , perhaps , by bad examples , the propensity to whic.h will increase in proportion to the practice of it and your yielding . This admonition proceeds from the purest affec tion for you ; but I do not mean by it that you are to become a stoic , or to deprive yourself in the intervals of study of any recreations or manly exercise which reason approves . " T is well to be on good terms with all your fellow-students , and I am pleased to hear you are so ; but while a courteous behavior is due to all , select the most deserving only for your friendships , and before this becomes intimate , weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant of slow growth ; to be sincere , there must be a congeniality of temper and pursuits . Virtue and vice can not be allied ; nor can idleness and industry . Of course , if you resolve to adhere to the two former of these extremes , an intimacy with those who incline to the latter of them would be extremely embarrassing to you ; it would , be a stumblingblock in your way , and act like a millstone hung to your neck ; for it is the nature o* idleness and vice to obtain as many votaries as they can . " I would guard you , too , against imbibing hasty and unfavorable impressions of any one . Let your judgment always balance well , before you decide ; and even then , where there is no occasion for expressing an opinion , it is best to be silent ; for there is nothing more certain than that it is at all times more easy to make enemies than friends . And besides , to speak evil of any one , unless there is unequivocal proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no adequate reparation ; for , as Shakespeare says , He that robs me of my good name enriches not himself , but renders me poor indeed , ' or words to that effect . Keep in mind that scarcely any change would be agreeable to you at first , from the sudden transition , and from never having been accustomed to shift or rough it and , moreover , that if you meet with collegiate fare , it will be unmanly to complain. ** * * * More useftil in many high respects that the biographies , and certainly more stirring , are the great orations upon Washington , of which there are so many and by men so eminent . The careful words on memorable occasions of men like Webster and Winthrop and Everett and Parker and Curtis mean much . The student in this centennial year will not neglect these ; and he will go back to the first of them all , the funeral oration which General Henry Lee delivered before the two houses of Congress on that // December day in 1799 . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more impressively and fittingly than those famous words at the close of General Lee 's oration : " First in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen , he was second to none in the humble and endearing scenes of private life . Pious , just , humane , temperate and sincere ; uniform , dignified and commanding , his example was as edifying to all around him as were the effects of that example lasting . To his equals he was condescending , to his inferiors kind , and to the dear object of his affections exemplarily tender . Correct throughout , vice shuddered in his presence , and virtue always felt his fostering hand . The purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues . Such was the man America has lost ! Such was the man for whom our nation mourns ! Methinks I see his august image , and hear , falling from his venerable lips , these deep sinking words : " Cease , Sons of America , lamenting our separation . Go on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joint efforts and common dangers . Reverence religion ; diffuse knowledge throughout your land ; patronize the arts and sciences ; let liberty and order be inseparable companions ; control party spirit , the bane of free government ; observe good faith to and cultivate peace with all nations ; . . . be American in thought and deed . Thus will you give immortality to that union , which was the constant object of my terrestrial labors : thus will you preserve undisturbed to the latest posterity the felicity of a people to me most dear ; and thus will you supply ( if my happiness is now aught to you ) the only vacancy in the round of pure bliss high Heaven bestows. ' * * * One of the lectures in the Old South course is to consider " What the World has Thought and Said of Washington . " There is a large book , published a dozen years ago , which bears the title of " Character Portraits of Washington as Delineated by Historians , Orators and Divines , " in which the compiler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates of Washington by men who personally knew him and by critical students of a later day , from James Thacher , who records the personal impression which Washington made upon him at West Point in 1778 , to the English historians , Lecky and John Richard Green . Each reader will remember the noteworthy tributes which the editor does not include and which would have swelled his volume to many times its size ; and we remember two words of peculiar penetration and significance which have been added to the ever growing monument within the dozen years . We think of no higher tribute to Washington as the maker of the nation than that , but a little while before his death , of our own Francis Walker . The true path by which alone the English race may hope to advance to a beneficent supremacy in the world is pointed out with power by Freeman in his essay on " George Washington , the Expander of England . " Freeman sees well , as all Englishmen of insight see and say , that the men behind the redoubt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true representatives of the English idea , that Sam Adams was the bearer of the English idea when England set a price upon his head , and George Washington bombarding the British army out of Boston . Washington effectually taught England how alone she could hope to expand and what the policies were which would inevitably check and ruin her . Let him , interpreted by the great English historian , teach that lesson anew to America . We can not here cite Freeman 's words . The most striking words of General Walker are these : " Chief among the forces which contributed to make the United States a nation , I believe ,  --  - largely as the result of recent thinking on the subject ,  --  was the personality of George Washington . Conscious of a distinctly grudging disposition in respect to the influence of great men upon the political development of peoples , perhaps even subject to a depreciatory *pirit respecting their very greatness itself , I yet find myself more and more turning to regard the first President of the United States as in no inconsiderable degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized and undertaken by the Constitution of 1787-89 , not only his transcendent authority among his countrymen , derived from his personal character and from his services in achieving independence , hut his lofty hearing in office , his impartiality as between antagonistic sections and competing interests , his prescience respecting the evils of foreign alliances and affiliations , and his fervent Americanism were far more to the future of the country than the fact that the Philadelphia convention had used the phrase , We , the people of the United States , ' in the preamble of the Constitution . He was to the plastic elements of the country , in the outset to that great political experiment , more than all other statesmen put together . In securing comparative peace between the angry factions of that day ; in holding the nation , as no other man could have done , out of the giant struggle between France and England ; in impressing respect for law , for public credit , and for the forms of the new governii*nt ; and in silently , but powerfully and grandly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only gave time for a fortunate trial of the Constitution , but he contributed a positive force which we can not overestimate toward its orderly and energetic operation during the first critical years . " * $ * - As We are fortunate in possessing among the many biographies of Washington one which was written by one of his contemporaries , and one of the greatest of his contemporariesJohn Marshall . In the article by General Walker from which we have quoted , his general tribute to Washington is followed by particular specifications ; and his first word is this : " Of the direct contributions made by President Washington to the development of American nationality , the greatest must be admitted to have been his judicial appointments . From 1789 to i8io , the tremendous powers intrusted by the Constitution to the national judiciary were , essentially through Washington 's own appointments , exerted steadily and unremittingly on the side of an indestructible union . " General Walker should * Article on " The Growth of American Nationality , " in the Forum , June , 1595. 5ee also his hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named a date much later than i8io ; for the traditions of Jay and Ellsworth were continued to the end of his life in Marshall , whose influence , legal and political , for a full generation , was greater than that of any other man who ever sat on the Supreme bench . The great chief justice was the intimate and trusted friend of Washington to Washington 's death . He was , like Washington , a Virginian ; he served in the army throughout the Revolution , fighting by Washington 's side at Brandywine , Germantown and Monmouth , and enduring cheerfully with him the hardships of the terrible winter at Valley Forge ; his influence was second only to that of Madison in securing the ratification of the new Constitution by the Virginia convention ; and he was the stout defender of Washington 's administration . If any man was preeminently fitted to be Washington 's biographer , it was this great friend of Washington and most judicial of Americans ; and he was induced to undertake the task by Washington 's family , who placed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1802 , four of the five octavo volumes of the work ( a volume upon the early history of the American colonies was afterwards placed at the front ) were ready for the press in 1804 . It was a too hurried preparation of so great a work , surveying not only the personal life of Washington but the whole history of the period ; and Marshall himself was keenly alive to its defects . It was afterwards revised and compressed ; but Marshall was not a literary man , and the charm of the work is very unlike the charm of the life by Irving . Its great value will lie forever in the fact that it is Marshall 's work . There was much polemic against it in its day on the part of Jefferson and his friends , who condemned it in advance as a Federalist book , written for electioneering purposes ; and how Jefferson and Marshall stood with reference to each other in the politics of the time is best // pictured , for Old South students and others , in Henry Adams 's magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . When all is said , there was probably no man in America who could write of Washington then more impartially than Chief Justice Marshall . That he did write of him we should all be devoutly thankful ; and one of the best things that we can do in this centennial year is to make ourselves more familiar with his monumental but neglected work . His summing up of Washington 's character at the end is often printed and well known ; but none of us can read it too often , as the judgment of one whose opportunity and right to judge were so preeminent : " General Washington was rather above the common size , his frame was robust , and his constitution vigorous , . . . capable of enduring great fatigue , and requiring a considerable degree of exercise for the preservation of his health . His exterior created in the beholder the idea of strength united with manly gracefulness . His manners were rather reserved than free , though they partook nothing of that dryness and sternness which accompany reserve when carried to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently to show how highly he was gratified by the charms of conversation and the pleasures of society . His person and whole deportment exhibited an unaffected and indescribable dignity , unmingled with haughtiness , of which all who approached him were sensible ; and the attachment of those who possessed his friendship and enjoyed his intimacy was ardent , but always respectful . His temper was humane , benevolent , and conciliatory ; but there was a quickness in his sensibility to anything apparently offensive , which experience had taught him to watch and to correct . In the management of his private affairs he exhibited an exact yet liberal economy . His funds were not prodigally wasted on capricious and ill-examined schemes , nor refused to beneficial though costly improvements . They remained therefore competent to that expensive establishment which his reputation , added to a hospitable temper , had in some measure imposed upon him , and to those donations which real distress has a right to claim from opulence . He made no pretensions to that vivacity which fascinates , or to that wit which dazzles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , judgment rather than genius constituted the most prominent feature of his character . " As a military man , he was brave , enterprising and cautious . That malignity which has sought to strip him of all the higher qualities of a general has conceded to him personal courage , and a firmness of resolution which neither dangers nor difficulties could shake . But candor will allow him other great and valuable endowments . If his military course does not abound with splendid achievements , it exhibits a series of judicious measures adapted to circumstances , which probably saved his country . Placed , without having studied the theory , or been taught in the school of experience , the practice of war , at the head of an undisciplined , ill-organized multitude which was unused to the restraints and unacquainted with the ordinary duties of a camp , without the aid of officers possessing those lights which the commander in chief was yet to acquire , it would have been a miracle indeed had his conduct been absolutely faultless . But , possessing an energetic and distinguishing mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his errors , if he committed any , were quickly repaired ; and those measures which the state of things rendered most advisable were seldom if ever neglected . Inferior to his adversary in the numbers , in the equipment , and in the discipline of his troops , it is evidence of real merit that no great and decisive advantages were ever obtained over him , and that the opportunity to strike an important blow never passed away unused . He has been termed the American Fabius ; but those who compare his actions with his means will perceive at least as much of Marcellus as of Fabius in his character . He could not have been more enterprising without endangering the cause he defended , nor have put more to hazard without incurring justly the imputation of rashness . Not relying upon those chances which sometimes give a favorable issue to attempts apparently desperate , his conduct was regulated by calculations made upon the capacities of his army , and the real situation of his country . When called a second time to command the armies of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he meditated a corresponding change of conduct . In modelling the army of 1798 , he sought for men distinguished for their boldness of execution not less than for their prudence in counsel , and contemplated a system of continued attack . The enemy , ' said the general in his private letters , must never be permitted to gain foothold on our shores . ' " In his civil administration , as in his military career , were exhibited ample and // repeated proofs of that practical good sense , of that sound judgment which is perhaps the most rare and is certainly the most valuable quality of the human mind . Devoting himself to the duties of his station , and pursuing no object distinct from the public good , he was accustomed to contemplate at a distance those critical situations in which the United States might probably be placed , and to digest , before the occasion required action , the line of conduct which it would be proper to observe . Taught to distrust first impressions , he sought to acquire all the information which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons which could be urged for or against a particular measure . His own judgment was suspended until it became necessary to determine , and his decisions , thus maturely made , were seldom if ever to be shaken . His conduct therefore was systematic , and the great objects of his administration were steadily pursued . Respecting , as the first magistrate in a free government must ever do , the real and deliberate sentiments of the people , their gusts of passion passed over without ruffling the smooth surface of his mind . Trusting to the reflecting good sense of the nation for approbation and support , he had the magnanimity to pursue its real interests in opposition to its temporary prejudices ; and , though far from being regardless of popular favor , he could never stoop to retain by deserving to lose it . In more instances than one , we find him committing his whole popularity to hazard , and pursuing steadily , in opposition to a torrent which would have overwhelmed a man of ordinary firmness , that course which had been dictated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real republican , devoted to the constitution of his country , and to that system of equal political rights on which it is founded . But between a balanced republic and a democracy , the difference is like that between order and chaos . Real liberty , he thought , was to be preserved only by preserving the authority of the laws and maintaining the energy of government . Scarcely did society present two characters which , in his opinion , less resembled each other than a patriot and a demagogue . " No man has ever appeared upon the theatre of public action whose integrity was more incorruptible , or whose principles were more perfectly free from the contamination of those selfish and unworthy passions which find their nourishment in the conflicts of party . Having no views which required concealment , his real and avowed motives were the same ; and his whole correspondence does not furnish a single case from which even an enemy would infer that he was capable , under any circumstances , of stooping to the employment of duplicity . No truth can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright , and his means always pure . lie exhibits the rare example of a politician to whom wiles were absolutely unknown , and whose professions to foreign governments and to his own countrymen were always sincere . In him was fully exemplified the real distinction which forever exists between wisdom and cunning , and the importance as well as truth of the maxim that honesty is the best policy . ' " If Washington possessed ambition , that passion was , in his bosom , so regulated By principles , or controlled by circumstances , that it was neither vicious nor turbulent . intrigue was never employed as the means of its gratification , nor was personal aggrandizement its object . The various high and important stations to which he was called by the public voice were unsought by himself ; and in consenting to fill them , he seems rather to have yielded to a general conviction that the interests of his country would be thereby promoted , than to his particular inclination . Neither the extraordinary parLiality of the American people , the extravagant praises which were bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he experienced , had any visible influence upon his conduct . The cause is to be looked for in the texture of his mind . In him , that innate and unassuming modesty which adulation would have offended , which the voluntary plaudits of millions could not betray into indiscretion , and which never obtruded upon others his claims to superior consideration , was happily blended with a high and correct sense of personal dignity , and with a just consciousness of that respect which is due to station . Without exertion , he could maintain the happy medium between that arrogance which wounds and that facility which allows the office to be degraded in the person who fills it . " It is impossible to contemplate the great events which have occurred in the United States under the auspices of Washington , without ascribing them , in some measure , to him . If we ask the causes of the prosperous issue of a war , against the successful termination of which there were so many probabilities ; of the good which was produced , and the ill which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest prejudices that a combination of circumstances and of passions could produce ; of the constant favor of the great mass of his fellow citizens , and of the confidence which , to the last moment of his life , they reposed in him ; - the answer , so far as these causes may be found in his character , will furnish a lesson well meriting the attention of those who 775 // are candidates for political fame . Endowed by nature with a sound judgment and an accurate discriminating mind , he feared not that laborious attention which made him perfectly master of those subjects , in all their relations , on which he was to decide ; and this essential quality was guided by an unvarying sense of moral right , which would tolerate the employment only of those means that would bear the most rigid examination , by a fairness of intention which neither sought nor required disguise , and by a purity of virtue which was not only untainted , but unsuspected.

How many men take their English history chiefly from Shakespeare  --  and their Julius Caesar too ! They might take it from a much worse place . It is dangerous to go behind Shakespeare on the vital point . Cromwell is forever safe against the critics , with Milton 's sonnet and Marvell 's odes in the library . A little volume has just been published containing the noteworthy poems on Lincoln . Lincoln was fortunate indeed in living in the golden age of our poetry ; and almost all of the great poetsEmerson , Lowell , Bryant , Whitman , Holmes-wrote some great word of him . Washington 's age was not an age of poetry in America . The poetical tributes to him are chiefly later tributes . But it is a brilliant collection ; and we wish that , in this centennial year , a Washington volume might be placed beside the Lincoln one . Most noteworthy it is that the same hand which wrote the greatest poetic tribute to Lincoln gave us also the greatest poetic tribute to Washington . What better last words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell 's " Under the Old Elm " : " Never to see a nation born Hath been given to mortal man , Unless to those who , on that summer morn Gazed silent when the great Virginian Unsheathed the sword whose fatal flash Shot union through the incoherent clash Of our loose atoms , crystallizing them Around a single will 's unpliant stem , And making purpose of emotion rash . Out of that scabbard sprang , as from its womb , Nebulous at first , but hardening to a star , Through mutual share of sunburst and of gloom , The common faith that made us what we are . * * * * What figure more immovably august Than that grave strength so patient and so pure , Calm in good fortune , when it wavered , sure , That mind serene , impenetrably just , Modelled on classic lines so simple they endure ? That soul so softly radiant and so white The track it left seems less of fire than light , Cold but to such as love distemperature ? * * * * The longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , Seeing how most are fugitive , Or fitful gifts , at best , of now and then , Wind-wavered corpse-lights , daughters of the fen , The more we feel the high stern-icatured beauty Of plain devotedness to duty , Steadfast and still , nor paid with mortal praise , But finding amplest recompense For life 's ungarlanded expense In work dane squarely and unwasted days . For this we honor him , that he could know How sweet the service and how free Of her , God 's eldest daughter here below , And choose in meanest raiment which was she . Placid completeness , life without a fall From faith or highest aims , truth 's breachless wall , Surely if any fame can bear the touch , His will say , Here ! ' at the last trumpet 's call , The unexpressive man whose life expressed so much . "
