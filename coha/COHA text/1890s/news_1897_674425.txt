Speaking of his relations with Mr. in the past , Mr. Gary said : " I have known Major for a good many years . My first intimate experience with him was in 1888 , at the National Convention , when I was a member of the Sherman campaign committee of seven men , of which Major , being head of the Ohio delegation , was Chairman .

It will malZe you President some day . ' " Mr. Gary declined to say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of patronage .
