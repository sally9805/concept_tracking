txt ' Upon demand of Edward M. Grout , the Democratic candidate for Mayor of Brooklyn , Almet F. Jenks yesterday afternoon withdrew from the " regular " Judiciary ticket , and Josiah T. Marean was substituted as a candidate for Justice of the Supreme Court . It was thought by the regulars that the withdrawal of Mr. Jenks would heal the breach between the two wings of the party so far as the Judiciary was concerned , and that the reform organization would indorse Mr. Marean , but in this they were disappointed . The members of the Executive Committee said they were personally friendly to Mr. - Marean , but that it was too late for the organization to fish for their support . The Executive Committee of the reform party met in the Clarendon Hotel last night and indorsed Wilmot M. Smith , the Republican candidate for Justice of the Supreme Court , and James W. Covert , the regular Democratic candidate from Queens County , retiring J. Warren Greene and John A. Taylor from the reform ticket . Mr. Grout made the demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening that unless Mr. Jenks withdrew , and several Senatorial slates were changed he would decline the nomination for the Mayoralty . This ultimatum threw " Bess " and the other machine leaders into a panic , and they held a conference to consider the matter . They recognized that Mr. Grout was master of the situation , and that there was nothing to do but avert , if possible , the threatened blow to their party , and they quickly decided to obey his mandate . " Boss " did not relish the new turn of affairs , but be had to smother his personal feelings , so he called upon Mr. Jenks at the latter 's office in the Garfield Building , about 11. o'clock A. M. He had hardly entered the place when he was followed by Mr. Grout , and the three men were closeted together for more than an hour . When Mr. Grout and the " Boss " emerged from Mr. Jenks 's office it was settled that Mr. Jenks should retire from the ticket The committee appointed by the City Convention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 o'clock A. M. , and performed its mission . The committee was composed of Peter H. , Mirobeau L. Towns , and ? Robert Stewart , Mr. Grout thanked them , and said he would reply to them by letter to-day . He did not commit himself as to his intentions , but they understood perfectly well the reason for his reticence . There was consequently no little anxiety among the leaders for the receipt of Mr. Jenks 's promised letter of resignation . It was handed to Arthur C. Salmon , Chairman of the Notification Committee , at 4 o'clock P. M. It was as follows : BROOKLYN . Oct. 7 . I395 . To the Committee of the Judiciary Convention : Gentlemen : Through you I thank the convention for my unanimous nomination to a Justiceship of the Supreme Court . I shall not forget the steadfast devotion shown by you and by your associates , It is an honest ambition for any lawyer to strive to attain the bench . It was , and it Is. mine . I think that none can serve his fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither a decoration nor a pension ; willing to give his days and nights to untiring labor ; courteous to the youngest junior , considerate to the humblest suitor , and knowing no rule than that the great guarantee of civil liberty is the open administration of justice according to known laws , truly interpre:ed , and fair construction of evidence. - Fur myself , I should not refuse to take this place , striving with all my might to fulfill its obligations , save for considerations that seem paramount at this time . But now there is a higher duty than any that involves self-interest , however legitimate and honorable . Loyalty calls to every Democrat to turn his eyes from person to party , to the end that its progress shall not be staled or its principles flouted . There should not be discord and dismembership. but ha:mony and union . and each should concede something for the common good of an . My name has been bruited as the cause of dissension , and some have objected to my nomination in that it stands in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal unfitness or of mental lack , or were based upon my record as a man , nothing could stay me from taking this nomination , for then I should regard nothing but myself , my wife , and my children . Nay . even If the objectors did not distinctly disavow my challenge against me as a man of honor , nothing could turn me from standing in this fight . But these considerations are not up , and with entire self-respect 1 am free to take the course that best shall serve the interests of my party at the present time . I shall not permit that party to split upon the rock .4 my personal ambition , however dear and long-cherished that ambition has oeen tom , me . I am willing to show to the Democrats this sacrifice with the earnest hope that it may unite them on the lines of peace , union , and harmony , now and hereafter . I withdraw my name from the ticket as a candidate for Justice of the Supreme Court . Respectfully yours , ALMET F. JENKS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket , was promptly convened , and it met in the Court House . The committee consisted of M. F. , Arthur C. Salmon , Thomas J. Farrell , Robert Brown , Andrew Beck , and Dr. Joseph J. O'Connell . The machine leaders had already decided on Josiah T. Marean as Mr. Jenks 's successor on the ticket , and the Judiciary Committee , which met in the Supreme Court Chambers , had merely to ratify the choice of the leaders Mr. Marean was proposed by the " regulars " as a union candidate for District Attorney , and would have been acceptable to the reform wing of the party had certain requirements been complied with . " Boss " : 's position In the matter is humiliating for one who has been accustomed to give orders to Mayoralty candidates , and not to receive orders from them . The depression of spirit manifest yesterday at the machine headquarters was not reflected at the headquarters of the Democratic Party in Kings County . The new rooms of the Executive Committee , at 353 Fulton Street , were opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building and are much more commodious and cheerful than the old rooms , in Montague Street . Secretary Robert H. Roy and Elections Commissioner Charles J. Edwards were busy all day arranging for the approaching Senatorial , Assembly , and Aldermanic Conventions . As soon as . these are disposed of and the candidates are named , the work of the campaign will begin . The organization will have headquarters in every ward ' and meetings will be held throughout the city every night to arouse interest in the reform cause , Edward M. Shepard , the reform candidate for Mayor , will take the stump and lead in the work of the canvass . George Foster Peabody , Chairman of the General Committee ; Henry Hentz , A. Augustus Healy , Theodore S. Nye , D. L. Ramsey , and every other good speaker in the organization will co-operate with Mr. Shepard and do their share of the talking . The Campaign Committee will arrange for parades and pyrotechnics . It is likely that the new excursion trolley cars will be utilized for street demonstrations . Campaign glee clubs will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gayly decorated and illuminated trolley cars , displaying reform transparencies , will be run from one end of the city to the other at night . The " regulars " view these arrangements for a great crusade against machine politics with no little alarm , for they know that the reformers are better prepared than they for a vigorous campaign . The " regular " machine is suffering from a lack of funds , and economy must be observed . With few henchmen in office the machine can not assess salaries and there are few Democrats of wealth who will contribute toward its support . The result is that in some wards no headquarters have been established . In the Ninth Ward there is no " regular " Democratic headquarters , though it is one of the wealthiest wards in the city . ExMayor Boody is a resident of that ward . He is a very rich man , but since his retirement from office he has taken little interest in politics , and , although a check from him for the support of a Democratic headquarters in his ward would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Jefferson . To the reappearance on the political stage of " Boss " is ascribed the failure of wealthy Democrats still allied to the " regular " organization to subscribe , for they feel that so long as he is in control of the party it will be a discredited machine . This sentiment is known and appreciated by the young members of the " regular " organization , and there is a determination among them to cast him off for good and all after this campaign . " This will be the last political campaign in which ' Boss ' will figure prominently , " said Robert Stewart yesterday to a. ? reporter for THE NEW-YORK TIMES . " There is a big revolt ready at any moment to break out among the ' regulars . ' There will be no fight against during the campaign , but as soon as the polls clo-le election day , the agitation for his permanent retirement , and for the retirement of every leader identified with him , will begin , and it will ? not end until that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because we submit now to 's dictation we are content with the condition of affairs . We are discontented , but we do not think it wise to begin a civil war in our own ranks while fighting political enemies . " and his friends can not handle such a large General Committee as we now have , with the same ease that they manipulated smaller committees in the past , and they intend next Winter to try to haw ? its membership reduced . As soon as such a proposition is made the real fight against and his fellows will begin , and I think they will be defeated , and turned out of the organization . The opposition to them is much stronger than they think . " Josiah T. Marean . Josiah T. Marean is a Democrat , but is not connected with the regular organization . He was born in Maine , Broome County , N.
