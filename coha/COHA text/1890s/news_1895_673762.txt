Since the result of last night 's caucus of the Republican members of the House became known , politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Senatorial contest . There is a general admission of the fact that the Higgins forces have made a substantial gain . ? It is a question whether they have made a Higgins supporter of Speaker by elevating him to the chair , as he is as close as an oyster with respect to his preference for Senator , but they have at least disarmed him as an opponent . It is also clear that they have obtained . a strong following in Sussex County by giving the Clerkship to Edgar T. Hastings , a Sussex man ; the Addicks combine had a. , , Teed to give this office to New-Castle County . The Higgins leaders , however , decided to refuse the bait , and laid their plans for a break of the Addicks slate , which proved successful . It is conceded now that Senator Higgins will have the votes of Senator Alrichs and Representatives Pyle , Wilson , Walker , Reybold , Jolls , and Money , all of New-Castle County , and of Representative Townsend of Sussex  --  eight in all . Ten votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two he has chances in the votes of Senators Pierce and Moore and of Representatives Burton and Brown , all of Sussex . Addicks , it is said , is sure only of the votes of Senator Hanby of New-Castle and Representatives Ball , Moore , and Robbins of Sussex , or a total of four . Representatives Brown , Morgan , and Burton are credited with a kindly feeling for Dr. Hiram R. Burton , although their closest friends can not predict whether they would vote for Higgins or Addicks if it should come to a decision between these two . Representative Fleming of Kent County will vote for Massey , Richardson , or some other Kent man , but it is claimed he would Vote for Addieks in preference to Higgins on a choice between the two . The result . therefore , is still uncertain , with chances largely favoring Senator Higgins . The opening skirmish has resulted in his favor , although it also has shown his strength and given the opposition a chance to count his followers . Higgins is now surely the leading candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since their set-back of last night . It is still possible to form combinations that may doom Higgins to defeat . As for Addicks , however , few even of his most loyal supporters now expect him to win . He tray have the opportunity of naming the winner , but can do no more .
