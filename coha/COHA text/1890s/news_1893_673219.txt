txt If Murderers Pallister and . Roohl , who have now been free men for seven days , are recaptured , ' they will not be likely to have hard feelings against Warden Brown of Sing Sing Prison for his share in the work of hunting them down . If it depended solely upon Mr. Brown whether or not active search should be made for the murderers , it is safe to say that little would be dune toward getting those two men back in their cells . Mr. Brown is otherwise engaged just now than in looking for Pallister and Roehi . Mr. Brown i8 looking after Mr. Brown these days , and , if one may judge by his actions and sayings , he has a pretty big job on his hands . Up here in Sing Sing the villagers make statements about Mr. Brown which seem to indicate that he has a " thirst on him " compared with which Private Mulvaney 's would be but a slight tickling in the throat . Perhaps less would be said about Mr. Brown 's indulgences by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he had not recently developed the practice of handling revolvers in a playful way . If he does n't kill somebody before he quits the Wardenship , he will come off better than most persons expect him to . " He 'll shoot somebody or himself , sure as preaching , " said one of the villagers . " I never saw a man fool with a pistol as he is doing . He thinks its sport to point that big six-barrel , thirty-two calibre shooter at a fellow 's head and make believe he 's going to pull the trigger . I do n't know whether he 's drunk or sober when he does these things , but . whichever he is , he ought to be locked up for doing it . " " Brown 's at it again , " the people said the day after the escapes were discovered . Whether he was " at it " or not the reporters could not determine until , last Sunday , they were invited up into one of the rooms of his house . Then they witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , his devotion to the duties of his office , and . the dignity with which he carries himself , All the reporters who had been making the Warden 's office headquarters while waiting for the men who were " scouring " the neighborhood to report were invited to visit the Warden in his private rooms , and as soon as they were there liquid refreshments were produced in abundant quantity . It was not long before the Warden had reached the playful stage , and having exhaused his stock of ready-made yarns , which were of a questionable color , looked for more vigorous exercise . The young man who , offered to wrestle with Brown was rash , but he - was longheaded compared with the one who undertook to argue with the Warden or oppose his wishes , for when language gave out , the ' Warden did n't hesitate to reinforce his speech by means of a six-shooter , which was fully loaded and in good working order . " Am I a good company keeper ? " queried the Warden , fondling his pistol in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I guess not . Have another drink No 7 Well , I guess you 'd better , if you want ever to get out of this room . " Then the Warden would tap the table with the barrel of his " gun . ' And the visitor never cared to carry the discussion any further . After settling his dinner thoroughly by a little recreation of this kind the Warden started for a drive with one of his friends . Mr. Brown has four " record " horses , and his favorite , a pacer . is reputed to be one of the swiftest animals off the track . Probably Mr. Brown 's nerves were steady enough to drive that sort of horse last Sunday , but all the same he and his friend had an exciting time before he got home . ? The Warden was confined to his room all of Monday , and Mr. Connaughton explained to callers that he " guessed he was resting from the strain he 'd been under eversince Friday morning . " When Warden Brown put in an appearance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate the escapes , he walked with a cane and said that he had rheumatism in his right side " terribly . " He thought that he must have caught it while he was going up and down the Hudson in his yacht looking for clues on Friday . Afters Superintendent Lathrop had gone the Warden had another party in his room . and once more opened np the well-stocked bar , which a capacious closet conceals . One of the features of Mr. Brown 's party was Richard , a colored convict , who is the Warden 's body servant . Being a convict . Richard could not resent anything that is said or done to him . and one of Mr. Brown 's favorite methods of creating mirth seemed to be to put the man through some absurd performance or to drive him into a corner and make him throw up his hands at the muzzle of a revolver . Tuesday evening the Warden ordered up his pacer again and wont to drive about the town . In a few minutes he was back again and went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take another drink . " Jump in and I 'll give you a ride that 'll make your hair stand on end . " said the Warden to a NEW-YORK TIMES reporter who was standing on the prison steps . " No , but say , " he went on confidentially , " got a tip . Going to Tarrytown on a clip : ) . I 'll have those fellers both back here ini a few hours . " Am I any good ? eh 7 Well , I guess not . Come , jump in . " The possibilities of getting some important news first hand were too much fur the listener , and he jumped in . " Only thing that bothers me is I do n't know how to drive , " said the Warden . " But , say , am I any good for a companykeeper ? , No . I guess not " : and the Warden chuckled over this joke , which he used constantly , varying only the things that he " guessed he was n't good " at and the profanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If THE NEW-YORK TI3IES 'S leportor had been as easily frightened as the young man who rode with him on Sunday ho would doubtless have been as bad a wreck the next day . Before the pacer had traveled three of the six miles that separated Sing Sing and Tarry town both occupants of the road wagon were covered from head to foot with dirt , although the roads were comparatively hard , and when the horse was driven into the stable of the Franklin House , in Tarrytown , he was " wringing wet " and shaking . " I 'm right after those chaps . an ' have ' em before the night 's over , ' said the Warden . " God help ' em if I moot ' cm . ' Shoot on sigh t. " lhose are my orders . Come in an ' have a drink . Ai n't had one in twenty minutes , an ' I 'm near dead . Sav , am I any good as a ? " The barroom door closed behind him . Having ordered a quart of champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your name 's Williams , an ' you come from Byrnes 's office , see ? " said the Warden to THE NEW-YORK TIMES 'S reporter ai they crossed the hall . Then , pulling t handful of money from his pocket , he added : " Are we well fixed ? Well , I guess not . " After introducing " Williams frorc Byrnes 's office , hunting down those convicts , " to a woman in the parlor , Mr. Brown started the champagne flowing . girl brought the first bottle in . " What do you want ? " said the Warden . The girl asked for the money to pay foi the wine . " Well , I 'm broke , " he answered , as he pulled out the handful of cash again . " But my credit 's good . See I " and he pulled a revolver from the side pocket of his ulster , which he had not removed . " Oh , that 's all right . Got five of ' em , " ho wont on , shifting a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pretty well fixed , too , " and ho showed his money . The next time the girl appeared with wine the " gun " was " Bashed " again , and when the third bottle was brought the servant opened the door just far enough to set it inside on the floor and not enter herself . Mr. Brown saw the door closing , and lifting a large , four-legged stool threw it across the room against the door , on which it left a big gash , knocking a partly emptied bottle oft ' the table in its course . About 10 o'clock , when Mr. Brown and " Williams " had been in the house about two hours , a second woman appeared and a man dropped into the parlor . The man unfortunately owned a cigarette holder . The Warden got possession of it and amused himself by holding it out to its owner until he could almost reach it and then suddenly pushing the barrel of a six-shooter into the man 's line of vision . The Warden 's ability to absorb champagne seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed of . Sitting beside the woman who had come in last , with a tray that supported four glasses in his hand , Mr. Brown invited everybody to have another glass . Everybody declined , but the new-corner finally decided that she had best ' accept after all . " Nobody else have any ? " asked Mr. Brown , who constantly insisted that ho was " Warden of Sing Sing Prison until the lst of May , and do n't you forget it . " Nobody else would , and with a " Here she goes ! " the Warden throw the tray down the room , leaving a wreckage of glasses and champagne in its wake . The next moment the Warden of Sing Sing Prison was on the floor rolling over in pursuit of the glasses , A little after midnight the Warden was persuaded to give up the idea of driving home before morning and to go to bed . He had forgotten all about the clue . In the meantime nothing was known at the prison of the Warden 's whereabouts .

The people at the hotel were warned of the coming of reporters early enough on Wednesday to be on their guard , and all of the servants were told to know nothing , while the rest of the household knew less , and denied everything , except the fact that the Warden had spent the night there . Warden Brown left Sing Sing a little after 9 o'clock Wednesday morning and was gone about twelve hours . It was said that he had spent the day in New-York and had had a conference with Gen. Lathrop about the four suspended men , who were finally discharged . When he returned to the prison Warden Brown had another party in his room . " Let 's have another drink , " remarked the Warden after the party had been talking some fifteen minutes . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Warden produced his revolver . " Now , Richard , take one yourself , " said Mr. Brown to his colored servant . The convicts are never allowed any liquor , and . the man declined .

" And so the party continued , with periodical displays , of the Warden 's firearms whenever anybody started to leave , until somebody made a joke that did n't please the Warden , probably because it was a very harmless one . " Richard , open the closet . " Richard did as he was told . " Bring me my ' Winchester . " The man brought it when urged by the pistol . " Now , young feller , " said the Warden , " if you ever say a thing like that again you know what to expect .
