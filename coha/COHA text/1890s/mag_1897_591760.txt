CHEERFUL YESTERDAYS . VIII . THE CIVIL WAR . " Black faces in the camp Where moved those peerless brows and eyes of old . ' BROWNING 'S Loria . Fno*r the time of my Kansas visit I never had doubted that a farther conflict of some sort was impending . The absolute and increasing difference between the two sections of the nation had been most deeply impressed upon me by my first and only visit to a slave-mart . On one of my trips to St. Louis Ii had sought John Lynch 's slave-dealing establishment , following an advertisement in a newspaper , and had found a yard full of men and women strolling listlessly about and waiting to be sold . The proprietor , looking like a slovenly horsedealer , readily explained to me their condition and value . Presently a planter came in , having been sent on an errand to buy a little girl to wait on his wife ; stating this as easily and naturally as if he had been sent for a skein of yarn . Mr. Lynch called in three sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little mulatto girls in neat pink calico frocks suggesting a careful mother . Some question being asked , Mr. Lynch responded cheerfully , " Strip her and examine for yourself . I never have any secrets from my customers . " This ceremony being waived , the eldest was chosen ; and the planter , patting her on the head kindly enough , asked , " Do n't you want to go with me ? " when the child , bursting into a flood of tears , said , " I want to stay with my mother . " Mr. Lynch 's face ceased to be good - natured when he ordered the children to go out , but the bargain was finally completed . It was an epitome of slavery ; the perfectly matter-of-fact character of the transaction , and the circumstance that those before me did not seem exceptionally cruel men , made the whole thing more terrible . I was beholding a case , not of special outrage , but of every-day business , which was worse . If these were the commonplaces of the institution , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind , and the fact everywhere visible in Kansas of the armed antagonism of the Free State and pro-slavery parties , I readily shared the feeling - then more widely spread than we can now easily recall - of the possible necessity of accepting the disunion forced upon us by the apparently triumphant career of the slave power . It was a period when l3anks had said , in a speech iii Maine , that it might be needful , in a certain contingency , " to let the Union slide ; " and when Whittier had written in the original form of his poem on Texas , - " Make onr Union-bond a chain , We will snap its links in twain , We will stand erect again ! These men were not Garrisonians or theoretical disunionists , but the pressure of events seemed , for the moment , to be driving us all in their direction . I find that at the jubilant twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Massachusetts Anti - Slavery Society ( January 2 , 1857 ) I said , in Fanenil Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern that the joys of this evening will seem years away . To-morrow may make this evening only the revelry by night before Waterloo . " Under this conviction I took an active part with the late Francis W. Bird and a few other Republicans and some Garrisonian Abolitionists in calling a state disunion conveiition at Worcester on January 15 , // 1857 ; but the Republican party was by no means ready for a movement so extreme , though some of its leaders admitted frankly that it was well for the North to suggest that freedom was more valuable than even the Union . The Kansas question , it must be remembered , was yet impending , and it was still very possible that it might result in another Slave State , leading the way to others still . Moreover , passports were now for the first time refused to free colored men , un ( ler the Taney decision , on the ground of their not being citizens of the nation . It was also understood that , under this decision , slaveholders would be protected by the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding them there . Such things accounted for the tenporary development of a Northern disunion feeling about that time ; anti a national convention at Cleveland , following the state convention , had been fully planned by a committee of which I was chairman , the call for this receiving the names of more than six thousand signers , representing all of the Free States , - when there came the formidable financial panic which made the year 1857 50 memorable . As this calamity had begun in Ohio , and was felt most severely there , it was decide ( l that the convention should be postponed , and this , as it proved , forever . Jn the following year Senator Sewardi made his great speech in which he accepted fully the attitude , which was the basis of our position , that the whole anti-slavery contest was a thing inevitable , - an irrepressible conflict between o* ) posing and enduring forces , " - and that the United States must and would " sooner or later become entirely a slaveholding nation or entirely a free labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South must ultimately be tilled by free labor , or the farms of Massachusetts and New York must be surrendered to the rearing of slaves ; there could be no middle ground* Lincola had said , in the controversy with Douglas , " A house divided against itself can not stand . " In view of these suggestions , some of us were for accepting the situation , after our fashion , and found ourselves imitating that first mate of a vessel , who , seeing her to be in danger , and being bidden by his captain to go forward and attend to his own part of the ship , came aft again presently , touched his cap , and said , " Captain , my part of the ship is at anchor . " It was doubtless well that the march of events proved too strong for us , and that the union feeling itself was finally aroused to do a work which the anti-slavery purpose alone could not have accomplished ; yet we acted at the time according to our light , and we know from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England Abolitionists from whom lie learned that love of liberty which at last made him turn the scale . Then came the John Brown affair , as described in a previous chapter of this series ; and there followed , in the winter of 1860 , a curious outbreak in New England itself of the old proscriptive feelin There ensued an interval when the Boston Abolitionists were again called upon to combine , in order to prevent public meetings from being broken up and the house of Wendell Phillips from being mobbed . Phillips was speaking at that time on Simdays at the Boston Music Hall , and it was necessary to protect the assembly by getting men to act together , under orders , and guard the various approaches to the hall . I was placed at the head of a company formed for this l ) urpose , anti it was strange to find how little advance had been made beyond the old perplexity in organizing reformers . There was more willingness to arm than formerly , but that was all . Mr. George W. Smalley has lately given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lovers of freedom as being " well organized ; " but he // was not wholly in a position to judge , because he and another young man - the John W. LeBarnes already mentioned in connection with the abortive Virginia foray - had chivalrously constituted themselves the body-guard of Wendell Phillips , and were at his side day and night , thus being in a manner on special service . Their part of the work being so well done , they may naturally have supposed the rest to be in an equally satisfactory condition ; but as a matter of fact the so-called organization was only the flimsiest shell . It consisted , while nominally under my command , of some forty men , half of these being Germans , half Americans : the Germans were inconveniently full of fight , and the Americans hardly awakened to the possibility of it . After going through the form of posting my men at the numerous doors of the Music Hall , each as it were on picket duty , I almost always found , on visiting them half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were applauding the speakers , as if that were their main duty ; while the Germans had perhaps got into some high discussion in the corridors , ending in an exhibition of pistols and in being carried off by the police . Expostulating once with one of my nominal lieutenants , an American , I referred to a certain order as having been disregarded . " Oh , " he said calmly , " that was an order , was it ? I had viewed it in the light of a sUggestion . " Inasmuch as one or two public meetings had been broken up by gentlemen of property and standing , who at least obeyed the directions of the bully who led them , this attitude of the defenders seemed discouraging . It was too much like that croquet party in Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , where the game was disturbed by the fact that the attendants who were expected to stoop down and officiate as wickets kept constantly straightening themselves up and walking away . I spent one night on guard at Phillips 's house with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his high-bred bearing . Always aristocratic in aspect , he was never more so than when walking through the streets of his own Boston with a howling mob about him . It was hard to make him adopt ordinary precautions ; he did not care to have the police protect his house , and he would have gone to the scaffold , if necessary , I firmly believe , like the typical French marquis in the Reign of Terror , who took a pinch of snuff from his snuffbox while looking on the crowd . This was never more conspicuously the case than at the annual convention of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society , just after a meeting on the anniversary of John Brown 's execution had been broken up by a mob of very much the same social grade with that which had formerly mobbed Garrison . I did not happen to be present at the John Brown gathering , being in Worcester ; but at the larger convention ( January 24 , 1861 ) , held at Tremont Temple , I was again in service with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speakers , if needful . The body of the hall was solidly filled with grave Abolitionists and knitting women , but round the doors and galleries there was a noisy crowd of young fellows , mostly well dressed and many of them well educated , who contrived , by shouting and by singing uproarious songs , to drown the voices of the speakers , and to compel Phillips himself to edge in his sentences when the singers were out of breath . The favorite burden was , - " Tell John Andrew , Tell John Andrew , Tell John Andrew John Brown s dead ; " with more ribald verses following . It was not many months before those who took part in the meeting and those who tried to suppress it were marching southward in uniform , elbow to elbow , singing a very different John Brown song . // There was one moment during this session when it seemed as if an actual hand-to-hand conflict had come . There was a sudden movement at the doors , and a body of men came pressing toward the platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , for one , had my hand on my revolver , when the invaders proved to be Mayor Wightman with aldermen and police , on an apparently peaceful mission . He turned and announced , however , that he came to dissolve the meeting by request of the trustees of the building . This being promptly denied by the trustees , who were present , and who compelled him to read their letter , it was shown that he had been requested to come and protect the assembly instead , and this , with curious changeableness , he proceeded to attempt ; at least securing partial order , and stopping the mob from throwing down cushions and furniture from the galleries , which it had already begun to do . The speakers at this session were Phillips , Emerson , Clarke , and myself , and it was on this occasion that Phillips uttered a remark which became historic . Turning from the mob , which made him inaudible , he addressed himself wholly to the reporters , and said : " When I speak to these pencils , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My voice is beaten by theirs those of the mob , but they can not beat types . All honor to Faust , for he made mobs impossible . " At last the mayor promised the chairman , Edmund Quincy , to protect the evening session with fifty policemen ; but instead of this he finally prohibited it , and when I came , expecting to attend it , I found the doors closed by police , while a mob of assailants , under their leader , Jonas H. French , were in possession of the outer halls . A portion of these , bent on mischief , soon set off in search of it among the quarters of the negroes near Charles Street , and I followed , wishing to stand by my friends in that way , if it could be done in no other . Lewis Hayden afterwards said that I should not have done this , for the negroes were armed , and would have shot from their houses if molested . But there was only shouting and groaning on the part of the mob , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors , and I went home undisturbed . All these things looked like a coming storm . It was observable that men were beginning to use firearms more , about that time , even in New England . I find that in those days I read military books ; took notes on fortifications , strategy , and the principles of attack and defense . Yet all these preliminary events were detached and disconnected ; their disturbances were only like the little local whirlwinds that sometimes precede a tornado . There was a lull ; and then , on the day when Fort Sumter was fired upon , the storm burst and the whole community awaked . One of the first things thought of by all was the unprotected condition of Washington . It seemed to me that there was one simple measure to be undertaken for its defense , in case of danger ; so I went , on the very day when the news reached us , to several leading men in Worcester , who gave me a letter of recommendation to Governor Andrew , that I might ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let me again summon Montgomery and his men from Kansas ; going with them into the mountains of Virginia , there to kindle a back fire of alarm and draw any rebel force away froni Washington . Governor Andrew approved the project , but had no contingent fund ; Dr. S. G. Howe entered warmly into it , and took me on State Street to raise money , as did Mr. S. G. Ward , afterwards , on Wall Street in New York . One or two thousand dollars were pledged , and I went to Harrisburg to see Governor Curtin , of Pennsylvania . He said that lie would give a thousand dollars if John Brown could be brought back to life , and had my plan under consideration , when the rapid progress of events strengthened the governinent // enough to make any such irregular proceeding quite undesirable . Coming back to Worcester , I was offered the majorship of the Fourth Battalion of Infantry , then hastily called into the United States service ; and when I declined this , the position was offered to my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant of military drill , accepted it on condition that our best local drill-master , Captain Goodhue , should go with him as adjutant . My reasons for not accepting were various : first , that I doubted my competency ; secondly , that my wife , always an invalid , was just at that time especially dependent on me ; and lastly , that it was then wholly uncertain whether the government would take the anti-slavery attitude , without which a military commission would have been for me intolerable , since I might have been ordered to deliver up fugitive slaves to their masters , - as had already happened to several officers . I have often thought what a difference it might have made in both Devens 's life and mine if I had accepted this early opportunity . I might have come out a major-general , as lie did ; but . I dare say that the government gained by the exchange a better soldier than it lost . Meanwhile I went on drilling and taking fencing lessons ; and a few months later , when the anti-slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Governor Andrew to raise a regiment , and had about half the necessary ten companies provided for , in different parts of the State , when one of the sudden stoppages of recruiting occurred , and the whole affair proved abortive . It was understood with Governor Andrew that while I was to raise the regiment , I was to be only second in command , the colonel being Captain Rufus Saxton , U. S. A. , an officer with whom , by a curious coincidence , I was later to have the most intimate connection . I had been engaged upon this organization between October , 1861 , and February , 1862 , and the renewed disappointmnent was very hard to bear . In several of my printed essays , especially at the end of that called A Letter to a Young Contributor , I find traces of this keen regret ; and when finally a new nine months ' regiment , the Fifty-First Massachusetts , was called out , in August , my wife being in somewhat better health , I could keep out of the affair no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being already well known among the young men there , through the athletic clubs and drill clubs , I had little difficulty in getting much more than the required number , giving a strong nucleus for a second company , which was transferred to the command of my friend John S. Baldwin , now of the Worcester Spy . It is almost impossible here to reproduce the emotions of that period of early war enlistments . As I ventured to say in the preface to Harvard Memorial Biographies , " To call it a sense of novelty was nothing ; it was as if one had learned to swini in air , and were striking out for some new planet . " All the methods , standards , habits , and aims of ordinary life were reversed , and the intrinsic and traditional charm of the soldier 's life was mingled in my own case with the firm faith that the death-knell of slavery itself was being sounded . Meanwhile , the arts of drill and the discipline were to be learned in practice , and the former proved incomparably easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no department of science in which the elements were so readily acquired . As to the exercise of authority , however , it was different . It was no longer possible to view a command only " in the light of a suggestion . " Moreover , we were dealing with a democratic society , on which a new temporary aristocracy of military rank was to be built , superseding all previous distinction ; and the task was not light . Fortunately , I was older than many raw officers , // - being thirty-eight , - and had some very young men in my company , who had been confided to me by their parents as to a father . Within my own immediate command I had hardly a trace of trouble ; nor did I find the least difficulty in deferring to the general in command of the camp , who was by profession a working mechanic , and uneducated except in war . But the trouble was that lie was on duty only by day , returning to his home every night , during which period the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little trained either to command or to obey . Discipline was not easy , especially in the case of some newly arrived company , perhaps in a high state of whiskey ; and we had to learn to bear and forbear . I know that in the effort to enforce order I fell rapidly out of popularity , usually for my merits ; and then inexplicably fell into it again , sometimes through acts of negligence . But nobody denied that my own company was at least in good condition , and from the moment we had a permanent colonel , and an admirable one , - afterwards General A. B. R. Sprague , now mayor of Worcester , - all went as it should . I was only a month with the regiment , but the experience was simply invaluable . Every man is placed at the greatest disadvantage in a higher military command , unless he has previously sown his wild oats , as it were , in a lower ; making his mistakes , suffering for them , and learning how to approach his duty rightly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " so called , bearing upon my humble self , and vivacious enough to be widely quoted in the newspapers . It was composed , I believe , by Mrs. Sivret , of Boston , and ran as follows - " There was a young curate of Worcester Who could have a command if he d choose ter , But he said each recruit Must he hiacker than soot , Or else he d go preach where he used ter . " As a matter of fact it came no nearer the truth than the famous definition of a crab by Cuvier 's pupil , since I had never been a curate , had already left the pulpit for literature before the war , and was so far from stipulating for a colored regiment that I had just been commissioned in a white one ; nevertheless the hit was palpable , and IL always enjoyed it . I had fornied even in a short time a strong attachment to my own company , regiment , and regimental commander ; and one day , when the governor of Rhode Island had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had notified my young lieutenants , John Goodell and Luther Bigelow , that such an enterprise would be the only thing likely to take me from them . A few days after , as we sat at dinner in the Worcester barracks , I opened a letter from Brigadier-Geiieral Rufus Saxton , military commander of the Department of the South , saying that he had at last received authority to recruit a regiment of freed slaves , and wished me to be its colonel . It was an offer that took my breath away , and fulfilled the dreani of a lifetime . This was long before Massachusetts took steps in the same direction ; Kansas was enlisting a regiment of free negroes , and three similar regiments , formed by the Confederates in Louisiana , had been turned into Union troops by General Butler ; but the first regiment of emancipated slaves as such had yet to be mustered in . There remained but one doubt : would it really be a regiment , or a mere plantation guard in uniform ? This doubt could be determined only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South Carolina to inspect the situation , and saw promptly that General Saxton was in earnest , and that I could safely leave all and follow him . The whole condition of affairs at what was to be for me the seat of war was then most peculiar . General Saxton , who had been an Abolitionist even at West Point , was discharging the semi-civil func // tion of military governor . Freed slaves by thousands , men , women , and children , had been collected on the Sea Islands of South Carolina , and were being rationed , employed , and taught under the direction of missionaries , agents , and teachers from the North ; these being sometimes admirable , but sometimes incompetent , tyrannical , or fanatical . Between these and the troops there existed a constant jealousy , and General Saxton , in a position requiring superhuman patience and tact , was obliged to mediate between the two parties . M*ajor - General Hunter , at the head of the department , had been the very first to arm the blacks ( in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , to that policy , - my regiment being a revival of that early experiment ; but some of his staff were bitterly opposed to this policy , and thwarted him as soon as his back was turned , - a thing not difficult , as he was indolent , forgetful , changeable , and easily accessible to flattery . While , therefore , my regiment had a nominal support , it was constantly hindered : there were difficulties as to uniforms , medicines , and guns ; it was often necessary to struggle to obtain more than a Cinderella 's portion . This had the farther disadvantage that it tempted us , perhaps , to be sometimes needlessly suspicious ; nor was our beloved General Saxton always free from over - sensitiveness . Incidentally , also , we found that in all connection with the regular army we must come in for our share of its internal feuds ; and we discovered that old West Point grudges were sometimes being wreaked on our unoffending heads , General Saxton 's enemies occasionally striking at him through us . He , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers in regard to us , feared lest we should be sacrificed under any orders but his , and sometimes held us back from service when he might better have risked us . All these drawbacks were trifles , however , beside the pleasure of being fairly in mil itary harness , and of bringing into the public service the warlike material which many still regarded with doubt . There was also a happiness in dealing with an eminently trustful and affectionate race , and seeing the tonic effect of camp discipline upon the blacks . In this respect there was an obvious difference between them and the whites . Few white soldiers enjoyed serving in the ranks , for itself ; they accepted it for the sake of their country , or because others did , or from the hope of promotion , but there was nevertheless a secret feeling in most minds that it was a step down ; no person of democratic rearing really enjoys being under the orders of those who have hitherto been his equals . the negroes , on the other hand , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step upward to be in uniform , to have rights as well as duties ; their ready imitativeness and love of rhythm made the drill and manual exercises easy for them ; and they rejoiced in the dignity of guard and outpost duty , which they did to perfection . It is , however , a great mistake to suppose that slavery , as such , was naturally a good preparation for military life , and the officers who copied the methods of overseers always proved failures . It was necessary to keep constantly before the men that they were much more than slaves , to appeal to their pride as soldiers , to win their affection also , and then to exercise absolute justice ; and the officer who did all this could wind them round his finger . Through such influences it was needful to teach them , among other things , to obey the non-commissioned officers of their own color , and this they at first found hard . " I do n't want him to play de white man ober me , " was a frequent remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently met by explaining that color had nothing to do with it ; that they obeyed their sergeants only as those sergeants obeyed their captains , or the captains yielded to me , or I took my orders // from the generaL In a little while this became perfectly clear to their minds , and they were proud , not offended , when sent on some expedition under a sergeant of their own race . This was made easier by the fact that we had among the non - commissioned officers much admirable material ; and the color-sergeant , Prince Rivers , was not only a man of distinguished appearance , but superior in the power of command to half of the white officers in the regiment . He had previously been the swell private coachman in Charleston ; there had been a reward of one thousand dollars offered for him when he escaped from slavery ; and once , when visiting New York as General Hunter 's orderly , he had been mobbed in the street for wearing the United States uniform , and had defended himself successfully against half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the war he was appointed a justice of the peace in South Carolina . It was a fortunate thing for both General Saxton and myself that each of us had been satisfied in advance of the essential courage of the blacks . In my case this was the result of a little experience , previously related , at the Burns riot , when a negro stepped into the CourtHouse door before me ; in Saxton ' s case it came from his participation in the war between the United States troops and the Florida Seminoles , when he had observed , having both blacks and Indians to fight against , that the negroes would often stand fire when the Indians would run away . We were thus saved from all solicitude such as beset for a time the mind of that young hero , Colonel Robert Shaw , when he took the field , six months later , with his Massachusetts colored regiment . When I rode over to his camp to welcome him , on his first arrival , he said that while I had shown that negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined how they would fight in line of battle ; and I expressing no doubt on this point , he suggested that it would always be possible to put another line of soldiers behind a black regiment , so as to present equal danger in either direction . I was amazed , for I never should have dreamed of being tempted to such a step ; and he learned a lesson of more confidence when his men followed him upon the parapets of Fort Wagner , after a white regiment , in a previous assault , had lain down and refused to face the terrific fire from that almost impregnable fort . The colored soldiers afforded to me , and I think to their officers generally , no disappointment whatever in respect to courage or conduct . As General Saxton wrote to a Northern committee of inquiry as to the freed blacks , they were " intensely human . " They were certainly more docile than white soldiers , more affectionate , and more impulsive ; they probably varied more under different officers and were less individually self-reliant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more eager and impetuous than whites . They had also , in the case of my regiment , a valuable knowledge of the country . They were very gregarious , and liked to march together even on a fatigue party , singing as they marched , whereas white soldiers on such service were commonly to be seen tramping along singly . In regard to courage , there was not , I suspect , much difference . Most men have the ordinary share of that attribute ; comparatively few are adventurous ; the commander of any regiment , white or black , knew perfectly well erelong just which of his men would be likely to volunteer for a forlorn hope . Whether the better education and social position of white soldiers brought them more under the influence of what Sir Philip Sidney calls " the great appetites of honor " I can not say ; this being , it will be remembered , Sidney 's reason for expecting more courage from officers than from enlisted men . It is quite certain , on the other hand , // that any want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the black soldiers were fighting for their freedom and that of their families , this being the most potent of all motives . They used often to point out , in conversation , that they had really far more at stake than their officers had , since , if the Confederates conquered , or even if it were a drawn game , the negroes would all relapse into slavery , while their white officers would go back to the North and live much as before . This solicitude was at the foundation of all their enthusiasm ; and besides this there was their religious feeling , which was genuine and ardent , making them almost fatalists in action , and giving their very amusements that half-pious , half-dramatic character which filled the camp every evening with those stirring songs that I was perhaps the first person to put in print , and that have reached so many hearts when sung by the Hampton singers and others . Riding towards the camp , just after dark , I could hear , when within a half-mile or thereabouts , the chorus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I drew nearer , the gleam of the camp-fires on the dusky faces made the whole scene look more like an encampment of Bedonin Arabs than like anything on the Atlantic shores . Before I had joined the regiment , detachments of recruits had been sent down the coast of South Carolina and Georgia to destroy salt-works and bring away lumber ; and after it had grown to fuller size , there occurred several expeditions into the interior , under my command , with or without naval escort . We went by ourselves up the St. Mary 's River , where the men were for the first time actively under fire , and acquitted themselves well . The river itself was regarded by naval officers as the most dangerous in that region , from its great rapidity , its sudden turns , and the opportunity of attack given by the projecting bluffs . To this day I have never understood why our return was not cut off by the enemy 's felling trees , which could have been done easily at several points . We were on a " double-ender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards protected by iron plates . There was often no way of passing a sharp curve , in descending , except by running one end ashore and letting the swift current swing the other extremity round , after which we steamed downwards , the engine being reversed , till the process was repeated . At these points the enemy always mustered in numbers , and sometimes tried to board the vessel , besides pouring volleys on our men , who at such times were kept below , only shooting from the windows . The captain of my boat was shot and killed , and I shall never forget the strange sensation when I drew his lifeless form into the pilothouse which he had rashly quitted . It was the first dead body I had ever handled and carried in my arms , and the sudden change from full and vigorous life made an impression that no later experience surpassed . A more important enterprise was the recapture of Jacksonville , Florida , which had been held by the Union troops , and then deserted ; it was the only position that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , and was reoccupied ( March , 1863 ) by two black regiments under my command , with the aid of a naval gunboat under Captain ( afterwards Admiral ) Charles Steedman , U. S. N. We took a large supply of uniforms , equipments , and extra rations , with orders , when once Jacksonville was secured , to hand it over to white troops that were to be sent under Colonel John D. Rust ; we meanwhile pressing on up the river to Magnolia , where there were large unoccupied buildings . These we were to employ as barracks , and as a basis for recruiting stat ions yet farther inland . It was of this expedition that President Lincoln wrote to General Hunter ( April 1 , 1863 ) " I am glad // to see the account of your colored force at Jacksonville . I see the enemy are driving at them fiercely , as is to be expected . It is important to the enemy that such a force shall not take shape and grow and thrive in the South , and in precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall . " Our part was faithfully carried through , and no disaster occurred , though I had to defend the town with a force so small that every resource had to be taxed to mislead the enemy into thinking us far more numerous than we were ; this so far succeeding that General Finnegan - afterwards the victor at Olustee - quadrupled our real numbers in his reports . We fortified the approaches to the town , drove hack the enemy 's outposts , and made reconnoissances into the interior ; and Colonel Rust with his white troops had actually appeared , when General Hunter , with one of his impulsive changes of purpose , altered his whole plan , and decided to abandon Jacksonville . Once more , after the arrival of General Gillmore , we were sent up a Southern river . A night was chosen when the moon set late , so that we could reach our objective point a little before daybreak ; thus concealing our approach , and having the whole day to work in . It was needed on the South Edisto , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of palings which it took the period of a whole tide to remove , and which , had not my lieutenant - colonel ( C. T. Trowbridge ) been an engineer officer , could not have been displaced at all . Even then only two out of our three small steamers could ascend the shallow stream ; and of these , one soon grounded in the mud , and the other was disabled by a shore battery . The expedition - which should never have been sent without more accurate local reconnoissances - failed of its nominal end , which was the destruction of a railway bridge utterly beyond our reach . My own immediate object , which was recruiting , was accomplished , but at the final cost of health and subsequent military opportunities . As I stood on the deck , while we were in action with a shore battery , I felt a sudden blow in the side , doubling me up as if a Sullivan or a Fitzsimmons had struck nie . My clothes were not torn , but very soon a large purple spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole side , and for weeks I was confined to bed . I had supposed it to have been produced by the wind of a ball , but the surgeons declared that there could be no ecehymosis without actual contact , and that I must have been grazed by a grapeshot or an exploded shell . This was to have found myself only half an inch from death , yet , in Mercutio 's phrase , it was enough . I was long in hospital , my life being saved from the perils of peritonitis , I was told , by the fact that I had never used whiskey . I came North on a furlough in 1863 ; went back too soon , as men often did ; found the regiment subdivided and demoralized ; and having to overwork in bringing it into shape , with the effects of malaria added , I had ultimately to resign in the autumn of 1864 , after two years ' service , foregoing all hopes of further military experience . Up to this time I had stood the influence of a malarial climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major , a somewhat frank and outspoken personage , the assurance that I was " tougher than a b'iled owl . " During a part of my invalidism I was sheltered - together with my surgeon , who was also ill - by my friend Mrs. Jean M. Lander , widow of the celebrated General Lander , and well known in earlier days on the dramatic stage , - a woman much respected and beloved by all who knew her fine qualities . She had tried to establish hospitals , but had always been met by the somewhat whimsical hostility of Miss Dorothea L. Dix , the national superintendent of nurses , a lady who had something of the habitual // despotism of the saints , and who had somewhat exasperated the soldiers by making anything like youth or good looks an absolute bar to hospital employment ; the soldiers naturally reasoning that it assisted recovery to have pleasant faces to look upon . One of Miss Dix 's circulars read thus : " No woman under thirty years need apply to serve in government hospitals . All nurses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be browa or black , with no bows , no curls or jewelry , and no hoopskirts . " Undaunted by this wellmeant prohibition , Mrs. Lander , who was then a little more than thirty , but irreclaimably good looking , came down to Beaufort , South Carolina , accompanied by her mother , in the hope of establishing a hospital there . A sudden influx of wounded men gave General Saxton , erelong , the opportunity of granting her wish , and she entered with immense energy into her new task . She had on her hands some fifty invalid soldiers , and had for their use an empty building , which had yet to be fitted up , warmed , and properly furnished ; even the requisite beds were difficult to obtain . She would come in abruptly some morning and say to Dr. Rogers and myself , " Gentlemen , to - day I must remove every bedstead in this house to the hospital building . You have blankets ? " We could only meekly respond that we had blankets , and that the floor was wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gentlemen , this day the cooking-stove goes ! Your servants can cook by the open fire ? " Oh yes , our servants could easily nianage that , we replied , and accepted the inadequate results . One day there came a rap at the old-fashioned door-knocker , and Mrs. Lander , passing swiftly through the hall , flung the portal open regally , as if it were in Macbeth 's palace . We heard a slender voice explaining that the visitor was the Reverend Mr. So-and-So from New York , just arrived by steamer . " Mr. So-and-So ? " said our prima donna . " Delighted to see you , sir ! Can you dress wounds ? " - this in Siddons tones . The poor man started back , and said apologetically , " Spiritual wounds , madam ! " " No time for that , sir , now , - no time for that ; there are still thirty men in yonder hospital with no beds to lie on ; we must secure the common comforts first . " Timidly explaining that he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been recoinmended to her for " a comfortable lodging , " the pallid youth withdrew . It was no fault of his that he was forlorn and useless and decidedly in the way at a military station ; but I could not help wondering if , after his return , he would preach a sermon on the obvious deference due to man as the military sex , and on the extreme uselessness of women in time of war . I have given few details as to my way of living in South Carolina and Florida , because much of it was described a few years after in this magazine , and again in a volume called Army Life in a Black Regiment , which was translated into French by Madame de Gasparin in 1884 . There was plenty that was picturesque about the life , and there were some things that were dangerous ; we all fought , for instance , with ropes around our necks , the Confederate authorities having denied to officers of colored regiments the usual privileges , if taken prisoners , and having required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never believed that they would execute this threat , and so far as we were concerned they had no opportunity ; but the prospect of hanging was not a pleasant thing even if kept in the background , nor was it agreeable to our friends at home . In other respects my life in the army had been enjoyable ; but it had been , after all , one of somewhat obscure duty . I had once received from an officer , then high in influence , what was equivalent to an offer of promotion , // if I would only write a letter to Senator Sumner asking for it ; but this I had declined to do . As my promotion to a colonelcy had come unsought , so , I preferred , should any higher commission . For nominal rank I cared little , and I should have been unwilling to leave my regiment ; but I should have liked to see great battles and to fill out my experience through all the grades , if it had been possible . I came nearest to this larger experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I should have commanded a brigade had not my regiment been ordered back , even after being actually embarked for Florida . I never felt at all sure how far up in the service I might have climbed , even under the most favorable circumstances ; for that was always a hard thing to predict of any one , in those days , even apart from the frequent occurrences of favoritism and injustice . I saw around me men who had attained a much higher position than mine without a greater outfit , perhaps , of hrains or energy ; but whether I could have shown that wide grasp , that ready military instinct , which belong to the natural leader of large numbers , I can never know ; and I am afraid that I might always have been a little too careful of my men . Certainly , I should have been absolutely incapable of that unsparing and almost merciless sacrifice of them which made the reputation of some very eminent officers ; while for the mere discharge of ordinary duty I might have been as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that marked military talent is a special gift , and a man who has not had the opportunity can no more tell whether he would have displayed that faculty than a man who has never learned chess can tell whether he might or might not have developed into a champion player . For the final result , my saga6ious elder brother felt content , he told me , that I should leave the army with the rank of colonel only . He said , with his accustomed keen philosophy , " A man may go through his later life quite respectably under the title of colonel , but that of general is too much for a civilian to bear up under , and I am glad you stopped short of it . " For myself , I felt that to have commanded , with fair credit , the first slave-regiment in the Civil War was well worth one man 's life or health ; and I lived to see nearly two hundred thousand ( 178,975 ) black soldiers marching in that column where the bayonets of the First South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two years of army life , with small access to books , had so far checked the desire for literary pursuits , on my part , that I should have actually preferred not to return to them . I should have liked better to do something that involved the charge and government of men , as for instance in the position of agent of a large cotton-mill . This mood of mind was really identical with that which led some volunteer officers to enter the regular army , and others to undertake cotton-raising at the South . In few cases did this impulse last long ; a regular army career in time of peace usually proving unattractive , as did also the monotony of the plantation . In my own case this unsettled feeling soon passed away , and the old love of letters revived ; the editing of the Harvard Memorial Biographies affording an easy transition . The change to the ways of civil life , however , involved almost as great a transformation of tastes and habits as the original enlistment had brought ; and this being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which to close this series of Cheerful Yesterdays , with the understanding that in a succeeding volume of this magazine I may add a few more papers , under detached titles , in order to give a certain semblance of completeness to this whole retrospect of a somewhat varied career .
