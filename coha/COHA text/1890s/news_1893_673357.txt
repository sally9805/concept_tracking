txt Do the people of this State propose to elect a criminal to the Court of Ap peals Bench ? Popular suffrage has sometimes raised base persons to high places , but it has rarely done itself so ill a turn as that . It would be a hideous travesty of tree institutions . The bad rulers of history who have appointed corrupt Judges have done so because they wished justice to be perverted for their self-interest . The interest of the people , altogether and without exception , is served by upright Judges and equal and exact justice . Through indifference or laziness the people of the State of New York may stupidly allow MAYNARD to be elected . It is inconceivable that they can affirmatively desire his election . Mr. MAYNARD stole and suppressed a corrected election return , allowed the false return to be counted by the canvassers , he being present and not protesting , and through this crime , punishable under the Penal Code by five years ' imprisonment , his party gained a seat in the State Senate to which it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate . The people had voted the other way . Judge MAY , NARD 's act thwarted their will . It was in its nature and intent one of the gravest crimes known to the laws of a republic . It was so pronounced by the committee of the Bar Association . By that committee , composed of the most eminent lawyers in this city , many of them Democrats , MAYNARD was declared to have been guilty of suppressing the corrected return and conniving at the counting of the illegal one . There is no room for doubt about the facts . The candidate nominated by the Republicans for this office is a member of the New-York bar of good standing and excellent character . The only way to defeat MAYNARD is to vote for BARTLETT . If Mr. PLATT will support his candidate in good faith , the vote of protest against MAYNARD , added to the Republican vote , will be sufficient to elect him .
