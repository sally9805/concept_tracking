txt It was a very striking picture ? of British opinion with regard to American credit that Mr. WILLIAM M. Ivxs gave in TILE TLMES yesterday morning . British  --  opinion of the operation-of the Sherman law is the same , plainly , as intelligent American opinion , and is imporant chiefly because it contfols the investment of large amounts of money of which we have need . But the Sherman law is not the only thing that stands in the way of our getting the money that we need . Snspieion of the honesty of the management of the enterprises they are asked to invest in is a very unpleasant feature to encounter among borrowers just now , as Mr. IviNs says , and as many borrowers have had occasion to know , it is particularly excited by the operations of the American Cordage Company and the Reading Railroad . That is not surprising , . for these operations have been . about as bad as they well could be . Our readers have been made fairly familiar with them . Obtaining money on false pretenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fine assortment of the various processes which men can use with a colorable authority , but which disclose on a large scale the cunning and unscrupulousness of the sneak thief , have either been proved or reasonably inferred in these records . The . natural reply to foreign investors who cite them is that these cases are exceptional , as well-informed Americans know that they are , and that they are no worse and no more indicative of the character of the general management of corporations than cases that might be cited in other countries , such as that of the Balfour swindles in England and the Panama scheme in France . This reply is obviously inadequate unless the foreign investor can be made to understand exactly what are the limits of these-exceptions , and that any specific enterprise in which he is asked . to put his money does not fall within them ? which is an arduous task . Nor is it any special advantage for Americans to be able to show that there are rascals in England and France . It averts a certain odious comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be far better if we could prove that our system of doing business made success for rascals very difdcult , if not impossible . This can be done in part-by law , but not wholly . The system of law that will prevent rascality on a large scale has not yet been invented . The best that has ever been tried is , in effect , a lever of an uncertain and insufficient action , for the very simple reason that there is no motive strong enough , direct , and sustained enough to put it in operation and keep it working until its object is achieved . Probably the probity and the energetic sense of duty in the officers of the law are as stROng in England as in any other country , and there , more than in almost any other country , rascality is sure of punishment , and yet rascality does now and then flourish on , a most portentous scale . Prevention , so far as it is possible at all , must be obtained from another source . In our judgment . it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably larger amount than new , through the action of the Stock Exchange . There is already a certain amount of valuable supervision exercised over securities there dealt in . It is , We-think , capable of extension and development . It might be founcipraeticable to establish-well-defined and pretty effective conditions to the sale of securities on the Exchange and to affix effective penalties to corporate acts of bad . faith . The Exchange does not now hesitate to punish dishonorable conduct in its members in matters directly connected - with its business . We believe that this principle . which is a sound . one , might be effectively applied over a broader field . Certainly the task would not be an easy one , and it would re -- quire a high order of both character and judgment in those charged with it . But as regards a very large part of the work of the Exchange , the principle that honesty is the best policy is vigorously and severely carried out , and this would be only an extension of its working . The Exchange has it in its power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them honestly , and it would be a very great gain , not only generally , but to the Exchange itself , if that power were exercised as far and as thoroughly as possible .
