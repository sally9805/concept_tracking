A COLONY OF THE UNEMPLOYED . I. IF the world of work has its interest for the social economist , no less has the world out-of-work for every student of social aims and conditions . It may be divided like the earth into two great hemispheres , - the one half that will not work , and the other half that can not work " because no man has hired them . " One of these hemispheres I had explored in several countries . I had found its inhabitants in England , Germany , and America thoroughly committed to the theory of living without work , choosing rather mendicancy or depradation . I became irresistibly drawn to the other half , and resolved on as practical a study of the man out of work by no fault of his own as I had made of the tramp who is accustomed to boast that he can live better without work than with it . Being in Germany , I began on the spot . Thanks to a good philanthropist , and fortunately for my purpose , there was accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the out - of - work at close range . It is called die Arbeiter-Kolonie , and there are at present twenty-seven colonies scattered throughout time empire . Pastor von Bodelschwingh , the philanthropist referred to , the superintendent of the large Epileptics ' Hospital near Hanover , started the first one about fourteen years ago in the town of Bielefeld in Westphalia . At that time Germany was literally overrun by tramps . Two hundred thousand were arrested every year , and the poorhouses and shelters were full to overflowing . In 1882 , von Bodelschwingh conceived // the idea of establishing labor colonies , or refuges , where unemployed men , able and willing to work , nmight go , and at least pay their way until more profitable labor was found . His plan was to make it impossible for the beggar to say that there was no place where he could find shelter , and that therefore he must beg . The colony in Westphalia proved so useful that others soon sprang up in other parts of the country , and , as I said , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bremen , where men who have proved themselves particularly deserving in other colonies may acquire a piece of land and eventually set up independent homes of their own . Each applicant for help must promise to stay in a colony at least four weeks , after which he can go or stay longer , as he pleases , provided no work has been found for him outside . The authorities try to keep in touch with all employers seeking labor , and the moment they can recQmmead a man they do so , in order that seine other out - of - work may take his place . The colonies are supported in the main by private charity and the proceeds of the work of the colonists . In some cases the district in which a colony is situate ( l helps it out of the public funds , and in Berlin a society of several thousand members contributes largely to the maintenance of the colony there . Each member pays a specified annual fee , and receives a number of tickets , which entitle him to send men to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found for them and they prove themselves worthy . I chose the Berlin colony , or rather its branch at Tegel , outside the city , for my investigations . It is one of the very few found near laro-e towns , and it offers on this account the better opportunity for study , because of the congestion of the labor market in a commercial centre . German farmers often complain that there are not laborers enough to reap their harvests , while in the cities the workingman often has to sell his labor at ruinous prices . I applied to the director of the colony , stating frankly to him my purpose , and asked if I might be received as a regular colonist , to work , eat , and sleep with the men , and see not only the workings of the institution , but the lives of the inmates as well . After testing my honesty in the matter , the director granted my request and sent me to the branch at Tegel , where no one could know anything of me or my errand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon when I presented myself in tramp garb at the little brick office and asked for admission . I had with me my American pass , and a letter from the director of the main colony to the effect that I was " all right " and should be taken in without hesitation . By rights I should also have had an Ar6eitsbueh , which every German workingmaa must carry , - it contains his recommendations and the police stamp of the different towns in which he has worked , - but the director 's letter explained my being without one . Thinking that I did not understand much German , - and I was careful , for reasons easily understood , not to make him think differently , - the Hausoater , or overseer , mem-ely asked me the ordinary questions . I had to tell where I was born , how old I was , what trade I had , where I had worked last , whether I had ever been in prison , where I had come from , and whether I was married , single , divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given a contract to sign , to the effect that I would obey all the rules of the colony and remain at least a month , unless I should find work outside . By the rules I was bound to work to the best of my ability and show every respect to the officials , who were the Hausvater , a young theological student acting as pastor . and a foreman who superintended matters when the Hausvater was absent ; these were the only outsiders in any way connected with the // institution . I was also cautioned against making any irreverent remarks about the Bible and religion , and was told that the first offense would be punished with immediate dismissal . The contract signed and stamped , I was received into the corporation , and was assigned at once to the " straw factory section , " where I was expected to learn how to make straw cases for wine bottles . I remained at this work throughout my stay in the colony . The daily programme was as follows : We rose in the morning at five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attended prayers , and were off to work by six . At nine there was a short pause for lunch , after which we resumed work until neon . From twelve to one was the dinner hour . After dinner we worked on until seven , with a short pause at four for another lunch . After supper we sat around in the woods and garden until half past eight , when we had evenin g prayers . At nine everybody was suppose ( l to be in bed . Ou Sunday there was no work , and after church in the morning we were free to lie about in the woods . I received in payment for my labor a mark a day . No one received less than this , and some made as much as a mark and a half . These were colonists who worked in the forest , clearing the ground where a penitentiary is to be built , or those who managed the machines in the straw factory and were paid by the piece . There were several men who had no less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of every man 's earnings seventy-five pfennigs a day were taken to pay for food and lodging . The food wus simple , but abundant . For breakfast we had a bowl of gruel and a slice of black bread ; for lunch ( at nine and four ) , black coffee and bread and butter ; for dinner , broth , potatoes , and meat , all in one dish ; for supper , tea and bread . I can not say that the food was as nourishing as I should have liked , and I often heard the men grumble , but for seventy-five pfennigs a day one could not expect more . The beds were fuinished with mattresses , l ) illOwS , blankets , and sheets , and were fairly comfortable . I slept in a room with six other men ; most of the colonists were in a larger room close by . On Saturday afternoon a little store was opened in the garden , where the men could buy tobacco , shirts , collars , socks , handkerchiefs , toothbrushes , suspeimders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate account , and whatever he bought was put down in a little book , shown to him every week . On Sunday afternoon all ne'v-comers were called to the l ) astor 's room , where he talked with them confidentially about their life , supplementing the questions put to them officially in the office . He is a practical religionist , and looks after all the interests of the men and their positions outside . He thought , like the Hausvater , that I was quite helpless in German , so my encounter with him was short . As I was leaving his room , however , he asked again , ns if the thought had just come to him , " Have you ever been in prison ? ' * Afterward , when my identity was discovered and I was no longer a colonist , lie told me that men often tell him the truth when the question is put to them in this way . So much for the routine iii the colony . I have hurried over it in order to tell about the colonists rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily task to fulfill . IL . There were in all forty-two men in the colony while I was there ; in winter there are over a hundred . Mechanics and common laborers were most numerous , but there were others who had been druggists , school-teachers , clerks , officials in the civil service , cadets and o*Acers in the army , students in the university , lawyers , merchants , and even noblemen . Each one had fallen very low , and fully half had been forced to ask the Haus // vater to give them clothes to cover their nakedness . Not all were willing to talk about their careers , and there were some who , the minute work was over , retired into corners and would commune with no one , but I succeeded in gathering more or less definite information about the most of them . First of all aud most noticeable of all were the boys and young men . They numbered fully a third of the colonists , and were by all odds the easiest to get acquainted with . They had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still before them , and they talked freely and without reserve with all who would listen . They were mainly Handwerksburschen , - apprentices who have learned trades and travel about the country from one master to another . They had taken shelter in the colony , partly because there was no other place for them , and partly to get a fresh Arbeitsbuch . For those who tramp the highways in Germany as the Handwerksburschen do it is not allowed to be out of work longer than six weeks , unless they have been ill , and the gendarmes can tell from their books when and where they last had a position . A great many succeed in eluding the officers , and rove for months without even asking for work . It often happens , however , that when they do seek work their books are in such bad order that no one will employ them , and there is then nothing better for them to do than go into an Arbeiter-Kolonie , where they can get a fresh stamp in their books , which allows them , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molest them . Not all Handxverksburschen are so unprincipled as this , but there are so many who are that their class has become notorious , an ( l those whom I met in the colony were exclusively of this character . All of them said they could have found work had they wanted to , but preferring to travel about and see the country , they had got in to the trouble I have de scribed . They were not tramps in the sense in which the American hobo is a tramp , and most of theta intended to look for work on leaving the colony , but they were so possessed of Wanderlust that until they had satisfied it there was not much hope of their settling down . Each one had traveled all over Germany , and several had been in every country of Europe . England and the United States seemed to be their IMecca , and they called their desire to visit these countries die Englische Krankke it . The larger part of the colonists were men all the way from thirty to fortyfive or fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there were also men who had fallen from higher walks of life . The latter were easily marked by their love of seclusion and by a refinement of manner which , try as they would , they could not entirely conceal . They called themselves Arbeiter , like the rest , but bits of their stories had leaked out , and it was known to everybody that they had seen better days . One of them , a poor fellow whose misfortunes had unbalanced his mind , I learned to know personally . I never found out what lie had really been , - some thought a lawyer , - but the story he gave me was this : He belonged , he said , to a very distinguished family , settled in a little l ) rovince of its own on time river Oder , not far from Stettin . It is a custom in this family for some one of each generation to live his life among the poor , and lie had been chosen for this task . While still a little child lie was put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his father or mother . He managed , however , to get an education , and lie told me that he had been a military officer in Turkey , a journalist in France , a barrister in England , and a labor agitator in the United States . While in Turkey he had marned , and two children , a boy and a girl , were born to him . He had returned to Germany in order to compel his family // to receive these children into the old home . lie did not nican to ask anything for himself ; he believed , indeed , that Providence had willed that he should live his life in just this way , but he was ( letermined to carry the case of the children to the very highest courts , if necessary . Sometimes , when off duty , I would find him mumbling to himself in the gar ( len , and it was always concerning his case in the courts , and that he " was going to conduct it himself . " I have seldom met a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the colony ; nearly everything he had on had been borrowed from the Hiausvater , yet his poor deluded brain made him think that he was the most aristocratic of all . lie called himself Count Adrian-Hohenstein . Another man , who had been a druggist , was also interesting . His great theme was America , and how any one with a will is bound to get on there . His own case illustrated the fact , he said . He had lived nearly fifteen years in the United States , and there was not a day when he was without work , if he wanted it . In Milwaukee he had been a police station janitor , in San Francisco a lawyer 's clerk , in Chicago a news-vender , in New York an independent druggist , and for three years he had been cook on a steamer plying between New York and Brazil . Wherever he had gone he had made money , and wherever he had stopped he had , unfortunately , spent it . He returned to Germany by mistake . Stranded in Rio Janeiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound for Copenhagen , in order to get out of the country . Landed in Copenhagen , his earnings soon went for liquor , and the first thing he knew he was in Germany , a wandering beggar . lie was working in the colony to get money enough to cross over to England , wher ehehoped to ship for New York . He was sure that luck would again favor him when once out of verdammt Deutschland . There were several men of this stamp , and all seemed to have fallen through drink . They wanted work , and did willingly their tasks in the colony , but I fear they could not hold any position long . The other men of the class I am considering were ordinary day laborers . They were in the colony because they had been unable to find even a breadand-water existence outside . Wherever they had been , and particularly in Berlin , no employer needed their services , and they were trying to earn a few marks to help them on their travels when they left the colony . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havoc with them , also , but they were by no means such victims of drink as the men whom I have described . Their greatest mistake had been in seeking work in large towns . They were part and parcel of that large army in Germany continually storming the cities , and once enlisted they had not been able to return to the farm . They had tramped from city to city , asking for work in each one , but had foolishly passed by the villages , where , at least in summer , farmers often bid high for laborers . They had acquired the passion for town life , and even hunger could not drive them farther away from it than out to Tegel , where they still heard the roar of the neighboring city . Their class is uncommonly large in the Fatherland , and is likely to keep on growing until something definite is done to force them back to the fields . This is where most of them belong , and the wonder is that Germany , with its all - powerful paternal government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities . I believe that they honestly desire work , but they must be made to seek it where it can be found . Berlin could dispense with thousands of them without in the least disturbing its business , and the pity is that they are permitted to remain . Last of all in my observations came // the old men , of whom there were about ten in the colony . Nearly all had trades , but they were too old to ply them satisfactorily . One said to me : " When I ask for work , people say , Why , father , what can you do ? ' and then they smile , give me a piece of bread , and tell me that my hair is too white . The world is not what it used to be . In 48 they preferred old men to young ; to-day it is just the opposite . All that an old man can do now is lie down and die . " There was something indescribably pathetic about these old men , as they gatliered together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable , but I could not help wondering why they had not saved something to keep them in old age . They were all intelligent , well-read men , and several had had very good positions in their day , yet not one had a home to which he could return . Some had been married and had children , but either the latter would not receive them , or the old men were too proud to seek them out . They fussed about the colony , doing light work in the factory and household , each one anxious to keep up his end , if possible , but their outlook was hopeless . No employer could make use of them , and without the colony they must have given up the struggle . I could not bring myself to the point of asking any of them outright for the story of their lives , - it seemed cruel to make them hark back in detail over the mistakes and failures which had brought them here ; but from remarks dropped now and then in general conversation , I managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , a Silesian , interested me particularly . He was over sixty , and had come to Tegel from another colony in Schleswi*-Holstein where he had spent several months . He worked next to me in the factory , and at lunch-time we occasionally talked together about our travels . I told him about America , and he told me about Poland , Russia , and Hungary . He had been all over these countries , and spoke the different languages besides several dialects . He knew south Russia best , however , and from little things that he said I concluded that he had fled there with his parents after the revolution in Baden in 49 , of which he had considerable to say . From his conversation one would have taken him for something more than a simple locksmith , and he had the manner of a man who had been brought up in polite society , but he assured me that whatever education he had , had been acquired by his own efforts . His great trouble in life , the one indeed by which he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he put it . The revolutionary spirit was in him , and he had got into trouble in every country he had visited . In Hungary he had served three years in prison , in Poland two , and in Russia there was a sentence of exile to Siberia standing against him . He did not look like a dangerous man , and many of his political notions could have been subscribed to by any American , but T was told by other colonists that he was one of the most violent Socialists in Germany . Another old man had been unfortunate in his married life , and his wife was consequently much blamed for his sad state . He could not hear the word " woman " mentioned without exclaiming , " Langes Haar und kurze Gedanken ! " Through some short-siglitedness of his wife - I did not learn what - he had lost his home in Thiuringia , and had never been able to found another . For fully a third of his fifty-odd years he had been wandering about Europe , working wherever lie could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned it . He lost his ambition to save , he said , when his home was taken away from him . Still another of the old men had made a wreck of his life by trying to patent his inventions . He told me of a num // her of things which he had invented , among them a wrench in use at the colony factory , but he had invariably lost them through the meanness of unscrupulous lawyers . I liked him for the simple-hearted way in which he took his troubles . There was always a pleasant smile on his fatherly face , and I fail to recall a bitter word from his lips . All he would say , was , " Ich hab ' kein Gliick gehabt . " There was one other who I think mioht easily prove a specimen for Loinbroso . He was not an old man , but I have reserved his case till now because his peculiarity has nothing to do with the conditions in relation to which I have considered the others . He ought lone since to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured as a significant study in criminology . Sometime in his career , I do not know exactly when , he had killed a man by holding his head under water in a lake . There was no particular enmity between the two men , and the murderer seems to have acted merely on a natural inclination to be cruel . He suffered but ten years ' imprisonment for the crime , his lawyer having made out that lie was not entirely in his right mind . He had drifted into the colony , like the rest , to find shelter . The curious thing about him was , that he killed everything he dared . He saw a bird'snest one day in a tree in the garden ; it was full of little birds . Down they mn3t come , and the cat was called to eat them up . lie looked on and grinned . There was a dog in a corner of the garden . He plagued it to distraction ; he wonI ( l have strangled it , he said , had he not been afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ants ' nests , which he rooted out and then stamped on the ants . Flies he liked to pick to pieces . His attitude toward the other men was that of cold indifference . He always tried to get more than his share of the food , and I never saw him do a favor or ask one . At prayers and in church he was the most devout of all : he sang louder than any one else , and followed the readings in the Bible with the closest attention . He was one of the few real moral delinquents it has been my privilege to meet , and I have taken note of him on account of the genuineness of the type . Such were my companions in the colony . I am convinced that the great majority of them desire work , and look for it , as a rule , rather than beg , but I can not say that I found in them the outof-work I was seeking - sufferers from a dearth in the labor market , and unemployed through no fault of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution who did not seem to me more or less responsible for his condition , and I understand that this is the case in all the labor colonies of Germany . In 1895 , sixtyfour per cent of all the colonists received at Tegel and at the main colony in the city had been confined at least once in a jail , workhouse , or penitentiary . About nine hundred were *dmitted during this year , and they came from all parts of the country , and represented nearly all branches of industry . They may be taken as a fair sample of unemployed men in Germany , and I feel safe in saying that the forty-two I learned to know were equally typical . III . The most alluring thing to me , in my intercourse with these men , was to get at their opinions and philosophy of life . They were all great travelers , had seen much and heard much , and I trie ( l to find out what they thought about people and things in general . There was not much time to talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we had turned in , they often chatted for an hour or more , and I then had a chance to hear their views . I can not attempt here more than a brief summary of what they said , but I assure the reader that they were // most interesting to listen to . Germany an ( l its present condition was the absorbing topic of conversation . Although the men had traveled much in other countries , the " Fatherland " was , after all , their home , and they enjoyed telling each other of the reforms which , in their opinion , were necessary to make it habitable . No country that they had visited suited them entirely , not evea America , but they found so many things out of order in Germany that they could not keep off the subject long . There were four institutions which they particularly disliked , - the church , the monarchy , the army , and the police . Nearly everything they said in criticism bore directly or indirectly on these institutions , and II fail to recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was not the subject of discussion . The church they considered antiquated , hypocritical , and oppressive . There was no distinction made between Protestant and Catholic , and the entire institution was condemned . It was antiquated , they thought , " because it teaches thins * which all the world knows are no longer true ; " hypocritical , " because the clergy , as a class , do not live up to what they preach ; " and oppressive , " because it taxes people who do not believe in it . " They also said that it is much to blame for the ignorance that prevails in the peasant class . " In no other country , " one declared , " are the peasants so stupid and bigoted as here , and the Pfaffen* are the cause of it . They go about and tell the peasants that they must vote and think the way the church wants them to , and they are just fools enough to do it . Down with the Pfaffen , I say ! " Very few of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their own private religious ideas , and were perfectly sincere in stating them . They believed that there is a great Power which regulates the world , but not a personal God , or indeed One to whom prayers may be offered . They consid ered the devotional exercises in the colony ridiculous , and attended them merely because attendance was compulsory . As to what happens after death , which was one of their favorite themes when discussing the church , a great deal was said , but there seemed to be no unanimity of opinion . One man declared that he did not believe in heaven and hell at all , as popularly depicted . He thought that when a man dies , the good in him , spiritual as well as physical , is used again in this world , and that the bad is destroyed . lie talked for nearly two hours On ' this subject , one night , and seemed to be well informed about all religions . He often asked me about the different sects in America , and was the only colonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were most peculiar in this respect , considering their general intelligence . I had told them that I did not belong to the so-called evangelical church of Germany , and the rumor spread about that I was a heathen . I finally received the nickname of " Heide . " This was not meant in any unfriendly way , but merely as a name to go by . A great deal is being done just now in Germany to win such men as these back to the church , and there are those who prophesy sore disaster to the state unless the present estrangement is overcome . The Christian Socialists are particularly fearful of this result . I can not forbear reporting one of the comments which a colonist made on a certain phase of German methods to convert men of his kind . On entering the colony , every man is told that he must thank Providence alone for the benefits there conferred upon him . " One would think , " the man said apropos of this , " that human nature was incapable of charity . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my good man , because I want to help you ' ? It would impress me a great deal more than continually talking about Providence . " The criticisms of the monarchy , army , // and police were pretty much what any man of their stamp , who had learned to know more liberal forms of government , would have made . They considered the monarchy the result of the stupidity of the people , - such a thing should never have been allowed , - and the army and police institutions devised to prot , ect it . " If we had never had a monarchy , " said one of the old men , " we should never have had the army . It is for something more than merely to fight France . They have it so that they can keep us poor people down , if we should ever try to revolt , - that s the bottom of the whole business . Kaiser Wilhelm sees that things are getting hotter and hotter for him , and he hangs on to his soldiers , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know these emperors and kings ! What did they do in 49 ? Crowded us into corners and then jabbed at us with bayonets . Our time will come , though ; just wait . Some day we 11 do the jabbing . " Not all were so revolutionary as this , and for the boys and young men the army seemed to have certain attractions , but there was a general tendency to put the blame for the present feeling of unrest among the laboring classes on the institutions in question . The monarchy was too despotic , the army too expensive , and the police too overbearing . But very little was said about economic conditions or the overcrowding of the labor market . Each man appeared to think that these questions would settle themselves , if the others were once solved . " I would rather have liberty , " one of the mechanics remarked , " than good wages , but you ca n't find either in Germany now . All I save from my earnings has to go in taxes , and all I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning to move on . That s a nice state of affairs for hochcultiviertes Deutschland , is n't it ? And he sneered . Three remedies were suggested to bet VOL . LXXVIII. - NO. 470. 51 ter the existing condition of things , and I give them in the order of their radical nature . The first was a republican form of government . This was the scheme of the old men . They thought that if Germany could only have a President instead of an Emperor , everything would improve . I said to one that Germany was not yet ready to become a republic , that the people were still too much attached to the monarchy . " Bosh ! " he exclaimed . " All we have to do is to send the Kaiser out of the country , and put a President and the Reichstag in his place . We are as ready for that as we shall ever be . If the army were disbanded , we would soon show what we want . The trouble is that the soldiers stick by the Kaiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do anything . " The subject was so dear to the old man that it was impossible to discuss it with him calmly , and all I could get out of him , or the others who favored it , was the simple declaration that cine Republik witrde alles dndern . Socialism was the next suggestion . It was upheld mainly by the middleaged colonists , who were nearly all members of the Social Democratic party . They had sat at the feet of Bebel and Liebknecht , and , like the other followers of these strenuous agitators , would listen to no reform other than that of a complete reconstruction of society . " The whole thing must be changed , " said one , " and until it is the poor man will be kept down . " They made the usual remarks about " unearned increment " and " the exploitation of the proletariat , " and seemed to be well up in the general terminology of their cult . I tried to get from two or three of them clear statements of exactly what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change was to be brought about , but I could obtain nothing beyond the usual promises of the millennium . They seemed to me to be seeking merely a general overthrow of society that they // might enjoy for the moment the riotous living that would follow , and I can only say that if the rank and file of German socialism is equally indefinite in its ideals and the means whereby they are to be achieved , the government is fully justified in keeping it under strict police surveillance . Such men , in my opinion , would make an even greater failure of life under Socialism than they do now . A " bio ' war " was the third remedy . The young men and boys favored this procedure . " The world is too full of Miensehen , " they said , " and the only way to thin it out is to let things go los for a while . " By los they meant an all round battle between the nations . " After the war with France everything boomed , " one declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were just as obstinate and one-sided in their opinions as the others , and protests about the horrible results of war had no effect upon them . In all these conversations and suggestions , I was struck with a trait of character which is common to men of this class the world over . They all know , or think they know , what ails the world , and exactly what it needs for its regeneration , but it almost never dawns on them that they themselves have any personal responsibility in the reforms suggested . They seem to consider themselves as something aloof from society , lookers-on , as it were , justified in making all manner of criticisms , but not required to look at all deeply into their own failings and sins . Tramps have this same trait . They will talk for hours at the hang-out camp-fire about what ought to be done to make the world better , and at times with a clearness of perception and earnestness of argument that are unexcelled ; but let a little personal introspection or criticism be suggested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graveyard . Other people 's failings they feel perfectly free to discuss ; their own must remain a sealed book . Another thing that impressed me in the colony - and I have noticed it before in all places where men are shut in - was the irritability of the inmates . Sometimes they could hardly stand a contradiction in conversation without showing anger , and in the workshop the least trouble with a machine would send some of them into a violent rage . Those who had been in the colony longest were the most easily excited . I report this fact for the benefit of those penologists who find in the criminal 's irritability an evidence of his natural lack of stamina and will power . If simple out-of-works in such an institution as the colony , where , after all , they are not very closely confined , show the nervousness and petulancy that I have described , how much more must the man show , and with reason , who is shut up for years , perhaps for life , in a prison cell ? Criminologists would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouncing judgment too definitely upon the criminal 's natural capabilities . Iv . A week of colony life was over , and my work was done as far as these men were concerned . I felt that I knew them as well as it was possible to know them in such a place , and a longer stay seemed unnecessary . A card to a friend in the city soon brought me word that work was waiting for me , and I was released in good faith . I went , as I came , a common day laborer . A few days later , " clothed and in my right mind , " I sought out the colony again . I desired to express to the Hausvater thanks for the fair treatment I had received , and to talk over with him and the theological student my experiences . I found them , as before , in the little brick office , and it was hard for them to believe that I was the same man who had presented himself a week previously in such a pitiable plight . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it took all my powers of // persuasion to convince them of the earnestness of my purpose . This accomplished , however , I was made most welcome , and immediately invited to drink coffee with the Hausvater 's family . He called his wife and daughters from the house , and I was introduced to them as der Eritpmppte , - the chrysalis turned butterfly . We all took seats at the cosy little table in the garden , laid for afternoon refreshments , and it was a pleasure I shall never forget to sit there and enjoy the things which had seemed to me so delicious while I was forced to live upon the simpler fare of the colonists , - a gratification somewhat similar , I fancy , to that which the prisoner experiences when eating his first " square meal " after a long bondage . I was plied with all manner of questions about how I had found the food and the beds , and what treatment the men had given me ; and then the Hausvater and the Herr Candidat told me of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of all who came to them for assistance they considered worthy of help and capable of betterment . " Not half , " they replied . " The majority are men who , on account of their bad habits , would go under in the struggle in any country . They are not a*-tual tramps , in the sense that they are absolutely averse to work , but the most of them want work that they can not find . They are dilettanti , and skip from one thing to another without any definite aim or purpose . " " Do you consider them fair representatives of the so-called army of the unemployed ? " They are good representatives of the men who are continually talking about lack of employment . They find no work because they seek it , as a rule , where it is least likely to be found . Here in Germany , if a man really wants labor , and is not particular about the kind , so long as it keeps him going till something better turns up , he can generally find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consider the colony , and is it worth while housing men of such a character ? " " It is useful in helping us to form a more or less correct idea of who the worthy unemployed are . All sorts and conditions of men come into these colonies , and we soon find out who are deserving and who are not . The former we do our best to place in suitable l ) os*tions , and to the latter we give the benefit of our home , believing that the strict order and discipline required can at least do them no harm , and may possibly help them . In this way we are able to keep pretty well informed about the real situation , which was impossible before the colonies existed . Then , when great distress was reported , one had to take the statement more or less on trust . To-day we can tell to a nicety , as far as single men are concerned , how much real need there is , and that goes a long way toward settling the problem . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he wishes , his determination to help himself . " As such I can recommend it to the careful attention of all who are interested in philanthropic work . I do not believe that the time has yet come when such an institution is absolutely necessary in this country on simple grounds of charity , - there is still work enough in the United States for every man in it who is not afraid to take the first thing that comes , - but I am fully persuaded that it would be of great use in winnowing the honest from the dishonest , and the industrious from the lazy .
