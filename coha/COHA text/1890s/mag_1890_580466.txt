txt RICHARD HENRY LEE . THIS country has never seen a more interesting form of aristocracy than that which existed in Virginia at the middle of the eighteenth century . The colony had drawn its ruling class mainly from the English gentry . Many such , eager for gold and adventure , had come in the beginning with Dale and Captain Smith ; while others , royalist refugees , had found here an obscure retreat after the overthrow of Charles I. Purchasing for a trifle large tracts of the rich lowlands along the picturesque river-banks , they gradually assumed many of the conditions and modes of life to which they had been accustomed in England . They built spacious , imposing manor-houses , kept large numbers of servants , affected // ceremony , luxury , and ease , and ruled their wide and separated domains with a mild but arbitrary sway . Establishing the English Church , they made it the medium of their power as well as of their worship ; for through its vestries they directed not only the religious services , but also the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully as it did the household and the Church ; for , occupying the magistracies , and monopolizing the governor 's Council and even the popular House of Burgesses , they gathered into their ready hands all the reins of political power . And the better to maintain their position an*l to perpetuate their names , they transplanted and nourished that taproot of aristocracy , the rule of primogeniture , controlling the descent and securing the integrity of the family estate and prestige . From this dominant , conservative aristocracy came the greater part of " that generation of Virginian statesmen who left so deep an impress on the history of the world ; " and among them no one traced a longer lineage or inherited a stronger taste for politics than did Richard Henry Lee . His family was established on the rich tract of lowland known as the Northern Neck , between the Rappahannock and the Potomac , and at a point not far from the present city of Washington . Its history ran back nearly to the founding of the colony , and was interwoven with its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee , came to Virginia in the reign of Charles I. , and during that king 's struggle with Parliament was secretary , and next in prominence , to Sir William Berkeley , then governor of Virginia . Together , these two kept the colony loyal , so strong was its royalist sentiment . Even after they were forced by Cromwell 's ships to acknowledge the Commonwealth , they still plotted for the restoration , - Richard Lee himself visiting Charles II . in Flanders , and inviting him to Virginia ; and when royalty was restored , their fidelity and zeal were rewarded by a renewal of their control of Virginian affairs . The prestige thus acquired by Berkeley 's secretary was maintained in the Lee family . A son , Richard Lee , was a member of the king 's Council ; and a grandson , Thomas Lee , father of Richard Henry Lee , after serving many years as president of the Council , was commissioned governor of Virginia just before his death . Equally distinguished in the public service were the Ludwells of Greenspring , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and her brother were members of the Council , and her grandfather had been governor of North Carolina . With these continuous and eminent examples among his ancestors , - his father being the president , his uncle and grandfather having been members , of the king 's Council , - naturally Richard Henry Lee early contemplated a public career . Indeed , this was about the only future then open to a young man of his class in Virginia . To engage in trade or in manual labor was deemed unworthy of a gentleman . In fact , there was no trade , even as there were no municipalities . The plantations , each constituting a little community by itself , usually had their own artisans and handicraftsmen among their indentured servants or their slaves ; and , generally bordering upon tidal bays or upon rivers , they had their separate wharves , from which they loaded English ships with their sole important product , tobacco , and at which they received in return nearly all fabrics , tools , utensils , furni.ture , and even food required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergymen , such as they were , came mainly from England , and the physicians scarcely constituted a class by themselves ; the law alone began to attract young men from the first families . Its practice not only afforded scope and op // portunity for the highest talent , but also furnished a thorough preparation for the Council and the House of Burgesses . But Lee was not attracted to the law as a profession , and he chose a more direct way to these goals of youthful ambition and battlefields of Virginian politics . In 1757 , at the age of twenty-five years , he was chosen to represent his native county of Westmoreland in the House of Burgesses . This assembly was surpassed by no other in the colonies for dignity , influence , and ability . It was the oldest legislative body in America , having sat for the first time June 30,1619 . It was also one of the most free and spirited . As early as 1624 it had voted that " the Governor shall not lay any taxes or yinpositions , upon the colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the General Assembly , to be levyed and ymployed as the said Assembly shall appoynt . " The spirit and the principle then manifested were uniformly maintained during the century and a half which followed , so that at the approach of the Revolution few political bodies more independent or more resolute existed in the world . In this generous , animating school was acquired the political training of the planter aristocracy ; for the House of Burgesses was mainly a patrician assembly . To be sure , its members were elected by the freemen ; but as they received no pay , few but wealthy landowners could afford to serve , and those few often owed their election to the predominant influence of the local magnates . Its prevailing spirit , therefore , was aristocratic , and its conduct was correspondingly dignified . Its sessions were held in the stately old Capitol at Williamsburg , and were attended with ceremonies more or less copied from those of the House of Commons . The Speaker sat upon a high dais under a canopy supported by a gilded rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table before him . to show that the House was in session ; while in front , in long rows , their hats upon their heads , sat the honorable Burgesses , representing the wealth , culture , and pride of Virginia . Doubtless there was much in this dignified body to abash and repress a young man just admitted to it ; and apparently such was its effect at first upon Richard Henry Lee . Diffident by nature , and deferential to the experience and abilities of his associates , he remained for several sessions a silent member . It required first a strong conviction of duty , and then a sudden prompting of affection , fully to discover to himself and to the House his remarkable gift of speech . The first occasion here alluded to was a debate upon a motion " to lay so heavy a duty on the importation of slaves as effectually to put an end to that iniquitous and disgraceful traffic within the colony of Virginia . " At this time there were in Virginia over one hundred and twenty thousand slaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that number fast increasing ; and the resulting evils , social and economic , were already arousing discussion and solicitude . Evidently they had long weighed on Lee 's mind , for in this debate he was at last moved to speak . In a brief but pointed and earnest speech he set forth the impolitic , unjust , and cruel aspects of the slave-trade . Imputing to it the inferior economic development of Virginia as compared with other colonies , he declared that , " with their whites , they import arts and agriculture , whilst we , with our blacks , exclude both . " Finally , he openly denounced his countrymen as participants in the nefarious traffic : " We encourage those poor , ignorant people to wage eternal war against each other ; not nation against nation , but father against son , children against parents , and brothers against brothers , . . . that by war , stealth , or surprise we Christians // may be furnished with our fellowcreatures . " For a maiden speech this was indeed a bold one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course it did not avail , so strongly was slavery linked with aristocracy ; yet its keen insight and elevated tone , at that early day , are worthy of admiration . In other respects the speech was not noteworthy . At the most , it unsealed Lee 's lips , and made him available shortly afterward in a cause that appealed even more strongly to his sympathy and indignation . His brother , Thomas Lee , also a Burgess , having been selected to bring forward a motion that was obnoxious to the Speaker and to a large part of the House , performed the duty in an able and effective speech , but at the same time neglected to observe the rule requiring all motions to be presented in writing . The Speaker quickly perceived the oversight , and gladly took advantage of it . Administering a severe rebuke at the omission , he so disconcerted the mover that the latter could not recover from his confusion . Thereupon Richard Henry Lee sprang to his feet , and presented the motion in writing , in a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his brother . It is recorded that the elder brother never again ventured to address the House , but the younger from that hour became one of its acknowledged leaders . The nature of his leadership , assumed at this time , will be evident from a memorable incident of 1766 . The Speaker just mentioned was John Robinson , one of the most wealthy and aristocratic of the Virginia planters . He had been Speaker of the House for twenty-five years , and for several years Treasurer of the colony , also ; and , using his official position with tact and ability , he had acquired great power and popularity . Suddenly , in 1766 , his death occurred , and at once rumors arose of se rious defalcations in the office of Treasurer , involving many of the Burgesses . An inquiry was imperative ; but all shrank from taking the initiative . Lee , when convinced that there was ground for suspicion , had the courage to move " that a committee be appointed to inquire into the state of the treasury . " As was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did not flinch , and it finally prevailed . In the investigation that followed the worst suspicions were reallzed . It had been the duty of Robinson , as Treasurer , to cancel all government bills paid to him for redemption ; but instead of destroying them , he had been in the habit of loaning them secretly to importunate Burgesses and other friends , relying on his own property , together with what security he could obtain , to prevent loss to the colony . The union of these two offices had given opp4rtunity for this misconduct ; and , obviously , their separation might prevent its recurrence . Accordingly , Lee followed up his advantage by moving that the office of Treasurer be separated from that of Speaker ; and again he antagonized most of the older and more influential planters . Nevertheless , with the aid of Patrick Henry and other kindred spirits , he carried his point , and effected an important reform . The incident just narrated clearly reveals the existence of two parties in the House of Burgesses . One party , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealthiest families of Virginia , and was devoted to the maintenance of the power and privilege they had so long possessed , even at the expense of some abuses in the government and in society . At its head was Edmund Pendleton , an able lawyer , a shrewd politician , and a selfmade man . Early in life , he was left , penniless and uneducated , to make his way ; and by his industry , integrity , and ability he rose from the position of a // plougliboy to that of the conservative leader . From his entry into politics he was the prot*g6 of Speaker Robinson , and with him strove to resist innovation and revolution . Among the other able and distinguished conservatives were Peyton Randolph , Richard Bland , and George Wythe . The other , the radical or popular party , was determined to break up abuses , wherever they might be , and to bring the colony into a more progressive policy ; and its number was made up from the sturdy yeomanry , or middle class , together with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , strange to say , was Richard Henry Lee . From the antecedents of his family , he should , on the contrary , have been first among the conservatives . From his great-grandfather , the valiant secretary of Berkeley , down to his father , the president of the Council , the family had been , without exception , upholders of royalty and aristocracy . But he , cutting loose from family ties and traditions , became a determined radical , denouncing the injustice and inexpediency of slavery , and exposing the greed , pride , and excesses of the aristocracy . The explanation of this is to be found largely in his moral and intellectual development . In his education he had been left much to himself , his mother bestowing her care chiefly on the eldest son , the heir to the estate . Yet the younger sons , of whom there were four , were not overlooked . In their earlier years they had a private tutor , and subsequently at least three of* them were sent to England . Thus Richard Henry Lee spent several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the age of eighteen , shortly after his father 's death , he resided for some years with an elder brother ; and it would seem , in anticipation of a public career , he devoted himself during this time to the study of history , law , politics , and literature . Evidently these were the chief formative years of his life . In his father 's library , a large and valuable one for the time , he found , among many other works , those of Locke , Hooker , and Grotius , Homer , Virgil , Milton , and Shakespeare . Becoming familiar ' with the best in politics and belles-lettres , he not only refined and informed his taste and style , but examined the fundamental principles of free government . He studied especially the history and constitution of England and her colonies , tracing the development and embodiment of English freedom , and following with deep interest the careers of Pelham , Sydney , and Hampden . Withal he acquired that habit of bold and independent thinking in politics which later led him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil designs of the British ministry , and to devise means of thwarting them . Under such a well-trained and vigilant director , it is no wonder that the Virginia radicals performed so well their part in opening the drama of the Revolution . In March , 1764 , Grenville 's Declaratory Act was passed , asserting a right and a determination in Parliament to tax America . Lee saw the dangerous scope and intent of this measure , and resolved to arouse his fellowBurgesses against it . Soon after the meeting of the House , he brought the subject forward ; and , after full discussion , a special committee was appointed , consisting of Landon Carter , Richard Henry Lee , George Wythe , Edmund Pendleton , Benjamin Harrison , Richard Bland , and Peyton Randolph . They reported an address to the king , a memorial to the House of Lords , and a remonstrance to the House of Commons . These papers , of which the first two were written by Lee , denied , in clear and decided terms , the claim asserted by Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted almost the earliest legislative opposition in America to the designs of Great Britain . // In this step it had not been difficult to enlist the leading conservatives , of whom chiefly the above committee was composed . Thus far they were willing to go , exercising their undisputed right of petition . But when their petitions were disregarded , and Parliament , in the execution of its programme , enacted the Stamp Act , the Virginia aristocrats were inclined to acquiesce . Fortunately , at this point , the radicals received a potent*accession to their number through the election of Patrick Henry to the House of Burgesses ; and , aided by his unexpected and irresistible eloquence , they barely secured the adoption of his famous resolves . On this occasion , Lee , though a member of the House , was temporarily absent . But he was quite in accord with Henry ; and from this time these two men worked together to keep Virginia in the front rank of colonial resistance . Yet their functions and methods were very different . To Patrick Henry politics was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gave his whole mind and soul . But his profession was the law , and in its pursuit he was regularly engaged . Lee , however , had no profession . He was devoted to the welfare of his country . For its sake he had made extensive , earnest preparation , and to this cause he henceforth gave almost undivided attention . He endeavored in every way to enlarge his field of observation . He kept himself informed of public opinion in England , and of the course of the ministry and Parliament , through an active correspondence with his brother , Arthur Lee . The latter , having taken a degree in medicine at Edinburgh , was then studying law at the Temple ; and , being in the confidence of Lord Shelburne , Burke , Colonel Barr* , and other Whig leaders , possessed an intimate knowledge of public affairs . Keeping thus a close watch upon English politics , Richard Henry Lee was one of the first to become convinced that a serious struggle with Great Britain was inevitable ; and , spurred by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety to other patriots , and to consult with them for the common safety . For this purpose , in 1768 , he endeavored to institute a private correspondence society among the leading men of the colonies , addressing , among others , Christopher Gadsden , of South Carolina , and John Dickinson , of Pennsylvania . In his letter to Dickinson , he suggested also that , " well to understand each other , and timely to be informed of what passes , both here and in Great Britain , . . . select committees should be appointed by all the colonies . " Here , it seems , is the first suggestion of those " select committees of correspondence " which became so formidable to the British authorities and so potent in the American colonies . It did not satisfy Lee to suggest the plan . He followed it up to its execution . Not far from the old Capitol , on Gloucester Street , the broad thoroughfare of Williamsburg , was the quaint old Raleigh Tavern , named from Sir Walter Raleigh , whose bust stood over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the meetingplace for the gay and polished society of the town ; and in the Apollo Room , the large apartment of the tavern , Jefferson and his fellow-students from the neighboring College of William and Mary often danced with the handsome and accomplished belles of Virginia . Here , also , later , *Vere accustomed to meet , in a private room , a knot of zealous patriots , including Thomas Jefferson , Patrick Henry , and Richard Henry Lee . At one of these conferences Lee advocated his scheme . Being approved by his fellow-radicals , it was presented to the House , and on March 12 , 1773 , the first general committee of correspondence was appointed . It consisted of the ablest members of the Burgesses , and included // Bland , Lee , Harrison , Pendleton , Henry , and Jefferson . The new governor , Lord iDunmore , taking affront at these proceedings , dissolved the house . But he could not change the effect or importance of their action . Already , in Massachusetts , Samuel Adams had organized local committees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest colonies was followed by the others , and the general committees of correspondence thenceforth secured an authoritative and expeditious exchange of information and sentiment . No more important step had yet been taken toward union , and hence it caused great alarm and apprehension in the British ministry . They foresaw what soon took place . A rapid assimilation of public opinion into a determination to resist aggression was followed within a year by a general and growing demand for concerted public action . In meeting this demand Lee was hardly less active than he had been in arousing it . Immediately upon hearing of the passage of the Boston Port Bill , he drew a series of resolutions denouncing that measure , and proposing an intercolonial congress ; but before he could bring them to the attention of the House it was dissolved by the governor , in the hope of checking the rising tide of popular indignation . Nevertheless , the Burgesses assembled , the next morning , in the Apollo Room of the Raleigh Tavern , and took the momentous step on which at last they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general congress of the colonies . Shortly afterward , led by Samuel and John Adams , Massachusetts took similar action . Again the example of these trusted leaders was followed by the other colonies , and on September 4 , 1774 , in Carpenter 's Hall , Philadelphia , an intercolonial union became a fact . The men sent by Virginia to this first Continental Congress were , in the order of their selection , Peyton Randolph , Richard Henry Lee , George Washington , Patrick Henry , Richard Bland , Benjamin Harrison , and Edmund Pendleton ; and in character , ability , and influence they were not surpassed by any other delegation . The impression that they made , on arriving at Philadelphia , may be inferred from the words of Joseph Reed , a contemporary Philadelphian : " We are so taken up with the Congress that we hardly think or talk of anything else . About fifty have come to town , and more are expected . There are some fine fellows from Virginia , but they are very high . We understand they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding . " In the Congress itself , the precedence that Virginia had hitherto taken was at once recognized . Peyton Randolph , formerly the attorney-general of Virginia and Speaker of the House of Burgesses , the chairman of the Virginia delegation , was made the presiding officer ; and Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee were soon acknowledged to be the greatest orators . The eloquence of the former has become famous . Intense , dramatic , or constrained , according to mood or occasion , he could at will charm , melt , or subdue . He lives , and will live , in American history for his wonderful mastery over human passion . But in chasteness and purity of diction , in grace of manner , in melody of voice , and in culture of mind he did not equal his friend and associate , Richard Henry Lee . Of the latter , John Adams , that keen and unsparing critic of his contemporaries , wrote , toward the close of his life , " As a public speaker , he had a fluency as easy and graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to decorate with frequent allusion to some of the finest passages of antiquity . " Lee 's personal appearance was striking . His form was tall and spare , but well proportioned , and his face was of // the Roman type . His manners were easy , cordial , and elegant . He had lost the use of one hand , through an accident while shooting swans on the Potomac , and kept the wound concealed by a black silk bandage ; yet his gestures were so graceful as to give the impression of having been practiced before a mirror . He was sometimes called " the gentleman of the silver hand . " It was not without reason that the Virginians spoke in raptures of Richard Henry Lee as the Cicero , and of Patrick Henry as the Demosthenes , of the age . Nevertheless , it was not the form and manner of Lee 's utterances so much as their spirit that made them impressive and weighty . They displayed a breadth of view , a variety and richness of knowledge , and an elevation of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tone seemed too bold to the Congress of 1774 . The great majority of this body were cautious and conservative , and for this reason the New England delegates deemed it expedient , in the interest of harmony , to refrain from any decided expression of their radical views . As John Adams said subsequently , " Because they had been suspected from the beginning of having independence in contemplation , they were restrained from the appearance of promoting any great measures by their own discretion , as well as by the general sense of Congress. ** Not the same restraint was imposed or observed in the case of the Southern radicals , like Lee , Henry , and Gadsden . For the first two a fair hearing was insured , both from the prestige enjoyed by Virginia and from their own preeminence as orators . Their temperament impelled them to speak , and they made the most of their opportunities . " Goveminent is dissolved , " declared Patrick Henry at the opening of the Congress ; and in his Address to the People of the Colonies , Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournful events . " July , The Congress did not possess the spirit that animated these bold and energetic minds . Lee thought that the opposition of the colonies had been so feeble and incompetent hithert* that it was time to make vigorous exertions . " A resolute unanimous resistance , " he wrote to Washington , " and the king and his ministers will give way . " Accordingly , he moved that " the Congress do most earnestly recommend to the several colonies that a militia be forthwith appointed and well disciplined , and that it be well provided with ammunition and proper arms ; " and later , on hearing of the investment of Boston by General Gage , he moved in a similar temper for prompt and decided action . But these motions were either rejected or modified to suit the conciliatory policy of the conservatives . The hour for revolution and independence was not yet come . Just how early the more ardent patriots began to contemplate independence it is impossible to determine . The Adamses were suspected of entertaining such a project considerably before 1774 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the interception and publication of a letter written by John Adams , savoring of the spirit of independence . There is some reason to think that Lee secretly cherished the idea at a date even earlier ; for in 1764 , immediately after hearing of the passage of the Declaratory Act , he wrote to a friend , " Possibly this step of the mother country , though intended to oppress and keep us low , in order to secure our dependence , may be subversive of this end . " At any rate , it was the conviction alike of Samuel and John Adams , and of Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee , that the conciliatory measures of the first Congress would not move Britain , and that , in the words of Joseph Hawley , " after all , we must fight . " This conviction once reached , the desire and effort to bring it home to the people naturally followed . In Virginia , // at a convention held in St. John 's Church , Richmond , March 20 , 1775 , a resolution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Congress , was brought forward by Patrick Henry , and supported by Richard Henry Lee . Against them rallied the forces of Virginian aristocracy and conservatism , led again by Edmund Pendleton ; and long and heated was the struggle that ensued . Lee presented a masterly review of the resources of the colonies and of the available force of Great Britain ; while Patrick Henry , roused to a frenzy by the persistence of the opposition , poured forth that torrent of eloquence which has fixed the attention and elicited the admiration of subsequent generations . Of course the resolution was adopted . Its two chief advocates were the first ones named on the committee for its execution . The aggressive spirit here manifested rapidly spread throughout the colonies ; men 's minds turned toward war and independence . And when , shortly afterward , the second Congress met , that spirit speedily permeated and controlled its councils and conduct . At last the times were ripe for the radical revolutionists , and they pushed their scheme with gathering momentum and assurance of success . Disregarding the warnings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives , they secured a large majority , both of the people and of the Congress , in favor of declaring independence . The night of doubt , contention , and uncertainty was past , and the birthday of American nationality was at hand . At this point the question arose as to who should move the declaration . All circumstances pointed to Richard Henry Lee . To the Congress it seemed fitting that Virginia , hitherto the foremost colony in nearly all the more important advances toward union and resistance , should also be the leader in this final , momentous step ; and of the Virginia delegates ( George Wythe , Richard Henry Lee , Thomas Jefferson , Benjamin Harrison , Thomas Nelson , Francis Lightfoot Lee , and Carter Braxton ) no one was better known or more acceptable than Richard Henry Lee . He was chosen , doubtless , for his preeminence as a debater , and for his long and zealous advocacy of independence . Similar reasons influenced the selection of John Adams , of Massachusetts , to second the motion . They were well mated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argumentative Puritan . No duty more trying or more honorable had ever fallen to their lot . In American politics , few debates have been more persistently or more evenly contested ; never was there such a momentous issue . Though the words have been but meagrely reported , both men are known to have acquitted themselves as became the eminence of their talents and the significance of their cause . With magnanimous faith and courage , looking beyond the perils and discouragements of the time , they pleaded for the preservation of republican institutions for themselves and for all mankind . While the debate was in progress , Congress , anticipating the result , chose a committee of five to prepare a declaration of independence . Of this committee Lee , being the mover of the resolution , should have been made chairman , in accordance with parliamentary usage . But on the eve of its selection he was summoned to Virginia , on account of the serious illness of his wife ; and his absence was used to his disadvantage by his enemies . The animosities that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Burgesses , and the antagonisms that he had subsequently excited in Dickinson , Jay , and other conservatives through his radical course in Congress , now worked together to deprive him of his right . Even John Adams , his professed friend and sympa // thizer , on this occasion turned against him . The youthful Jefferson , being made chairman , enjoyed the fruit that Lee should have gathered , - the signal honor of being the author of the Declaration of Independence . However great and memorable was Lee 's service in that event , on which all Americans delight to dwell , an even greater claim to the remembrance and gratitude of his countrymen lies in his conspicuous devotion to the ordinary business of government , - and that , too , during the most critical years of the Revolutionary struggle , when so many statesmen deemed it honorable to forsake the halls of Congress for their state legislatures . As an example of his activity and readiness , it may be said that , during the years 1774 to 1778 inclusive , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly every committee on finance and foreign affairs . His brother-in-law , Dr. Shippen , at whose house he lodged in Philadelphia , declared that " there was a constant procession of members repairing to his chamber , to consult about their reports . " His services as a writer , also , were in frequent demand ; and he drew many state papers , from the Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain down to the commission of Washington as - commander-in-chief . Yet his mind was not absorbed in details ; nor was it narrowed by local prejudice . Studying the interests of the United States as a whole , he delighted to forecast and to contemplate its great future . In this spirit , when in 1779 the conditions of peace were discussed by Congress , he demanded for New England fishermen the same rights enjoyed by the French in British North American waters , and for the future pioneers of the great West the unrestricted navigation of the Mississippi . His views received then but little support from the delegates of the Middle and Southern States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and soon became impo*rtant principles of national policy . But Lee had not the strength to perform the arduous tasks to which he was called by his associates and impelled by his zeal . Under such a prolonged , incessant strain his health was impaired ; and for several years his attendance upon Congress was intermittent . Yet even from his retirement at his country-seat , Chantilly , on the Potomac , he eagerly followed the course of public affairs . In 1784 , his health being improved , he resumed his seat in Congress ; and almost immediately he was elected president of that body , the most honorable position under the Confederation . He retired from this office at the end of the year , but continued to take a prominent part in Congress . In particular as a member of the committee that reported the famous Ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory , he was able at last to embody and enforce those views regarding slavery which he had vainly presented in his maiden speech to the Burgesses . In view of his pure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bondmen should engage the close , as it had enlisted the opening , of his political career . There remained , however , one service for Richard Henry Lee to render his country ; and it was the most remarkable , if not the most important , of all . Strange to say , it was to oppose the Constitution of the United States . Lee had no part in the framing of this instrument , nor did he share officially in its ratification . As a private citizen , he objected to it from the first , and attacked it earnestly in the press and in correspondence ; and in this course , singularly enough , he had the sympathy and support of his oldtime friends and associates , Samuel Adanis and Patrick Henry . The radical revolutionists of 1776 had become , it would seem , ultra - conservatives in 1787. // From their standpoint only is it possible to reconcile the two positions . To them the Declaration of Independence secured the liberty of the individual , the autonomy of the community ; it asserted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the claims of society as a whole . Upon this theory carried to an extreme the Confederation had been erected - and had gone to pieces ; and the framing of the Constitution resulted from a decided reaction toward the recognition of the unity and interdependence of the political divisions of society . But this reaction had gone too far , in the opinion of Lee , Henry , and Adams . They believed that , in the eagerness to escape from the evils of the Confederation by strengthening the general government , the rights of the individual had been neglected and the authority of the State diminished . Like many other devoted and distinguished Revolutionary statesmen , they leaned toward those political convictions which subsequently led to the doctrine of state rights . Lee , expressing their common sentiment , declared that " the first maxim of a man who loves liberty should be , never to grant to rulers an atom of power that is not most clearly and indispensably necessary for the safety and well-being of society . " " The most essential danger from the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a consolidated government , instead of a union of confederated States . " They therefore viewed with suspicion and anxiety the extraordinary grants contained in the Constitution . They saw in it , moreover , a deficiency equally as great , - it lacked that cherished English birthright , a bill of rights , securing trial by jury and freedom of conscience and of the press ; and so vital did Lee deem this deficiency that when finally the Constitution was adopted without change , he resolved , notwithstanding his infirmity , to reenter public life for the purpose of securing its amendment . In 1789 , he was nominated by Patrick Henry , and elected by the Virginia legislature , one of the first Senators of the United States . Soon after taking his seat in the Senate , Lee moved several amendments to the Constitution , embodying the views held by his party ; and at the same time similar action was taken by the Virginia delegates in the House of Representatives . So great and persistent was the pressure which they brought to bear that the Federalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of the first ten amendments a bill of rights was added to the Constitution of the United States . Having attained his object to a large extent , Lee soon resigned his seat in the Senate , and definitely retired from public life . Overcome at last by the disease from which he had so long suffered , he died at Chantilly , the same month in which , eighteen years before , he had moved that " these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent States . " Throughout his political career , as in its concluding episode , Richard Henry Lee was filled with " a constant care of the public liberty . " Apprehensive of " the unvarying progress of power in the hands of frail men , " he was loath to concede to individual or to legislature the exercise of any power not clearly and strictly defined and carefully guarded . In this attitude , as well as in temperament , he much resembled Samuel Adams . Early drawn together by common convictions and purposes , they became firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost their whole political careers , is replete with interest and instruction . With a common intolerance of superimposed authority and usurped privilege , they boldly and persistently advocated the rights of the people . From early manhood to old age they were radical democrats . Not only toward New England 's leaders , but also toward her spirit and institutions , Lee felt a strong attraction . At // one time he went so far as to consider a change of residence ; for in 1779 he wrote to John Adams , " I feel myself interested in the establishment of a wise and free government in Massachusetts , where yet I hope to finish the remainder of my days . The hasty , unpersevering , aristocratic genius of the South suits not my disposition , and is inconsistent with my views of what must constitute social happiness and security . " Not being in harmony with the genius , he could the better promote the reformation , of Virginian society . His aristocratic birth and training did not fetter his bold , independent spirit .

He roused animosities and suffered ostracism ; but he received the support of the yeomanry ; and later , in company with Patrick Henry , securing control of the House of Burgesses , he placed Virginia beside Massachusetts in the front of colonial resistance . As a reformer , Lee was a co-worker with Henry , and the predecessor of Jefferson . Less forceful than Henry , but more steady and intelligent , he broke the soil that Jefferson cultivated ; and all three together introduced in Virginian society a republican leaven that finally worked a thorough reformation . They were at the South the early " apostles of democracy . " Lee 's radicalism did not warp his judgment . While intolerant of , and outspoken against , the excesses and abuses of aristocracy , he agreed with Jefferson that , in organizing resistance to Great Britain , it was wise , by a charitable and conciliatory attitude toward the conservatives , to advance slowly , " keeping front and rear together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with less friction and contention in Virginia than in any other colony . When radicalism contended with his convictions of private justice or public morality , Lee adhered to the latter , even at the hazard of friendship . For example , while a member of the Virginia Assembly in the sessions of 1781-82 , he found himself in constant opposition to his old friend and associate , Patrick Henry . The latter was in favor of making the depreciated paper money a legal tender for debts contracted on the faith of specie payment , and of impeding or confiscating debts due British merchants and contracted before the war . Both these measures Lee earnestly opposed , on the ground that they violated honesty and good faith . He declared that it would have been better to remain " the honest slaves of Great Britain than to become dishonest freemen . " It is possible that his indignaiion was intensified by the memory of his own pecuniary losses through the depreciation of paper currency .

" But it is more likely that his early studies in social and political problems , followed by his experience and reflection , revealed the inexpediency as well as the enormity of such schemes . In fact , his liberal culture , with his aristocratic breeding , gave a temper and balance to his radical sympathies and impulses . As a result , he had a breadth of view and of interest unusual in his time . His alert and eager gaze swept the political horizon , comprehending European as well as American affairs . Thus it was that he was among the first to perceive the gathering storm and to prepare to break its force . So when the shock had been met and overcome , and a nation had sprung from the impact , he comprehended its wide extent and foresaw its greaf future . Toward the realization of that future much was done by the radicals of the Revolutionary era . Against aggressive //                  @ @ @
