Residents , if not visitors , of Venice know that Sir Henry Layard had in his palazzo on the Grand Canal a very valuable colleetion of paintings and brie-e-brae , picked up at the ends of the earth and greatly cherished by him and his bright , eccentric wife .

In order to keep in the graces of the Grand Turk , the Venetians sent Gentile , the elder son of Jacopo Bellini , to the Levant , but he was too prudent to remain any longer than was strictly necessary in that dangerous atmosphere .

" A severe head does not show such a piece of neck , " ho observed to the Italian ; " the neck draws up and shortens . " Seeing an expression of polite doubt on the painter 's face , he motioned to a guard : ' Cut off that man 's head , " and in a moment a slave was decapitated . " There , " said Mahmud , " do n't you see how the neck draws up to the head ? " Bellini saw and excused himself at the first opportunity , returning to Venice in else . This is only one , though perhaps the most valuable of Sir Henry 's treasures .

About the summit floated human figures on broad white wings , coming and going like ships of the air . It certainly agreed with an imaginative artist 's way of symbolizing Gibraltar , a part of Spanish soil occupied by foreigners who come and go in their white-winged ships indifferent to the rage of the owners of the soil .
