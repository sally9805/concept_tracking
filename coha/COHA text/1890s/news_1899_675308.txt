txt Judge BROWN is very severe upon the I arrangement by which HORGAN and SLATTERY have endeavored , as he more than intimates , to cheat their creditors : But nobody who has followed the proceedings which have ? culminated in his decision will be likely to say that he is too severe . He characterizes the " corporation " into which HORGAN and SLATTERY have resolved themselves , and in which they have endeavored to merge and confuse their personal liabilities , as a mere fiction , ? a hocus-pocus by means of which , with only $30 of ready money " in sight , " two bankrupt builders of tenement houses have endeavored to evade the payment of liabilities amounting to $190,000 . Ordinarily such a showing as this would not be of any public importance . Unsuccessful speculators in real estate are going into bankruptcy every day , or every week . For all we know there may be every now and then among them those who confront liabilities of $190,000 with a cash capital of $30 , an inequality which suggests the vivid statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of ' the man who found himself " standing on the brink of eternity with only l2 in his pocket " But this is not a common ease of bankruptcy of injudicious speculators in real estate . What makes it uncommon is that these absurd bankrupts have been " taken up " by Tammany or by smile member of Tammany , and been made in effect the official architects of the second , or third , or whatever it may be , city in the , worid . These ridiculous insolvents have no standing whatever in any branch of their profession , and they are suddenly made the very highest authorities upon every branch of it . Questions of prison construction , in which they have not had even that experience of inmates which Judge BROWN suggests they ought to have ; questions of interior " finish , " questions of landscape gardening , questions even of the construction of steam boilers , are referred for decision to these impossible and unsuccessful inexperts . It really will not do . Tammany ought to see that it will not do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . It is publicly known that nobody can possibly know all the things that they are assumed by this municipality to know . And when , in addition to a complete professional obscurity , it appears that they have endeavored to " bluff " $190,000 of debts with $30 of cash , there is really nothing to be said in their favor . Tammany must really drop them . HORGAN may be , in spite of the ignorance of all men who are " charged with knowledge " on the subject , a great aesthetic authority . SLATTERY may be , in spite of a like lack of information , a great scientific and technical authority . Or perhaps it Is Ilona-AN who is the scientist and SLATTERY who is the aesthete . But when what is of public record about them is merely that they confront $190,000 of liabilities with $30 of assets , it is obviously out of the question that Mr. CARROLL , or Mr. VAN WYCK , or Mr. CROKER himself should continue to carry them and to impose them upon this municipality  --  because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a possibility of nauseation . And HORGAN and SLATTERY have already been too much imposed on both . After Judge BROWN 's opinion they can not be worked any longer . And , as we have before suggested , it would be a very good thing for the present rulers of New York to take pattern by Messrs . TWEED and SWEENY to the extent of invoking professional assistance that commands some decent measure of professional and public respect .
