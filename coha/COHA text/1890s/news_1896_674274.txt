Help came an hour after they had vanished . It included , before daylight , Dearly everybody within call . The burglars took nothing away . A general upset of furniture in two of the lower rooms and four bullets driven into the interior walls and woodwork bore evidence of the difficulty that attended their departure . The house they visited is occupied by Thomas F. Burke , Superintendent of the Ilawtherne Woolen Mills . It belongs to J. H.

While Mr. Broderick was preparing for supper in an up-stairs bedroom he heard a door close - softly . It startled him for the moment , because the sound did not seem like that which would be made either by the wind or by any one walking freely about . Since there were nearly a dozen persons in the house he concluded that there could be no reason for uneasiness , and when he went to supper he said nothing of the incident . At about 9 o'clock in the evening he drove back to Greenwich , leaving his wife and child at lar . Burke 's . The Burke family , in which there are Mrs. Burke and five children , Mrs. Broderick and her child , Miss Humphrey , a teacher , who had begun her services that day in the village school , and had taken board with the Burkes , and Mr. Burke were all stirring about the house , which was lighted throughout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house could not know that Mr. Broderick had gone . . Mr. Burke Seeks the Burglars . Before 10 o'clock the doors were locked and the household retired . One door opens on a porch in front and the other is at the rear . At about midnight Mr. Burke was awakened by a noise which sounded as if some one were on the porch . He thougdit it might be his St. Bernard dog until he recalled that when the doors were locked the dog lay on a rug in the sitting room , where it usually slept at night . The noise continuing , Mr. Burke took his revolver and started forth to learn the cause of the noise . He became informed of it in startling fashion . As he stepped from his bedroom Into a hallway which runs the length of the house , and in which gas is burned all night , he saw a tall , slender man with a mask over his face , fumbling at the door of the bedroom to which Mr. Broderick had gone to prepare for supper . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall . Before he had taken half a dozen steps Mr. Burke fired . The man cried out as if hit . Mr. Burke stepped into his doorway to escape the smoke of his revolver . He had barely done so when a shot was heard and a bullet from the burglar 's pistol buried itself in the window frame at Mr. Burke 's end of the hall . The hallway is only wide +enough. for two persons to pass each other , and a duel in it at such close range could not fail to be effective . Mr , Burke , his excitement increased by the burglar 's return fire , stepped quickly into the hall and tired again , as the burglar plunged down a hack stairway at his end of the hall . The bullet plowed into the framework of the window there , at about the height of a rnants shoulders . Then Mr. Burke gave chase . The back stairway is narrow and winding , and beyond the first turn it was dark . Mr. Burke heard the man descending it by lumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kitchen door at the bottom . The door was open . Mr. Burke sent a shot after the fugitive , and then turned from the kitchen , intending to pass through the : dining room and sitting room , on the lower floor , to a hallway in the front of the - house , where the main stairs are built . He had emptied his revolver of three shots , and wished to go back to his bedroom for a shotgun . Grapples with One of the Thieves . In the dining room , which was wholly dark , he ran into a man , who grasped him around the body and tried to throw him . Although the meeting completely surprised him , Mr. Burke recovered himself , and , still grappling his assailant , fired . The two men tumbled into the sitting room adjoining . They knocked over a centre table at the beginning of the encounter . Chairs were banged about as they fought . Both were strong , plucky , and nerved to a high pitch . The encounter had proceeded only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was too much excited to know whether his antagonist outmatched him or whether help had reached the assailant . He was forced to the floor . Strong hands pinioned him there . In a moment he felt a sponge pressed over his mouth and nostrils . He tore himself loose and pitched over a chair into the dining room . Then he heard a pistol shot . One of the burglars , supposing him in the sitting room , had fired into a corner there . The bullet entered the wall . Another shot quickly followed , this time into the dining room wall near where he lay . Then Mr. Burke lost consciousness , but his - household of women and children , who mere screaming up stairs , heard two additional shots . Women and Children Behind Barricade . It was a little after midnight when Mr. Burke became unconscious . His wife and Mrs. Broderick had assembled the six children in one of the up-stairs bedrooms , barricaded the door with the bed and other furniture , and were calling for help from the window at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearing that the armed burglars were still there , and , hearing nothing from Mr. Burke , they thought he had been killed . The side of the house from which they called overlooks a gulch through which the Byron River Rowse That part of the , river is dammed to supply power for the woolen mill near by . The noise of water flowing over the dam drcwned their cries , except when they were at their highest pitch , and then the sound was misleading . Frantic with terror , they screamed continuously far a full hour before response came . It was after 1 o'clock before a sign of life appeared in the neighborhood . Exhausted and despairing , they were about to cease screaming - when a light moved up the river bank from tile mill . It was the lantern of John Eurleigh , the mill watchman . He had heard the cries all the time , but had only then been able to locate them . " Hurry , John , for God 's sake ! " Mrs. Burke implored , " I think Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to the house . The front door was wide open . Jumbo , the St. Bernard , met him en tile bank , rejoiced apparently over the late call , until he spied the watchman 's dog , when a fight began .

The women and children emerged from the up-stairs room in which they had imprisoned themselves . Neighbors , awakened by the fighting of the doga were called in . They carried Mr. Burke to his bedroom , and while some disrobed him others went ? tit for a physician . His face was cut under one of the eyes , as if from a blew with brass knuckles .

Dr. Dalbeck of Port Chester arrived at about 3 o'clock and said that chloroform had doubtless been administered . Signs of nausea confirmed this diagnosis . Mr. Burke kept his bed all day yesterday , but was able to be up last night . He said he stil ! felt the effect of the chloroform , but expected it to pass off in a day or so . He spoke with some respect of the man who got the better of him in the sitting room , saying that he must be a good man , " because I am slick myself at rastle . " His theory was that one man had entered the house before the doors were locked , perhaps following Mr. Broderick in . When the household had retired the first intruder had opened the doors for his associates , and Jumbo , the St. Bernard , had walked quietly out . There were no marks anywhere of forcible entry into the house . David C. Broderick said that when he was In Greenwich yesterday Deputy Sheriff Fitzroy had informed him that three men , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train there Monday night . He accosted them and they hurried away with their collars upturned and their faces averted . Fitzroy suspected that these men were Mr. Burke 's visitors , and that Mr. Burke was overcome in the sitting room , because the stout man who first attacked him had been joined by a second stout man , the tall burglar having gone off to attend to his wound . It is not supposed that it was serious , for he left no blood trail , and trace of the men had disappeared before daylight yesterday . A curious circumstance in the affair was that Miss Humphrey , the school teacher , slept through it all , although the first three shots were fired in a hallway on which her room opens . She offered in explanation of her sound slumber - that at Wilkesbarre , where she last taught school , shooting was so common that she had learned to sleep through it .
