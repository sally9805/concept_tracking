THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS . II . THE TEACHER 'S SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL POSITION . A CAREFUL examination of the answers to the inquiries sent by The Atlantic Monthly to superintendents and teachers of the public schools has put me in closest touch with my fellow-teachers in every part of the country , and has given me a clear insight into the varied conditions under which they have to work . As summarized by President Hall in the preceding issue of this magazine , these replies do not present a bright picture . However , he bids us hope . To point out just what the defects are in the status of the teacher , and what we teachers must do to remedy these defects , is the purpose of what follows . The comments upon the American public school teacher made by visiting French and German educators have usually been favorable . Notwithstanding these comments , were his case to be tried before a jury of foreign educational experts , on the basis of the evidence furnished by the confessions in the letters we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three following counts : ( 1 ) lack of general culture , ( 2 ) lack of scho // larship , and ( 3 ) lack of professional preparation . Although morally the status of the teacher is high , socially it is found to be lower than the status of the average lawyer , the physician , or the theologian . Teachers do not give proper time and thought to the social side of life . To begin with , they are thought to be like the old-fashioned scholar in matters of personal appearance . Fortunately , there is no special style of dress by which they are known , but there is a carelessness that characterizes the rank and file of them . They do not feel the desirability of meeting people in a social way . The fault , however , is not in the occupation , but in the persons who take it up . Whenever teachers meet other men and women on equal terms , they get all the esteem their character and personality deserve . Undoubtedly , as many complain , they are overworked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drudgery of the school robs them of time for social duties , and tends to quench any social desire . Moreover , many are not paid enough to dress properly . In school we teachers are associated with less mature minds , and it is easy to become selfsatisfied . Unless we come in contact with men and women of equal or higher intellectual attainments , we fail to realize our littleness . The general testimony of the replies is that in the larger villages and smaller cities the social position is higher than in the larger cities and smaller villages . From Maine the statement comes that there has been no advance for the last twenty years in the respect with which the public regards the teacher . Of the older States , Pennsylvania also is represented in an unfavorable light : " A teacher is apparently of little account . " " He is regarded as an inferior of humanity . " " He has no influence in the community outside of the schoolroom . " It is evident that in all parts of the country where the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges , normal schools , or large private schools , more consideration is shown to teachers as a class . One man in the West gives his opinion that the teacher is a great big cipher . " One from the South writes : " The teachers are expected to help the church , subscribe to the political fund , take all the papers , be helpers for everybody and everything , and carry the burden of humanity generally , and never assert their own views , but patiently serve . " From all over the Union comes the testimony from teachers that , if they wish to keep their positions , they must not express their opinions on local and national questions . This subserviency of itself would tend to make the calling an inferior one . A few of the New England States furnish evidence of a respectful recognition of the teacher in society ; Georgia , Colorado , Minnesota , and Illinois leave with me the impression that they are the hopeful States . The reports from some of the States , especially from New York , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not the opinion expressed that the chief lack among our teachers is " general culture , and the refinement of manner that comes with it . " Intellectually , the teacher , whether in city or in country , has not attained a high status . Overcrowded as the profession is , because it is the best stepping-stone to other callings , the average teacher has not deliberately qualified himself either in scholarship or in professional knowledge . This testimony goes to corroborate the statements on this point made annually by the National Commissioner of Education . As the public school teacher is not scholarly , it follows that his interests are not broad , and that intellectually he is not a power in the community . In the schoolroom itself , it often happens that the teacher has no greater knowledge of his subjects than an acquaintance with the facts required for the recitation . A superintendent in EliThe Case of the Public Schools . // nois writes : " The criticism I have to offer upon teachers as a class is their limited literary qualifications . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and logical . " A teacher in a neighboring State notes chiefly the teachers ' lack of " an accurate and broad knowledge . Our elementary schools are taught by young persons who are not always graduates of grammar schools , and hardly ever of high schools . Further , our high school faculties are not , as a rule , made up of college graduates . " The standard of professional equipment of the American teacher is , as would be expected , even lower than his social status . Throughout the Union the idea prevails that any one who knows schoolroom subjects can teach , and that any one with sufficient muscle can discipline . The public is satisfied with a low standard of scholarship , and makes little demand for professional skill . Until quite recently the normal schools have furnished what professional preparation there has been . Nothing struck me more forcibly , in studying these opinions , which came straight out of the experience of those who wrote them , than the note of dissatisfaction with the normal schools . Several teachers ask , Why require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not successful teachers ? The majority of the students of the normal schools enter with little more than an elementary education . For this reason the normal schools tend to lose their peculiar function of preparing young men and women to teach the elementary branches . As a superintendent in Illinois well expressed it , " Most of our normal schools try to give an average of academic with an equal amount of pro . fessional training , all at once . " The result is an apology for both . The normal schools tend also to " deify method , and to lose sight of the supreme importance of the teacher 's individuality and personal force . " The kindliness of the American heart rather than professional responsibility characterizes those in charge of these schools , and those candidates not fitted by qualities of temper and manner for teaching are not weeded out . One educator from a small State observes , " A teacher is born , not made , " and then continues , " We need a few more teachers born . " A person can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not naturally fitted for it . It is not sufficiently understood , however , that a good teacher can not be made out of a person who lacks all the qualities of a teacher . A second or third rate man can not begin to do the harm in one of the so-called " learned " professions that he can do in a school where he has the sole charge of forty or fifty boys and girls for five or six hours a day , five days in the week , seven or eight months in the year . The school age is the impressionable age . In the formation of habits , lines of thought , and rules of action , unconsciously the pupils adopt their teachers as models . A South Dakota teacher makes an utterance from that new State which has a genuine ring in it when he says : " The lack of professional training prevents the teachei from holding that standing in the community which other professionally trained persons have . The low status of the profession has not made the teacher the adviser of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which the physician and lawyer are advisers in their professions . " It is to be acknowledged that the lack of confidence in teachers is well grounded . If it has been a question in the past whether teaching should be considered a profession , the data hereby furnished leave no further doubt that it is yet a makeshift , a " procession " rather than a profession . Only a very few choose the work deliberately as a permanent vocation because they think it best for them . A few take it up because they can not get anything else to do , and remain in it // for life . Teaching has the reputation of being a " berry-picking roadside , where spare change is to be picked up before jumping into the field and going to work , " and of being a " hospital for the blind , the halt , and the lame of every other craft . " From a New England State a teacher reports : " Many in the community think teachers must have failed in some other business before being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in the country schools are many young girls . Often an American girl , after she leaves school , " keeps school " until she has the opportunity to keep house , and this fact alone shows that teaching is not a life-work with the majority who take it up . Men , also , frequently regard teaching as an incident in their career ; it is a step to their professions , or else a temporary means of support to the doctor while waiting for patients , to the lawyer while waiting for clients , and to the preacher while waiting for a pulpit . Successful professional men are apt to look upon men who remain in teaching with a sort of compassion . If a teacher 's purpose in taking up the calling is of a temporary or trivial kind , it will be to the detriment of the pupils ; for the teacher 's purpose is reflected in the schoolroom . Instability of the teacher 's purpose accounts directly for much of the inefficiency of our schools . If a person is in the work because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , his presence will tend to keep out better persons . Among other reasons , the status of the teacher is low because the ablest men and women are not attracted to it in very great numbers , and because such persons of ability as are drawn into it are not retained ; and thus the system tends to the survival of the unfittest . This instability of purpose leads to a great deal of moving about within the calling . Teachers who lack any great amount of professional zeal leave lowpriced positions for more lucrative ones before they have had time to impress themselves fully upon their pupils . In a new country like ours new ideas are taken up and quickly put into practice ; but our teachers , like the rest of their countrymen , are too eager for immediate results ; they will not remain patiently to watch over their ideas and wisely to aid their development . Frequent changes , for whatever cause , mar the influence that teachers might exert upon the pupils . It is not uncommon for every teacher in a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School boards , especially in the West , have a belief that places can be filled easily . Usually the teachers who come are no worse than those who go . One superintendent says that his best teachers marry , and leave the poorer ones whom he could better spare . While incompetency is the rule and competency the exception , frequent changes are not so much to be regretted . It is the country schools , undoubtedly , that are most affected . After being called to the cities teachers are contented , and tend to become unambitious and nonprogressive . A considerable number of teachers say that changes are too infrequent in the cities . From one city in the West a teahher writes : " If a cyclone were to strike this city , it would be justified in carrying off seventy-five per cent of the teachers ; and yet our schools are progressive and well spoken of because we 1*ave a progressive superintendent . " The natural reflection is , what a load that superintendent must carry , and what could he not accomplish if things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! When there is any degree of permanency in the more remote communities , it is because local candidates are elected . They can live more cheaply at home , and can not casily be called away . A school taught by " home talent " is often dead educationally . The old faults are fixed , and routine rather than naturalness and progressiveness characterizes the work done . // The remuneration of teachers as compared with that of the " learned " professions is low , - whether unduly low for the mass of them , who are hardly more than unskilled laborers , is doubtful . As a Kansas man puts it , " There are about as many overpaid as there are underpaid teachers . " Throughout many States , and in some cities in other States , the salaries of women who teach compare very favorably with women 's salaries in other walks of life . The minimum salary reported is four dollars a week . Teachers living at home can work for less pay than others . This results in the depression of salaries . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is co-education , that ignores the need of both men and women does not attain its greatest efficiency . Men are usually passed by because Women can be had for lower salaries . Men must bear family burdens , and thus can not compete on the same footing with women . One teacher writes : " Men of a given degree of ability and application can earn more in other occupations than in teaching . " The same teacher adds further : " Low salaries necessitate poor teachers , but it does not follow that high salaries alone will bring good teachers . Inefficiency is often rewarded . Every schedule of salaries rewards inefficiency just as much as it does efficiency . " One person on the Pacific coast reports that " the best teachers are poorly paid ; the inefficient , exorbitantly paid . " A letter from Illinois runs as follows : " It has been my observation that teachers are appreciated for what they are worth . " Tutoring in the larger towns , vacation work everywhere , and other forms of outside work are done by teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful in diminishing the efficiency of the school work . It does not allow proper preparation for daily recitations , nor furnish the proper rest for the teacher . It is a practice not confined to lowsalaried teachers . In the more favorably situated communities extensive outside money - earning is carried on , and the public naturally asks whether it is necessary to pay as much for teachers as it does pay . If one remains in school work , one is obliged to save for old age . Germany regards her teachers as " defenders of the public safety , " and pensions them . The hindrance to the granting of pen sions in the United States is the incomplete organization of our school systems , together with the general lack of the permanency of the teaching force . There is not sufficient stability to give an impetus to the establishment of anything like a general cotiperative pension bureau . No one who is temporarily in the profession wishes to contribute to a general fund for this purpose . No one who is competent desires to pay part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one teacher puts it , means that " the competents support the incompetents . " Brooklyn proposes to have a retirement fund . Deductions are to be made from the salaries of the regular teaching corps , and applied for the support of those who retire or are discharged . If I am not mistaken , the initiative in this was taken by the city authoi*ities , and the scheme is regarded with disfavor by the majority of the teachers . In Chicago , " it is proposed to honor teachers " by giving them pensions . One teacher writes : " From the nature of the work teaching compels a man to retire early . " If this is true , it is a fact not to be observed in the German schools . A New England teacher wishes that " salaries were such that it would not be inhumane to retire one when too old to teach . " Male teachers , particularly , feel that by the time they are forty they ought to be in something else . If it is once admitted that a teacher past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching will ever be " held in as high honor as it ought to be . " Teachers ' agencies stimulate competition and assist teachers to find their // proper places quickly . Their very existence , however , is indicative of the lack of any real organization of teaching as a profession . While teachers ' agencies often find reward for individual merit , every dollar paid to them takes from the total amount paid to the teaching force . Their business also tends to keep in the work those who have been failures . Promotions should come as a most natural distinction for efficiency . Under present conditions , it is almost a necessity , if the teacher wishes to know of vacancies and to stand a fair chance of bettering himself , to use a teachers ' agency . Should he be fortunate enough to procure a place , he must pay five per cent of the salary that lie is to receive to the agency that has helped him . Sometimes this is paid when the agency has merely informed the candidate that there is a vacancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the educational checkerboard . These moves are paid for , not by the school boards , but by the teachers themselves . Were there an organized profession , its members , and not outsiders , would form some kind of a general coöperative agency for giving notice of contemplated changes in positions , and , as far as possible , for aiding the right man to secure the right place . The bureaus that have been established at the colleges are not , apparently , of much use to the graduate of three or four years ' standing . The normal schools which have come under my observation fail entirely to keep in touch with their graduates so as , to assist them as regards promotion . The defects in the status of the teacher are , to repeat what was said at the beginning , lack of general culture , lack of scholarship , lack of professional training . Incidentally , partly as causes and partly as results of these defects , there must be added these facts : teaching is chosen as a makeshift by a large majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lack of fixity of location ; there is a lack of security because of improper influences from outside ; there is a lack of professional progressiveness ; there is a lack of a strong fraternal spirit . To put it briefiy*teaching is not a profession . Although this statement is disturbing to the complacency of the earnest , well-trained teacher , yet it is none the less a fact , and is so regarded by the m'emhers of the calling at large . The status in the poorer and more sparsely settled portions of the country is , of course , decidedlylower than it is in the larger towns and cities . Yet the defects presented are the same . The difference is of degree only . There are professional teachers to be found in all parts of the country , but they are exceptions . They are mixed in with the general mass of teachers , and in any composite picture of the American public schoolteacher their identity is lost . As regards remedies , the first requisite is a proper realization on the part of the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second a clearer understanding of his own duty and opportunity under the circumstances . A teacher does better work only as he grows through experience , and as he broadens his mind by study and by intercourse with his fellow-men . First of all , the teacher needs to guard himself against the danger of not making acquaintances outside the school circle . He should seize every chance that offers itself to be social and to excite sociability in those about him . He must not , out of an over-seriousness , believe it his duty to have nothing to do with society . If the young teacher lives forhimself alone after he leaves the schoolroom , he will not , when success comes , find it easy to meet on an equal social footing people outside of his own line of work . The teacher need not have the graces of a Lord Chesterfield , but , as the instructor of boys and girls , he should possess good manners . Perfect self-possession , freedom from affectation , proper care for dress and the person , produce a subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly less valuable than that which is given by direct instruction . Good manners are sadly wanting in children of all school grades above the kindergarten . Often the home pays too little attention to the cultivation of polite ways , but the school itself is responsible in a larger measure . Teachers have here a valuable opportunity that they can not afford to neglect ; but how can they teach politeness if they are not themselves polite ? Further , to make their social status in all respects as dignified as that of the professions , it is the duty of each teacher to avail himself of the unusual opportunities for self - cultivation that this calling offers . Art , literature , and history should be regarded by him not alone from a teacher 's , but from a student 's point of view . The normal schools should give more time and thought to the social side of the young teacher . Then , as teachers go from these institutions , would the schools themselves in which they teach tend to develop better manners . The Educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chicago , Cincinnati , and New Orleans , and some of the reading circles of the Western cities , besides raising the professional standard , are bringing the teacher more into touch with society . Any influence that can create a closer sympathy and cooperation between the home and the school will tend to better the social position of the teacher . Improvements in the teachers ' status must take their beginning from the teachers themselves . This problem , however , can not be treated as altogether distinct from the other problems that the teachers ' position presents . To secure social standing and recognition , teachers must possess culture and personal power that win respect outside of school . The question how to attract the best men and women needs to be answered before we can come to a final solution of the social problem . It is true that if the social status is raised , a better class of men and women 541 will take up the work ; and it is equally true that if a better class of men and women appear , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible for teachers to buy books , to travel , to hear lectures , to attend concerts , and to dress properly on social occasions . But it may be asked , What is going to make salaries higher ? Then , too , what is going to diminish the labor required of the teacher so that " his personal needs shall not be effaced and opportunities for self-culture surrendered " ? Passing to the problem of the defective intellectual equipment , it would seem as if the duty here were plain . It is simply to bring about in the instructing body itself a sentiment that will urge wouldbe teachers to prepare themselves more broadly . Let those who are in the work put forth every effort that those who are going to the normal schools shall have at least a complete , thorough high school course before they enter , and those who are going into high school instruction , a college course . It must be borne in mind that the first requisite of the teacher is the right kind of personality . The normal schools themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sift out the applicants for admission . Quality , not quantity , should be their aim . It would be well if the faculty of the normal school would arrange for personal interviews with all young persons seeking admission , to find out the purpose and something of the individual make - up of each applicant . This is perfectly feasible . As regards academic training for those from the country districts , - which often furnish the best teachers , - where shall it be procured ? There is often no high school within the radius of many miles . Such young persons as signify their intention of later entering a normal school should be sent to some approved high school at the expense of the State in which they live . Objection is made at once that this arrangement would be expensive for the // room that is hardly less valuable than that which is given by direct instruction .

Such young persons as signify their intention of later entering a normal school should be sent to some approved high school at the ex- qwq 1896. 541 // State , and for the candidates as well . The aim should be to choose only the best , and it would be wiser economy to train a small number of promising candidates well than a large , promiscuous body poorly . Wherever the academic training may be obtained , let it come before the professional training , not along with it . The first educational duty of each State is to look to the welfare of its elementary schools , for they provide for the education of the plain people . These schools are what the teachers make them . It should not be forgotten that the elementary schools fit also for the secondary schools , and that it is of prime importance that elementary teachers be high school graduates . If for no other reason than that the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more , the source of supply for teachers of the primary and grammar schools , their existence at public expense could be justly maintained . The high schools furnish also our social and business leaders ; they raise the educational standard of our communities , and they prepare for the higher institutions . It is of prime importance that the States look to the intellectual and professional preparation of the teachers of thes.e schools . Where there are no state universities , scholarships should be provided by the States at some college for the would-be high school teachers . These should be carefully selected by written examinations and personal interviews . It is only as all public school teaching is put on firmer educational foundations that teachers will become greater powers intellectually . For myself , I look forward with hope to the day when many of our grammar school principals and assistants shall also be college-trained . In addition to the high school course , the elementary teacher needs two years , at least , of the right normal school training , and a secondary teacher one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pedago gical courses are planned in connection with our colleges , but it is hoped that in the future higher normal schools will be established in States where there are not state universities . Judged by German standards , the length of time for professional preparation here outlined is too short . Germany leads the world in educational matters because of the superior training of her teachers . In contrast to German conditions , it can not be disguised that there is a lack of complete organization in our school systems , that public sentiment is more materialistic than educational , and that because of the largeness of our country there is a great difference in the efficiency of city and country schools . Moreover , there have been neither educational experts of sufficient training and experience to perfect our school systems , nor a well-trained , sympathetic , stable body of teachers to awaken public interest in education . Whichever way we turn , in viewing the inefficiency of our public school system , we are brought face to face with the fact that the personnel of its leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great need that a teacher prepare himself as definitely and carefully as a man is prepared for the ministry , medicine , or the law . The exact nature of this preparation can not be set forth in a paper like this . Suffice it to say , the teacher should have a definite knowledge of the human mind and of the human body ; he should know how to draw forth , to direct , and to control the activities of the child through the periods of school life ; he should know the influences which act upon a child to determine its character ; he should be acquainted with school organization and school management ; he should not be ignorant of the thought and experience of other teachers in the field in which he is at work ; he should know the history of education , and also school laws and precedents . His training should leave him thoughtful , devoted , and energetic . The attitude with // which a teacher approaches his work determines largely his success . If the professional course has aroused in him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should have brought him to regard the pupils as of major , and the subject matters of instruction as of minor importance . What we teachers are able to do for our boys and girls is measured by the interest that we take in them as individuals . Possessed of a sympathetic , intelligent interest , the teacher with small intellectual capital is oftentimes more efficient than the unsympathetic scholarly teacher . Child study and the study of adolescence should be begun in the training institutions , and there sympathetically and intelligently directed . City , district , and country superintendents need to be sufficiently well equipped to lead their teachers to study the home interests and influences and the personal characteristics of their pupils . The status of the teacher will be improved only by insisting on higher intellectual and professional equipment as a prerequisite for obtaining a position to teach . It is the duty of the teaching body itself to bring up its status by raisingthe quality of its membership . There should be some assurance in the form of a license or certificate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions set us examples of the kind of watchful care necessary in guarding against admission of quacks , " shysters , " and other persons entirely unfit . Teachers should organize , and demand that they , and not school boards made up of laymen , should conduct all examinations for determining who shall become teachers . When every school in this country is under the supervision of some educational officer , really an educational expert , practical , conservative , and far-seeing , then it is to be hoped that superintendents will be regarded in the light of professional advisers . A school superintendent should know schools from actual experience in them . He needs the highest kind of professional training , the broadest scholarship , and more than the ordinary practical business ability . Ministers , lawyers , doctors , and men of no profession are as undesirable as they are usually incompetent . In Idaho , for example , " probate judges are ex officio superintendents , and in looking after the interests of the dead those of the living are neglected . " In this survey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of politics and other outside influences to enter in and interfere with school management , and especially at its most vital part , the appointment of teachers . The formation of a teachers ' union in each State , so strong that all working together could present a solid front and demand that appointment be based on merit , might do much good . Whatever may be the solution of this problem , I agree most thoroughly with a report from the West , which says : " The teacher who can make the most out of the boys and girls placed in his care is the one for the place , be he Methodist , Baptist , Republican , Populist , tall , short , Yankee , or German . " A larger number of persons of higher scholastic and pedagogical preparation will do something to counteract the effect of improper influences , and will furnish a sounder basis for legislation concerning " tenure of office . " Security is wanting , partly at least , because of a well-grounded lack of confidence in teachers generally . Did teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down on the teacher 's occupation , and the chances for a permanent continuance of desirable men and women in the work would be largely increased . If better preparation were required for admission , only those who chose teaching for their life - work would expend the necessary time and money . The general permanency belonging to the other professions is almost impossible for teaching as long as most teachers are women . Yet women // are desirable teachers , and their power for education is not lost when they become mothers . An Illinois teacher writes that , in his opinion , " a professional course such as doctors and lawyers must take would make the teacher 's calling a profession , and induce men of ability to stay in it . " He is far from being alone in this opinion . As legislation for more complete tenure of position for the teacher goes hand in hand with higher professional equipment , so does higher remuneration . If salaries are low , it may only go to prove that the popular estimate has not been blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that they are only protecting themselves when they keep undesirable material out of the profession . For him who chooses teaching deliberately , and who provides himself with an all - round preparation , there is a high place , and because of the unorganized condition of our educational system it is quickly attained . The people will be satisfied with such teachers as they have until teachers themselves demonstrate the necessity of employing better . The American public will not withhold its appreciation if higher scholarship and sounder professional culture result in honest , enthusiastic , and skillful efforts ; and anything that can lead to the spread of expert supervision will tend to increase salaries , and to give greater assurance that merit will be rewarded . If in connection with every college and normal school there should be established teachers ' employment bureaus , both the institutions themselves and the teaching graduates would be materially aided . That the teacher is a potent factor in American civilization no one can deny , but that his highest possibilities have not been reached can not be ignored . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe unreservedly that the defects in his status will be remedied .
