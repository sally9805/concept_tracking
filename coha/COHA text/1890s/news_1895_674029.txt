txt Now that the charges of Lord DuxRAVEN against Mr. IsELnkr are under consideration by a committee which commands universal confidence for . its interngence. and its impartiality , it seems high ly proper to await the decision of that tribunal and to refrain In the meanwhile from any comments upon the subject . But that obvious course does not suit Lord DukaavEx . He has made an interlocutory appeal , so to speak , to the British public , in a speech that was not only made to his friends and neighbors , in whose minds he could not be blamed for trying to exculpate himself , but that was promptly telegraphed to the press and laid before the British and American publics by way of influencing their opinion in advance of the decision of a tribunal to the jurisdiction of which he had submitted his case . The noble Earl has singular notions about what constitutes an exculpation . He does not pretend to have any evidence in support of his charge , or to be in a position to substantiate it to anybody 's satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only possible chance of ascertaining " whether his suspicions were well founded has now " gone forever . " Yet he not only does not withdraw his charge or apologize for having made it , but he publicly reiterates it , after the matter has been referred to a tribunal for investigation . In case the committee decides that he is wrong , he has thus made a case against himself for what , in a lawsuit , would be an aggravation of damages . If only his guesses and the guesses of anybody else who may have guessed with him , that a change was made in the water line of the Defender should be opposed to the positive testimony of everybody in a position to know that no such change was made , apparently he will still go on preferring his guesses to the evidence , and will reiterate , after the judgment has been rendered , that his competitor in an international race for the yachting supremacy of the world played a swindling trick upon him . Luckily the publication of Lord DorfRAVEN 'S speech , following upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so gross and palpable that the British publicist and the British public can not err therein . Which boat was to blame for a collision , how much the course was obstructed , whether the obstruction was more injurious to one contestant than to the other  --  these are all questions which onev.must be an eye witness to have an opinion upon , and on them an interested person 3,000 miles away naturally adopts the opinion of his own countrymen and his own side . But whether it is honorable or dishonorable to declare and to reiterate that a man is a swindler , without producing or pretending to possess alz.z : evidence in support of the accusation , that is a question which everybody can understand . Everybody has equal and abundant facilities for forming an opinion upon it , and honorable men in every country will form the same opinion . In the latest phase which he has ca , uird the discussion to assume , Lord DuNi6.44 ' may be safely left to the judgment of his own countrymen .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
