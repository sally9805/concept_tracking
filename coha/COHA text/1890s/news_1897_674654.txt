txt Capt . P. H. Ray of the Eighth United States Infantry , who was sent with Lieut . Richardson to explore the Yukon Basin and make a full report to the War Department concerning supplies and the need for troops , is now at Fort Yukon , 1,300 miles from St. Michael . He has little chance , if any , of getting out of the Yukon this Winter , his dog teams , which were forwarded to him from St. Michael on the steamer May West , being delayed at Minook . The May West will be frozen in at that point without doubt . A dog team numbering fifteen animals is on the May West . At Fort Yukon Capt . Ray , Lieut . Richardson , Mint Statistician G. Yale . and Deputy Collector Charles Smith signed a statement concerning the situation on the Yukon , which is in part as follows : " The river steamers , with passengers crid supplies for Dawson , find it absolutely impossible to cress the main river four miles above this place , and soundings and examinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is available for steamboat navigation . Those who are contemplating a return to St. Michael to Winter will encounter the fact that while there is an abundant supply of provisions at that point , there are not buildings enough to shelter the people already there . There is no lumber available for erecting cabins , and there is practically no fuel obtainable . " The climate is very inclement , the Winter gales being exceedingly severe , so it is out of the question for men to live in tents in that place . There are already more people at St. Michael than can be properly cared for . At Fort Yukon and vicinity there is a certain amount of food , which will be for sale , and consider ; able more is expected on the Weare and Bella and her barges . There is plenty of wood for building cabins , and also for fuel . A larger supply of provisions is at Fort Yukon than at any other point on the river . At Minook Creek supplies have been landed and a trading station has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will Winter there , and so far not enough food has been landed for that number . "
