ALBANY , April ** Morton to-day sent a message to certain Albany politicians which leads them to complain that " the hinges in his backbone axe rusty this week . " His message was that the Albany BiPartisan Police bill had better be recalled for amendment if they did not want it vefoed . The word was taken to the legislators from this district by the Governor 's legal adviser , Charles Z. Lincoln , who had come to the conclusion that the bill is unconstitutional . The Albany men will probably withdraw the bill to-morrow . This action of the Governor is particularly displeasing just at this time , for it endangers the bill . If the measure Is to be amended it must be three days on the desks of each House before it can be passed . Then it must be sent to Mayor Thacher for approval or disapproval . He may retain it fifteen days , and if he vetoes it , it must again be repassed by both houses . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The suggestion made to the Albany legislators is that the bill be changed so that the power to appoint Police Commissioners shall be given to the Mayor of the city instead of being put into the hands of the Common Council . The Albany bosses are not pleased at this project , because Mayor Thacher is a Democrat . Some of them are proposing to give the appointing power to the County Judge .
