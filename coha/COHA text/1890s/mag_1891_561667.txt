txt THE United States government is first a political and second a business organization . If it is purely an affair of business , it could not be noble enough in the larger things in human ambition and existence to protect life , insure liberty , and promote human happiness . It is something which , under the blessing of God and the wisdom of man , comprehends and serves first greater aspirations than any mere sordid thing of business , finance , or commerce . Therefore it is not primarily a business machine . It is something with a soul , and that soul , let the reformers cant as they may , is put into it through politics . For this is a representative government based on party responsibility . The people at the polls , deciding between certain parties , decide in favor of certain political or party principles . When they elect a Republican candidate for President , they indorse the Republican platform of principles , and expect to see those principles carried out in the government during the term of that President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to see the Democratic principles carried out in the government during his term . This was the intention of the fathers of the republic and the makers of the constitution , and this idea controlled , and party principles ruled in government , under the limitations of reason and law , for the first hundred years of the republic , to the satisfaction of the people and the vindication before the world of the capacity of man for selfgovernment . In these first hundred years partyism was encouraged and applauded ; not discouraged and flouted according to the new intellectual fashion of this latter day . Indeed , the early men of // the republic felt and taught that honorable party zeal was an active and practical form of public patriotism . In truth , the larger fear of the fathers in establishing a republic was that the indifference of the average voter might imperil and prevent the actual rule of the people . For a hundred years American boys were taught love of country , pride of party , and promotion and protection of liberty through patriotism of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who sought by constant industry to make his government better , locally or nationally , who worked with unselfishness and generosity for his country by working for his party , who had such pride in party record that he vigilantly employed every honorable endeavor to keep it pure and honest , was called in those better days the better citizen . The people saw clearly then that their only way to exert influence in government was to identify themselves with party . If they believed in certain principles , they allied themselves with all others who believed in the same principles , and this assembling of people of kindred belief and aspiration formed a political party . The first impulse toward it was one of patriotism . The constant incentive in it was love of country . So the first Americans found political parties necessary , and both from honor and from party interest saw that they must be kept pure in order to gain the approval and retain the confidence of the people . It was this spirit and this pride of party which made the first hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in record for liberty and human rights , unequalled in the world , whether a comparison be made with other governments , as to the faithful transaction of business and the minimum of loss in the collection and disbursement of revenues , or with the most perfect and scrupulous methods and systems of the business or commercial world . In that good old fashioned time of simple faith and open belief , when any political party assumed power in the government , whether of city , State , or nation , it assumed full responsibility . That which was good in its administration of the government went to its credit ; that which was bad went to its discredit . The people did not ask , after they had given it full power , whether it would choose faithful and friendly agents to serve under it . They took it for granted that in human wisdom it would follow the lesson of human experience that a friend is safer than an enemy . It was never believed , in the first hundred years of // America , that any national administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe in its principles than with people who did . Otherwise , in those days it was not believed that Democrats could carry out Republican principles in the government better than Republicans . The plain people of that period had never read in the Bible , nor in human history , that an enemy is more dependable or more serviceable , either in public or private life , than a friend . The people always knew , when they elected the Democratic party , that they had indorsed Democratic principles . They knew they-were to have a Democratic administration ; and let it be said that the Democratic party has never disappointed this expectation up to date . The Pharisee , who made his appearance in American politics at the same time that the Democratic party  --  the smartest thing in human guile which this young country has ever known-purchased several Republican newspapers and set them to teacbing the Democratic doctrines while still bearing the Republican name , proclaimed that the first hundred years of the republic had been all wrong . Under the American fashion the elder men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frequent changes in public office were also advocated . All told , in nation , State , county , district , city , and precinct nearly a million of offices were created . It was taught that it was not only the privilege , but the duty , of every intelligent and patriotic citizen to engage in politics , and to hold office when his fellow-citizens demanded it . Under this theory every active and earnest citizen of the republic , especially in the rural communities , was almost sure at some time to hold some office and be educated in government , and to learn the conservatism of government . It was also cherished as one of the glories of the republic that the humblest family in the land might furnish the best public officer . The . Pharisee came to reverse all this . He came to teach that partyism , or love of party , or activity in politics , was a peril to the republic ; that constant political agitation was hurtful to the nation ; t*hat the political caucus in the township , otherwise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that activity and politics made a man dangerous in government . So the argument goes on to-day . For my own part , I believe in the old theory . I believe in the politician-otherwise , in the American who takes an active // personal interest in public affairs , beginning with the smallest office and continuing through to the largest-rather than in the Pharisee , who would introduce into the republic the doctrine that private or individual interest in government is wrong , that officeholding does not concern the people , and that life tenure in office is both wise and necessary . I believe , too , that every good American citizen is a politician . It is a good word , although the Pharisee would make it an epithet . He scouts the word politician and uses the word statesman . Our accepted dictionaries make little difference between politician and statesman . In the sense that any one who takes an interest in politics is a politician , as he is , we have millions of politicians in America . In the sense that a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known in the whole world of statesmen , we have very few . As the town meeting , the initial movement in our government , is the unit of public welfare , so may it be that the politician of the town meeting may be not only the best citizen of his own community , but the most useful citizen of his State . For the town meeting is not only the basis of liberty in American government , but without it liberty would soon go . It is the absence of the town meeting in the South which is responsible for the absence of both home rule and liberty in that portion of the country . If the South had the town meeting , as the North has it ,  --  otherwise , if its thousands of precincts or small communities had the right to rule in their own affairs ,  --  what is called the Southern question now in politics would be speedily settled . For if the hundreds of thousands of free men in the South among the white men there , as well as the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start in politics , if they could make this precinct Republican , or this county Republican , or that district Republican , each according to its honest majority , the leaven w6uld soon spread , and the South be put in line with its own true interests , and no longer left an oligarchy , governed by centralized tyrannies at the various State capitals . The coercion and disfranchisement of the black men of the South are the cruelty of this age . Yet nearly as alarming is the coercion of hundreds of thousands of Southern white men who do not believe in the bourbonism of Democratic rule or in the cruelty of Democratic methods , but who are terrorized into stifling their own consciences , suppressing their own // principles , and acting with the party in whose doctrine and destiny they do not believe . I am not of those who think that millions of Americans may be politically smothered . There is a palsy of political parties just now ; but God can cure this palsy , as he can the other plagues that fall upon men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no pity for the repose of nations ; and any soothsayer of this timid time who thinks that six millions of colored people in the South , twice as many as composed the people of the colonies at the time of the Revolution , can be degraded into a servile peasantry , and a million voters permanently disfranchised , little comprehends the final justice of man or the overwatching justice of God . Time will settle this question . Timorous politicians or lawmakers of to-day may postpone the settlemelit , as timorous men once before referred the question of slavery from a settlement of statesmanship to one of blood . If the South had the town meeting , and with it its half-dozen politicians , with pride of party and love of liberty , in every town and precinct , it would be settled on Southern soil and by Southern men , and would not clog the way all the time in the national capital . I believe in the politician , and am not afraid of the word . The American politician who loves his country is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who honorably spends his time to see that his party has the best men for candidates and his government the best men for officers . Give this kind of politicians free course , and we shall have less of the danger that comes through rich men buying high offices with money , and then complacently scouting either obligation to party or duty to the people in filling them . Nor is the country in any danger from any citizen who , having seen that nine times in ten rascality in office follows long continuance in office , demands frequent changes in the interest of the public service . The Pharisee would change all this , would take away from the people this interest and education in politics , would take away from the million Americans holding office every year the education they thus gain in government , and would teach the masses of Americans to be indifferent to public affairs . He would also make a poor citizen of a man in order to make him a good officer . The people themselves have no fear of the politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to renew his life at every // caucus and in every convention and at every election . The more publicity in politics the better ; the more activity the better . When the white light of publicity is on anything , the danger is gone . A rathole is no longer a rathole after the sun shines into it . Instead of narrowing the number of men who shall hold public office , instead of taking away public affairs from the people , instead of educating the people to be indifferent in political matters , I would renew the custom of the fathers , and teach in the home , even before the caucus is reached , and again in the caucus , and again in the local convention , and again in every convention and election , until the top is reached , that every boy and every citizen*should take an interest in the proceedings at every step , and that every family in the land should be informed in regard to it as well . It is on the hearthstones of this country that all great political questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politician . I know personally of the generosity of the men of politics . Twenty-five years ' participation in active politics has given me a chance to look in the lion 's mouth . I can recall today , looking back over this long stretch of time , scarcely any men who have made money in politics . I know of no politician who has become rich as a politician . To find those who find fortune and gear in politics , you must go to the corrupt rule of Tammany or some other large city . I believe that it may be asserted as true that ninety-nine men in every hundred spend more money in politics , and in public affairs and for the public good , than they ever gain in politics or from any sort of office-holding or profit-sharing in government . The presence of corruption in politics is greatly overestimated . There are very few men who want to violate the honor of the Republic or dishonor the record of their party . No man who would debauch the American ballot should be respected by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honesty of this government , the preservation of it in power and patriotism to our children , are far more to any and all of us than anything of party success or power or personal ambition could possibly be . Not merely the essayists who write for reform on salary are honest . The great masses of the people are honest . The rivalries of politics , the quarrels of party , the jealousies and enmities of politicians over office , are many and often shocking . But so in this poor world are the rivalries and jealousies and // enmities of the professions , of the business world , and even of the church We are all poor mortals , and God must have some charity for us all in our mortality and weakness , whether we be politicians , Pharisees , or persevering saints . It is the cant of the Pharisee to speak of the cruelty and heartlessness of politics and politicians . I have seen the other side of the shield . I have studied human nature in politics for a quarter of a century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind , in the good intention of my neighbor , in the honesty of the masses of the people . I have seen more of generosity displayed in politics , more of self-sacrifice , than in anything else . I have seen men display more activity and more generosity to gain office for friends than for themselves . I have seen , too , as so many blooming flowers on the wall between parties , that freemasonry between men of honor and soul in different political parties which leads constantly to the practice of human charity and individual generosity . You may go to the departments in Washington , and you will find there that the worl*l of politics takes care of those who in any sense appeal to its heart . Nearly every distinguished family in America has some representative in those departments . It is one of the customs of men in politics , when they find the descendant of a man who has served his country well and gone his way to another world , leaving his family poor , to care for that descendant ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed . By what right does the Pharisee sneer at the politician ? By what right does the professional moralist sneer at politics ? The hundred years or more of American polities and government is disproof of the sneers of both . The business affairs of the people have been conducted more scrupulously and more accurately than the private business of commerce in the same time . There have been fewer defalcatious and fewer rascalities in office , in proportion , than in private life . Who are the politicians who have made money and fortune trafficking in the public name or national honor ? Of the six thousand seats that have been filled in Congress in the last thirty years , who are the politicians who have proved dishonest ? Is it not true that , where one public official has been found unworthy , twenty men in public life have served the government for a third of the return which they could have gained in the business world or the professions ? // What was Samuel J. Randall but a politician ?  --  the man who served his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars from opulent merchants , and died on a bed worth ten dollars . Who has been a more typical politician in the last fifty years than Oliver P. Morton or John A. Logan , each rendering his nation and his people great service , and dying poor and in a mortgaged home ? Hannibal Hamlin is another fair and representative type of the politician , and the whole country reveres the American in him to-day , and forgets the Republican and honors the politician . So might we cite hundreds of thousands of others . Who is the boss in politics , or the local or State leader-that great bogy who is now conjured up by the Pharisees and reformers with which to frighten the people ? In the small neighborhood he is the man who does for his party what the classleader does for his church . lie keeps its political lamps trimmed and burning . In the district or State he is generally the most generous man , and has the most ambition in party and pride in country , who does a work so good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it done , nor merely money find a man able to do it . Why should every other organization of human affairs have a leader , and not politics ? The church has a leader ; every active organization must have a leader : so must politics . Here and there is found a leader who may be unworthy . He is not a boss until he gets to be unworthy , and then the people , acting in their primary capacity , very quickly dispose of his dishonesty and his lordship . No boss can live more than a year in this country , because every leader has to renew his life at the hands of the people at least once every twelve months . To say that political leaders are dishonest , that they keep a long and corrupt reign of power , extending over years , is to say that the people themselves are either too ignorant to know a dishonest leader or too dishonest to demand honest leadership . I believe also in practical politics . I believe that when Benjamin Harrison was elected President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was elected to carry out those principles , and was expected to believe that Republicans could carry them out better than Democrats . Whether he desires it or not , the Republican party is held responsible for his every act . Every Democrat that he retains in office he becomes responsible for , and makes the Republican party responsible for . If any // Democrat proves a rascal in holding office under a Republican administration , the Republican party , and not the Democratic , becomes responsible for his rascality , and the people will so hold . This is the sense found at the level of common-sense , and the people believe in it . President Harrison , one of the truest of Americans and most progressive of men , has from the first sought to test to the marrow the good that was reported to be in the new reform . He has tried it honestly and not in half ways . What has been the result ? While his administration was in its honeymoon , or for the first year and a half , it had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished it well but the Mugwump , who never wishes well to anything Republican . Yet the executive persevered in faithful , patient trial of the new idea . President Harrison is a sincere Republican ; as sincere and earnest as any one in the party , past or present . He believes more in the moderh theory than many of us do ; and he may be right or he may be wrong . Yet the first two years of his administration , with all its missionary spirit of kindness and sacrificing party spirit , has not placated the Pharisee nor made the Mugwump any more tolerant . Over half the federal offices , places , and clerkships under the control of the administration  --  a hundred thousand or more-are held by Democrats still , and yet no Mugwump paper and no moral essayist ever lets this fact come into the light . Nearly or quite half the places abroad are still filled by Democrats , who are telling the outside world that the Rebellion was right , that the election of Harrison was an accident where it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States will come into power again in 93 . Democrats have not only been retained in the offices that they held in the beginning , but many Democrats have been appointed or reappointed to place . Among the earliest and most tolerant and most missionary of President Harrison 's acts was the commissioning of ninety-eight l ) emocratic presidential postmasters who had been appointed by Cleveland . Yet the Mugwump paper never has murmured of these facts in the record of the President . The Inter-State-Railway Commission , an agency of vast power , remains Democratic still . The Civil-Service Commission is more unfriendly and more opposed to the Republican party under Harrison than it was under Cleveland . Several others of the stronger national commissions // or official boards remain Democratic in the Republican time . And yet the President is not saved from the constant and unsparing censure of the Mugwump and Democratic press and people by reason of this or anything else in his administration which spares the Democrat or exalts the Mugwump . The experiment of lowering the temperature of the Republican party to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or strengthen the party . If the present administration has any weakness to fleck its otherwise spotless record , it is that it has not had enough of politics or politicians in it , nor enough of that cordial , infectious , inspiring party fellowship , contributing to party self-respect and party pride , always so necessary to keep any political organization alive and self-respecting . The politicians of the Republican name are those who believe in their party , who love its principles , and work always for its glory and success ; and there are six millions of them - a strong and splendid army , capable of anything which is good , if rightly led . They do not like the Mugwump or his fads . They have seen that a man in becoming a Mugwump first becomes better than his party , and next better than his country . The average Republicans are content to be as good as their party , and to try to be as good as their country . They would always stand in the open in politics-frank , fearless , candid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out Republican principles . They too would have a rigid civil-service examination , and retain faithful public servants , and make promotions on merit . But they would have an examination which is practical , which would be conducted by the different departments under which the appointees are to serve , and which would test the men and women practically in the duties they are to discharge ; and would have these appointed by the heads of the departments , as directed by the constitution , and not selected by an outside agency of irresponsible officials , absolutely unknown to the constitution , who know nothing of the practical duties required by the different departments , and are not held to any responsibility whatsoever for the proper conduct of such departments . The practical Republican politician would conduct this practical sort of examination , and under a Republican administration he would always appoint a Republican to office . He would do this because , from scriptural teaching and the sum // of human experience , it is true that a friend always serves you better than an enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America . He believes in the honesty of his fellow-men . He believes in friendships , in politics and out , and does not believe that the people 's desire for a change in office is simply to give some other man , as a man , a place . Practical Republicans believe in frequent changes for the public good . When the people at the polis have approved of a party , they believe in changes , not only for the public good , but to carry out the principles indorsed by the people at the polls , and also from a sense of party pride . They did not expect , after the election of President Harrison as a Republican President , to have continued over them in administrative offices , such as post-offices , revenue places , etc. , the same Democrats who held the places under President Cleveland . In other words , they believe in Republican officers under a Republican administration , and are ready always to concede Democratic officers under a Democratic administration . If this conclusion is not true , then the Mugwump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America ought to disband . In any event the Republican party can not continue to live half-Mugwump and half-Republican . It must be fair to itself and to its people in 1892 , if it cares for its life , and must declare plainly and boldly for one thing or the other-for the full acceptance of the Mugwump theory and a resolute adherence to it when in power , and no pretence of Republican preference , or for an open . and fearless Republican theory and preference . I am for the latter* Let it comprehend an actual civil-service reform , but let it be a practical and Republican reform , including a separation of the appointing power from the legislative power . But let it never fall below the standard of party self-respect in America-that for any administrative office , under any party 's rule , a man who belongs to that party can be found good enough to fill it.
