txt We take it that the reports sent out from time to time from Washington as to the plans of the Republican caucus committee on the currency are intended to sound public opinion . The latest is that the committee has agreed upon the following points : 1 . All obligations of the United States to be payable in gold . 2 . No note once redeemed for gold to be paid out again except for gold . 3 . National banks to issue notes to the par value of the bonds held as security . 4 . Banks of $25,000 capital to be au-thorize &; This plan differs from the last one reported in two important regards . It does not set apart the gold reserve and free it from all appropriations of Congress . It does not provide for authority in the Secretary to borrow directly and explicitly to strengthen the gold reserve when necessary . In both these respects the new plan is inferior to the former . We regard it as of the highest importance that the reserve shall be put beyond the reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , a law making this provision could be repealed by Congress . but this would always require time and the veto of the President would have to be reckoned with . Such a law would be of the greatest value . Still more important is it that the Secretary of the Treasury should have the power to borrow directly for the strengthening of the gold reserve whenever in his judgment it is needed . The provisions of the plan , as lately reported , for the slight extension of the issues of the National banks and for the establishment of smaller banks are not of serious consequence . They merely scratch the surface of a problem that must sooner or later be taken up in a very different spirit . At present we should say that it would be better to confine all efforts to the absolute establishment of the gold standard and the complete security of the gold reserve .
