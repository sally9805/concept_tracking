txt Mr. Goff says that the Grand Jury is " the palladium of our liberties , " , which should be " freed from even the suspicion of taint . " He is right . There is not an institution of all those that have come down to us from our liberty-loving and justice-loving ancestors of higher value than the " Grand Inquest . " It is meant on the one hand to see that citizens are not oppressed by prosecution of unfounded charges , and on the other to see that where there is good ground for trial , offenders shall be brought to trial . Its duties link it on the one hand with the police , on the other hand with the judiciary . Its members should be as pure , as impartial , and as firm as any officers of the law . If the Liquor . Dealers ' Association can dictate the/ composition of the Grand Jury , so that violations of the law by its members shallgo unpunished , lawbreakers of other/ kinds , who can command a like pull , i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , President of the State Liquor Dealers ' Association , and that of J. P. Smith , editor of The Wine and Spirit Gazette , make it plain that the jury can be " fixed . " An end to that kind of thing can be made on Tuesday by voting Tammany out of power wherever it can be reached . Can the Grand Jury be packed ? When Mr. Tekuisky , asked from Mr. Smith . " the names of real estate dealers who , held Property in which liquor was sold ; " in order to get them put on the Grand Jury , Mr. Smith asked how he would accomplish it . " Never mind , " replied Tekuisky , " leave it to me . " And when Senator Lexow asked Mr. Smith if " the idea was that in that way the Grand Jury could be fixed so that excise matters would be leniently dealt with , " Mr. Smith promptly answered " Yes . " That is not a pleasant glimpse of the , possibilities of the Grand Jury room . It . is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be loosened from ' the law system of this city . How much dot ; the so-called . Board of Jurors have to ; do with . picking out the members of the Grand Jury ? Most of them nothing ; several of them a great deal . Read this extract I from the proceedings of the Lexow , committee on Thursday : " Mr. Goff  --  Yes , and the law requires that the entire Board of Jurors must sit and select the Grand Juries , but an investigation has shown that the Board of Jurors has made it a practice to adjourn and appoint a subcommittee of three , to whom such names as are wanted are sent for appointment . " Senator Lexow  --  And it is in this way that people charged , or about to be charged , with crime are able to pack a Grand Jury ? " Mr. Goff  --  Yes , and this sub-committee consists of the Commissioner of Jurors , the County Clerk , and a Judge , whom I do n't care to name . " It will thus be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six Judges , only one Judge , the County Clerk , and the Commissioner really act , and these act only on the lists submitted by the Commissioner . The process is handy for an experienced Manipulator . Tekuisky clearly knew how to work it . But it is a very dangerous system , and should be got rid of . Down Tammany !
