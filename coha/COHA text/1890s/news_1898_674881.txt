txt The advance of the American Army on Puerto Rico will begin this week , with Tampa , Charleston , and Newport News , as the points of embarkation . It will proceed rapidly and steadily until a force approximating 30,000 men has been landed on the south coast of the island , near Ponce , from which point a quick march will be made over a modern military road to San Juan , the capital . After three days of consultation with the heads of the War Administration , Major Gen. Brooke , who is to command the invading expedition , left to-night for Chickamauga . The bulk of his army is already picked out and many of the regiments are under orders . At Chickamauga he will complete the organization of the force , the last section of which is expected to leave these shores not later than Saturday , the 30th of July . The Bustle of Preparation . The bustle of preparation for the new expedition was the feature of the day at the War Department . No such activity has been seen there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something and do it quickly - a- ere more evident than on the occasion of the embarkation of the Shatter expedition . For the moment the Santiago campaign and its gratifying results were lost sight of . Nobody asked what Shatter was doing . Everybody wanted to know what Brooke was going to do and when he would begin it . So completely did the impending enterprise impregnate the atmosphere that the cloak of secrecy furnished but a thin veil . There could be no two meanings to the long talks participated in by Secretary Alger , Adjt . Gen. Corbin , Gen. Brooke , Commissary Moneagan , Quartermaster General Ludington , and Col. Hecker , Chief of the Transportation Bureau , who has come to the front by sheer force of ability as the business man of the Administration . Before the day , closed the admission was made semi-officially that the new expedition would get under way this week ; that the troops would sail from Tampa , Charleston , and Newport Nrws ; that the first transports will probably sail on Saturday and that the second section will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yale . For the transportation of the expedition the army will use all the ships it owns or has chartered and will borrow all it can from the navy . The Yale is already at Santiago , with Gen. Miles and some of the artillery intended for the expedition . The St. Louis and the Harvard , which recently came North with Spanish prisoners for Portsmouth , will be pressed into service again as troopships , and they probably will take on their details at Newport News on Saturday . Besides these big boats , capable of carrying a brigade between them , the Quartermaster 's Department has the following vessels to draw from : San Marcos , Concho , Comal , Rio Grande , Leona , Alamo , Vigilancia , Seguranca , Orizaba , Yucatan , Seneca , Saratoga , Santiago , City of Washington , Manteo , Gussie , Whitney , Morgan , Aransas , Clinton , Allegheny , Berkshire , D. H. Miller , Cherokee , Iroquois , Matteaw an , Miami , Breakwater , Stillwater , Oilye tt e , Knickerbocker , Kanawha , Laura , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , City of Macon , Catania , Arkadia , Lampasas , Nueces , Comanche , Roumanian , Obdam , Berlin , Mohawk , Mississippi , Mobile , Massachusetts , and Grand Duchess . The Troops tinder Orders . In the assignment of troops for the expedition Title change has been made from the designations announced already . It is understood here that the First and Second Divisions of the First Corps will go from Chickamauga Ernst 's and Rain 's brigades of Gen. Wilson 's division are under orders . From Tampa the Second Division of the Fourth Corps , including the First Brigade of regulars , under Schwann , have been ordered on board transports . The Fifth Regular Cavalry will go , but the detachments from the other cavalry regiments left there by Gen. Shatter will not be taken . The two light batteries of artillery and the heavy batteries are to go . They will be reinforced by four light batteries now on the Yale , with Gen. Miles . With the siege train under Brig . Gen. Rogers , which will go from Tampa , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it probably will be added to still further by withdrawing more guns from Santiago , even , if the men who man them have to be left there for sanitary reasons . Elaborate Commissary Preparations . For the feeding of the Puerto Rico expeditionary force , Commissary General Eagen is already making elaborate preparations . On Saturday he will ship from Newport News by the transport steamer- Massachusetts , now at New York , 200,000 pounds of refrigerated beef and 6,000,000 pounds of soldiers ' rations . These will be shipped to whatever point may be designated as the landing place of the expedition . All the information that comes to the chiefs of the War Department confirms them in the choice of the south coast as the best objective for the transport fleet . Not only does Playa , the port of Ponce , afford a good anchorage for vessels drawing twentylive feet of water , but near it and accessible by a good road Is the harbor of Gusailea or Guayaniila , where ships of twenty-one feet draught may enter safely . It is a spacious basin , completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could , according to military authorities , be easily fortified so as to be impregnable . There are no wharves there , but the banks are so steep that vessels can run up close enough to the shore to land passengers and men by throwing gang-ways from the decks to the shore . Jouvos Another Favorable Port . The Port of Jouvos , thirty miles to the east of Ponce , is another haven where the vessels that can not be accommodated at Playa might disembark . Vessels of the largest kind can anchor there in safety from all winds , and there is room for the entire navy . It is from Ponce , however , that the march on the capital will be made . The two cities are connected by a broad modern highway , the best road in the island , travelers say , and one - admirably adapted for military purposes . This road is said to have been made with a heavy layer of crushed rock and brick , packed and rounded and covered with a layer of earth , upon which is superposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled until , it presents an almost glossy surface . For troops landing at Guanica or at Jouvos , or Ponce , the march to San Juan will , it is expected , be an easy matter . Rendezvous of the Transports . There being three points of departure for . the troops leaving this country for Puerto Rico , it is assumed here that the transports will rendezvous according to the original programme near Santiago , care being taken to allow none of the men to land so as to be exposed to fever infection . It is yet possible that some of the regulars at Santiago may be included in the new army , though extreme caution - will be used and none will be taken if thereby the risk of infecting the second expedition is run . Gen. Miles , who is to exercise general supervision of the Puerto Rico enterprise , is famous for the care he takes of . his men , and he can be depended on to see that no useless chances are taken . Role of the Navy . The part which the navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fully matured . The several transport fleets will have with them one or two auxiliary craft carrying strong secondary batteries of six or eight 6-pounders . Secretary Long said this afternoon that no time had been fixed for the departure of Admiral Sampson 's fleet for San Juan . As to the naval plans , he would only say that they would co-operate in every way with the movements of the army . The reports that three monitors were on their way from Key West to San Juan was characterized by the Secretary as unauthorized . It is the general understanding , however , that the navy will rely mainly on armored ships for the bombardment of San Juan , as the big battleships and monitors afford the best means of offensive warfare , while their armor belts protect them from such fire as the San Juan batteries can bring to bear . The fortifications there are much like those of Santiago , with a ( Morro Castle at the entrance of the harbor and a number of lesser fortifications leading up to the city . These , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries at Santiago . Transports Ready for Sea . The transports Massachusetts , Roumanian , and Michigan , in this port , are ready to go to sea now , and the Manitoba of the Atlantic Transport Line , which arrived yesterday , will be turned over to the Government as soon as she has been unloaded , and . will be fitted out at once . Major Summerhayes of the Quartermaster 's Department has received orders to hurry things along on these vessels . Supplies are being placed on board as fast as possible , and the vessels are to sail to southern ports and take on soldiers , who are to go with the expedition to be sent to Puerto Rico . The Roumanian has been ordered to sail at once for Newport News , and she will probably go to-day . She will take 800,000 pounds of fodder for 1,000 animals . The others are to be held here , and it is thought they are to take their details of men on board at this port and sail from here for Puerto Rico . CRUISER ST . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five More Guns Installed . The auxiliary cruiser St. Louis , which brought the Spanish naval prisoners to Portsmouth , N. H. , from Santiago , and afterward landed Admiral Cervera and his officers at Annapolis , arrived here yesterday morning , and was docked at the American Line pier on the North River . The St. Louis will take on coal , provisions , ammunition , and ship 's stores , and will be ready tor sea Thursday or Friday . Capt . Jasper Goodrich said that he had received no orders , but it is expected that the cruiser will go with the expedition to San Juan , Puerto Rico . The St. Louis left Annapolis Monday , and nothing of interest occurred on the trip up the coast . The most important feature of the St. Louis 's visit will be the installation of five five-inch guns , thus converting her into the St. Paul class of auxiliary cruiser . She has been carrying only eight six-pounder guns , four forward and four ' aft . With her new armament to protect herself from such vessels as remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ply without convoy between the fleets and participate , if need be , in minor engagements . Several of the officers of the St. Louis in the employ of the American Line will now seek commissions in the navy , and a number of them whose names were not revealed went to the navy yard yesterday to undergo physical examinations .
