Note : 1Kb Main text ACT I SCENE I : A large room in Colonel Sellers ' house in Washington ; a large parlor , with folding doors , cheaply but very showily furnished , equipped with all manner of fantastic inventions , lying on chairs , scattered over the floor , hanging from the walls , and heaped in the corners , various cheap chromos on the walls . At the bottom of the scene is a grotesque arrangement of numerous batteries and other apparatus for generating electricity . Mary Sellers and the old nurse moving about and trying to evoke a little order from the chaos , with Mrs. Sellers looking on . AUNT SALLY : It do n't seem just right , Miss Mary , to hear you talk about your Paw the way you do . MRS . SELLERS : No indeed , that it do n't ! I wonder at you ! MARY : Oh no , you do n't , mother ! And nobody else would that knew how he had pulled us about from pillar to post , all our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see how such a good , kind man as father can bear to do it . MRS . SELLERS : You know , you ungrateful child , that he does it all for your sake . What else made him break up at Hannibal , where we had got so comfortably settled , and come on to Washington at his time of life ? MARY : Oh , I know he did it for me ; and do n't you suppose I love him the more , the more he makes us suffer ? There is n't a dun comes into the house , and they 're about the only visitors we have except the newspaper interviewers , that I do n't fire up on father 's account , and believe just as he does that we are coming into our everlasting fortune to-morrow morning . But we 've lived on faith so long  --  and dressed in it ! Look at yourself , mother , in that ridiculous dressing-gown while I 've got on the only decent dress we have left between us ! I shall wear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " till that time ; then you 'll put it on , and I 'll turn into the kitchen in my beautiful flour-sack peignoir , and be " Engaged " and let you have the dress . And here are all these blessed inventions and scientific discoveries , with millions in every one of them , littering up the whole house ! Oh , if I did n't know father was the best man in the world , I should say he was the worst . ( Playfully . ) Well , go along , mother , you 're as bad as Aunt Sally about him , every bit and grain . One would think he had kept you rolling in the lap of luxury all your days . MRS . SELLERS : He 's kept me happy , child , and that 's a great deal better and the luxury is coming along too , in good time . MARY : Oh , yes , to-morrow morning before breakfast , as usual . Just at present there 's nothing to eat in the house but dried apples , and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , mother ; that does n't help any . She playfully takes her mother by the shoulders and pushes her out of the door . MRS . SELLERS : Oh , you ridiculous girl . You 're as full of spirits as your father . MARY : Am I ? Then I 'll be just as rich as he is before I die . Her mother goes out , and Mary turning from the door , suddenly bursts into tears . AUNT SALLY : Oh don ' you cry , honey ; don ' you take on so ! MARY : Oh , I ca n't help it ! It 's no use , Aunt Sally ; I might as well give up at once . ( She drops into a chair and leaning forward seizes the back of another with her hand and rests her head wearily on her arm . ) You do what you can , Aunt Sally . The gentleman to see the motor wo n't be here till one o'clock . All that I wanted was to have the place looking a little less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh dear me ! She drops a feather duster with which she has been operating to the floor . AUNT SALLY , sweeping vigorously between the piles of inventions : Don ' you min ' , honey ; don ' you min ' . Aunt Sally gwine to put all dis to rights . You jes sit still dare and res ' yourse'f . De Lord knows you need it in dis house . I don ' know what Marse Sellers thinkin ' about , de life he leads you and yo ' mother , honey , wid dis thing and dat thing , change , change , change from morning till night , and no res ' . MARY , lifting her head : No , none for me ! Oh , I wish it was all a dream , and then I could try to forget it . AUNT SALLY : Yes , we 'd all been better off dis minute if it had n't happened  --  if we 'd all stayed at home in old Missouri , ' stead o ' comin ' on here , and reskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by de skin o ' your teeth from fire and flood on the way  --  smashed up on the railroad and drownded in de Mississippi . It 's perplexing , honey , it 's ridiculous , all dem accidents . MARY , springing to her feet : Oh , no , no , Aunt Sally ! Do n't speak against the accidents . They 're my only comfort now ! They are all I have left of him  --  all that there is to prove that he ever lived , or spoke to me , or touched me . When shall I ever see him again . Oh , never , never ! AUNT SALLY : What you talkin ' ' bout , Miss Mary ? Is it dot young man wot  --  wot  --  wot  --  why Miss Mary , you ai n't in love with him ? MARY : No , no , Aunt Sally ! Not in love with him , not in love , but  --  interested . Yes , and very anxious to know what happened to him . Oh , I wish I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him ! Oh , oh , if we could only have been drowned together ! AUNT SALLY : Drownded ? You think he got drownded ? Fine , strong , active , young man like dat ? MARY : Oh , he was strong , was n't he , Aunt Sally ? And beautiful was n't he ; and so noble , and brave , and unselfish . Do n't you remember how he worked to get those poor creatures out of the wreck of the train  --  how quiet he was , how gentle , how thoughtful , and then when the boat went down  --  AUNT SALLY : I lay ef I git my han 's on him I take en tar de lights out'n him . MARY , horrified : Aunt Sally ! AUNT SALLY : I bet I 'll do it . I 'll take en mop up de flo ' wid him  --  I 'll  --  MARY , indignantly : Hush  --  I wo n't have it ! AUNT SALLY , shaking her head threateningly and muttering broken sentences : Nemmine  --  nemmine  --  any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be still , you dreadful old thing ? What  --  how did he go back on me , as you call it ? He is dead , and I wo n't let any one speak a word against him ! Was it his fault , I should like to know , if I was so silly as to take a fancy to a perfect stranger on the cars , before I had spoken a word to him ? AUNT SALLY : No , no , it wo n't do , honey . MARY : And was it his fault , if he showed mother and me all those little attentions and took care of us while father was addressing a mass meeting of the gentlemen passengers in the smoking-car , and drawing up a constitutional amendment authorizing the President to declare war against any power excluding American pork ? Was that his fault ? AUNT SALLY : No , it was n't dat . MARY : And was  --  was it my darling 's fault  --  Oh , he is my darling , my dear , dead only love ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel to me when he was helping those bruised and mangled creatures out of the wreck ? AUNT SALLY : No , it was n't dat . MARY : And was it  --  you cruel old thing  --  was it his fault that the little hour after chance brought us together on the boat , the next day , and we stood there talking by the guard before the boat went down , and we did n't know each other 's names , and we did n't care , because we knew each other 's hearts  --  was it his fault that he made that hour a whole long eternity of bliss for me ? AUNT SALLY : No , honey , I ai n't blamin ' him for dat . MARY : Very well , then , you wicked old creature , do you blame him when he found me at the last gasp in the river , and pulled me up on that piece of the wreck , and told me there in the horror and darkness that he would rather be there with me in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene on earth without me ! Oh , that moment , Aunt Sally ! That happy , happy time that out-heavened the wildest , fondest dream of bliss ! Do you blame him for giving me that moment ? AUNT SALLY : De Lord knows I ai n't blamin him for dat . MARY , falling from her rapturous key , and speaking brokenly and doubtfully : And then when that miserable thing came floating by  --  I know she floated as near as she could on purpose , because I saw her watching us before the boat struck  --  Do you blame him for leaving me to save her ? AUNT SALLY , doggedly : No . MARY : For giving up his own place on the piece of wreck to her , and for pushing us to the shore , and then in the dark and confusion getting separated from me ? AUNT SALLY : No , I ai n't blamin ' him for dat . MARY : Then what  --  what are you blaming him for ? AUNT SALLY , very severely : What am I blamin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman after you got separated . What 's de reason when your paw come and fin ' you he could n't fin ' dem ? What 's de reason , honey ? What 's de reason day never turn up again ? You think he got drownded , hey ? You think she got drownded ? No , honey ! No such thing ! Dey lit out togeder , and de sooner you make up your mind to dat , de better , and de sooner you 'll git cured of him . Oh , if I git my han 's on him ! MARY : Oh , he never did it , he never did it ! Oh yes , he did , he did , he did , he left me ! Oh , he went away with her , and I shall never see him any more ! Oh , my poor false , lost darling ! Oh , my love , my cruel love ! ( She drops her face in her hands and sinks sobbing to the floor . At the sound of steps outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , who 's there ? A VOICE WITHOUT : All right , Mrs. Sellers . Do n't trouble yourself . I 'll go right in . She wo n't mind me . As Lafayette Hawkins enters one door , Mary with a cry escapes through the other . SCENE II : Hawkins and Aunt Sally HAWKINS : Is that you , Aunt Sally ? Why , I would n't have known you , you have changed so . He takes her hand . AUNT SALLY : Yes , it 's me , Marse Lafayette , it 's me , I reckon , but sometimes I ai n't shore . Oh , laws , de goin 's on in dis house ! You see de ole Missus ? HAWKINS : No , she could n't see me . She sent me in here to see Mary  --  Where is Mary ? Mrs. Sellers called down from up stairs that she could n't see me because she was dressing . Fashionable hours  --  not dressed at eleven in the morning . AUNT SALLY : No , nor at three in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nothin to dress in . I reckon the poor soul 's pinnin ' a few rags together , so 's to look a little ' spectable before she comes down to see you . Poor Miss Mary run out soon 's she heard your voice , po ' thing , she 's been a crying here , Marse Lafayette , and I bin a tryin ' to comfort her . But don ' you min ' , Marse Lafayette . When she comes back , don ' you seem to notice nothin ' . I 'm powerful glad to see you again , powerful glad . You 're gittin ' gray too , Marse Lafayette . You ai n't so young as you was . Well , we 've all got to die sometime . Don ' you min ' Miss Mary when you see her . She 's ben cryin ' a little  --  jis kin ' o ' mortified to think you ketch her in such ornery lookin ' clo'es . Don ' you ' pear to notice when she comes in . She 's been kin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheer her up , and I reckon she 'll get along . I 'll call her . Jis ' set down  --  ( She looks around the bare room for a chair , but finds none . ) Jis ' set down on  --  on  --  on some dese yer flyin ' machines , or percussion bombshells , or ' lectric batories , and I 'll go and send Miss Mary to you . ( Goes out calling . ) Miss Mary , oh Miss Mary , yer cousin , Marse Lafayette Hawkins , is in de parlor . HAWKINS , alone , going about , inspecting the inventions , and gingerly handling them : This  --  this  --  seems to be some sort of dining-table . ( He places his hand on the top and the table suddenly opens and drops to the floor in the form of an oblong punt or boat . He reads a label pasted in the bottom . ) " The Sellers ' convertible marine ship 's table and life boat . Patent applied for . " Well , I declare to goodness what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas as he was when I first knew him thirty years ago . And all his thoughts run to benevolent enterprises ; he still devotes himself to the amelioration and advancement of his species ! What 's this ? ( He picks up a tin can like an oyster can and reads in the bottom . ) " Sellers ' corn beef can for the supply of contraband provisions during time of the war . Dynamite charge inserted under the label ' Open here . ' " My gracious , how can I get this out of my hands quick enough without dropping it ? ( He changes it from one hand to the other with the greatest tenderness . ) Where is a soft place to put it ? ( In stepping backward in this search , he trips on a string which pulls the trigger of a spring-gun , and sets off an alarm clock , which continues to ring after the discharging of the gun . ) Hello ! Hello the house ! Mary ! Aunt Sally ! Uncle Daniel ! Mary , Cousin Mary ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeats these cries , while the clock rattles on . Mary enters in the midst of the hubbub , and runs to stop the alarm . ) Cousin Mary , what does all this mean ? Quaking and afraid to move . MARY , approaching and throwing her arms around him : It 's nothing but father 's burglar alarm  --  patent applied for . Oh , Cousin Lafayette , how glad I am to see you ! When did you come ? Have you seen mother yet ? HAWKINS : No , no . I have n't seen anybody yet , but Aunt Sally . Is it safe to  --  to  --  step about here , freely ? Perhaps you 'd like to take me to some other room . I 'm afraid I might  --  disarrange some of your father 's inventions . MARY : Do n't be troubled . You ca n't hurt them . We have them all right in the family and do n't mind them any more . ( Desperately . ) You can sit down on them and kick them about the room if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you , I can stand . I 'm not tired  --  I 've been sitting so long in the cars  --  all the way from Hannibal . It 's a long way from Missouri . But Mary , my dear little cousin  --  You do n't look very well or very happy . And Aunt Sally tells me  --  MARY : Oh do n't mind Aunt Sally ; she 's a silly cross old thing . I 'm very well , and I 'm perfectly happy . HAWKINS , looking doubtfully at her : Well , I 'm glad of that  --  very glad . MARY , incoherently : Yes , I knew you would rejoice with us . I knew  --  ughhoo ! Ughhoo ! Sobbing and then suddenly arresting herself , and looking defiantly at him . HAWKINS , after a pause : And is your mother well ? MARY : Oh perfectly well . HAWKINS : And your father ? MARY : Ughhoo . He 's always pro-pros-perous  --  ugh hoo , ugh hoo ! And you know it Cousin Lafayette ! HAWKINS : Well , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to send me such a long message as he did when he telegraphed me to come here . MARY , astounded : Father telegraphed you to come on here ? HAWKINS : Yes , here 's the dispatch I got in Hannibal , Monday morning and here I am in Washington , at eleven A.M. Wednesday . Pretty quick work ! But I never stopped a moment after I heard from your father . Here 's his telegram . " Come on to Washington immediately . The heir of the Earl of Dover will be here Tuesday night as the guest of the British minister . Everything in train for a successful interview . Lose no time . If Jones still wants your house , sell out to him at any sacrifice . All my enterprises flourishing  --  The motor as good as disposed of to parties in New York . Come at once , and charge all expenses to me . Bring all that documentary evidence that we drew up together in reference to my claim to the Earldom . Sellers . P. S. Turn all your property into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family . " The first time I ever had a telegram with a postscript . MARY : He sent you all that by telegraph ! Why it must have cost him ten or fifteen dollars ! HAWKINS : Well , I suppose he thought I could put that into the general account against him . MARY , aghast : He did n't let you pay it ? HAWKINS : Oh never mind . I know your father 's ways , but I 've never lost confidence in him through thick and thin . I 've always pinned my faith to the Colonel . So I just let Jones take the house at his own price  --  lost about fifteen hundred dollars on it ; but I was glad to do it if I could be of any use to the Colonel . And he seems to feel that he 's got a sure thing this time . ( Looking about the room . ) This is a pleasant house , Mary . You seem to be living in fine style here . MARY , giving over to prolonged fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Aunt Sally tell you  --  tell  --  HAWKINS : O , yes , she got off some nonsense , but I did n't pay any particular attention to it . I knew that if Colonel Sellers telegraphed on to me in that way , he knew what he was about . I did n't care what Aunt Sally said about your circumstances , I  --  MARY : Well then , I tell you that we are as poor as poverty , and that we are head over ears in debt , and we have n't a decent thing to wear , nor hardly raw turnips any more to eat , and if father has got you to waste your money coming on here to share our wretchedness , it 's a cruel , cruel shame and I do n't care who knows it ! If those New York people who are coming to see the electric motor to-day do n't do something about it  --  and of course they wo n't  --  we are ruined  --  that 's all . HAWKINS , incredulously : Oh , you must n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan you do n't know about . Do n't be troubled . He 's going to come out all right , yet . I 'm not afraid . I suppose he 's got as many schemes on hand as ever ? MARY , with bitter coldness : Oh , quite ! HAWKINS : Then some of them must prosper . You must cheer up . Your mother is n't discouraged , is she ? MARY : She is n't when father 's with her , but when he 's away , she does nothing but cry over our troubles . Father could cheer up a lost soul , but that 's neither here nor there . He even cheers me up . HAWKINS : I wish he were here to cheer you up now . Where is your father ? MARY : Oh , I do n't know , he 's out somewhere trying his latest invention . HAWKINS : Latest ? Then the motor is n't his latest ? MARY : There have been a dozen since the motor . The very last latest is a fire extinguisher . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with it strapped on his back and he sleeps with it at his bedside , so as to be able to run at the first alarm of fire . It makes me frantic to see him . Of course , at his age , he ca n't get to the fires before they 're all put out , and so he goes about indoors and out with that ridiculous thing on his back and every now and then at the table or when he 's getting into bed , it shoots off  --  HAWKINS : Shoots off , Mary ? MARY : Yes , fireballs , like a roman candle  --  it 's a new principle of fire extinguishing  --  and scares us almost out of our wits  --  or would if we had any left , and  --  there ! There he is now  --  out on the fire-escape ! Sound of shuffling and scraping outside , with incoherent exclamations growing gradually more distinct . HAWKINS : On the fire-escape ! Cousin Mary ? MARY : Yes , yes ! Did n't you notice father 's fire-escape on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it , so as to advertise it , and keep it before the people . There is always a crowd following him . HAWKINS : Well , I never did hear of coming up a fire-escape before ! A voice outside and below . VOICE : Three cheers for the Colonel . The cheers are given . SELLERS , without : I thank you gentlemen for this reception . At another time I will address you more fully . But now , I am exhausted from the efforts which have proved my fire extinguisher a complete success , and have scored another triumph in the cause of humanity ! Gentlemen , for the present I bid you good day ! ( He appears at the window which he throws up . ) Mary , is that you , and  --  what ! Not Lafayette Hawkins ! Lafayette , my dear boy , my faithful friend , my generous ally , my  --  ( He shows himself in profile at the window with the extinguisher strapped on his back and in the effort to spring into the room , catches his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saved from falling by Hawkins who runs forward and catches him in his arms . ) All right ! All right ! In your arms , my friend , my more than son and brother ! I accept the omen ! ( Hot and swabbing his face . ) Why , this is delightful ! ( Shakes both his hands . ) It 's a breath of old Missouri to see you . Sit down  --  sit down . ( Sits . ) How 'd you leave everything ? And when did you come ? ( Lafayette tries to get in answers , but does n't succeed . ) Mary , my dear , where 's your mother ? Your mother ought to be here to welcome Lafayette ! Go and call her , my family  --  her own child , as it were  --  tell her to throw on anything  --  any  --  little sort of negligee thing . Lafayette wo n't mind . MARY , in a responsive aside : Any little negligee thing ! My floursack peignoir , or the dressing gown I made her out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn out family umbrella ! Exit . SELLERS : Well , well , well ! Here we are in Washington again , after all these years ! How it brings back the old times , the Goose Run appropriation that did n't get through ; and the Tennessee land appropriation that broke down in the Senate ; and the noble Senator Dilworthy  --  ah ! There was a grand man , a grand man , Lafayette  --  there are all too few like him in these days  --  he 's keeping a butcher shop , now , in Kansas . Ah , yes , you 'll find things changed here , Lafayette , since you were a youth . Well , let bygones be bygones . By accident  --  purely by accident  --  I made some little failures in those days and your father 's family suffered some of the consequences . But our sun is rising now , Lafayette  --  certain and prodigious prosperity right ahead , and imminent  --  and as soon as I was perfectly sure of that , I telegraphed for you  --  for I mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely as you 've shared in the former disasters . ( Laying his hand on his shoulder . Impressively . ) Lafayette , I 've got the world in my grip  --  the world , understand  --  and I am going to divide it with you ! HAWKINS , with sincerity : Ah , that 's like you , Colonel . You 've not changed at any rate . SELLERS : I 'm glad you believe in me still , Lafayette . HAWKINS : I always have believed in you ; and I always shall , as long as I live . SELLERS : Thank you , my boy . You sha n't repent it . You ca n't . Why , cast your eyes around this room  --  what do you see ? Apparently a junk-shop ; apparently a hospital connected with a patent office  --  in reality , the mines of Golconda in disguise ! Footnote : 1Kb We live in the sum total of time , Lafayette . The elements are crowded full of beneficent forces  --  always have been  --  and ours is the first generation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has Mary been telling you about some of my little contrivances ? HAWKINS : Yes , but I had no idea how fast you had been throwing them off lately . I supposed that you were still working at the electric motor . SELLERS : Of course , of course . I did n't write you , I suppose , I got the motor off my hands two weeks ago , and parties from New York are coming to take it away to-day . I do n't know what they 're going to do with it , but I 've an idea , Lafayette , that they 're going to employ it in the application of stored electricity to the grip cars on the Brooklyn bridge . HAWKINS : Why of course ! The very thing ! There 's a mint in that thing  --  SELLERS : A few millions . I shall take a royalty , probably , on the cars passed over the bridge . But look here ! ( Turning himself around so as to show the extinguisher , which covers his whole back and is strapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a trifle I threw off a few weeks ago between whiles . What do you think of that ? HAWKINS , lost in admiration : Well , of course , Colonel ! Anything you 've given your mind to  --  SELLERS : A child could use this extinguisher . ( Seized with an idea and coming forward to the audience . ) I 'll have children 's sizes introduced at once with chambers to replace the old-fashioned school satchels and offer special terms to schools . I 'll write a manual of my extinguisher drill for the use of  --  of  --  of  --  your ladies ' seminaries , I will have a ladies ' style out at once . Old ladies  --  I 'll get out a pattern for elderly and timid people . I 'll  --  HAWKINS , still looking at the machine : But what 's the principle , Colonel Sellers ? Is it a chemical vapor , or  --  SELLERS : Chemical vapor ! No , sir ! Fire ! A principle as old as the Christian civilization ! Greek fire ! Why , Lafayette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I merely apply ideas that have always existed but have n't been developed because the world was n't ripe for them . Fire and vaccination  --  that is the strange device of my banner , Lafayette . The principle of vaccination has always existed . They 're applying it now to everything in France . They 're inoculating for scarletina and consumption and erysipelas  --  they do n't stop at smallpox . I apply the principle to fire . And when you inoculate for fire , what do you want ? The strongest form of virus ! You want Greek fire . That combustion , in-extinguishable by water , with which the Creeks of old Byzantium destroyed the galleys of their enemies  --  that devouring element which they employed against the Turks at the battle of Navarino  --  Greek fire ! Wherever it strikes , it simply obliterates and annihilates every other form of combustion . No conflagration can stand before it a moment  --  not an instant . If they had twelve  --  or half a dozen of my instruments , even the old common unimproved kind , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! ( Begins to fool about his machine . ) See that button ? Well that 's the key to a chamber where I have twenty-five charges of Greek fire stored . By simply touching that button  --  by pressing it thus  --  do n't be alarmed ! I fired off the entire series of charges into a vacant lot on my way home  --  thus  --  ( He touches the button , and the extinguisher fires off a ball , which whizzes past Hawkins ' face , and Sellers rushes after it and dashes a bucket of sand on it . ) There ! If I had n't had that bucket of sand left over from my last experiment , nothing could have saved this house ! HAWKINS : My goodness ! SELLERS : No , sir ! Water has no effect on it  --  makes it worse  --  makes it burn fiercer ! This destroys the original fire , and concentrates the element wherever it strikes . HAWKINS : Well , but how  --  if the engines ca n't put out the fire when you 've concentrated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sand-blast engines can ! And here comes in a third great principle . What causes the greatest ravage by fire ? The limited supply of water ! The cisterns give out  --  you 're always reading of it . But the supply of earth is simply inexhaustible ! As long as there 's a handful left of this distracted globe , you can put out a fire . No more Chicago fires  --  no more Boston firesFootnote : 1Kb  --  they 're obsolete . Lafayette , I threw off the idea of a little sand  --  blast engine the other day  --  or wait , I 'll show you ! ( He begins rumaging among the different piles of inventions . ) I declare , if those women do n't stop putting those things in order  --  ( Desists . ) Well , never mind ! Why do I waste your time with these trifles ? This will do well enough to pass an idle hour  --  to kill time , but the extinction of fire after all is such a small matter  --  HAWKINS : Small matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SELLERS : With the restoration of the dead to all the necessary functions of life  --  so small a matter that I feel like apologizing to you , Lafayette , for talking to you about it . I do , indeed . The great thing  --  the great thing  --  is materialization ! Mark my words . Ma-te-ri-al-ization . HAWKINS , aghast : Why Uncle Mulberry , I did n't know you were a spiritualist . SELLERS , with the greatest contempt : Spiritualist ! Who ? I ? I a spiritualist ? Do I look like one of those crazy , rapping , table-tipping , planchette , music in the air , hand-tying , parafine candle-moulding frauds ? Why should any relative of mine , any blood-relation , why should you who have known me from the cradle , and know what a plain , practical , straightforward common-sense man I have been all my days , imagine that in the very prime of life , the ripe wisdom of my years , I should sink so low as that . Deeply affected . HAWKINS : But Uncle Mulberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean anything  --  I only mean that I thought I had heard that this materialization was one of the latest discoveries of spiritualization  --  SELLERS : No spiritualization about it . The principle is as old as the everlasting hills . ( Softening into confidentiality . ) Why , Lafayette , this thing has always existed . It 's an old thing . Only the world was n't prepared for it . It 's just like steam and electricity  --  the principle always has been understood and practiced in a small way , off in holes and corners . But now it comes out in the full light of day because the world 's ripe for it  --  wants it  --  needs it  --  must have it . It 's a plain practical thing  --  and I would n't take hold of it as a man of science , if it was n't . I can explain it to you in half a minute . The spiritualists materialize one little pitiful specter  --  or part of a specter  --  a leg , or an arm ! Or a forefinger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance from each person in the circle . Now I propose to do it on a large scale . I propose to reclothe the departed spirits and bring them back solid and substantial by simply using the enormous waste of human substance that 's always going on ; by employing the lost weight and vitality thrown off in breathing , by utilizing what we lose through hunger every day between breakfast and dinner , by applying the insensible perspiration of living men . HAWKINS , dazed : It is immense , it is prodigious  --  but it sounds so impossible . SELLERS : Nothing impossible about it ! HAWKINS : But  --  but  --  you only propose to do it ; as I understand , you ; you only hope  --  SELLERS : No , I do n't merely propose to do it , I can do it . The thing has finished and completed itself in my mind  --  the final and essential details flashed upon me this very day . Lafayette . ( Impressively . ) I can actually make a dead man rise up and live . HAWKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yes sir , live . This is the thing I was referring to a while ago  --  for this is the grandest invention of the age , of all the ages , as you said . There 's no end of money in it . HAWKINS : How ? Why , where is there money in it ? It 's certainly a much bigger wonder than materializing a mere plaster of Paris leg in a dim light , but you know the public have grown so suspicious of all that sort of thing , that now even an entire dead man walking about in the impressive twilight of a seance would hardly draw , I 'm afraid . SELLERS , compassionately : Ah , dear me , you  --  why Lafayette , did you suppose I had anything so paltry as an exhibition in my mind ? ( Earnestly . ) No , sir ! I have a far nobler object in bringing these dead people back to life . I shall make them useful . HAWKINS : Useful ? How ? SELLERS , pauses  --  reflecting gravely : For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Hawkins breaks into a laugh . With rebuking seriousness . ) It is not a laughing matter , Lafayette . HAWKINS , sincerely : You must excuse me , Colonel  --  I meant no harm  --  I did not know you were in earnest . SELLERS : I am in earnest . I shall rehabilitate these dead men and put them on the police . I have thought it all out , and it is perfectly rational , perfectly feasible . And mints of money in it . It 's full of sense . You take the average policeman . Look at that animal yonder , ( pointing out of the window ) asleep  --  against a lamp-post  --  moss growing on his back and probably barnacles  --  is he better than a dead man ? I mean a dead man that 's been dead 500 years and had a rest . Of course he is n't ; he 's not half so good  --  not half as lively . You wait  --  you 'll see how it 'll freshen them up  --  my process , I mean . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the longer he 's been dead the better  --  he 's more rested . I have been inquiring around privately , among officials and politicians ; and I find that by a judicious distribution of money I can get a contract to supply Washington with a police force of this kind . Now look at the thing calmly . What does the present force cost this town , in the mere item of wages alone ? Two hundred men at , say , an average of $100 a month apiece , $20,000 a month  --  $240,000 a year . Very good  --  now listen . A materialized policeman costs nothing for his keep  --  not a cent ; because he does n't eat anything , he does n't drink anything . Very good ; I can materialize a very good article of policeman at eight cents apiece  --  that will cover my expenses , wear and tear of machinery , etc.  --  and I can turn out the very best A.1. article that ever was seen at nine or ten cents  --  say $13 a gross . Suppose I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them  --  A hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year clear profit , ai n't it ? Now do you begin to see any money in it ? HAWKINS : Money ? Why it takes a body 's breath away ! SELLERS : Does that take your breath away ? Why , Lafayette , that is nothing but the mere poverty-stricken preliminary . HAWKINS : You do n't mean to say  --  SELLERS : I mean to say just what I  --  why look here ! There 's New York , Philadelphia , Boston , Baltimore , Chicago , St. Louis , Cincinnati , San Francisco , and a hundred and fifty other cities  --  I 'll supply them all  --  they 've got to come to it , they ca n't help themselves . Why ? Because if they 'll give me a monopoly , I 'll let them have policemen at club terms . There are 30,000 policemen in the U.S. I 'll furnish the entire lot at $5 a month apiece . Just figure on that ; $150,000 a month , ai n't it ? Eighteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's too stupendous ! SELLERS , indifferently : Yes  --  yes  --  it 's well enough for a beginning . HAWKINS : For a beginning ! SELLERS : That 's all  --  merely a beginning . The rest of the world  --  HAWKINS : The rest of the world ? SELLERS , calmly : Certainly . I have thought it all out and I have made the necessary calculations . ( Taking a paper from his pocket . ) I find that in Europe and the rest of the world there are 500,000 policemen employed  --  at a perfectly ruinous expense . From my works , when I get them fully equipped , I shall supply all these men . I shall let them go at , say $2 a month apiece ; a million dollars a month , you see  --  twelve millions a year . Lafayette , I will make policemen cheaper than any other kind of meat in the world . This thing is so sure ; these grand results are so absolutely certain , that if a man was to come in here now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have five million dollars for a few  --  " ( Knocking at the door . ) Come in . ( Enter a man  --  he and Sellers step aside and talk together inaudibly , Setters feeling in all his pockets in vain and saying . ) Two dollars  --  um  --  two dollars  --  I meant to pay it six weeks ago  --  but my capital is so engrossed by  --  look here I 'll tell you what I 'll do . ( Leading him to a picture . ) You shall take this work of art temporarily until I can  --  and please be very careful with it . ( Brushing it with handkerchief . ) It 's a marvelous thing , marvelous  --  it 's the best battle-field pastoral that ever  --  why just look at these drums  --  you can hear them  --  and observe the tone of the middle distance , and the extraordinary attitude of the high lights  --  and the feeling  --  ah , just observe the feeling that 's in that picture . I regard it as altogether the finest work in my collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , " Sellers , people may talk about a railroad being the one possession that can round and complete a human life , and satisfy the tender and nameless longings that breathe their plaintive sighings through the mysterious chambers of the soul , but I would rather own that Meissonnier of yours than  --  " MAN : Meissonnier ? Why , it 's chromo ! SELLERS , undisturbed : Why of course it is . Do you suppose you 'll ever see another original painting in the U.S. while the national idiot asylum yonder in the capital levies a 30 per cent duty on them ? MAN , gratefully : Let me shake you by the hand . Give me the chromo . I 'm not going to draw business lines too rigidly with a man who is animated by such honorable sentiments as that . ( Shaking hands . ) Good day , sir , good day  --  take your own time . SELLERS : Good day . ( Man leaves with picture . Calling after him . ) Keep it in a dry place  --  do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) It 's better he should have it , anyway , till I can build a gallery  --  bound to get injured here . ( Brushing another chromo with handkerchief and holding it at arm 's length in different lights . ) He 's got a fine feeling for art , that man . ( Brush . ) The finest I ever saw , ( Brush. ) in a gas fitter . I 'm glad he did n't get his eye on this old Rembrandt . ( Re-hanging picture and sitting down . ) Let me see  --  where was I ? Oh , the policemen . HAWKINS : Yes , that was it . SELLERS : Now as to detectives . There 's always been an ineradicable defect about detectives . I have recalled and set down , here , ( Referring to document ) upwards of a hundred cases where they would have ferreted out a crime if they had lived long enough . Now I can fix all that . I can get up an article of detective that 'll last like the joke about the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why if proper pains are taken in the materializing the materialized detective should n't remain perfectly sound and sweet a thousand years . Just the same with policemen . For a reasonable premium I 'll make ' em immortal . HAWKINS : It 's a grand idea  --  grand ! SELLERS : The more this thing opens up to me , the more marvelously its possibilities expand . Think of it . Why , these now idle , useless myriads of dead men can be employed in a thousand ways . District telegraph messengers , consuls  --  Congressmen  --  why look here . Why should n't we have a permanent set of dead congressmen ? Instead of always turning out one lot that were just beginning to learn something and electing a new lot that did n't know anything . Why , man , it would entirely stop this ignorant tampering with the tariff  --  because any dead man of ordinary intelligence knows that those mistakes were all committed ages ago . And moreover it  --  why , Lafayette , I could give this country its pick and choice out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAWKINS , going to Sellers : Your materialization plan beats immigration if it will work ! SELLERS : It will work and I will work sometime ! And take the case of Europe . I can furnish Europe a set of kings that can eat dynamite if they want to  --  it wo n't hurt them . Lafayette , I can do a splendid trade in misfit kings  --  just as one does in carpets  --  for a reasonable brokerage , take an AlphonseFootnote : 1Kb off their hands and furnish them the old original ! Solomon in his place , Solomon ought to fetch a slashing figure . What should you think I ought to ask for Solomon , Lafayette ? HAWKINS : I believe you could get anything you chose to charge . SELLERS , meditatively , telling off his fingers : Say a million a year  --  dirt cheap  --  million for Charlemagne  --  million for  --  a million 's too cheap , Lafayette  --  we can do better ; we can do a great deal better . You write to some of those governments  --  let ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you think it 's better , you can try an auction . I really believe an auction 's the correct thing . It excites competition , you know . And everybody likes auctions , anyway . It 's human  --  it 's a human failing . I believe there 's thirty or forty millions a year just in kings alone . But you mus n't be too hasty  --  you want to make sure of the best way before you break ground . Now if you could get some advice from the British minister  --  I 'll leave the whole thing in your hands  --  get the best terms you can , and  --  HAWKINS : But in such an important matter as this , I should think you yourself  --  SELLERS , impressively : If it were an important thing , I should of course give it my personal attention  --  but in view of the greater matter at stake , it will be necessary for me to occupy myself exclusively with the wholesale end of the business , so to speak , and entrust the retail trade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything bigger than  --  SELLERS : Peddling kings ? Why , Lafayette , have you forgotten that the nations of the earth have got to be supplied with armies ? HAWKINS : Good land ! SELLERS : Can they afford to carry their custom anywhere else ? I would like you to answer me that ? What chance would an entire army of living soldiers stand against a single brigade of my dead ones  --  My immortal ones ? None at all . Lafayette , the combined armies of the European and Asiatic world aggregate 16,000,000 men . To these we add our own army , which , including deserters , amounts to nearly 20,000 . I will supply 16,020,000 men for $200,000,000 a year or I will sell the entire crop , and warrant them to outlast the solar system , for the bagatelle of sixty billion dollars cash on the nail .

( Enter another creditor and talks with Sellers aside who searches his pockets and says presently . ) One dollar and a half  --  um  --  I thought it was a dollar and forty cents  --  but you 're right  --  I remember now . You lent me a couple of car tickets  --  yes , it was a dollar and a half . ( Reflects , then takes down picture and brushes it off , occasionally wiping away a tear . ) Take it along , there 's no other way . MAN , ruefully : If you 've got anything else , I 'd infinitely rather  --  SELLERS , interrupting and gently pushing him out with the chromo : No , it will break my heart , but I 've got to submit to the heavy blow  --  for the present  --  for a couple of days  --  but I know you 'll take good care of it  --  do guard it as you would your own life  --  it 's the only Rembrandt that 's in this country . MAN , casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hesitatingly : I suppose , Colonel , that necessarily in view of these new and colossal interests , the business which you called me here about , is no longer of sufficient importance to  --  SELLERS : What , the Earldom ! The Earldom not important ! Why , now it 's a hundred times more important than it was before . Why , Lafayette , do you know what it is to be an English earl ? Why it 's a grander thing , it 's a sublimer thing , it 's a more enviable thing to be an English earl than to be a materialized Solomon , with all his unapproachable paraphernalia of wisdom including his eight hundred materialized wives ; that 's an ordinary earl . Think what an earl I shall be , with these billions at my back . No , indeed , the Earldom 's a hundred times more important now , than it was before . You know all about our family claim and how the matter stands , do n't you ? HAWKINS : In general terms , yes  --  but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple . Our branch of the family came over to this country about a hundred years ago . Several times , since , the Earldom has come near falling to the American tribe but always missed fire at the last moment . By the extinction of my Uncle Abner 's family ten years ago I became the head of the American House . Well , our chances have become good again . For instance  --  there 's the present Earl , now in possession . He 's old and feeble and likely to go any time . After him comes his young bachelor son , Reginald De Bohun , his heir . If Reginald should die unmarried , his cousin Rupert , also a bachelor , would inherit . If he should die unmarried , I walk into the Earldom with none to dispute . Very well ; Rupert is here in Washington at this moment . I have n't seen him , but he 's here  --  arrived lately . Now , my idea is to buy out his claim . HAWKINS : But why do n't you buy out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present I ca n't get at him . He 's in England ; so I will buy out Rupert , and as soon as that 's all fixed , you will proceed to England and negotiate with Reginald . As soon as you 've fixed Reginald , go ahead and buy out the old gentleman , telegraph me , and I 'll come along with the family . HAWKINS : O , Colonel , I shall never know how to be grateful enough to you for choosing me for this service ; for all my life I have so longed to travel to foreign lands , but I never could afford it before . SELLERS : Well , you can afford it , now , and you shall go in style , too  --  style that 'll make your head swim . I do n't want you to spare any expense  --  just make the money fly . I 'll foot the bills . HAWKINS : O , it 'll be delightful . And what do you think I had better pay for Reginald and the old Earl ? SELLERS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any matter . HAWKINS : But will they sell ? Will an Englishman 's pride allow him to sell such a thing ? SELLERS : Well , how you talk ! An Englishman 's pride allows him to sell the succession to a pulpit to the highest bidder , do n't it ? Do you reckon the pride that do n't stick at peddling places in the immediate service of the Deity for cash , will stick at peddling little sham dignities pertaining to the fictitious service of an earthly king ? Do n't you see that would be idiotic ? HAWKINS : Certainly  --  I see it now  --  now that you 've put it so that a body ca n't help seeing it  --  but I had n't thought of it before . SELLERS , reflectively : In a week  --  or at most , two weeks  --  the lightnings will be carrying my stupendous achievement all around the globe . HAWKINS , concerned : Wo n't that make Reginald and the Earl put up their price ? SELLERS : Yes  --  that 's true . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . HAWKINS , despairing gasp : Aw ! SELLERS : As far as I am personally concerned I do n't mind it , for it is not a sum of consequence ; but what I am troubled about is the effect upon my country . No , Lafayette , as a patriot I  --  to suddenly remove this money from the veins and arteries of commerce  --  ( Walking the floor in distress . ) Why  --  why  --  true , the sum is nothing to us , but the United States ca n't stand it . We 've got to look out for our country first and ourselves afterward . HAWKINS , with enthusiasm : That 's just like you , Colonel Sellers  --  and I 'm proud of you for it . Well , then  --  SELLERS : Well , then  --  um , um . ( Walking and puzzling over it  --  then cheerfully . ) I 've got it ! You 'll hold that auction there ! HAWKINS : Good ! I see ! Take money out of Europe ! SELLERS : That 's the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , pay those people their billion and square the thing up , and make the proper preparations for my reception right away . Go down to the House of Lords and have my seat upholstered fresh . ( Knock at the door . ) Buy me a few country seats in good localities  --  Warwick and Hampton Court and one or two others  --  and buy Kenilworth and fix it up and put a mansard on it  --  white-wash it and put in a burglar alarm  --  ( Louder knock . ) And when you 've got everything ready for me , send a ship . HAWKINS : A ship ? A whole one ? SELLERS : Yes  --  What could I do with a half a one ? HAWKINS : What kind of one shall  --  SELLERS : Why , the best of course  --  what other kind would you have me use ? HAWKINS : Very well , then  --  I  --  SELLERS : Get the great Eastern . HAWKINS : What , charter the gr  --  SELLERS : No . ( Loud knock . ) Buy her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people , they annoy a body to death .

( Pause . ) Well , I believe everything 's settled and understood , now  --  ( Pause . Meditatively , slowly , absendmindedly . ) Windsor Castle  --  um  --  If Windsor Castle were just a shade nearer town  --  Mrs. Sellers bursts in with the newspaper . She is shabbily dressed in the gown that Mary had on when she left the room . MRS . SELLERS : Lafayette Hawkins , I 'm glad to see you . You do n't need to have me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Sarah and the girls ? And your mother ? Is she well ? I 'm ashamed to keep you waiting so long  --  I was just trying on a dress , and I could n't come any sooner , and I 'm so flustered about this fire  --  HAWKINS : Oh , that 's all right , Mrs. Sellers . Do n't mention it at all . How young you look ! Why when you came in I thought it was Mary right over again . You do n't look a bit older . MRS . SELLERS , looking fearfully down at her dress : I reckon it 's the dress partly . We always dress off the same piece  --  when we can . You come at a sad time , Lafayette , but you 're welcome all the same ! You 're a Sellers by blood too , and you 've a right to share our family affliction . I suppose the Colonel has told you of our bereavement . Oh , it do n't seem as if I could bear it . Pulls out her handkerchief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy , Polly ? What are you talking about ? MRS .

I got there as usual just as they had put it out but I illustrated the principle of the extinguisher to a magnificent audience in a vacant lot on the way home . ( Mrs. Sellers continues to weep . ) But what in the world has the conflagration of a woodshed in Georgetown got to do with our family troubles ? I thought  --  MRS . SELLERS : It was n't a woodshed  --  it was the Tolliver House , last night  --  it 's all in the paper !

DE BOHUN : Overheated ? Why no  --  of  --  course I do n't . ( Aside . ) Now what in the world does the man mean ? What kind of a craze is he in ? SELLERS , aside  --  with enthusiasm : I 'll empty perdition ! I 'll do it as sure as guns ! It 's the grandest invention of the age  --  of all the ages ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take billions for it . Yes , sir , I 'll empty per  --  DE BOHUN , rising : I beg your pardon , Colonel Sellers , for interrupting your  --  ah  --  meditations  --  and perhaps I 've come inopportunely  --  SELLERS : Oh , not at all , not at all  --  I had sent for you . DE BOHUN , mystified : Sent for me ? SELLERS : Yes  --  to the hotel , you know . DE BOHUN : Ah , I did n't know they got the names in the papers so soon . SELLERS : Oh , they 're all there ! A full account of it . DE BOHUN : I really do n't understand you , my dear sir . But I do n't know that it matters . If you sent for me , it was very kind and hospitable . SELLERS : Oh , not at all ! DE BOHUN : And it relieves my mind , in regard to what I was afraid might seem an intrusion . But the fact is , I 've wished to make your acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first visited Missouri for that purpose . SELLERS : Sir , I appreciate  --  DE BOHUN : When I found that you had recently left Hannibal  --  Hamilcar , or Regulus Hannibal or some of those punic characters  --  It 's very extraordinary calling a town after an elephant ! I assure you that I did n't know where to turn . Besides my personal wish to meet the American claimant to the Earldom of Dover , and to make the acquaintance of a cousin , whose rights , such as they are , we all acknowledge  --  SELLERS , with spirit : Oh , you do ! Then , sir , may I ask , why my cousin , the Earl of Dover , has taken no notice whatever of the letters I have addressed to him ? Three letters a week for the last two years at the lowest calculation  --  letters proffering him the hospitality of my Missouri home , if he should come out our way , and attempting to establish a  --  a  --  cousinly reciprocity with him on the  --  the questions of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , you know , the Earl is a very poor correspondent , and he 's an irascible old man , gouty , and perhaps always a little hot tempered . And one thing I had in mind was to beg you not to expose yourself to the ignominy of having letters put into the fire by the footman as fast as they arrived  --  SELLERS : The infernal , insolent old scoundrel ! DE BOHUN : Ah , I dare say you 're quite right . The Earl is old , and he 's insolent , so far as I 've been able to observe , and he 's the greatest scoundrel alive . ( Suggestively . ) But he 's the head of the house , you know . SELLERS : Well , sir , I 'm a Southern gentleman , and I am the head of the house , in right . DE BOHUN : I dare say  --  I 've no doubt you 're quite right ; but the present Lord Dover is in possession . However , that 's neither here nor there . Besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had another motive in coming here this morning . I have ventured to hope that you would be willing to assist me in a matter which concerns me very deeply . SELLERS , with bland dignity : You may command me , sir . My house , my person , and my purse are at your disposal . You must allow me to introduce you to my wife and daughter . ( Aside . ) I do n't know how they 'll manage about that one good dress , between them . But I could have them appear on the installment plan . DE BOHUN : You 're very good , I 'm sure . The matter is simply this ! When I left Hamilcar , Missouri , after my disappointment in failing to find you there , three months ago , I met with what I suppose were some common incidents of travel in your country ! I was in a railway smash-up  --  I think you call it  --  and I was carried down in a sinking steamboat in the Mississippi . SELLERS : Oh , every day occurrences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort happened to us on our way east . DE BOHUN : When I came up , I had the pleasure of saving the life of a young lady , to whom I had spoken on the train just before the smash-up , and whom I had met again on board . In the darkness we were separated , and I have never seen her again . My life since then has been merely a search for her . Can you aid me to find her ? SELLERS : I can and will , with great pleasure . What was her name ? DE BOHUN : I never knew . SELLERS : Well , no matter . Not the least matter . I can arrange all that . I will simply materialize one of the people who were lost on that boat , and ascertain her whereabouts . You see this electric apparatus ? With the aid of this simple affair , I can materialize any body who ever died , have done it  --  ( Aside . ) My goodness , I forgot that I had materialized him . DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a desperate extremity . But it 's only fair to tell you I have n't the least faith in spiritualism . SELLERS : Spiritualism ? No spiritualism about it , sir . A purely scientific operation  --  ( Cautiously . ) But may I ask , sir , why you wish to meet this young lady again ? DE BOHUN : I may as well be frank with you ; I love her . SELLERS , aghast : You  --  love  --  her ? DE BOHUN : We pledged each other there on the bit of wreck to which we clung , and I hope to meet her as my betrothed , and  --  in short  --  to marry her . SELLERS : Marry her ! Oh , good Lord ! You must n't ! You ca n't ! It is n't permissible  --  it is n't possible ! No , sir ! You must n't think of it . UNCLE DANIEL , at the door : Yere 's dat gentleman from New York wants to see you , Marse Sellers . He 's waitin ' down in de hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away . SELLERS , to De Bohun : Ah , excuse me a moment ! Just  --  just amuse yourself here till I come back  --  I wo n't detain you  --  unavoidable engagement . Exit . SCENE II : De Bohun alone . DE BOHUN : Really , this is a most extraordinary old gentleman . He surpasses all that the American claimant should be in eccentricity and originality . I fancy he ca n't be in his right mind  --  if he has one , as his country-men would say . Most extraordinary ! What does he mean by his jargon about my buoyancy ? I never felt less buoyant in the whole course of my life ! And why does he expect me to petrify ? Bless my soul , it 's very odd , very strange ! I ca n't understand this ! I 've visited a good many parts of this remarkable country and I 've met a great many remarkable men in it , but my American cousin is certainly the most remarkable . What a very curious old den it is ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone into the business at second hand . ( He walks about the room , examining the various objects through his eye-glass till he comes to the ship 's phonograph . He reads the label . ) " The Sellers Ship 's Phonograph for the application of stored Profanity to the working of Vessels during storms . Adapted to the use of Foremen in Boiler Manufactories , and Large Press-Rooms . Patent applied for . " My kinsman is certainly one of the most  --  He turns the crank of the phonograph . THE PHONOGRAPH : Drop that , drop that , you infernal lubber , or I 'll knock you off that yard with a belaying pin ! DE BOHUN : Very extraordinary . Turns . THE PHONOGRAPH : Turn out o ' there , you lousy hound . Going to be all night  --  If you do n't jump I 'll wow , wow , wow , you low lived wow , wow , wow , of a wow . DE BOHUN : Really , this is a most amazing implement ! Turns . THE PHONOGRAPH : Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wow , wow , or I 'll heave your carcass overboard to the sharks . DE BOHUN : Very truculent language , upon my word . I wonder if my ingenious cousin charged this instrument himself ? Turns . THE PHONOGRAPH : I could whittle a better sailor than you out of a pine stick , you miserable Portagee , wow , wow , wow . I could go ashore at Cape Ann and dig up a man out of the grave-yard that could reef a sail better than that . DE BOHUN : This is the true American touch , upon my word . I must get one of these for the old Earl , and have it charged with profanity here in America . The Earl runs to quantity rather than quality in his blasphemy . He 'll be glad of a thing like this ! Turns the crank . THE PHONOGRAPH : Footnote : 1Kb O , I wish I had gone down in the water in his place  --  or with him ! DE BOHUN : Ha ! High ! What 's this ? This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , oh ! If we could only have been drowned together ! DE BOHUN : Why  --  why  --  I know that voice  --  can it be ? It ca n't be  --  Turns wildly . THE PHONOGRAPH , confusedly : You think he got drowned  --  poor creatures out of the train  --  git my hands on him  --  tar de lights out'n him  --  mop de floor wid him  --  fancy to a perfect stranger in the cars  --  American pork  --  Oh , he is my dear , dead only love  --  talking by the guard before the boat went down  --  pulled me up on that piece of wreck and told me there in the horror and darkness that he would rather be there with me in the presence of death  --  DE BOHUN : Gracious powers ! What is all this ? I distinguish two voices ! And one I know . It is her voice ! Yes , it is ! And these last words were the last I spoke to her  --  Oh , my lost love ! Turns . THE PHONOGRAPH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth without me . DE BOHUN : Yes , my words ! Turns . THE PHONOGRAPH : Then in the darkness and confusion  --  DE BOHUN : Oh , something lost here ! THE PHONOGRAPH : Dey lit out together and de sooner you make up your mind . Oh , yes he did , he left me and went away with her  --  poor lost false  --  my love , my cruel love ! DE BOHUN , staggering back from the phonograph : Merciful Heaven , what can it mean ? Wait , let me think ? This is the story of my luckless love  --  it ca n't be any other ! One of the voices is hers  --  no other ! This machine , they say , gathers up and records every sound uttered in its presence  --  Then  --  yes , it must be so ! She spoke those words here  --  in this room  --  She is in this house now , perhaps  --  oh ! MARY , within : Uncle Daniel , will you let that phonograph alone ? ( Entering . ) Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was our old servant . Whenever he gets provoked at anything , he comes in here and swears through the phonograph till we have no peace of our lives . ( Recognizing De Bohun . ) Oh ! DE BOHUN : You ! ( She makes a step towards him ; then arrests herself ; he rushes upon her , and clasps her in his arms . ) Oh , my darling ; is it you at last ! Have I found you again ? How did I lose you that night ? Where have you been ? What  --  but now I have you once more , and nothing but death shall part us ! Oh , my dear , my love ! Wake ! Look at me ! It 's I  --  I , your  --  MARY , rousing herself from the faintness that has crept over her and feebly struggling to repel him : Let me go ! Leave  --  leave  --  let me  --  ( She lifts her face and looks into his and then before blissfully relapsing into his embrace . ) No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you have been or done ! Stay with me now , and let the past go ! I have you again , and I have been so true to you that it shall be enough for both ! DE BOHUN : But I have been true to you , dearest , in every word and thought since we parted  --  MARY : And that  --  that woman  --  whom you gave your place upon the wreck ? That  --  DE BOHUN : Poor old lady ! When I lost you , it was my sole drop of comfort that I could restore her to her grand-children . MARY : Her grand-children ! Oh , bless , bless you , my darling for that word ! ( Wildly clasping and clinging to him . ) Oh , forgive me , love ! Oh , hate me  --  hate me for my wicked doubt of you . Kissing him . DE BOHUN : Well , under the circumstances it 's a little difficult . And I have been looking for you ever since that fatal night for a very different purpose ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must , indeed , for I 've quite lost my senses , and there ought to be some slight method in the madness of such lovers as we . I do n't know what to make of it all . How is it you happen to be in this house ? MARY : This house ? DE BOHUN : This private bedlam , if you like  --  MARY : Oh , it is a bedlam indeed ! DE BOHUN : I found my way here in the hope that I might chance to learn something of you or get some hint or help in tracing you from my remarkable cousin , Colonel Sellers  --  MARY , starting from him : Cousin ? Who  --  who  --  DE BOHUN : My co-heir to the dream of being Earl of Dover , the American claimant  --  MARY : Then you are  --  DE BOHUN : Rupert De Bohun . MARY , wildly : But you are dead ! DE BOHUN , astounded : I beg your pardon . I think there must be some error . MARY : No , no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death last night in the Tolliver House ! It was all in the papers ! Have n't you seen it ? DE BOHUN : No , I have n't seen any paper to-day . I arrived this morning at half-past eight  --  and  --  His eye follows Mary as she bustles about the room , looking at the newspapers scattered over the floor . MARY : Here it is ! Fire at the Tolliver House . There ! Can you deny it , now ? What does it mean ? ( She clasps her hands before him , while he quietly reads . ) Who  --  who are you ? DE BOHUN , quietly folds the paper : Rupert De Bohun , as I told you . It 's my poor cousin , Reginald De Bohun who was burned last night . He was a cad , and we were n't on terms ; but I 'm sorry for him  --  I 'm sorrier for my uncle  --  I had no idea Reginald was in America . Poor boy ! I must go  --  MARY , throwing her arms around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet  --  not  --  DE BOHUN : Not instantly , of course . I 've no doubt that everything has been done that can be done . I 'll leave you when you bid me . There 's no haste . MARY : Yes , you must go and go at once ! It is your duty ! Wait ! My father will wish to go with you . DE BOHUN : Your father ? Is your father  --  MARY : Colonel Sellers , the American claimant . I 'm Mary . DE BOHUN : You are my cousin then ? MARY : Yes , cousin . DE BOHUN : How sweet the word is on your lips ! And that remarkable old gentleman is your father ? MARY : He is . DE BOHUN : I might as well take it all coolly . A miracle more or less do n't greatly matter ! And may I ask , my pretty cousin , what theory your father is treating me upon ? MARY : Why , how does he treat you ? DE BOHUN : He seems to have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've sat down , he seems to doubt whether I can get up . He begs me not to get into a current of air for fear I shall be carried out of the window , and he hopes next I 'm not solidifying too rapidly . Sometimes he claps me on the knee with the greatest possible friendliness ; then he treats me with the deepest awe , and then he suddenly seizes me by the coat lapel and pulls me about  --  I beg your pardon my love , but if I were you  --  I hope you 'll excuse my saying it , but really I think some physician ought to see your father . He seems to be over-excited , and  --  MARY : Does he know your name ? DE BOHUN : Certainly . MARY : Then he thinks you 're dead ! DE BOHUN : Bless my soul , how extremely unpleasant ! MARY : Yes . And he believes that he 's materialized you . That 's his latest invention . DE BOHUN : Materialized , as the spiritualists do ? Is your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! He 's a man of science ! He has materialized you by stored electricity ! He was talking of trying it yesterday . DE BOHUN : Dear me ! And at present I am  --  an  --  an  --  apparition ? MARY : Exactly . He thinks you were burnt last night , and when you called here to-day , I suppose he must have been trying to materialize you , and thought he had succeeded . DE BOHUN : Ah , that accounts for it . It 's very simple when you understand it . But still , my dear , I think you 'd better have a physician see your father  --  two of them ! SELLERS , without : In a minute , in a minute , in just one minute . ( Entering . ) Ah , Mary , I 'm glad to see you 've found our  --  our honored guest here . Do you still find yourself pretty well , sir ? No great change I suppose ? Mary , my dear , I 've got a little surprise for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our cousin , Mary , our cousin from England , Mr. De Bohun , one of my fellow heirs to the Earldom of Dover . MARY : Father ! SELLERS : Yes , I knew I should astonish you . Mr. De Bohun , my daughter . DE BOHUN , with some embarrassment : Why , the fact is , I had been making  --  Miss Sellers had allowed me to make  --  her acquaintance before you came in . SELLERS : Is that so ? Well , so much the better  --  so much the better . I want Mary to take you and introduce you to her mother . Better go right to the dining room with Cousin De Bohun , Mary . I 've got to meet that New York gentleman here ; he wants to examine the motor as I used to call it . But I 'll join you directly at lunch . We make a light lunch , cousin , about this hour  --  a few dried apples desiccated by my own process  --  I 'll explain it to you  --  dried apples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohun , Mary . It 's all right  --  no cause for anxiety  --  no trouble  --  he 's just like one of ourselves  --  DE BOHUN : I beg your pardon , but I ought to disabuse you  --  I 'm really not at all what you take me for . I 'm not the De Bohun who  --  SELLERS : Oh , it 's all right . I 'll follow right along down . Just tell your mother , Mary , that he 's our late cousin  --  our cousin lately from England  --  she 'll understand  --  ( He gets them out of the room , familiarly caressing De Bohun and at times starting back . Then he opens the other door to admit the New Yorker . ) Walk right in  --  sorry to keep you waiting , sir . There , sir , there it is . ( He points to the motor , and stands with his arms akimbo admiring it while the New York gentleman picks his way about the room inspecting the mechanism from different points . He steps on a sugared almond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ah , a little idea of mine , that I threw off at an odd moment  --  little improvement on the Nihilist bomb  --  There 's getting to be a grand demand for those things , in Europe , among people of advanced opinions . You see I put the dynamite up in the form of these little sugarplums , ( Picks one up from the floor. ) which may be introduced in the dessert at the Royal or Imperial table  --  I told my servant to sweep these things up , but you ca n't place any dependence upon the negro . He 's left them scattered all over the floor , just where they fell . Well , sir , there 's the motor . NEW YORK MAN , looking about his feet : Yes , yes , it 's very intricate  --  it 's  --  SELLERS : The mechanism is intricate , but the principle is one of the simplest known to science . In five minutes I can make the whole thing clear to you . You observe this battery  --  but I prefer to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? NEW YORK MAN : Why , in the application of stored electricity to the street cars on the Brooklyn bridge  --  SELLERS : Yes , yes . All very well . No harm in that idea . That is the old idea ! NEW YORK MAN : Old idea ! Is n't that what you telegraphed me to come on for , yesterday ? SELLERS : I may have put that idea forth yesterday  --  advanced it tentatively , experimentally , suggestively , so to speak ; but this motor was built for an entirely different purpose . Be careful , there  --  that little cylinder contains a new explosive I 've been amusing myself with  --  perfectly safe if you do n't touch it . This machine was invented and designed exclusively for materialization ! NEW YORK MAN : Materialization ? SELLERS : Yes , sir , for absorbing and condensing the enormous waste of vital force with which our atmosphere is filled from the dissolution of the human race  --  computed at nine-thousand millions of square feet of gaseous matter . This has hitherto been entirely lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-horse way by the necromancers of former ages and the spiritualists of ours for the materialization of a few sporadic spectres here and there , to delude their ignorant votaries . NEW YORK MAN : And are you  --  you are a spiritualist ? SELLERS : Not at all , sir ! The question is perfectly natural . My nephew , Major Lafayette Hawkins , of Hannibal , Missouri , a shrewd and long-headed operator in real estate , out there , asked me the same question in this room not an hour ago ; and I replied to General Hawkins , one of the greatest financiers of the west  --  as I now reply to you ; not at all . I am a plain straightforward man of science , dealing with a well-ascertained scientific fact . I claim no merit in the matter , nor any supernatural power ; I apply natural forces on a large scale , that have always existed . I have only to press this button here , and I fill this room with the disembodied  --  no sir  --  the re-embodied spirits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the door , backwards , and looking carefully to his feet : Is it possible ? SELLERS : You may have your doubts , sir  --  it 's natural you should . It would detain you too long , perhaps , if I were to attempt this experiment , now ; but I can inform you in confidence that there is now a gentleman in the dining room with my wife and daughter , whom I materialized by my process not three quarters of an hour ago . NEW YORK MAN , still edging away : Is it possible ! SELLERS : I prefer not to give names  --  these things get into the papers so soon  --  but this gentleman was one of the victims of the Tolliver House fire , last night  --  cousin of mine , distant cousin ; so there 's no deception  --  no possible deception . I materialized that man in five minutes  --  five seconds ! I had n't started a full current from those batteries before that man sent in his card ! Yes , sir ! And a minute afterwards he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutest detail of the clothes that were consumed last night on his person . NEW YORK MAN : Great heavens ! SELLERS : A fact , sir , a simple fact ! Why , pshaw ! I 'll call him up here . He can excuse himself to the ladies half a minute , and I can show you what a perfect article of materialization this machine can turn out . Just amuse yourself with the morning paper a moment , while I get the gentleman to step up . There  --  there 's the account of the fire in this paper ; you can see there 's no deception about it ! Starting for the door . NEW YORK MAN , excitedly : No , no ! Do n't go ! Not this morning , please . I 'll look in again in the course of the day . I 've got an appointment . ( Taking out his watch . ) I promised to see a man at half-past twelve , and I 've only got five minutes . I 'll stop in towards evening , if you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens , and Uncle Daniel puts his head in . The New Yorker improves his opportunity to slip out . SELLERS : Well , what is it , Daniel ? UNCLE DANIEL : De deputation of temperance ladies . SELLERS : What deputation of what temperance ladies ? UNCLE DANIEL : I do n't know . Dey said you 'd know . Dey said you promised to ' dress ' em and dey 's come for you to go at de head of de possession to de hall . SELLERS : It 's a mistake . I remember now , I made a partial promise to address a temperance meeting on Thursday . But this is Wednesday . UNCLE DANIEL : No , it ai n't , Marse Sellers ; it 's Thursday , shore enuff . Dey said dey 'd wait outside till you was ready . De possession ai n't all formed yet . But it 's formin '  --  formin ' in front o ' de house . Dey ai n't many ladies yit ; but dey 's lots o ' boys and dogs . I guess dey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SELLERS , fuming about : Well , well . I must go , I suppose . I must go . It 's a matter of public duty . Where is Lafayette ? Send Lafayette to me . ( Uncle Daniel goes out . ) I 'm not at all prepared . I 've forgotten all about this address . What shall I do ? I must say something  --  perhaps Lafayette can suggest something . Dear , oh dear ! ( He hunts aimlessly about the room , and takes a bottle from the mantel-piece at random . ) Alcohol ! The subtle spirit of alcohol ! Yes , something like that ! Oh , that a man should put  --  put  --  ( Uncorks the bottle and smells it. ) an enemy in his mouth to steal away his brains ! Footnote : 1Kb Good Iago  --  ( Smelling . ) Prythee tell me , ( Smelling . ) I am unused to the soothing mood , Footnote : 1Kb ( Smelling. ) and the big wars that make ambition virtue .

I 've got it ! But pure alcohol wo n't do ! ( Replacing the bottle , he turns about and confronts Hawkins . ) Lafayette , my son , how long is it since you were drunk ? HAWKINS : Why , Colonel Sellers , I do n't know what you mean . You know I never was drunk in my life . SELLERS : Ah , that 's a great pity  --  a terrible pity ! HAWKINS : Pity ? But say what about this English chap with Mary ; they seem to be old acquaintances . SELLERS : Do n't mind him . He 's only a materialization and if he does n't mind will soon dematerialize . Ah  --  hum  --  yes  --  there 's a procession of ladies forming in front of this house , to conduct me to the hall of the Sisters of Siloam , where I 've promised to deliver a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great idea for my address  --  something that will carry my name throughout the land , and make it a means of good in every household . But your inexperience spoils everything . How have you been brought up ? Never been drunk ! HAWKINS : But I do n't see what my never having been drunk has to do with it , Colonel . SELLERS : That 's because you do n't take a practical view of things . What makes the average temperance lecturer an utter failure ? What saps the cause at its fountainhead ? Simply the fact that its advocates can speak so little from their own experience . This is what gives GoffFootnote : 1Kb his immense influence ; he speaks from his own experience , and warns and implores his hearers to avoid the evils from which he has suffered . Now if you had only been an habitual drunkard or if you had fallen once or twice , I could make an awful living example of you ! HAWKINS : Why , but Colonel Sellers , have n't you ever been drunk , yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we were last in Washington together  --  ten years ago  --  and then I was so completely drunk that , when I got sober I could n't remember anything about it . ( He thinks a moment in silence . ) Wait  --  I have it  --  do n't say anything ! Yes , the first false step  --  that shall be my theme , and then I can present it with all the powerful aid of realistic art ! Lafayette , have you any spirits about you ? I 've a bottle of pure alcohol on the mantel which I use in my experiments here , but that wo n't do . I must have a portable spirit  --  some soon-spreading gear that quickly as the hasty powder fired , may spread through all the veins  --  like brandy , for example . HAWKINS , hesitatingly : I got a bottle at the druggist 's before I left home , for use on the journey  --  SELLERS : Got it with you ? HAWKINS , drawing the flask out of his breast pocket : Yes , here it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , Lafayette , I am going to enter upon this career  --  for I shall hereafter devote my whole life to the cause of temperance  --  in a common sense , practical way . I am going to test in my own person the seductive effects of the first glass . ( He opens the bottle and winks . ) It 's a very good article of brandy  --  for Hannibal . HAWKINS : But the ladies , Colonel Sellers , it wo n't do to keep them waiting . SELLERS : Oh , I sha n't keep them waiting a minute . Women are never punctual . ( Tilts the bottle to his lips . ) A  --  a  --  a  --  h ! That is good ! That is good brandy , Lafayette . A good , pure medicinal brandy ! Got it at Braden 's ? HAWKINS : No , at Watson 's . SELLERS : Oh , I know  --  on the corner . Hannibal is a grand old town . And growing , too , they tell me , like a weed , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ! Just that one taste , has recalled the whole past to me ! What a wonderful vehicle of memory the , sense of taste is ! Why Lafayette , I can recall the very sensation now , that I had when I tasted my first glass of brandy . It was on the old Pocahontas , coming down from Napoleon to St. Louis . I was merely a boy  --  a lad of twenty , but I remember that first glass , the sense of degradation , of outlawry , and then as the infernal fumes mounted to my brain , the shameless exaltation ! Oh , I can picture it all to them in words of fire ! The orphan boy , on his first absence from home  --  of course , my parents were living , but an orphan is always so much more effective  --  The orphan tempted by evil associates  --  the first glass ! Glass ! ( Thoughtfully . ) I suppose I ought to have taken it from a glass  --  the bottle is such a different thing . If I am to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfully , Lafayette . Let me have that flask again . ( Looks about the mantel till he finds an old claret glass . ) Ah , here  --  here 's one . Leg 's broken off , but no matter . It does n't have to stand up , anyway . ( Pours a full glass from the bottle . ) There ! ( Drinks . ) That 's something like ! That is the real sensation ! No degradation about that ! No outlawry ! Nothing but exaltation . I remember , now , there was nothing but exaltation at the time . And moderate drinking is temperance . The other is total abstinence  --  fanaticism . Make that point , and  --  k  --  ic  --  keep the distinction before their minds . Let the lesson , ( Pours out another glass and drinks. ) sink in ! HAWKINS , nervously : But ai n't you afraid , Colonel Sellers that  --  SELLERS : F  --  ic  --  fraid of what , Lafayette ?

( Drinks another glass . ) Lafayette , I 've just thought of something ! I 'll tell you ! I ca n't waste my time personally on this temperance lecturing ; I must delegate it ! There ought to be a dozen  --  there ought to be fifty lecturers started on the platform at the same time and attack the enemy in converging lines . Lafayette , I will materialize that corps of lecturers !

Remorse ! ( Thoughtfully . ) Morse ! Inventor of the electric telegraph . Why , Lafayette , if that invention were to be made in these days , it would n't attack the slightest attention  --  not the slightest , ladies .

Oh , that a man  --  UNCLE DANIEL , putting his head in at the door : De ladies is all ready for you , Marse Sellers , dey 's waitin ' ! SELLERS : All right ! I 'm coming ! He attempts to pour another glass , but Hawkins gets it from him . HAWKINS : No , no , Colonel Sellers , you mus n't go ! I 'll excuse you to the ladies . You 're not fit to go !

Whashyou , whashyou been doin ' with that door , Lafayette ? Oh , here it is ! Come round again just in the nick of time . I 'm coming ! Sigh no more , ladies , sigh no more ! He plunges out of the door followed by the desperate Hawkins . HAWKINS : Oh , what shall I do ? CURTAIN ACT III SCENE IFootnote : 1Kb : Same as before . Time , evening . De Bohun and Mary sitting on sofa or adjacent chairs . DE BOHUN : I 'm so glad you sent for me , my dear , I found my cousin quite in his usual state , and sufficiently alive to send me about my business . In fact , no lives were lost in the fire at the Tolliver House beginning with my own , and the Honorable Mr. De Bohun was suffering from nothing worse than past enjoyment . He dined too well last night . And your father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the doctor thinks he 'll be all right in a little while . It was n't apoplexy , he says , but a kind of congestion that 's very common and not the most dangerous . Oh ! How often I wish that I were a man ! Oh ! If I were only a man ! DE BOHUN : Well , now , you know , my dear , I ca n't quite join you in that aspiration . No ! No ! It 's I who must be a man and it 's rather difficult after being brought up merely a gentleman . But there 's one thing I 'd quite made up my mind about ; and that is about going home again . I 'm going to stop here and do my best to be not only a man but an American . And you shall help me , I do n't think I could make it out at all if you did n't . Now in the multiplicity of your father 's inventions , do n't you know  --  is n't there some hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't mind taking hold of something of the kind . I should n't , indeed ! I should rather fancy " pushing a patent , " as you say here . ( He wanders gingerly about looking carefully to his steps and staring at the various models . ) Which one of these things does your father happen to prefer himself , my dear ? MARY : Oh ! Do n't ask me . He prefers the wildest of course . DE BOHUN : Of course , of course , with his love of the picturesque  --  the dramatic . But you do n't altogether agree with him , I suppose ? MARY : Agree with him ? DE BOHUN : You do n't believe a great deal in the sand-blast extinguisher , for instance ? MARY : I do n't believe it would put out a candle . ( Sobbing . ) If it had n't been for the steam cut-off , we should all have starved to death long ago . It 's the only practical thing he ever invented and it 's the only thing he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid I do n't understand . I do n't believe I know what a steam cut-off is . MARY : It 's all that 's saved us , or me , I mean . Father could always persuade mother that he had just made his fortune , and this dream of the Earldom  --  that 's been as great a nightmare as any of the other dreams . I do n't know how many times father has n't had it in his grasp . I believe that if he could ever have raked and scraped together money enough to get there , he 'd be in England now pressing his claim . When everything else failed , he fell back on that . I 'm glad your cousin 's alive  --  I 'm glad that none of those poor creatures lost their lives in the fire  --  but , oh ! I 'm so thankful your cousin did n't . It will help to kill one more hope of that wretched Earldom , and father will have to fall back on the cut-off . DE BOHUN , impulsively : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you mind telling me what a cut-off is ? MARY : Oh ! I could n't explain it , myself . But it 's a little machine that they use on steam boilers , and it makes a little saving on each  --  so that every owner of an engine can afford to pay a few dollars royalty for it  --  and as there are thousands of engines in the country , if you can only get the owners to believe in it  --  DE BOHUN : I see , and they wo n't believe in it ? MARY : Yes they will , they do , whenever it is brought to their notice . There is a man under contract with father now , who is to have one third of the patent right if he can get five hundred orders for it , and every now and then he sends us a little money on it , just enough to keep us from death 's door . But he 's terribly slow and father loses patience , and wants to sell it for any trifle , and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a million to-morrow , and I lose all heart about it . I do n't suppose it ever will come to anything . DE BOHUN : Well ! Well ! I do n't understand it at all , my dear , but it does look like a hope , and I would n't lose heart about it altogether . I really think I 'd better go into it more definitely . Where is this agent of your father 's at present ? MARY , desperately : He may be anywhere between here and the Rocky Mountains ! We have n't heard from him for a week , now , and dear knows when we shall ever hear again . DE BOHUN : But has n't he some local address  --  some place where you can get at him somehow ? MARY : Oh ! Yes , he has a brother at 3450 Pennsylvania Avenue , Footnote : 1Kb but he 's hardly ever in his office and we have n't seen him for I do n't know how long . ( She goes up to the mantel and takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mail and not a letter opened , much less answered . We 've been so excited to-day about the temperance address  --  and you  --  and I do n't know what  --  Do n't you want to help me open them ? DE BOHUN , surprised : Open your father 's letters , my dear ? MARY , tearing open the envelopes : Yes  --  I 'm his correspondence clerk . He would never open them . Sometimes I think it would be the best way not to open them , but I ca n't bear to let any chance escape me ; you ca n't tell what 's in them . ( She goes on distractedly tearing them open . ) Oh , I ca n't read them I 'm so happy  --  I 'm so miserable . ( She puts them back and he picks up one from the floor and hands it to her , she glances at it mechanically and then starts back . ) It 's from him ! DE BOHUN : From him ? From whom ? MARY , wildly : From the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oh my love  --  my life  --  my darling  --  She flings one arm around De Bohun 's neck and presses the letter to his face . DE BOHUN , pulling his head back to get a focus on the letter ; then reading : " I shall be with you Thursday to close the contract . I 've got the orders . " Does he mean  --  MARY : That it 's a success , that we are saved  --  that you 're not going to marry a beggar . ( Stopping . ) But Thursday ! That was yesterday . DE BOHUN : No , to-day is Thursday . MARY : So it is . But it 's been so long since morning that I thought it was a year ago . DE BOHUN : What a surprise this will be for your father , my dear , what a joyful surprise . MARY : Surprise ! Oh ! Dear , you do n't know father . Nothing ever surprises him . No matter how astonishing a thing may happen , his mind is so constructed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is just as I say  --  it is not possible to surprise him . Once he was struck by lightning . Why , he was just as calm as you are this minute  --  said he was expecting it . DE BOHUN : Bless my soul ! What a very remarkable old gentleman . Then you 're going to tell him  --  MARY : No , indeed ! Not until I know that Mr. Simpson is here  --  here in Washington in this very house . ( Looking at the letter again . ) Oh dear ! It 's from Buffalo and it was dated day before yesterday . Oh ! What if it was a hoax ? What if he should n't come ? What if he 's been killed ? How can I bear it ? I know he wo n't come  --  It 's Thursday night now , and he has n't come . DE BOHUN : Suppose I should go to his brother 's office ? MARY : He would n't be there at this hour . No ! I must wait . DE BOHUN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man 's house . MARY : I do n't know where he lives . DE BOHUN : No matter ; I can stop at the hotel and get his address from the directory . I do n't remember his first name . MARY : I forgot to tell you . Elijah  --  Elijah L. Simpson . But I ca n't let you leave me now . Do n't go  --  DE BOHUN , kissing her : I 'll be back before you miss me . MARY : Before I miss you ? ( De Bohun runs out . ) He 's gone  --  and I did n't think to tell him he could find a directory at any druggist 's , without going to his hotel  --  Oh I know he 'll never come back ; why did I let him go ? I must be crazy  --  everyone in this house is crazy . Rushes out opposite door from De Bohun 's exit . SCENE II : Sellers lies on a sofa in the moment of waking from a heavy sleep , with Mrs. Sellers seated beside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubs his back . MRS . SELLERS : Does it hurt you , Mulberry ? Have you pain there ? SELLERS , crossly : Pain ? No ! Where is my extinguisher ? Who took off my extinguisher ? Do n't you understand , Polly , the risk we run every moment , without that extinguisher ? MRS . SELLERS : I 'll get it for you , dear . It 's just here at the foot of the sofa . We had to take it off when you were brought home . Ai n't you too faint , yet , to have it on ? SELLERS : Faint ? Brought home ? What do you mean ? MRS . SELLERS : Why , do n't you remember , dear , when you got out at the head of the temperance procession , to address the Sisters of Siloam just after you left the house , and had to be brought home in a hack ? Lafayette was with you , and the poor boy was almost distracted . If it had n't been for him , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support you from the start  --  we saw you from the window ! He says you must have poisoned yourself with some of the chemicals  --  SELLERS : Oh , my head ! MRS . SELLERS : Are you dizzy , yet ? SELLERS : No  --  no  --  MRS . SELLERS : He says you were wild and raving , and when you fell  --  SELLERS : Did I fall ? MRS . SELLERS : Yes . A few blocks away from the house  --  he called a hack and put you into it and brought you home . You seemed to be in a kind of heavy stupor , and you 've been dead asleep ever since . I never saw you so before . SELLERS , bowing his head upon his hands : No , thank goodness , you never did ! I was drunk , Polly . MRS . SELLERS : Drunk , Mulberry ? SELLERS : Drunk , my dear , hopelessly , fatally drunk  --  drunk , to my everlasting disgrace and ruin . Oh , take me away from this town , Polly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these grey hairs ! Oh , Polly . He sobs . MRS . SELLERS : Why , Mulberry , how came you  --  SELLERS : Oh , as no man ever did before . From my wish to serve the sacred cause which my fall has made a hissing and a by-word . From my desire to speak from sad experience  --  Oh ! How I could speak now ! And tell my hearers what deadly ruin lurked in the first glass . I borrowed Lafayette 's travelling flask of brandy  --  yes , I remember it all  --  and pursuing the idea from sip to sip , and from glass to glass  --  Oh Polly , Polly , Polly , what have I done to you and to poor Mary ? We have suffered poverty , before , my poor girl  --  we have suffered hunger and cold  --  there have been times when we had scarcely rags to cover us  --  trouble and sorrow I have brought upon you time and again , and you have borne it like an angel , my dear old wife  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , public shame ! MRS . SELLERS , kneeling before him by the sofa , and pulling his head down upon her shoulder : Oh , do n't you cry , do n't you cry ! Do n't you take on , Mulberry . I 'd like to hear anybody but you , say you had brought me to shame ! I 'd like to hear them ! What has the poverty , the hunger and cold been with you , you good , kind faithful heart ? All joy , joy ! And if I could bear shame for your sake , how happy I should be ! But there is no shame . You acted from the highest , noblest motive , and I judge you by your motives , dear  --  I do n't care what the deed is . I 'm a poor , weak , silly old woman , but I 'm your wife , Mulberry , and I feel that God lets me look at your heart as He does . ( Crying and kissing his head . ) There , there . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody noticed  --  SELLERS : Ah , do n't deceive yourself . The town will be ringing with it in the morning ; it will be in all the papers  --  MRS . SELLERS : No ; no ; Lafayette says there was nothing but sympathy expressed by the ladies , and all the little boys cheered as the hack drove away ! They gave it three cheers , Lafayette says  --  yes . There , put on your extinguisher , dear , and cheer up . ( Bustling about and helping him to get it on . ) There might be a fire-alarm any moment , and you 'd hate to miss it . Do n't take on any more . You need n't be afraid about the papers . There have been three reporters here to get the particulars ; but I 've sent them all away . Do n't you be troubled , Mulberry . ( She buckles the extinguisher around him , and he stands thoughtfully silent a moment . ) What is it , Berry , dear ? SELLERS , Footnote : 1Kb vehemently : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea ! An idea destined to convulse the universal frame of things ! MRS . SELLERS , apprehensively : Oh , what can it be ? SELLERS : Polly , do you know what has hitherto wholly invalidated and neutralized the efficiency of this extinguisher ? MRS . SELLERS : Why , I thought it was the difficulty of carrying a portable sandblast to put out the fire when the extinguisher had concentrated it . SELLERS : Folly , stuff , drivel , delirium ! MRS . SELLERS : What in the world can it be , then ? SELLERS : Simply , the want of fire-escapes to get at the fire on . Not one house in a thousand has them . MRS . SELLERS : Well ? SELEERS : Well , I now propose to abolish all fire escapes ! Abolish them ! Abolish is the word , Polly ! MRS . SELLERS : What in the world would you use in their place , Berry ? SELLERS : Wings ! My flying apparatus ! I 'm simply paralyzed that I should n't have thought of it before ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings to my shoulders , mount to the window of a burning house , and hover before it while I play the extinguisher upon the flames inside . Where are those wings , Polly ? ( Runs about , looking . ) Ah , here they are ! ( He drags out of a pile of rubbish , a pair of enormous wings , with the plumage considerably broken . ) Here , help me put them on . Hurry , my dear ! We ca n't afford to lose a moment 's time ! MRS . SELLERS : What are you going to do ? SELLERS : Do n't talk ! You 'll see , Polly ! Here , let me get my arms through those loops . ( Passes them through , and the wings are made fast . ) Now , then , my dear , open the window ! MRS . SELLERS : The window ? SELLERS : Yes . Quick ! I 'm going to fly out of it , and hover before it while I play the extinguisher into the room , here . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kill yourself . SELLERS : Nonsense ! When did you ever know me to kill myself ? Open the window , my dear . MRS . SELLERS : Oh , Berry , love , do n't try it ! I know you 'll get hurt . She pinions him with her arms , while he struggles to get at the window . SELLERS : I 'll open it myself , if you do n't . MRS . SELLERS : No , no ! Fly off of something low , first ! This table ; or a chair ! Clings about him . SELLERS : Well , well ; I must humor you , I suppose . Or no  --  wait ! I 'll fly onto the table . Get out of my way ! ( Working his wings and failing to rise . ) Why do n't you help me work them , Polly ? Do n't you see I 've got the wind dead against me ? They both exert themselves violently , she working the wings behind him . MRS . SELLERS : There , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the weight of the extinguisher . Never mind ! It 's better to fly from the table till I get some practice . Here , put the chair on it and give me a little more elevation . MRS . SELLERS , obeying : Oh , do you think you 'd better risk it , Berry ? SELLERS : What are you crying about ? It 's dead sure to succeed . I never saw such a discouraging woman ! It 's enough to take the heart out of any man . ( He mounts , while grumbling away ; and at last stands upright in the chair . ) There ! You see there 's no danger . Now I shall merely spread my wings , and hover about under the ceiling as an illustration . I expect to make this invention pleasant as well as useful . I shall get this flying apparatus in various sizes and styles ; ladies ' wings , children 's ; large , roomy , and comfortable pinions for elderly and timid per  --  It 's a triumphant success ! The principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Flapping them . ) Now just get out of the way , Polly , and I 'll throw myself forward  --  MRS . SELLERS : Wait , wait a minute , Mulberry ; I 've got something to tell you . SELLERS , faltering : What is it ? MRS . SELLERS : Something very important ! I almost forgot it in my excitement about you ! SELLERS , impatiently : Well , well ! What is it ? MRS . SELLERS : I 've got some good news for you  --  some news that will make your heart sing for joy . You know that gentleman you left with us ? SELLERS : Yes  --  our honored guest  --  what  --  MRS . SELLERS : Yes ! Well , do you know who he was , Mulberry ? Prepare yourself for a great surprise . SELLERS : Who he was ? MRS . SELLERS : Yes ! SELLERS : Why , he was Mr. De Bohun . Getting down from the chair . MRS . SELLERS : Yes ! SELLERS : Our twentieth or thirtieth cousin from England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SELLERS : Our fellow claimant for the Earldom of Dover . MRS . SELLERS : Yes ! SELLERS : Well ? MRS . SELLERS : Nothing more ? SELLERS : No , unless  --  unless you observed something peculiar about him  --  that he did n't eat any of the dried apples , or  --  MRS . SELLERS : He ate more than all of us put together ! SELLERS : He ate you say ? Ate dried apples ? More than all of you ? My goodness ! Then there 's a flaw in my calculations . I shall have to feed those fellows , and I did n't suppose they could eat ! I 'm out twenty or thirty millions a year . MRS . SELLERS : Why , what in the world are you talking about , Mulberry ? SELLERS : About our cousin De Bohun . Do you know who and what he is , Polly ? MRS . SELLERS : That 's what I was keeping  --  that 's what I was going to tell you . He 's the gentleman that saved our Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it would astonish you . Is n't it just like a theatre play ? And Mary 's so happy , poor thing ! And he 's just as happy as she is , and it 's all made up between them and they 're so fond of each other  --  I fill right up whenever I look at them ; it reminds me of our young days , Mulberry . SELLERS , utterly aghast : The gentleman who saved Mary 's life  --  and she 's so ha  --  happy  --  and it 's all  --  made  --  up  --  between  --  them  --  and he 's  --  just as  --  fond of  --  her  --  oh , my good gracious , where are they ? Stop it , I say ! Stop it ! Stop it ! This instant ! Rushing about and trying to get at the door . MRS . SELLERS , intercepting him : Stop it ? Why , Berry , are you crazy ? SELLERS : No , but you are ! If there 's anything in materialization , he 's a ghost ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night at the Tolliver House , and I materialized him this morning , do n't you remember , to find out about the American claim to the Earldom . Oh my goodness ! Oh , woman , woman ! Mary 's happy is she ? Happy with a spectre , in love with a miserable fraud of an apparition ! And that wretched , swindling dried-apple eating simulacrum is fond of her , hey ? Oh , that I should have lived to see my child 's affections placed upon  --  a  --  a  --  ma  --  materializee ! He bows his head upon his hands . MRS . SELLERS : But why did n't you tell me ? It all comes from your never telling me anything ! SELLERS : Tell you ? Did n't I tell you I was going to materialize him ? And did n't you run out of the room , scared to death when I began to work the materializer ? MRS . SELLERS : But why did n't you tell me you had done it ? He came into the dining room just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waist . SELLERS : Oh ! MRS . SELLERS : And she told me they were engaged  --  SELLERS : Ow ! MRS . SELLERS : And he stepped up and kissed me as natural  --  SELLERS : Ugh ! Where are they ? MRS . SELLERS : Why Mary 's in the kitchen , helping Aunt Sally with the supper and he  --  it  --  disappeared just after you were brought back . Said he was going to his hotel  --  SELLERS : Of course ! Saw that I had no power over him any longer . Disappeared  --  vanished ! Oh , why did I ever leave him for an instant ? MRS . SELLERS : He said he would come back to supper . SELLERS : Oh , of course , of course ! You 'll never see him again ! A likely story ! But I 'll have him here again , if there 's any virtue left in this materializer . I 'll have that fellow back if I have to pull him out of the bottomless pit . Where 's Lafayette ! Lafayette ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Here ! Look after these batteries , pile on the biggest current you can get , and think as hard as you can crack it on about De Bohun . I want him .

That battery can store enough electricity in these cells to materialize all the dead men since Adam . Why look here , major  --  SUCKERS : Suckers . SELLERS : Major Suckers . I can tell you personally  --  in straight confidence in your capacity as a gentleman  --  SUCKERS : Of course . SELLERS : That this is an assured thing . There 's nothing tentative , or experimental about it , any more . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertone . ) I materialized a spirit here this morning ! SUCKERS : No ! Writes . SELLERS : Yes , sir  --  a relation of mine . But , of course , I should n't wish the fact to go to the public . SUCKERS : Certainly not . Writes . SELLERS : I can refer you to Mrs. Sellers and my nephew , who both lunched with the materializee  --  we shall have to coin a new word for the new fact . SUCKERS : First-rate . Materializee is capital . ( Writes . ) Lunched with it , you say ? MRS . SELLERS : Yes , sir , on dried apples . We dine late , and make a light lunch at half past one . The materializee ate more than all of us put together . SELLERS : But these details are confidential  --  between gentlemen . SUCKERS , writing : Of course . Mr. Hawkins , present , you say ? SELLERS : Mr. Hawkins , and my daughter , also . The fact is , I do n't mind telling you , Doctor Suckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewer , that the materializee had saved my daughter 's life when on earth a few months ago ; and  --  it will add a pathetic interest to the narrative  --  for your ear alone , sir  --  SUCKERS , writing : Yes ! SELLERS : To know that the young people were engaged , and that the poor girl could not disabuse herself of the impression that the materializee was a bona-fide old style flesh and blood lover . But that I should n't wish to get into print , Captain . SUCKERS : Of course not . Writing . SELLERS : I have n't undeceived her , yet . She 'll be heart-broken when I do . Well , I 've no right to use names , but under the seal of secrecy , I do n't mind telling you , Colonel Suckers , that this materializee was no other than  --  SUCKERS , writes : No other than  --  SELLERS : Mr. Reginald De Bohun who lost his life in the Tolliver House fire last night . SUCKERS , writing : Is it possible ? SELLERS : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl of Dover ; and the title and estates have therefore lapsed to me ! My mother was a De Bohun . But , of course , these are family matters , and I would n't speak of them to everyone . SUCKERS , writing : I understand . Shall you do anything further with your materializer on this side , Colonel ? SELLERS : Nothing that I wish made public , sir . SUCKERS : Yes ? Writing . SELLERS : But I shall probably pass it over to my nephew , here , Judge Hawkins , of Hannibal , Missouri  --  HAWKINS : Oh , you really mus n't , Uncle Sellers ! SELLERS , waving him benignantly aside :  --  whom I have instructed in its use , and who will be able to carry out my ideas of supplying materializees for policemen , poets , congressmen , presidents , financiers , and the other functionaries in whom the degeneration of the human species has left us comparatively weak . But as yet , I say nothing about this . SUCKERS , writing : Yes . SELLERS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , and so I shall leave the business to Judge Hawkins , and simply put up a little amateur materializer in the cinque ports at Dover , to amuse my guests with . But these are private matters . SUCKERS , writing : I see . Well , now Colonel Sellers , I 'm extremely obliged to you for being so frank with me , and I 'll try not to abuse your confidence . Do you object to my asking you a few questions ? SELLERS : Certainly not . SUCKERS : What is your opinion , Colonel Sellers , as an English nobleman , of the prospect of American pork in Europe ? SELLERS : We are destined to supply the world with pork , sir . The opposition of Prince Bismarck to our pork will be fatal to the German Empire if he continues it . I gave some attention to this question a few months ago , when I was coming on with my family from Missouri , and I addressed a meeting of gentlemen in the smoking-car  --  some of the leading minds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German people will have American pork . I predicted then , and predict now that if the senseless and soulless opposition of Bismarck continues , we shall have a republic in Germany in less than sixty days ! SUCKERS : Shall you advocate these views in the House of Lords ? SELLERS : Unquestionably . American pork and the spread of American principles go hand in hand  --  the pig and the eagle are one and inseparable . SUCKERS : Colonel Sellers , in view of the fire of last night , do you wish to make any suggestion , as a philanthropist , concerning these too prevalent hotel disasters ? You know , sir , they have crippled , and well-nigh ruined some of the best insurance com  --  SELLERS , interrupting : They can stand it , sir  --  insurance companies can stand it perfectly . I suffer pangs , but not on their account . Ah , no  --  the thing that always distresses me about these hotel fires is that they invariably fall with such fatal certainty upon one particular class among us  --  I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUCKERS , aside : Caesar 's ghost , he 's in earnest ! I 'll get a couple of columns out of this lunatic . SELLERS : It always happens  --  always . Now there were five of them captured last night ; and they 're nice , good , industrious girls , every one of them  --  and one or two of them have made tolerably fair reputations , too . They had been living in cheap private boarding houses till yesterday ; but of course , yesterday , of all days in the year , they must pack up and go to that hotel  --  why they might have known , by the whole history of their race , that it would burn down . Poor things ! Why , do you know , between them they lost $160,000 worth of jewelry . SUCKERS , aside : He actually believes that ! Why , it 's the same old gang that 's always getting burnt out  --  if you let them tell it . The papers have a standing arrangement with them  --  always put them in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , $160,000 , and that 's not all . That 's only just what 's reported  --  thus far . Wait till the reports are all in . You 'll see . Why , sir , I have n't a doubt that there were as many as thirty-five actresses in that hotel last night  --  Why , they 're the very children of sorrow ; they flock to misfortune as to a feast . They flutter like moths to a burning hotel . You could n't any more have a hotel fire without burning out a battalion of actresses , than anything in the world . And they always lose their jewelry  --  they lose every button of it . They never put it in the hotel safe . They 're the carelessest creatures ! Misfortune ? Why they can smell it across the globe ! Why do you know , sir , actresses came from Europe  --  they came from Asia  --  they came from Africa  --  to get burnt out at the Chicago fire . Yes , sir , they did . They lost four hundred million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true  --  perfectly true  --  I saw the estimate myself  --  it was in the papers  --  and mind you , no guess work , it named every actress and the  --  the  --  the  --  cargo she lost  --  came right out and named them . In print , you know , in print , conspicuously . They tried to keep it out , but it got in , somehow . HAWKINS : Why did n't they sue the papers ? SELLERS : O , of course , they did threaten , but they had n't any money left , and so they had to let it go . It 's impossible for actresses to keep out of the papers to begin with , but to keep out of the papers and the fire both  --  SUCKERS : Thank you . Do you believe that a state church should be established in this country ? SELLERS : As an American citizen I do n't think it is adapted to the genius of our free institution ! As an English noble , I believe the established church should be established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international copyright treaty in the House of Lords ? SELLERS : No sir ! The American people demand cheap literature , and they shall have it if they have to steal it . Let the English authors look out for themselves . SUCKERS : As an American citizen do you favor the removal of the capital to St. Louis ? SELLERS : I do , sir . St. Louis is the political centre of the country , and will soon outstrip Chicago as the moral and religious centre . SUCKERS : Do you believe in the immortality of the soul ? SELLERS : Certainly ; I 'm practically interested in the immortality of the soul . What becomes of materialization without it ? SUCKERS : Thank you . I think you are homeopathists , you and your lady ? SELLERS : Oh , dear no ! We stick by the old practice . SUCKERS : As a scientist , sir , what position do you take regarding the spots on the sun ? SELLERS : Well sir , I have given the subject a great deal of attention and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively crude appliances of science . However , I do not mind stating to you , sir , in confidence , that I am working out in my mind a method which will  --  SUCKERS : Remove the spots ? SELLERS : Yes sir . SUCKERS : Stupendous ! ( Writes . ) What will be the effect ? SELLERS : By my method I could remove them entirely , if I chose , and then the effects would be sure and permanent ; but I shall also be able to retain the spots , and shift them from place to place on the sun 's disk at will  --  and this I shall doubtless do , because there is more money in it . SUCKERS : How ? SELLERS : It is the sun-spots , sir , that determine climate . It is their present position which makes Russia and the Arctic Circle frigid and the equator torrid . I can change all that . I shall establish a bureau and deal in climates . SUCKERS : You actually propose to sell climates  --  or hire them out ? SELLERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate it wants for cash . Explorers desiring it , shall make the northwest passage with no other baggage than a fig-leaf and a fan . SUCKERS : You are leading a noble life , Colonel Sellers . SELLERS : I am trying to do what good I can . SUCKERS : Thank you . ( Looking at his book . ) That is about all . Oh ! One thing more ! Are you , or are you not , the Colonel Sellers who was tried for embezzlement in Ohio , a few months ago , and was acquitted on the ground of kleptomania ? SELLERS : No , sir . SUCKERS : Ah , thanks . Well , now , Colonel Sellers , we always send a proof if possible to gentlemen who have been interviewed in The Standard-Post , but I shall not have time in your case . So I will read you what I propose to say . ( Reads . ) " Colonel Mulbery Sellers interviewed ! A harvest of thought ! Views of an extraordinary mind concerning religion , pork , materialization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future state , distribution of climate by private enterprise  --  and kindred subjects ! " SELLERS : Very good  --  very good indeed . SUCKERS , reading : " A report having been circulated that Colonel Mulberry Sellers , the eminent scientist , inventor and humanitarian , being overcome by emotion while riding at the head of a funeral procession , fell from his horse and was fatally injured , ( Dumb show of assent on the part of Sellers , and wondering surprise from his wife and Hawkins. ) one of our reporters was immediately dispatched to make inquiries , since two nations would be anxiously concerned  --  our own because of this great citizen 's fame and many-sided usefulness , and England because of his immediate heirship to her oldest and richest dukedom  --  ( Dumb show as before. ) and his near relationship to the royal family . ( Hawkins and Mrs. Sellers dumb show of going to protest  --  Sellers gestures them down . ) The two countries will be grateful to know that the report was greatly exaggerated , as our reporter was able to testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be confined to his mansion for a few days ; but a consultation of the best physicians has resulted in the decision that , thanks to the careful nursing which his Excellency is receiving at the hands of his devoted wife and charming daughter , there is every reason to hope for the best . In the course of an extended interview during which the Duke wore not only his fire-extinguisher but a magnificent pair of India rubber wings , fledged with rough feathers , constituting the flying apparatus in which he had just descended in safety from the top of the Washington Monument . His Grace expressed the opinion , founded upon statistics and careful observation , that our imposition of a 30 per cent duty upon foreign pictures will affect us disastrously , because it will limit native art to the production of pork  --  " SELLERS , with enthusiasm : It 'll do it as sure as guns . SUCKERS , reading : "  --  and at the same time Germany 's attitude toward pork will help on the disastrous effects in a double way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign market for American art , the closing of her galleries against pork must inevitably result in the precipitation of our country into monarchy and the erection of a nihilist republic upon the ruins of the German Empire . " SELLERS , excitedly : I 've foreseen it from the beginning ! SUCKERS : " Various matters were touched upon , during the interview  --  all of them of vast and vital importance to  --  ( Sellers is called out  --  reporter continues. ) such , for instance , as his scheme to reorganize the solar system , the shortening the orbits of comets , the addition of ten hours to the day , the bridging of the Atlantic  --  the annexation of the Milky Way  --  " ah , he 's gone . Well , no matter , I can add a few trifles at the office  --  an interviewer that ca n't add a few trifles do n't amount to anything . Sellers returns .

I shall take occasion to express my sense of your disinterested devotion , sir , in a note to the managing editor of The Standard-Post . ( Wringing the reporter 's hand . ) Hope to see you again . Call in when passing . Drop in of an evening and have a friendly cigar . ( Daniel approaches him with a card . Sellers glances at it , still keeping the reporter 's hand . ) Ah , this is opportune ! You mus n't go , my dear sir  --  you must remain . This is one of the most satisfactory moments of my life . The materializee is here in person ! Daniel , show the gentleman in . Do n't be surprised , sir , ( to the reporter ) at his sending in his card , first ; a gentleman is a gentleman always , dead or alive . ( De Bohun enters . ) Ah , my dear sir , I 'm delighted to see you again  --  delighted . Pressing his hand . DE BOHUN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sellers . I ought to apologize for being so slow in responding to your friendly summons . I stopped at my hotel to get an address from the directory just at the moment you telephoned for me , and I had another errand before I came . SELLERS : Do n't mention it . I ought to apologize to you for leaving you to-day ; but I was unavoidably called away . Mr. De Bohun , allow me to introduce you to Professor Suckers , one of our leading literary men  --  I may say the first literary man of our country  --  at present representing The Standard-Post  --  one of the proprietors of that flourishing journal , and one of our largest capitalists . ( De Bohun bows distantly ; the reporter makes notes of his personal appearance . ) My nephew , Chief-justice Hawkins , of Missouri , I think you 've met . DE BOHUN : Oh yes . ( Aside to Hawkins . ) Ah  --  er by the way , Mr. Justice  --  er  --  Hawkins , would you mind at all telling me what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HAWKINS , gravely : His flying apparatus . DE BOHUN : Oh  --  ah ! Thanks . ( Surveying Sellers ' wings . ) Most extraordinary ! Thanks ! HAWKINS : Not at all . DE BOHUN , to Mrs. Sellers in undertone : I really do n't know what to say to you in explanation of my delay ( approaches her ) but perhaps we had better leave that to your daughter  --  MRS . SELLERS , shrinking back : Oh , go away , go away ! Do n't touch me  --  do n't come near me ! You poor , dreadful , dreadful  --  SELLERS , shocked : My dear , my dear ! Remember ! Remember the claims of hospitality . This  --  materializee  --  if he will excuse the expression  --  is under our roof ; he is our guest  --  he has sat at our board , and partaken of our  --  our  --  simple luncheon . MRS . SELLERS : I ca n't help it , Mulberry ! If he touches me , I shall scream . Throughout this scene the reporter must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes of all that is said and done . AUNT SALLY , entering from room with Mary : Do n't you fret , don ' you worry any ! Marse De Bohun bound to come back . You jist ask your paw if he ai n't . MARY , catching sight of De Bohun in the corner into which he has shrunk after Mrs. Sellers ' rebuff : Oh , there he is ! There you are , my darling ! I have you again . Oh , ugh , ugh , ugh , oh , oh , ha , ha ! Laughing and crying , she runs up and flings herself into De Bohun 's arms . MRS . SELLERS , wildly : Mary ! Mulberry Sellers , will you stop that child ? SELLERS , aghast : Oh , you unhappy girl ! Come away ! Oh , poor , deluded child ! Mary  --  let go , I say ! Come away from it ! It is n't a man ! MARY , fiercely , coming forward : Not a man ! SELLERS : No , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rupert , Rupert , Rupert ! Oh , my love , my darling ! ( She drags him forward , wildly kissing and embracing him . ) If he is n't a man , then let me die ! If he is n't a man , then I wo n't give him for all the men alive ! SELLERS , shaken : Who  --  who are you , sir ? DE BOHUN , quietly : Rupert De Bohun . SELLERS : And you were , were you not , burned in the Tolliver House fire last night ? DE BOHUN : I was not . It was our poor cousin , Reginald De Bohun that the reports of the fire referred to . He was a cad , but I was sorry for him . I arrived in Washington this morning , and I 've spent the afternoon looking up his ashes , but it was impossible  --  SELLERS , blandly : To distinguish the different victims , I know . Do n't trouble yourself about that , sir . I 'll have all that attended to . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His will do just as well . I proposed in order to simplify the matter , and avoid any possible mistake to send all three of the victims home to the Earl of Dover . DE BOHUN : That was very thoughtful of you , Colonel Sellers ! But there seems to have been a mistake somewhere ; it appears from what the people tell me at the Tolliver House , that there were no lives lost in the fire last night . SELLERS : No lives lost ? DE BOHUN : No , and my cousin , whose end we 've been lamenting very sincerely , I 'm sure , has been confined to his room ever since dinner last night , from the effects of an American wine that he tested rather too thoroughly at dinner last night . SELLERS : And this cousin of ours who has been getting himself into the papers as if he were a popular actress , and putting me to so much trouble and expense for materialization , who was he ? DE BOHUN : The heir of Dover . SELLERS : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir if he were now an indistinguishable victim ? Footnote : 3Kb DE BOHUN : I 'm sorry to say that any one of five and twenty cousins in England  --  before either of us , my dear Colonel . SELLERS : Exactly so ! This is what I anticipated  --  this is what I foresaw from the start . It is utterly impossible for an American claimant to an English title to urge his right with any hope of success . Very well , then , we must for the present abandon the idea of the succession  --  and I must give my attention to some of these little experiments of mine . I 'm glad to have my mind free for the purpose . I suppose the materializer  --  may be considered as yet too elemental in conception . Perhaps the extinguisher would be the most practical thing . With a little capital  --  Uncle Daniel entering , gives name under breath . UNCLE DANIEL : Mr. Simpson . SELLERS : Simpson ? What Simpson ? Who 's Simpson ? I do n't know any Simpson  --  He ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , father  --  your agent for the cut-off . ( Rapturously . ) Oh ! He 's come , he 's come , I know he 's come . Send him in Dan'l , at once  --  yes  --  he 's here , father , and we 're saved . See ! See ! Here 's his letter that came this morning and which I 've just opened  --  He 's got the orders . SELLERS : Why , of course ! I see nothing so extraordinary in that  --  That was to be expected  --  I always knew that cut-off could be counted upon . ( Enter Simpson . ) Ah , my dear sir , I 'm glad to see you , powerful glad to see you . And you 've succeeded in getting the little list of orders , eh ? SIMPSON : Twice  --  three times  --  four times the number . I 've got two thousand orders . SELLERS , slowly : Very good  --  very good indeed , but quite within the limit of my expectations . SIMPSON : And that is not all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy boiler-maker who offers $100,000 for a 1/3 interest in the cut-off aud sends this certified check for the amount subject to your order if you accept . This with your remaining interest and royalties should insure you a steady income of not less than $20,000 per annum . SELLERS : Ah ! Indeed ! $20,000 per annum ! That is a moderate sum , but perhaps I had better accept . It will serve to assist in developing more important matters . Here , Mary , my dear , you take charge of this check . I think you and your mother may need something in the way of wardrobe  --  and my remaining income will be sufficient for experiments . Besides from what I have seen lately I fancy there may be occasion for some little extras by way of a traveling outfit for you , Mary , if this young gentleman is of the same mind he was this morning . Glances at De Bohun . MARY : Oh ! Father ! DE BOHUN : My dear Colonel and Mrs. Sellers ; it should need no ghost come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that theme . Were the Earldom mine , in fact , I would abandon it without a pang for the blessed privilege of standing here the accepted suitor of your daughter . SELLERS : All right , my boy , all right ! Take her and God bless you both . She 's worth a dozen earldoms . And , by the way , if you should care to settle in this country and devote yourself to business , I should like to call your attention to one of my inventions which you have already noticed , but whose full capacity you can not have comprehended . I allude to this little instrument . Footnote : 4Kb Pointing to phonograph . DE BOHUN : Yes , Colonel . I have every reason to he grateful to that achievement of science as your daughter will testify ; but pardon me , Colonel , if I do not seem to see what practical application can be made of it . In short , where is there any money in it ? SELLERS , deprecatingly : My friend  --  excuse me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't as yet seem to " catch on , " as we should remark in our current phraseology , with that alacrity which I could wish in a son-in-law . Practical application ! Money ! Why , my friend , there 's a mint of money in it . Do n't you understand ? That is my grand adaptation of the phonograph to the marine service . You store up profanity in it for use at sea . You know that sailors do n't fly around worth a cent unless you swear at them  --  so the mate that can do the best job of swearing is the most valuable man . In great emergencies his talent saves the ship . But the ship is a large thing , and he ca n't be everywhere at once ; so there have been times where one mate has lost a ship which could have been saved if they had had a hundred . Prodigious storms , you know . Well , a ship ca n't afford a hundred mates ; but she can afford a hundred cursing-phonographs , and distribute them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's armed at every point . Imagine a big storm , and a hundred of my machines all cursing away at once  --  splendid spectacle , splendid  --  you could n't hear yourself think . Ship goes through that storm perfectly serene  --  she 's just as safe as she 'd be in the harbor . HAWKINS : Yes , I see  --  I see exactly . How do you prepare the thing ? SELLERS : Load it  --  simply load it . HAWKINS : How ? SELLERS : Why , you just stand over it and swear into it . HAWKINS : And that loads it , does it ? SELLERS : Certainly  --  because every word it collars , it keeps  --  keeps it forever . Never wears out . Any time you turn the crank , out it 'll come . In times of great peril , you can reverse it , and it 'll swear backwards . That makes a sailor hump himself ! HAWKINS : Yes ! And who loads it  --  the mate ? SELLERS : Yes , if he chooses , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert for $75 a month who will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in 150 hours , and do it easy . And an expert can furnish a stronger article , of course , than the mere average uncultivated mate can . Then you see all the ships of the world will buy them ready loaded  --  for I shall have them loaded in any language a customer wants . Lafayette , it will work the grandest moral reform of the 19th century . Five years from now , all the swearing will be done by machinery  --  on a ship . Lafayette , millions of dollars have been spent by the churches , in the effort to abolish profanity in the commercial marine . Lafayette , now think of it  --  my name will live forever in the affections of good men as the man , who , solitary and alone , accomplished this noble and elevating reform . HAWKINS : You 're right , Colonel . There is no two ways about that . How did you ever come to think of it ? So simple , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A mere trifle ! The simplest toy ! And yet it is complete in its result ! If you want to load it up loud and strong , you stand right over it and shout . But if you leave it open , and all set , it 'll eavesdrop , so to speak  --  that is to say , it will load itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it . Now I 'll show you how it works . I had an expert come and load this one up , yesterday . ( Goes to it . ) Hello , it 's been left open  --  it 's too bad  --  still I reckon it has n't had much chance to collect irrelevant stuff . All you do is to turn the crank  --  so . ( Turns it . Phonograph in a plaintive voice . ) " A watcher sick and weary Looks forth with anxious eye . " ( Pink trip slip . The wind waiting by . Stops turning . ) Hang it , that ai n't it . Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turns crank . PHONOGRAPH , plaintive voice again , mingled with a low , gradually rising wail of cats slowly warming up towards a fight : " Are we almost there , Are we almost there , Said a dying girl as she drew near  --  " meow , meow , pfst , meow , meow , meow ! " Scat you devils "  --  ( And a rocket of flying missiles. ) bang  --  bang  --  bang  --  Stops crank . SELLERS : Well never mind  --  let it go . I 've got some sailor profanity down in there somewhere , if I could get to it . But it is n't any matter ; you see how the machine works . HAWKINS , with enthusiasm : Works ! It 's a miracle ! I know there 's a hundred fortunes in it . SELLERS : And mind , the Hawkins family get their share , Lafayette . HAWKINS : Ah ! It 's the grandest invention of the age , of all the ages . SELLERS : Now do you begin to see any money in it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DE BOHUN : It certainly is very interesting . HAWKINS : Colonel , if Mr. De Bohun does not care to undertake the management of this great discovery , perhaps you would allow me a small interest in it . SELLERS : Interest ? Why , my boy , take it all . I have other great matters at stake  --  and ca n't devote myself to it  --  Why Lafayette , I expect to see you rolling in wealth inside of a year . The only thing I ask is that my name shall always be prominent in the grand moral reform which this machine is sure to produce . HAWKINS : Oh ! Thank you , thank you  --  a thousand times I thank you , Colonel . DE BOHUN : And Colonel would you mind allowing me as your son-in-law to devote my time to the development of your remaining interest in the cut-off ? I have a mechanical turn of mind and fancy I could greatly increase the value of your property . SELLERS : Of course , of course  --  I shall be delighted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it I guess you 'll find it pleasanter than hanging round waiting for dead men 's shoes  --  for after all what is an English earldom  --  a petty fragment of an effete monarchy compared to the glorious freedom of an American Citizen . Aunt Sally , bring me that striped banner , that beautiful emblem of our country .
