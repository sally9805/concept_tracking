txt The Briggs ease is still on , and the Presbyterian General Assenibly proposes to gain time by night sessions . The lines in the appeal case are being drawn more closely , and men who have no sympathy with the views of Dr. Briggs are joining in opposition to the resolute effort of some to force the case through the Assembly . When such men as Elder Junken and Dr. join together in an avowed attempt to conserve the constitutional rights of the individual , the union is significant . There is an effort on foot to proceed with the case to an end . This was evidenced by the remark of a prominent Commissioner . " We want to decide this case and set this man adrift in the wilderness . " With others there is a conviction that the Assembly is going too fast and making precedents with too much speed and without sufficient deliberation . A column of red roses was placed to-day upon the desk occupied by Dr. Briggs . The column was surmounted by a white dove with outspread wings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed to receive a report of the Standing Committee on Church Extension , because of the necessary departure of Dr. White , its Secretary . The total income of the committee amounted to $100.000 and the expenditures to $102,000 . Aid was granted to 292 churches and 44 manses . The report was accepted without debate . The Assembly was then constructed as a court by the Moderator . A resolution was introduced by Judge Struvell of Montana looking to the return of the Briggs case to the Presbytery of New-York . Amendments were offered slightly modifying this proposition , but with the same object in view . The parties were allowed to withdraw in order to prepare a form of action which should be mutually acceptable , and while they were consulting , the reading of a report on the revision of the Confession of Faith was begun . Just before closing the reading of the revision report the parties to the appeal returned from their consultation . The revision then went over again as unfinished business . Judge Stiltveil stated that there had been no agreement reached , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected to make known the will of the committee . " On Nov. 4 , " Mr. McCook said , " it was urged by me that we should then proceed to the trial . The Presbytery did not see fit to accept the proposition , but made a decision from which vse have appealed . We are prepared to argue the appeal . and we can do it in fifteen minutes , fifteen hours , or fifteen days . The Assembly has relieved us of all questions concerning the past . If you say ' Drop the case , ' we shall gladly do it , but we stand here now prepared to go on . The responsibility must be with the Assembly . We ca n't accept the proposal to return and begin the ease in New-York , de novo . This might be interpreted to mean new charges and specifications , whereas we desire only the privilege of amending former papers , if thought necessary . " Another suggestion is that the Presbytery be directed to try the case fairly . This suggestion we most vigorously deprecate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Prosecution refused to agree to the proposition suggested and to allow the ease to go batik at once to New-York , the Assembly proceed to hear the appeal . The question was whether the appeal should be sustained in part , or in full , 9r pro forma , after which it was in the discretion of the Assembly to reverse or modify the judgment of the inferiorjudicatory if errors were round , or to remand the case for a new trial . It was evidently desired by a very large part of the house that the case be remanded , but this was thwarted by the refusal of the prosecutors to consent . The proposition to sustain the appeal pro forma elicited a vigorous negative headshaking by Dr. Birch . Mr. McCook said that the question was a dismissal or a full sustaining of the appeal ; pro forma action was not desired . A mandatory order for the reception of delegates from other denominations temporarily postponed the case of appeal . Dr. Chambers of the Reformed Church and Dr. Gay of the Waldenelan Church occupied the time until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birch was reading his paper supporting the appeal and quoting certain words uttered by members of the Presbytery of New-York at the Briggs trial when a commissioner raised the point of order : " That it is improper to read these extracts . lest some commissioners here present may be thereby influenced . " At the same session Elder Junken of Philadelphia offered a resolution to bring matters before the ( weft to a close . Ho proposed to reverse the decision of the Presbytery , send back the papers , and direct the Presbytery of New-York to try the ease upon its merits without prejudice to either party . Be declared that the , assembly could not try the case at this session upon its merits . The action of the Presbytery had been unjust to the de ? fendaut ; he should have had an opportnpity to stand before his people and assert and prove his innocence of the charges . Dr. of Chicago seconded the resolution . He said lie understood Dr. Briggs would confess judgment upon two of the grounds of the appeal . Those would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . If the assembly received the appeal when no isles was entered in the lower court or no sworn testimony hoard , it would invalidate the rights of every member of the Church . and these were , higher than those of any individual . After a brief argument Dr. Briggs stated that he would personally be willing to confess judgment upon two points in the appeal . and would do so after consultation with members of the Presbytery . Col. McCook stated the appeal must be sustained , the decision of the Presbytery reversed , and the Presbytery directed to try the case on its merits . On these grounds the Prosecution Committee would be glad to accept the proposal . Upon the return of the conferees Dr. Briggs stated he agreed to Junkens 's resolution , but objection was entered by the Prosecuting Committee , and the Moderator ruled that the case must proceed . Then Dr. Birch went over the grounds of the appeal and specification thereunder . When the reading was concluded , Dr. Briggs was heard for an hour in rebuttal , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
