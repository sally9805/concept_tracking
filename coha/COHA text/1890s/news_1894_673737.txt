txt The rumor that a new twelve-story hotel would soon be built at the northwest corner of Madison Avenue and Forty-second Street was confirmed yesterday by Hawk &; Wetherbee , the proprietors of the Windsor Hotel . " lire decided some time ago , " said Mr. Wetherbee to a reporter for The New-York Times yesterday afternoon , " to build a hotel on that site , which we now own . It is , in our opinion , an exceptionally good location for a first-class transient hotel , and it will be run in connection with the Windsor . " The new house will be as magnificent as any in the city . The architect is Henry J. Hardenberg , who planned the Waldorf for W. W. Astor and is designing the new hotel for John Jacob Astor . We have employed as builders Marc Eidlitz &; Sons , who are now building the new Clearing House . " In some respects the new hotel will be quite different from others in the city . The caf ? on the ground floor will be a novelty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon from the regular bill of fare , or a quick luncheon at a large counter . They can spend a while over their cigars , if they wish , in a smoking and reading room which will embrace all the comfoi-ts of a well-conducted club . The restaurant proper will be a conspicuous feature of the hotel , being 116 feet in length and 85 feet wide . Besides this , on the parlor floor there will be a richly-appointed dining room for the regular guests of the house . In connection with this there will be a special parlor where , after dinner , guests may sit , have their coffee and cigars , and listen to the music . " The first three floors , counting the ground floor , will be so constructed as to afford perfect light and ventilation , giving the impression of height and open space instead of being cut up and divided by numerous walls and partitions . " The hotel will have wide halls , well lighted , so that it will not be necessary to use electric light during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrooms , which in every case have a window opening to the air . " The hotel will be absolutely fire-proof . In addition to the service stairways , there will be two wide stairways from top to bottom for the use of guests . We think that with our long experience in the hotel business we will start in this venture in the right way at the beginning and produce what we hope will be an example of perfection in a modern hotel building . We will begin work at an early date . " Another magnificent ? edifice of a semipublic character that will shortly be built is the proposed Young Men 's Christian Association Building , in Fifty-sixth Street , between Eighth and Ninth Avenues . It will have frontages on Fifty-sixth and Fiftyseventh Streets of seventy-five feet each . Work will be begun in May on the structure , which will cost half a million dollars , and it is expected that it will be ready for occupancy in the Fall of 1896 . The Building Committee is composed of Cleveland H. Dodge , Cornelius Vanderbilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fellowes Morgan . An officer of the Young Men 's Christian Association at Twenty-third Street and Fourth Avenue told a reporter for The New-York Times yesterday that the present building was inadequate for its purposes . The up-town site , he said , was purchased recently from the Hegeman estate for $165 , - 000 . This money was made up from $140,000 bequeathed by the late William H. Vanderbilt and $25,000 presented by Cornelius Vanderbilt . The new building will be six stories high , with the main entrance in Fifty-seventh Street . The reception room , two parlors , reading room , and lecture ha/1 will be on the main floor . In the basement will be the bowling alleys , a swimming tank , sixteen by forty feet , baths , shower baths , bicycle room , and lockers . On the first floor will be the reception room and gymnasium of the boys ' department . On the second floor will be the main hall , which will seat 604 persons . On the third and fourth floors will be studios and class rooms ; on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room , and kitchen . The gymnasium will occupy the top floor . The greater part of the 83,000 volumes of the library will be moved to the new building from the Twenty-third Street building , which will be kept open as a down-town branch .
