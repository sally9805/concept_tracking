BY GEORGE W. SMALLEY . I. AS this paper concerns itself with journalism , and will , I presume , be more likely to interest journalists than the general public , I hope it may be understood as addressed mainly to my colleagues in that profession , and that they will be indulgent if I am obliged to refer to myself and to my own share in the episodes I have to narrate . Besides , most of it relates to a rather distant past . I must go back to November , 1861 , and shall not come down much later than 1870 . The two dates will sufficiently indicate that my story relates to the journalistic history of two wars : the early part of the civil war in America , and the be , innin* , s of the great war between France and Germany . I avoid entering into military details or fighting old battles over again . What I shall attempt is to give some brief notion of what a war correspondent 's life was like , and how he collected and transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing editor of the Tribune , with Mr. Sydney Howard Gay as his first lieutenant . Mr. Horace Greeley was , of course , editor-in-chief , but with him the younger men on the paper came little into contact . If you were outside the office , in the field , you were not absolutely obliged to know of his existence . Any reminder of it was apt to come in the shape of a criticism , always useful to the beginner . Mr. Dana had the reputation of a masterful manager . I can only say that I found him , so long as lie remained on the paper , considerate , helpful , just , and even friendly , though he knew that the door by which I entered the office had been opened by Wendell Phillips , for whom he had none too much liking . New as I was to journalism , Mr. Dana gave me a free hand . There is nothing which is more likely to bring out of a man the best there is in him . He understood journalism and he understood human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it , a happy circumstance that I learned my first lessons in journalism under a chief who , being himself at the head of his profession , found time to show much kindness to a subordinate whose foot was on the lowest round of the ladder . In one sense it may almost be said that the history of war correspondence , as it is now understood , begins with the rebellion ; by which I mean that modern methods were then first applied , and that the transmission of war news was undertaken for the first time in extenso by telegraph . The truth of this will come out the more plainly when it is seen what was done in Europe in 1870 , and how it was done . My experiences in journalism began with the war , or , rather , began in November , 1861 , with a trip to South Carolina , of which the main object was to look into the negro question a little . The gallant Admiral Dupont had taken Port Royal , troops had been landed there , a military post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler had announced in Maryland the doctrine of contraband , which so impressed itself on the public mind that , for the next year or so , the blacks went by the name of contrabands . The war was of course still a war for the Union and not for freedom , but the pressure of the negro question grew daily heavier . I staid in Port Royal , or in that part of the country , until the spring of 1862 ; returned to New York , and was sent to join General Fremont in Virginia , and made the Shenandoah Valley campaign with him . Then I saw part of the ill-fated enterprise of General Pope on the Rappahannock , ending in the second defeat at Centreville and a second peril to Washington . Finally I rode out of Washington one afternoon to have a look at the army of which General McClellan had again taken command in Auoust , 1862 . Expecting to be away overnight , I took with me as luggage a tooth-brush and a mackintosh . I was gone six weeks , and saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The presence of correspondents with the army had been forbidden by Secretary Stanton and General Halleck , but of course there never was a time when they were really excluded , or never a very long time . General Pope sent for me one evening to his headquarters-by that time in a tent , and no longer , as he // too rashly announced at the beginning , in the saddle  --  and told me in his friendly way that lie had received a peremptory order from the War Office to allow no correspondents to remain in his camp . I said I would leave at once , to which he replied , " I do n't see that you need go till you get the order , " adding that he had not made up his mind whether or when to issue it . But he did issue it , and we were all supposed to obey . At Washington , when it was known that McClellan was once more in command , some of us thought it discreet , considering his known dislike to the publication of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied , to drop the journalist and join some friendly headquarters as volunteer aides-de-camp . General Sedgwick , the good soldier who was killed at Spottsylvania , offered me an appointment , or rather an opportunity , which I gladly accepted . He advised me to put on some sort of uniform , which mi glit prevent inconvenient questions being asked . The army moved forward sooner than was expected , and havin* once joined General Sedgwick , I had no time to turn back nor any wish to . We all knew that the position was such as must before long compel McClellan , the most unready of commanders , to measure himself again with Lee . And so it was that on a sunny September afternoon , the 15th , I found myself looking across the valley through which flowed the Antietam Brook , to the heights of Sharpsburg , crowned with the Confederate forces . Nobody called them Confederates in those days . Rebels , or , for short , Rebs , was all that a Northern soldier 's lips could shape themselves to utter . General McClellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to allow the enemy to collect his force* . On the afternoon of the 16th I heard that General Hooker , " Fighting Joe , " had been ordered across the creek to turn the enemy 's left . I did not know General Hooker nor anybody on his staff , but I thought I might as well go along , and I went . Nobody seemed to mind . I rode with the staff , and was asked no questions . General Hooker , never lacking in resolution , pushed a regiment or two of cavalry straight forward as far as they could go , and went with them . That was his idea of a reconnoissance . FolVOL . LxxxIx. - No. 531-46 lowing with the staff , we all had the pleasure of learning , a few minutes later , what a cavalry stampede to the rear was like , and of taking part in it . But Hooker was in great glee . He had found out what he wanted to know , and had ascertained pretty well where the enemy were . The night was drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close as it could well be to the opposite lines , found a barn to serve as headquarters for the night , and turned in . Most of us slept outside . I had no servant with me , and slept with my horse 's bridle round one arm . By five next morning the battle of Antietam began . By nine , Hooker had been driven back , and sent for more troops . Mansfield came , and Sumner came , and Hooker himself , with what was left of his divisions , again went forward . It was his way to keep well to the front , too far forward , no doubt , and one result of these tactics was that most of his staff were presently killed or wounded . There came a moment when not one was near him , not even an orderly . They were down or away on duty . He looked rather sharply at me , and asked me who I was . I told him . " Will you take an order for mel " and without waiting for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and order them forward . Then he stopped me . " Order every regiment you can find to advance . It is time to end this business . " I went off on this errand , and when I rejoined Hooker he was in the thick of what looked a pretty hot fight . Almost immediately a bullet struck him in the foot . He had to be helped from his horse , taken to the rear on an extemporized ambulance , and finally to quit the battlefield altogether . With his departure the attack on the Confederate left died suddenly away , and was never renewed to much purpose . During this lull in the battle , which nobody could believe to be the end of it occurred an incident which even at this distance of time I narrate with some hesitation . But it throws light on General McClellan 's character , on the opinion held of him by his own staff , on the state of discipline in the Northern armya* *his time , and on the extreme looseness of a military organization in which such an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall neither mention any name nor iiidicate // in any way the identity of the officer chiefly concerned . When it became evident that the attack on the Rebel left had been repulsed , and that the fightin* , in that part of the field was over for the time , I rode back across the creek in the direction of General McClellan s headquarters . It was expected he would order forward his reserves under General Fitz John Porter , but lie did not . Precious minutes and priceless hours ebbed away and nothing was done . I was looking about for a remount , as my horse had a couple of bullets in him and could not be depended on , when an officer on General McClellan 's staff whom I knew detached himself from the group at a little distance and came over to me . He said : " I hear you were with Hooker when he was wounded ? " " Yes . " " Do you know whether he is disabled ? " I said that he had been hit hard , could not sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance ; since then I had not seen him . " Do you know where he is ? " " Yes ; at a red farm-house in an open field on the right , this side of the creek . " " Will you take a message to him ? " By this time I began to think the interrogatory both curious and serious , and I answered , " That depends on what the message is . My friend and I were by ourselves , well out of ear-shot of the staff , but within view , and I saw that the staff or some of them were watching what went on . He came a little closer , lowered his voice , and said : " Most of us think that this battle is only half fought and half won . There is still time to finish it . But McClellan will do no more . What I want you to do is to see Hooker , find out whether he can mount his horse , and if he can , ask him whether he will take command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to surrender . " It was perhaps the most astounding request ever made by a soldier to a civilian . What he suggested was nothing less than an *ct of mutiny in the face of the enemy , and I told him so . " I know that as well as you do , " was the answer . " We all know it , but we know also that it is the only way to crush Lee and end the rebellion and save the country . " I pointed out that if Hooker were to be approached on such a subject , it ought to be by him or by one of his comrades in the plot -- for it was a plot  --  and that , if they meant business , they ought to be ready to take the risk . I added that I thought it more than likely that General Hooker 's answer to such a proposal would be to order the man who made it , whoever he was , under arrest . " It need not be a proposal , " he replied . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us know what his views are . The rest we will do ourselves . " I asked him if he meant to give me a written message . " Certainly not . Such things are not put into writing . " " But why should Hooker believe me , or compromise himself in a conversation with a man he never saw till this morn-ing ? " He said it was known I had acted as Hooker 's aide , and urged sundry other reasons . I still declined , but he still press . ed it . Hooker , he declared , had won the confidence of the army , and McClellan had lost it . It was no time to stand on trifles . He regarded what he proposed to me as a patriotic duty , and so on . Finally , as I persisted in refusing to be the bearer of any such message , he asked if I would see Hooker , and bring them word whether he could , in any circumstances , take the field again that day . To this I saw no objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , and in great pain . He asked eagerly for news of the battle . When I told him that the attack on both wings had failed , that no movement had been made for the last two hours , and that General McClellan seemed to have no intention of making any , he became angry and excited , and used language of extreme plainness . I had noticed in the morning that he had a very copious vocabulary . It was directed , for the most part , against the enemy , whose sharpshooters followed him all over the field , in which his tall figure in full uniform , and his white horse , were by far the most conspicuous targets . Once his staff got the benefit of this flow of energetic speech , when two or three of them joined in the suggestion that the proper place for a corps commander was not in the skirmish line , and that he could not prudently re // main under so hot a fire . Now it was turned upon McClellan , with whose excessive caution and systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no patience . This outburst gave me an opportunity of putting the question I wanted to , and I asked him whether his wound would permit him to mount his horse again that day . He pointed to his swollen and bandaged foot . " No ; it is impossible . " " Or to take command of your corps again in any way-in a carriage , if one could be found ? " " No , no ; I can not move . I am perfectly helpless . " All at once , whether from the way in which I had put my question , or from my manner , it seemed to flash upon him that there was something behind , He broke out : " Why do you ask ? What do you mean ? Who sent you here ? " He was in such torment from his wound and the fever it had brought on that I thought it best not to fence with his questions and his suspicions . I told him it was true that some friends of his who knew how well he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether , in an emergency , lie could resume his duties ; that the position was critical ; that his troops would fight under him as they would under nobody else ; in short , I admitted that I came to find out what his real condition was , and that I thought a good deal depended on his answer . He groaned . and swore and half raised himself on his bed . The effort was too much ; the agony brought a cry to his lips : " You see what a wreck I am ; it is impossible , impossible . " Even to his courage there were things which were impossible . Again he asked from whom I came , but I answered that my errand was done , that it was only too plain that his wound crippled him , that the whole army knew what a misfortune it was , and that I must return to my friends and report the facts . The paroxysm of pain had passed , but left him exhausted . He said good-by faintly , asked me to come again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I took my leave . The account I had to give of General Hooker 's condition of course put an end to all schemes at headquarters , and the sun went down upon an indecisive day . General McClellan 's irresolutioa on that memorable afternoon was to cost the country treasure and blood that might have been spared ; but it was decreed that the fight should be fought out once for all , and Destiny chooses her own ways and instruments . There is a sequel , almost a counterpart , to this story , but it comes later . After General Burnside 's failure on the left and General Franklin 's check on the right there was no more serious fighting that day . It was supposed that General McClellan must renew the attack next morning . After what I had heard I did not believe he would , and I determined to try at once to get an account of the battle through to New York . To send one by a messenger involved , first , a delay while it was being written , and secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted . I had a colleague with me , but there were reasons why he could not be sent . Then , and ever after , I found it sound policy to start either for the office or for the nearest telegraph office as soon as an important battle was over . Some men had to be seen first and some arrangements made in the event of further fighting ; and there was the question of dinner , not unimportant to a man who had been mostly in the saddle since five that morning , with no time to think of food . It was nine o'clock in the evening when I got away . Frederick was the nearest town where one might reasonably hope to get a long despatch on the wires and Frederick was thirty miles distant , and the horse I had borrowed was anything but fresh . There was a good road , and a good chance of encountering some of those parties of stragglers and marauders who are always hanging on the rear of an army ; not , I think , much real danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight of the 18th , and found my way to the telegraph office . The clerk on duty said he would take a short despatch , but that the wires , like everything else , were in the hands of the military authorities , and he would not undertake to say when the despatch would reach New York , or that it would ever get there at all . They were times when you had to take all chances . I sat in the office and wrote a despatch of rather more than a column , handing it in to the clerk in sections . The length made it , to his mind , still more doubtful whether it would be forwarded , but he was good-natured and promised to do his best . I heard af // terward that it had been wired straight to the War Office in Washington , and was the first narrative of the battle which reached the Secretary of War , except a brief despatch from General McClellan announcing his victory . Mr. Secretary Stanton took it to President Lincoln , who , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomely , however , and allowed it to go on to the office in New York , and it appeared in the Tribune on Saturday morning . The battle had been fought on Thursday . Meantime , having much more to say and no chance of saying it by telegraph from Frederick , I was trying to get a special train to Baltimore . The railroad , like the telegraph , had become a military possession , and there was no one who could , or would , take the responsibility of sending off a train . Money was no temptation , as it would have been to the railroad people . The best I could do was to get a military permit to go by the first military train . I went to the station to make sure of not missing it , and sat on a log and wrote . About two the train started . I thought I should have time between Frederick and Baltimore to finish my story of the battle , but once in the train I went to sleep . It was nearly thirty-six hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to be fatiguing . It is doubtful whether I should have fared better at the telegraph office in Baltimore than in Frederick if I had had a despatch ready . As it was not ready , I stepped into the New York express , which we just caught . The New York express in those days was lighted by a small oil lamp at each end of the car . Sitting , it was impossible to see . I stood under the lamp and wrote most of the night , finishing , I think , about midway between Philadelphia and New York . The editor had been notified that an account might be expected too late for the regular morning edition . When I walked into the office it was near five o'clock Saturday morning . Antietam was perhaps the greatest battle which had then been fought , and the first great victory which the North had won ; not a complete victory , but a victory , inasmuch as Lee withdrew across the Potomac into Virginia . There was , naturally , a great interest in the event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive ; the composing-room crowded ; the presses manned and waiting . Not long after six a second edition appeared , with a letter on Antietam about six columns long . It was , I imagine , one of the worst pieces of manuscript which had ever puzzled the intelligent type-setter and proof - reader ; the whole of it in pencil , and most of it written in the train . Mr. Gay , the kindly and cultured man of letters who had become managing editor in the spring in succession to Mr. Dana , asked me if I should be ready to return by the afternoon train . I said yes , and went ; but my return visit to the army proved to be a short one , as within a few weeks Mr. Gay proposed to me to enter the office as an editorial writer , and this I did . II . Four years later , in 1866 , I went to Europe to see the Austro - Prussian war . That journey shows the difference between pre-cable days and the present . The news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took the Wednesday steamship from Bostonthen the only American port of the Cunard line  --  and on reaching Queenstown heard the news of the battle of Sadowa , which practically ended the war . There was no more fighting , and no occasion for war correspondence . My instructions , however , went beyond the war . Mr. John Russell Young had by this time become managing editor of the Tribune ; a journalist of genius . Mr. Young thought that much remained to be done in the illuropenn field . He was not satisfied with the existing supply of European news , even in peace time . He wanted better news and more correspondence . Another experiment toward an Atlantic telegraph cable was then making , and he wished to be in a position to avail himself of it , should it succeed , during the next European crisis . Under his instructions I arranged for both . The Tribune bureau was set up in London , which grew out of the notion that the collection and transmission of European news must be done in Europe and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of Europe , and that an office for the handling of news ought to be established there . This theory is now universally accepted and acted , on . Many of the foremost American papers have their London offices . A great many more have correspondents in London who have been sent thither for the purpose , and are maintained there by the journals ( // they represent . But in 1866 this theory was very far from being generally accepted . It was generally scouted . It was ridiculed as a waste of money and useless to the journal . It put a considerable responsibility on the correspondent in charge of the London bureau . He was , of course , subject to New York , and took his orders from the New York office ; but it was seen that no such service could be performed efficiently unless the power intrusted to the representative abroad were commensurate with his responsibility . He must have , and did have , a certain degree of independence . The details , the organization , had to be left in his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New York to say how much news and what kind of news was wanted , and how much money was to be spent . It was for London to act on these general instructions , to select correspondents , to regulate the collection and transmission of news , to be ready to arrange a special service at a moment 's notice . The London delegate was to put himself in a position analogous to that of the manager of a London newspaper ; to make contracts and conditional engagements long in advance ; to know all that could be known about European telegraphs and steamships and railways and news agencies , and much else . He was so to order the affairs of the London office that the receipt of an instruction from New York should set in motion all these pent-up energies , just as the receipt of the " Krieg Mobil " from Berlin bya local commander set the German legions rolling towards the French frontier . These are now the commonplaces of journalism , and the great news-collecting agencies of America have long acted on them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1866 to 1870 the truths now so obvious remained a sealed book . No other journal during that period followed the example of the Tribune . No other bureau was founded . In 1866 I had visited other European capitals to make such arrangements as were then thought necessary , had returned to London , chosen a man to take charge of the bureau there , set up and started the new machinery , and then returned to New York . I had been to Berlin to see the Berlin and Potsdam garrisons come home in triumph from the Austrian war , had seen Count Bismarck , as he then was , heard from him his story of the events that led to the war in which he had been the mainspring , and written a very incomplete account of that ever-memorable visit , which may some day be completed . Meantime the cable had been successfully laid , and I had sent , I believe , the first news message which went to New York by cable , relating to that check in the negotiations for peace which had for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and threatened a renewal of hostilities . It was November when I went home and re-entered the office . In the spring of 1867 I again came abroad , this time to take charge of the London office for three years . Down to July , 1870 , the existence of the office furnished frequent material to the American press for disparaging comment . Such work as it did was done very quietly , and the visible result was not , to the minds of most American journalists , sufficient to justify its existence . It had to wait for its chance , and the chance came in July , 1870 . Nobody has forgotten how sudden was the outbreak of the Franco-German war . Lord Hammond had declared a fortnight before that there was not a cloud in the European sky , and Lord Hammond was the permanent chief of the English Foreign Office . Journalism was as far astray as diplomacy . Mr. Delane , who then reigned and ruled in Printing House Square , was convinced that the peace of Europe would not be broken that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him dear . There was nothing to show that New York saw any farther than London into the near future . The declaration of war took the world by surprise , Paris and Berlin perhaps excepted . Everywhere else the unreadiness was complete , and nowhere more so than in the great newspaper offices of Europe and America . The Tribune , which had by that time established itself comfortably in Pall Mall , was , so far as I can remember , no better informed of what was coming than any other journal . The difference between our position and others was simply that , when the war cloud broke , we were ready and others were not . After waiting a day or two to hear from New York and getting no message , I cabled Mr. Whitelaw Reid , who had succeeded Mr. Young as managing editor , for instructions . The answer // came quickly enough , and contained an assurance that war news would be welcome . But where to get it ? Mobilization had begun , and troops were in motion on both sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all in Berlin3 to take the press into the confidence of the headquarters ' staff . It became plain at Once that even to obtain passes for correspondents would be no easy matter . The first application brought a peremptory refusal . It was thought that British officers might have a better chance of getting into relations with the German staff than civilians . The same idea occurred naturally to the English papers , but when the Times asked that leave should be granted a certain well-known officer , the War Office said n* . He then came to us with an offer of his services if leave could be obtained . Mr. Cardwell was Secretary of State for War , and to him I went , armed with what I thought , and what was in fact , a very strong letter from an eminent personage who , both by his position and by his personal relations with Mr. Cardwell , was entitled to be heard , to say the least . Mr. Cardwell was good enough to see me and to listen to what I had to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not know that we have already refused the Times , on the ground that an officer on leave would still be an officer , and that we should be responsible for him , and that we do not choose to be responsible for what may appear in an English newspaper ? " I said yes , but suggested that the objection might have less force with reference to an American newspaper ; that we were so far off , and news would be so long in coming back , that no harm was likely to be done , and that , in any case , nobody would think of a connection between the War Office and a New York newspaper . " It can not be done , " was the brief answer . I saw I was expected to accept it as final , but , as a last card , I mentioned the name of the writer of my letter of introduction , adding that I knew he was anxious the request should be granted . The great man looked at me with what I thought an equivocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertinacity , and half amused . " I should be only too happy , " he said , " to oblige Mr. Motley , but does he think , or do you think , that we should concede to a New York journal what we have denied to the Times itself ? Where should we be then ? " And he wished me goodmorning with a military manner . That is a good enough sample of the sort of difficulties which meet the journalist in Europe at every turn , and which in America are scarcely known . We had to do without our British officer , to his regret and to ours . Time pressed , and it was not possible to carry on long negotiations . The men who were waiting for German and French permits to join the armies were sent to the front with good letters , and with orders to go on till they were stopped , to put themselves into communication with the staffs , and to be governed by circumstances . A good man makes his way somehow in the confusion of an opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the leading columns , and others a little later . No journalist , however , was quick enough to see the battle of Worth . No newspaper , European or American , had an account of Marshal MacMahon 's great defeat , save such as the military authorities chose to furnish , or as was picked up from outside gossip . I come now to a part of my story which has always seemed to me full of interest , but by no means easy to tell with fulness . Even after so long an interval discretion is desirable . The matter was more or less public at the time , and gave rise to much corn ment , and more conjecture , generally rather wild . The true account has never been made known . I am aware of no reason why it should not be , nor of any interest of either of the two journals concerned which can now be affected unfavorably . Other journals have since followed the precedent then set . There is no longer anything to be gained by secrecy , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how the so-called alliance between the Tribune and the Daily News was brought about , and what the effect of it was . Not only to journalists did it seem important . It was thought worthy of mention by the great historian of the Crimean War . Mr. Kinglake says , " The success of that partnership for the purpose of war news which had been formed between one of our London newspapers and the New York Tribune was an era in the journalism of Europe . " It had become evident almost from the first day that any single American paper , no matter how well served in the field by its own correspondents , would be heavily handicapped by its want of access to the // general news services which every great London journal had at its disposal . We could read it all next morning , but it was then of little use . Every journalist feels and knows that between to-day and tomorrow there are sometimes a thousand years . A piece of news may be worth anything to-day ; and nothing to-morrow . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act very often on conjecture , inference , and calculation , when , if we had been in connection with a good service , we might have acted on a certainty . Beside which , we wanted to know what news the agencies had , and what they had not ; what would go to New York independently , and what we ourselves had exclusively ; and many other things . Only a journalist knows the gulf that lies between the inside and the outside of a great newspaper office . Reflecting much on these matters , I finally went to Mr. Robinson , the manager of the Daily News , and laid my views before him . I told him frankly what we needed-that we asked nothing less than that he should put his office at our disposal , conceding to us the privilege of seeing news , proofs , and everything else , at all hours , whether relating to the war or otherwise . In return we offered him the results of our special service . I told him what we proposed , whom we were sending into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected and hoped to accomplish . I pointed out to him that we had behind us the four years ' experience of our own war , during which news had been collected on a scale and by methods before unknown , and I said we meant to apply the same or similar methods here , and to adapt our American practices to European fields . I said we were prepared to spend a good deal of money , and to use the telegraph far more freely than was the custom here , and in a different way . I explained that we did not propose the arrangement for the sake of economy , nor with any wish that either paper should reduce its expenses in reliance on the other . What I meant was that he , on his side , should organize his correspondence exactly as if we did not exist , that we , on our side , should - do the same with ours , and that each journal should have the full benefit of the double service . All our telegrams and letters were to be supplied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his and ours were to be printed simultaneously in New York and London . Mr. Robinson listened attentively to this statement , which seemed to make little impression on him , asked a few questions as if for civility 's sake , and ended by rejecting my proposal altogether . He saw no advantage in it , he said , and could not perceive that the Daily News would gain anything of consequence by accepting it . I asked him if he would talk it over with the editor . He answered that it concerned him , and not the editor ; it was within the manager 's , not the editor 's province . But I knew Mr. Frank Hill , the editor of this paper , and I asked Mr. Robinson if he had any objection to my talkin* the matter over myself with Mr. Hill . He said lie had none , and to Mr. Hill I went , and put my proposal before him as I had before the manager . Mr. Frank Hill was an Englishman of a singularly open mind , with a flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was outside his editorial duties , but he grasped the points as they were stated , put a number of searching questions , the answers to which satisfied him , and said without hesitation that he would see Mr. Robinson and urge him to accept . He knew his way to Mr. Robinson 's mind much better than I did , and the result of his intervention was that Mr. Robinson reconsidered the matter , and accepted what he had at first rejected . Mr. Hill 's sagacity was vindicated almost at once . Mr. Holt White , a Tribune correspondent , had pushed forward rapidly enough to see the first , or almost the first , engagement on the northeasterii frontier of France , and , in pursuance of his instructions , telegraphed his account of that action direct to London -- about a column altogether . That despatch marks the parting of the ways between the old and the new journalism of England-between the days when the telegraph was used only for short summaries of news and the days when despatches became letters , and everything of any real consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wire . I am aware that this remark may not have a friendly reception in England , and may be thought , from one point of view , open to criticism . But it is strictly and literally true . The despatch reached me , in a somewhat mangled state , early in the evening . I wrote out a fair copy , with some conjectural emendations which foreign telegraph operators made necessary , and went with it to the Daily News office . // Mr. Robinson had gone home and Mr. Hill had not come in . I-asked to see the editor in charge , and I handed him the despatch . He knew but very imperfectly the agreement we had come to , and he did not know at all what to make of the despatch . He asked more than once if I meant to say that it had come by telegraph . I assured him it had . " The whole of it ? " " Yes , the whole of it . " He was incredulous . He remarked that it was not written on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the forms . He was perfectly polite , but he evidently wanted to see the forms ; and as , anticipating some such question , I had brought them with me , I produced them . He looked at them as if I had produced a transcript from an Assyrian tablet . Finally he said he thought he might go so far as to have the despatcli put in type , and Mr. Hill would determine what should be done with it . I had done my part , and I left . I confess I opened the Daily News next morning with curiosity . There was the despatch , and there was moreover , a leading editorial , rather longer , I believe , than the despatch , commenting on it , and inviting the attention of the reader to this novel , and indeed entirely unprecedented , piece of enterprise in European war news . From that time on there was no further question in Mr. Robinson 's mind as to the value of the alliance with the Tribune . Despatches poured in . We were admirably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German armies , and during that memorable six weeks which ended with the battle of Sedan the Tribune in New York and the Daily News in London were far ahead of all other journals . So much was admitted . From the beginning the alliance was useful to us for the reasons given above , but for a considerable time it was , if I may say so , still more useful to our partner . With the exception of the account of the battle of Gravelotte , the larger part of the war news was ours , and the system was ours . Mr. Robinson was a very capable man , but it took time to get his forces into working order . The time which other London managers required was still longer . In the end we profited largely by the service which Mr. Robinson created . We , at any rate were well satisfied with the results of the alliance as a whole . It came to an end before the war was over , but for reasons which had nothing to do with its efficiency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be denied that during those few months the position of the Daily News had greatly improved . Its circulation had increased . Its reputation had increased . The public is quick to discover which paper has the earliest and best intelligence . Its rivals are quicker still , and were forced to follow the example set them . There is a great deal more to be said , but to-day I will describe only two events , both of which created no little sensation in their time . The first has to do with Sedan . The battle which was followed by the surrender of Sedan took place on Thursday , September 1st . It was not known in London till about ten o'clock on Saturday morning , when , or a little later , the London papers issued extra edit tions to announce it . At five o'clock that afternoon Mr. Holt White , who had witnessed the battle from the Prussian headquarters , arrived in London . He had instructions , in case of a great battle , not to wait to write out his account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tele*raph if he could , and if not , come to London direct . He had left the Prussian headquarters when the battle was over slept at Chevange , ridden next niorning through the lines or outposts of three armies-Prussian , French , and Belgianand reached Brussels , whence he expected to wire on his despatch , still unwritten . Going to the head telegraph office in Brussels , he was met by a point-blank refusal to accept the first brief message he handed in , announcing the total defeat of the French . It was not known in Brussels , it was not believed by the Belgian officials , and Mr. White was threatened with arrest as an impostor or spy . Escaping this peril , he took the first train to Calais , crossed the strait by special steamer , and came by special train to London , arriving more dead than alive , with his account still to be written . He began almost at once , and wrote till long past midnight . As his handwriting was not easily legible and time was precious , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript , with which the cable operators were familiar , was sent off in batches to the chief cable office in the city . The whole account , six columns long , was lodged in time for transmission to New York for next morning 's paper . But // there happened to be a break on the New Brunswick land Unes . The result was that the Tribune received and printed next morning ( Sunday ) about one-third of the whole , as much more on Monday , and the remainder on Tuesday , when it published the whole . It was not till Tuesday that any London morning paper had any account from any special correspondent . Mr.White had outstripped his competitors by three days . He supplemented his story of the battle by an account of a conversation with Prince Bismarck four days before the battle , setting forth the Iron Chancellor 's views as to the conditions of peace . Meantime our correspondent with the French army inside Sedan , a French officer , M. Mdjanel , arrived . He had been a prisoner of war , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . His account of the battle from the French side , four columns long , went by cable that evening to New York , and was printed in the Tribune Wednesday morning , one day later than Mr. White 's from the Prussian point of view . That is , I imagine , without precedent in the history of journalism . The battles in which a great empire went down had been fought 3000 miles away from New York , and within five days from the surrender of Napoleon , full and vivid narratives of the whole had appeared in the Tribune , filling ten columns of that paper . Nor was that all . On the same day had been published four or five columns from the Tribune correspondents in Paris , describing the fall of the Empire , the proclamation of the Republic , and the formation of the Provisional Government . The Tribunes of Tuesday and Wednesday were , as Mr. Greeley said , " mighty interesting reading . " Alto*ether , our special cable despatches printed from Sunday to Wednesday , inclusive , exceeded sixteen columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a very pretty bill to pay . The other event relates to the surrender of Metz , which took place October 27th . A young German-American , Mr. Gustav Muller , had come to me some time before with a letter from Wendell Phillips , and I had sent him to the Prussians outside Metz . Upon the surrender , he made his way into the city and out of it , and came to London with the first , and for a long time the only , account of the capitulation , and of the state of things in the city and within the French lines , all extremely well done . It was cabled to New York , and published the same morning in the Tribune and in the Daily News in London . Next morning the Times copied it in full , saying-I quote from memory- " We are indebted to the Daily News for the following excellent account of the surrender of Metz , and we congratulate our contemporary on the enterprise and ability of its correspondent . " That also was without precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little stir in the world of journalism . It is to be understood , of course , that both the Tribune and the Daily News regarded all these despatches and letters as common property , and neither credited them or any of them to the other . Very soon there grew up a legend about this Metz narrative . It was attributed to Mr. Archibald Forbes . No higher compliment could be paid to it or to its author . Mr. Forbes 's renown was then in its early growth , but he was already widely known alike for the solidity and brilliancy and military value of his writing , and for his almost matchless energy in the field . He had nothing whatever to do with this Metz despatch , but it is no wonder that outsiders credited him with a particularly good and difficult piece of work . On ne prdte qu'aux riches . The sequel is an unravelled and probably impenetrable mystery . Mr. Gustav Muller was naturally elated with his success , and willing , I made no doubt , to repeat it . I asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was usual , a large sum of money ; we said good-by , and he walked out of the office in Pall Mall . From that day to this I have never heard of nor from him . He vanished utterly into space . As he had every inducement to continue his career , I always supposed , and still suppose , that he was either shot in some skirmish , or murdered by some of the plundering bands always hanging on the rear of an army . The inquiries made at the time came to nothing , and it is too late to expect the secret to disclose itself , but I should still be much obliged to anybody who could give me a clue to the fate of Gustav Mflller.
