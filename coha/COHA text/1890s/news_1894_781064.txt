txt In a quiet spot about a quarter of a mile from Greenlawn Station , toward the village of Huntington , a band of Christians and mission workers from New-York City and . Brooklyn are holding an old-fashioned camp meeting . The neighborhood is largely a farming district . The morning and afternoon sessions are attended by the wives and daughters of the farmers , who themselves are so busy looking after their crops that they can not be present until after sundown . Sunday parties drive from miles about and spend the day at the camp . At present the majority of visitors from the city live at the home of Mr. Creighton , near by , although a few have pitched their tents in the woods . The leader of the meetings is the Rev. Williard Clark of NewYork City . He has been engaged for the past fifteen years in mission labors in NewYork and Brooklyn , and is an energetic worker . His duties have taken him among the lower class , and in Chinatown he is well known . He makes frequera excursions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dix Hills , holding short out-of-door meetings . He also goes about from house to house and prays and sings with the sick . ' On his return to the city he will organize-a mission to assist unemployed men to secure work . Mr. Clark is assisted by the Rev. Mr. Haskell of Guttenberg , N. J. ; Mr. Ballow , Mrs. Whitney , and Mrs. Everett , all of the Bleecker Street ( New-York ) Mission : Mr. Logan , the Rev.

Shapis , New-York ; the Oyster Bay and Woodbury praying bands , the Parks sisters , and others . Sunday last was the opening day , and all churches of the adjoining country closed and the congregations attended the services in camp , the pastors assisting .
