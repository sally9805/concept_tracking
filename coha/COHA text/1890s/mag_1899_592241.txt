A LESSON FROM THE MALAY STATES . WHATEVER the future may hold , it is certain that in the present America is called upon to make many and heavy sacrifices as an immediate consequence of her victory over Spain . Not only must she now , perforce , abandon the position of magnificent aloofness which she has held so long ; not only must she step down into the arena in which other white races have struggled and striven with such varied success , there to strain her thews and sinews in the effort to rule her distant and undesirable dependency ; but she must also consent to make many concessions against which her na tional pride will inevitably rise in revolt . Not the least of these , perhaps , will be found in the necessity under which she must labor of sitting at the feet of older nations , to learn from them and from their hard-won experience the rudiments of her new trade . The task upon which she is now embarking is one which she has never contemplated ; for which she is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tradition . The sensitive brown folk whom she is suddenly called upon to rule have nothing in common with her own sturdy people . The latter press forward with restless energy // in the van of the dying century ; the former lag lazily at the tail of the Middle Ages . The Americans are democratic by instinct and by education ; the Filipinos , like all Malayan races , are intensely aristocratic . The Americans love progress , and the change which means improvement and advance ; the natives of the Philippines are conservative to the backbone . It would be difficult to find two peoples more entirely dissimilar in character , in opinions , in ambitions and aspirations , than are the Filipinos and the race by which they are now to be ruled . Yet it is by sympathy , and by a thorough understanding of the native point of view alone , that an Oriental race can be successfully governed , and this is part of the bard lesson which Americans who may be concerned in the administration of the Philippines must set themselves to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , who have hitherto regarded such matters as lacking both interest and importance , must turn their attention to the records of the work performed in Asia by other white races , and must make a careful study of the methods which have produced the most satisfactory results . This , at the best , will be experienced only at second hand , but in the absence of anything better it will probably be useful . The English and the Dutch civil servant , who is sent out to the East at an early age , has the advantage of receiving from those under whom he serves some portion of the inherited tradition of the manner in which the Oriental can be most successfully ruled , which has been transmitted from generation to generation by those of his race who have labored in Asia before him . He holds no responsible position until he has been some years in the land of his adoption , and during that time he has had many opportunities of acquiring a practical working knowledge of the character of the natives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the age of thirty he is two hundred years old . Behind him is the accumulated experience of his race . His official forbears have blundered through small beginnings , until , by slow degrees , an empire has been won . Almost every mistake that is possible has at one time or another been made by them , though at a period when things were on a scale so small that they mattered little , and the modern civil servant thus knows what to avoid . It is due to those who have gone before him , not to himself personally , that now , when each false step would be a disaster , he blunders less seriously , less frequently , than they were wont to do . Lacking such continuity of experience and tradition , the American administrators of the Philippines will labor under great disadvantages . Not only will they miss the knowledge of the people and the country , which is in itself well-nigh essential , but they will be forced to assume posts of the first importance witho*it having received any previous training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown old in Eastern lore to guide them in their difficulties , without any records in their past history to serve as signposts on their perilous way . The sterling common sense of the Anglo-Saxon will doubtless stand them in good stead . The extreme cool-headedness for which Americans are remarkable will save them from making many mistakes into which a more excitable race might be betrayed ; but where error of a serious nature is so fatally easy , it is hardly possible that men thus heavily handicapped by circumstances should avoid the perpetration of blunders which may well prove disastrous . In seeking for an analogy by means of which the Americans may to some extent be guided in their administration of the Philippines , the records of the British in the Federated States of the Malay Peninsula , and of the Dutch in Acheen , most readily occur to the mind . With the work performed by the British in India // we need not concern ourselves . The conditions and the peoples are both unlike those with which the Americans in the Philippines will have to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula was neither contemplated nor foreseen . The Indian empire built itself up gradually , fortuitously , almost imperceptibly , and its history , marvelous and soul-stirring though it be , offers no analogy to the problem in the Philippines . The conquest of Burma is in some ways more analogous to the work which lies before the Americans ; but the Mongolian race with whom the British there had to deal is wholly unlike the Malayan peoples who inhabit the newly acquired archipelago . In the Malay Peninsula and in Acheen , however , the British and the Dutch , respectively , have had to find solutions for problems very similar to those which now present themselves to the Americans . The two nations have adopted different means to the same end , and in the policy of the English the best road to success may perhaps be found , while in the weary little war which the Dutch have protracted with such miserable results for more than twenty-five years may be seen an awful warning , which he who runs may read . Before turning our attention to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Malay states , it may be instructive to glance at the recent history of Acheen , to see how far it illustrates points of importance to American statesmen concerned in the administration of the Philippine archipelago . In 1819 , at a time when the British still held certain colonies in Sumatra , a treaty with Acheen was executed , whereby all Europeans were excluded from making the latter country the place of their permanent residence . In 1824 the British colonies on the shores of Sumatra were ceded to the Dutch in exchange for certain advantages ; but in the agreement no mention was made of Acheen , though it was understood by the two contracting parties that England abandoned her right to protect that state , while Holland stood pledged not to interfere with its independence . The position created was somewhat anomalous , and in 1871 a further treaty with the Netherlands relieved Great Britain of all remaining responsibility with regard to the Sumatran kingdom . The conduct of the governor of the Straits Settlements , who was mainly responsible for this abandonment , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which we are not now concerned . The immediate result of his action was that war was declared upon Acheen by the Dutch before eighteen months had elapsed , and an armed force landed on the coast in April , 1873 . Thus began the Acheenese war , which at the present time of writing is still dragging along , with no more prospect of a final issue than existed twenty-five years ago . The* country is ill suited to the operations of troops trained and disciplined on European lines . In the interior it is exceedingly mountainous . The interminable forest , tangled with creepers and underwood , covers most of the country , affording refuge for the enemy , and enabling them to draw the Dutch soldiers into frequent ambushes , where they may be stricken down without even having the satisfaction of catching a glimpse of their foes . No blockade of the coast has been successful in cutting off supplies of arms and ammunition , although the British government has done its best to aid by prohibiting export from its possessions ; nor will any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia continue to be thronged by hundreds of disreputable little craft , owned by men of all nationalities and colors , and manned by folk who love heavy profits and a spice of danger and excitement . Of food the Acheenese will always have a sufficiency . Their country is fertile , and they can grow their crops with little labor in // the valleys and on the hillsides of the mountainous interior , where they are safe from the Dutch . The people , who thoroughly realize the nature of their advantages , are firmly set in their determination to carry on the struggle to the bitter end ; and since poor and simple , gentle and wealthy , alike , have grown up to regard the Hollanders as their hereditary enemies , the disastrous war may well prove to be practically interminable . Meanwhile , it is not only with the Acheenese that the Dutch have had to contend . The mortality among their troops has often been terrible . Fever , dysentery , beriberi , - that most dreaded form of tropical dropsy , - have all claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch have been able to put into the field have suffered severely . During the first decade of the war , if rumor speak truly , peculation was rife , and enormous sums were realized by contractors and underlings . Latterly , more supervision and stricter economy have done something to reduce the expenses of the campaign ; but the Acheenese war continues to be a constant and heavy drain upon the revenue of the Dutch colonies , which now has to be supplemented from the income of the mother country , instead of contributing to it , as it formerly did . Lives of men and money in profusion have been devoted to the war , and what has Holland gained , after so many years of strife ? A certain influence in the districts lying immediately upon the seaboard ; a few forts , held in an enemy 's country by garrisons in a constant state of siege ; the hatred of the natives of the land , upon whom she has brought unspeakable sufferings , and for whose good she has not been able to effect anything ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions . This is , in truth , a deplorable result to have attained after a struggle which has lasted more than twenty-five years , and there is small room for wonder if the Dutch nation as a whole , and more especially those responsible for the administration of the Netherland Indies , are heartily sick of Acheen and all connected therewith . But it is now too late to withdraw from the policy of conquest by force of arms to which the nation is committed , and therefore the war , hateful and detestable though it be , must still be carried on . Any change of tactics now would be likely to endanger the power of Holland in the East . The theory upon which the Dutch have worked , that the colonies should contribute to the support of the mother country , has resulted in a system of taxation which can not but be regarded as oppressive , if it be compared with that in force in any civilized state in Europe or in the British dominions in the East . The natives of the Malay Peninsula and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the Malay population in the Dutch colonies . Thi* is the principal reason for the lack of popularity which the Netherlands government has eternally to face ; for Malays love money dearly . There are other causes , sufficiently serious in themselves , which need not be further alluded to in this place . That the government recognizes the fact , however , is proved by the excessive precautions against native risings which are taken by the authorities in Batavia , and in all the large centres of the Dutch colonies . With the danger forever before their eyes of fanning these smouldering embers of discontent into a flame , Dutch statesmen dare not discontinue the war with Acheen ; and so the troublous affair drags on and on , unending , but inevitable . The conclusions to be drawn from the above facts can be more fittingly dealt with in a later paragraph of this article . I will therefore now turn to the Malay states of the peninsula , and will relate as concisely as I am able the history of the British connection with them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been adopted , and the results thereby attained . In the very early days of " Old John Company , " at a time when the conquest of India was as yet undreamed of and the Eastern trade was still in its infancy , the emissaries of the London merchants had for their principal field of activity the islands of the Malay Archipelago . In the reign of James I. of England trade with many native states in Borneo , Java , and Sumatra was in full swing . On the shores of the Malay Peninsula itself a factory was established , in the kingdom of Patani , in 1612 , and was maintained for a period of ten years . Later , when a firm hold had been obtaiiied upon the peninsula of Hindustan , it was from Calcutta that the initiative was taken which had for its result the foundation of the colony now known as the Straits Settlements . In 1786 , Captain Light , an officer in the employment of the Indian government , procured the cession of the island of Penang froni the sultan of K*da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malacca , situated on the mainland of the peninsula halfway down the straits which bear their name , were wrested from the Dutch by an expedition fitted out from Calcutta . In 1819 Sir Stamford Raffles acquired for the Indian government the cession of the island of Singapore from the then sultan of JOhore . Having so obtained these possessions , the East India Company continued to administer them , as outlying flanges of its growing empire , until that great corporation passed out of existence , and the Straits Settlements did not become a crown colony until 1867 . During the whole of this period , and for seven years later , the administrators who had the straits in their charge did not attempt to gain a foothold upon the shores of the peninsula other than such as was afforded by the little territories of Malacca , and the district known as Province Wellesley opposite to the island of Penang . The various native states of the Malay Peninsula were suffered to manage , or mismanage , their own affairs in the fashion which most commended itself to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as entirely unchecked as in the days before the coining of Magellan ; the cruelties and barbarities , which in the peninsula are inseparable from native government , were perpetrated as of old ; the pirate craft which infested the mangrove - covered coast committed their depredations almost without let or hindrance ; ancient abuses flourished exceedingly ; the peasants were ground down and deprived of the barest rights of human beings , and no one conceived it to be his duty to come to their assistance ; even British subjects who were so foolhardy as to risk their lives by traveling in the interior did so at their own risk , and the authorities of the colony did not greatly concern themselves . So matters went on until 1874 , when the government of the Straits Settlements , which was just beginning to feel its feet as a separate entity after its emancipation from the control of the Calcutta executive , bethought it that the time had come for setting the houses of those who dwelt in such close proximity to itself in something resembling order . At this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula , on the western seaboard . In P*rak , a pretender , who had fraudulently obtained possession of the regalia , was striving for the throne with the legitimate ruler of the land . In S*l*ngor a sultan lived who recognized that his own best chance of safety lay in permitting the hot-blooded youngsters of his house to fight with one another unchecked . To this end , he supplied all parties indifferently with arms and ammunition when they asked for help , gave to each applicant an informal authority , and sat by complacently as a spectator of a quarrel of so many Kilkenny cats . In each state the 591 // struggle was further complicated by the presence of a fairly large population of Chinese miners banded into secret societies , which were largely controlled by capitalists of their own nationality , residing in the colony of the Straits Settlements . The possession of the richest stanniferous land was the prize of victory , and the Malay chiefs , divided among themselves , were quite unable to cope with the Chinese factions . Anarchy , complete as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bloodshed , scarcity and misery , - such were the things which held undisputed possession of the Malayan states when the British government first began to interest itself in their affairs . The legitimate ruler of P*rak applied at last , in despair , to the governor of the Straits Settlements , for assistance against his enemies and in the administration of his troubled country . A treaty was signed ; the sultan bound himself to be guided by his European adviser , and the first British Resident was appointed to live in P*rak . Almost simultaneously a Resident was sent to reside in S*langor . These men were unsupported by even a show of force . They had no settled place of abode , and their duty , for the most part , was to learn all that could be ascertained about the little-known states , and to lead the people and their rulers into better ways . It was heartbreaking work , of course . The Malays regarded them with dislike and with suspicion , for they represented the horror of the unknown . The worst that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the Malay peasants had a very full knowledge ; the evil that the white men might work upon them , on the other hand , was something of which they could form no estimate . Therefore , the bulk of the population eyed the coming of the white men with the utmost disfavor and fear . The chiefs themselves , who saw in the advent of the strangers a danger which must threaten alike their authority and their privileges , hated the European officers quite sincerely , and did all in their power to thwart them . Our experience of Malays was of the slightest description at that time . The principal Resident did not even know the language . Like the Americans in the Philippines to-day , the English were playing a game which was new to them , the veriest rudiments of which they had yet to Learn . As a consequence , though in a new country it is perhaps inevitable that one or more men should die for the people , Mr. J. W. W. Birch , the first Resident of P*rak , was brutally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatched to avenge his death , and the main rivers , the principal highways of the country , were occupied by troops . No attempt was made , however , to conquer the land by force of arms . The thickly wooded country made military operations impossible , and the only engagements fought were iii the last degree inglorious . Had an effort been made to reduce the state by overrunning it with troops , it is probable that the war would have been as bitter and as unsuccessful as that in Acheen . Instead , the English political officials did all in their power to convince the people that the occupation would last only so long as they by their own actions rendered it necessary ; that Mr. Birch 's murderers must be delivered up to justice ; that those who had organized the assassination must be punished ; and that , for the rest , there was no desire to tamper with the liberties of the natives . The Malays were iumpressed by the show of force , doubtless , for such things commend themselves to the imagination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupation is to be looked for in the fact that , through better acquaintance with our methods and with the character of our officers , the natives learned that their fear of us had been groundless , and that by our aid the meanest members of the community might obtain a measure // of justice and liberty such as they had never enjoyed under their own r*jas and chiefs . With the peasantry thus won over to our side , the native rulers no longer caused us any serious difficulty . The power of a chief lies in the number of his adherents ; when this has shrunk to insignificance , he continues to exist merely as a discontented person who is ilnpotent for harm . S*l*ngor did not need to be reduced to order by means of a military expedi-. tion . The example of P*rak proved to be sufficient . In Sfingei Ujong and the N*gri Sembilan , the little states round the territory of Malacca , troops were required before our grip upon the natives had become so firm that the aid of military force could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired of the native states , no army of occupation was ever needed , though the police forces of P*rak and S*kingor were used in 1892 to quell disturbances which had their rise in the discontent of certain native chiefs . The troops withdrawn , the real labor of setting the troubled lands in order was begun . The Resident appointed to each state was furnished with a number of European officers . The country was divided up into districts , each with a white man in charge . Men who bad experience of the Chinese and could speak their language were set to rule that portion of the population . The mining lands were leased to those who had the ability to work them , and private enterprises of all kinds were encouraged to the utmost . At first the greatest caution had to be employed , coupled with the most untiring patience . It was vastly important that things should not be hurried unduly , that the natives should not be terrified by unnecessary innovations , that the old landmarks to which they clung should be respected , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all occasions the greatest tact should be exercised , that native VOL . LXXXIV. - , *o. 505. 38 susceptibilities should never be wantonly wounded . It was recognized that our power lay in the good will of the bulk of the people ; that the only justification for our presence among them lay in our ability to make them freer , happier , and more prosperous than in the days before our coming . Crime of a serious description was punished with rigor , but with justice , for the Malay respects firmness in his rulers ; the ill deeds of the chiefs , which had the peasantry for their victims , were ruthlessly repressed , yet the commoners were made to treat the fallen despots with the ceremony required by custom , and any failure in this respect was treated as an offense . At first , of necessity , many things which were opposed to European ideas of the eternal fitness were suffered to continue . The white men who ruled the land were alone among aliens , and their ability to administer the country was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were bound to act in a manner which often harmonized more nearly with native than with European notions ; but little by little , as their grip grew surer , they led the people out of the darkness into the light . Meanwhile , in more material things they adopted a most energetic policy . The country , when they entered it , was one huge forest , threaded here and there by footpaths , cleft in twain by great shallow rivers , but for the rest trackless and impenetrable . Villages which did not lie upon the banks of the same river , though separated from one another by only a few miles of jungle , were so remote that it was a journey of several days ' duration to pass from one to the other . Vast tracts of stanniferous land were rendered inaccessible through lack of facilities for transport . The natural wealth of the country was thus hermetically sealed . To develop the resources of the states , and at the same time , by increasing the means of communication , to facilitate the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roads . At first the native states could not produce sufficient revenue to defray the cost of such works ; but the colony lent money freely , and later P*rak aided S*l*ngor with funds , just as at present Sdangor is financing Pahang . The sums thus expended were well and wisely spent . The country was opened up in every direction , markets for their produce were brought to the very doors of the peasants , the wealth and prosperity of every section of the population were enormously increased , the revenue rose by leaps and bounds , and the success of the administration was assured . But perhaps the most interesting and instructive feature of the work effected among the Malays of the native states by British officers is the part which , under their guidance , has been played in the administration of these countries by the natives themselvcs . Formerly , a Malay chief regarded his position merely as " a vantage ground for pleasure , and his people as folk of no account , whom Providence had thoughtfully bestowed upon him for the satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty was to him a thing unknown . He had never been taught to recognize any obligation to the country or to the people over whom he ruled . Before him the coinmonei*s and peasantry were as driven cattle , and as beasts of burden he treated them . Thousands of years , during which their forbears had exercised the privileges of undisputed authority , had given to the dominant classes of the Malays no higher conception of their raison d ' *tre than this ; had brought upon them all the evils consequent on complete self-indulgence ; and had not even developed in them the manly qualities which come to those who are marked out by instinct , not merely by birth , as the rulers of their fellows . Then the white men came . The chiefs watched these strangers laboring , with 8mall regard for their own comfort , in an uncongenial climate , and wearing out bodies and souls alike for the betterment of those around them . At first they wondered blankly at the eccentric actions of the Europeans ; speculated wildly as to their motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greed or gain , they might be seeking to satisfy at the cost of so much unremitting toil . Then , gradually and by slow degrees , the conviction was forced upon their minds that there was some driving power at the back of these men , some force or principle to which they themselves had hitherto been strangers . Later still they made the discovery that this was a sense of duty , duty toward the state and the alien people whom the white men had come so far to serve , coupled with a keen interest in the work which they were performing and a love of labor for its own sake . The idea was so foreign to the indolent native temperament that for a long time i ? could not be thoroughly grasped ; but little by little the example of the strangers was found to be contagious , and the better class of Malayan chiefs learned to assimilate something of the altruistic spirit which they recognized as dominating their European teachers . They met with ready encouragement ; and so it has come to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed work of administration throughout British Malaya is largely performed by the natives of the peninsula . On the bench , in the custom houses , in every village throughout the land , Malays , trained by Europeans to deal justly by the people , are to be found working for the good of the state in a fashion which would have been incomprehensible to their fathers a short generation ago ; and the number of capable native officers who are annually produced by our system of administration is ever on the increase . The Malayan states are even now only under the " protection " of Great Britain . They do not form an integral part of the empire , // and the sultans and chiefs have therefore a full right to exercise authority in the government of their countries . That , aided by their white advisers , they use this right wisely and well is not the least remarkable feature in the British record in Malaya . One word as to the European officers themselves . The most responsible posts were filled almost from the first by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives , but the subordinate officers were nominated by the Colonial Office in London and by the governors of the Straits Settlements . In many cases they were men who had received no special training for the work which they were to perform , but they received an education in Eastern lore from the older men under whom they served . They were selected from the class which we , in our archaic European phraseology , term " gentlemen ; " they possessed the refinement , the good manners , and the care for the susceptibilities of others which make men tactful , and in dealing with Orientals , the most sensitive of human beings , are worth all the ologies ; and physically they were generally sound specimens of their race . Moreover , in those very early days there were few amusements or distractions of any kind to tempt them from their work . They lived almost alone among a native population , and they made a study of the people their principal aim and recreation . They were thoroughly in touch with the folk over whom they ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they caught the enthusiasm for the work which distinguished their superiors in the service , and they lived for the state , - men with a single idea , whose hobby it was to manage the country in a manner which satisfied their high ideals . Now that the whole face of the land has undergone alteration , the men have to some extent changed with it . European society has grown up about them ; race courses and cricket fields occupy much of the time which of old was devoted to toil ; men think themselves ill used if they are kept for long in the solitude of out-stations ; and the cadets , recruited by competitive examination , are content to learn only so much of the language of the natives as will enable them to satisfy the by no means searching tests to which they are subjected . But the most difficult part of the work has already been accomplished ; many of the original crew are still at hand to man the ship ; and for the time , at any rate , the prosperity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it any very serious injury . Meanwhile , under British protection the Malay Peninsula has emerged from its former obscurity , and has begun to play a part not insignificant in the world to which it belongs . For the last ten years it has produced from fifty to seventy-five per cent of the tin of the globe , its output exceeding largely that of Australia , South America , Cornwall , and all other tin-yielding countries put together . The revenue of the existing federation has risen in five-and-twenty years from a few hundred thousand to over seven million silver dollars . Out of current receipts , roads , which intersect the states from end to end , have been constructed . Over two hundred miles of railway are open to traffic , and an elaborate system , joining Penang to Malacca , is in course of completion . Planting and other private enterprises have been stimulated ; the material wellbeing of the natives has been enormously improved ; and the once lawless land has been made as peaceful and as secure as are the best ordered countries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most orderly , hard-working , money-loving , and thrifty natives in the East , and by them has been performed the heavy labor of a kind which the indolent , ease-seeking Malays could never have accomplished . Some Chinese came to the Malay states before // ever white men set foot on the peninsula ; but as a race they love best a land where they can make money undisturbed by risk of war and robbery , and this they find in modern Malaya , ruled by a strong government under European control . Without the aid of the white men the present condition of affairs could never have been arrived at ; and this fact , which justifies our presence in the Malay states , is one of which Englishmen may well be proud . In the space of an article such as this , it is impossible to give more than an outline sketch of the work which has been accomplished , and the methods which the British have adopted for the attainment of their ends ; and the only interest which these things can have for American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states arid the Philippines . This is to be sought chiefly in the fact that the natives of the newly acquired archipelago are , with a few exceptions , of the Malayan race . As in the peninsula and other parts of Asia , the aboriginal natives of the Philippines are negrits , - little curlyhaired , soot-colored creatures , like African negroes seen through the reverse end of a field glass . They are not very numerous , and are too profoundly ignorant and uncivilized to be in any way formidable . The prevailing native tribes , called Igorrotes by the Spaniards , are probably the descendants of the next race wave which passed over the islands . They belong to the Mon-Annam stock , and resemble the S*kai hill tribes of the peninsula in their physical characteristics , though they have attained to a higher degree of civilization . Last to arrive were the people of the Malayan family , who , though now divided into some fifty different tribes , are scattered up and down the fifteen hundred islands which compose the Philippine archipelago . Asia is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accustomed to see give but a faint idea of the extent of the countries composing and adjoining it . Thus , as shown on the chart , the Philippines appear to be an insignificant group , whereas their most northerly extremity is as distant from the southern islands of Sftlu as is the north of Scotland from the toe of Italy . The work of administering such an extensive area will necessarily be difficult ; and if the opposition made be of a serious nature , it will be almost hopeless to attempt to subdue it by force of arms , unless the people of the United States are prepared to make sacrifices of a kind which no nation can pretend to regard with equanimity . Lying as they do in the womb of the tropics , the islands have a climate which is not well suited to white troops . The seasons of the year may , speaking broadly , be said to be three in number : the cold season , from November to March ; the hot season , from April to June ; and the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have given to the first of these divisions is somewhat misleading , for in the Philippines it is never really cold . The distinction between the seasons in the islands is much like that made by Mark Twain in writing of the weather in Calcutta : the hot season is that which will melt a brass doorknob ; the cold season will only make it mushy . The wet season , however , lives up to its reputation . The rain falls in torrents , day after day , night after night ; the rivers and lagoons rise in angry spate , flooding the surrounding country for miles ; the heavy malarious mists curl upwards and hang over the steaming land ; everything is clammy to the touch , miserable and oppressive . The country is in places very mountainous . It is covered , as is the Malay Peninsula , with interminable forests , affording excellent cover to those engaged in carrying on a guerrilla warfare , and most hampering and heartbreaking for white soldiery . In the lowlands the floods will enforce a cessation of hostilities for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the enemy time in which to make ready for a fresh effort . The geographical features of the islands are of a kind which will render the maintenance of a blockade well-nigh impossible , and the natives will therefore have little difficulty in obtaining all the warlike stores of which they will stand in need . The Americans will find that they have opposed to them all the obstacles which have proved so effectual in defeating the Dutch in Acheen , but always on a much vaster scale . They will have no brown troops to put into the field , such as the British employed largely in the Malay states , and the Dutch summon to their aid in Sumatra ; their base is many thousand weary miles away ; they have no intimate acquaintance with the country or the people ; and if they continue to act in a manner calculated to inspire universal hostility , they will in the end be forced to conquer the group , island by island , a work which may well occupy them for the greater part of the coming century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultan of the Sfilu Islands , and learned his view of the position of the Spaniards with regard to his territories . He laughed at any pretensions they might make that the land was a Spanish possession , and pointed out that they had never attempted to win a surer foothold on the islands the group , he declared , they had neither the right nor the power to interfere , and further inquiries on the subject bear out the sultan 's contention . A closer examination will also show us that in many of the outlying portions of the archipelago the white men 's control was purely nominal . It must be remembered that the position of the Spaniards in the Philippines was won , in the beginning , not by the sword , but by the Spanish priesthood , - devoted men who penetrated into the unknown wilderness , converting the natives from paganism to Christianity , and lifting them from a barbarism which was almost savagery to a degree of civilization greater than that enjoyed by Malays of any other land . Whatever the complaints which the natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be forgotten that it is to these men they owe their education , and all that makes up their present mental and moral acquirements ; and it is only natural that these missionaries , who in the past had exerted so great an influence upon the people , should cling to the power which they had won for themselves long after their good offices had grown useless to the executive . Thus , the priestly element in the government of the Philippines preponderated under Spanish dominion , and the class of men who were sent out from Spain to fill civil posts were little suited to the task . The cadets of the best families could not be tempted into exile ; the sons of tradesmen and of the bour1* , ' eoisie filled the gap ; and the only men of gentle blood and intellectual attainments in the islands were the priests . The administration was hopelessly behind the times ; the policy of taxation was clumsy , old-fashioned , and oppressive ; the government fell into disrepute with the natives , and the priests , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its unpopularity . Rapidly the discontent , fermented by the obvious inefficiency of the executive , spread and deepened ; eventually the collection of revenue became the only task which the administration even attempted to perform ; the Spanish control exercised by incompetent officials waxed weaker and weaker ; and now , when the rotten system has suddenly crumbled away into dust , the Americans find themselves in nominal possession of the islands which their predecessors were not in a position to hand over to them , and with no sure foundations established by the // former rulers upon which they themselves may begin to build . A consideration of the foregoing facts points clearly to two very definite conclusions . Every nerve should be strained by the United States to avoid the adoption of a policy of unnecessary aggression , and she should endeavor as far as possible to administer the Philippines with the aid of the natives themselves . " Now is the accepted time . " Later , steps may have been taken and a spirit of antagonism awakened which will render withdrawal from a policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become committed to such a course , the United States can look only for results which are likely to prove both humiliating and disastrous . If , on the other hand , her statesmen decide to act somewhat on the lines followed by the British in the Malay states , her hold upon her new possessions , if she be content to go forward slowly , but surely , will eventually be firmly secured , " broadbased upon a people 's will . " In order to attach the natives to herself , she must begin by convincing them that her motives in coming among them are entirely altruistic , that she seeks nothing but the improvement of their lot , and that she has no desire to exclude them from the administration of their country . To do this , she must for a time allow more power to be vested in the native officials than may theoretically be advisable . She should bear in mind the aphorism , " It is ill to hustle the East , " and she should make up her mind to move very patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands , to learn all that can be known concerning them , to make themselves acquainted with the people , and gradually to obtain an influence over them . The gobernadoreillos , the men who , under Spanish rule , were the heads of the village communes , are mostly natives of the islands . To begin with , these men should be intrusted with the admin istration of their people and their parishes ; the American political agents contenting themselves with giving such advice as may be necessary from time to time , and interfering only to prevent injustice of a gross description . Very soon the force of character of the white men will make itself felt ; the natives will learn where to look for help in their distresses , and for the justice which is incorrul ) tible . When this system has been in force for a period of years , if it be deemed advisable to assume a more complete control of the archipelago , the American officers will find that they have the support and the good will of the hulk of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without difficulty . This , in the opinion of those who best know the nature of a Malayan race , will be at once the safest , the surest , and the easiest manner in which the Philippines may be subjected . To carry out a policy such as this , America must select men of a stamp similar to that of the officers who did the early work among the Malays of the peninsula . They must be men of re finement and education , physically fit to stand the strain of a very trying life spent in a tropical climate , and they must devote themselves to the task allotted to them with enthusiasm and with sympathy . For them there will be no applause of the populace , no short cut to wealth , no reward of any kind save the power to perform quietly and obscurely a noble work for the benefit of a race which has no natural claim upon their services . England has found many of her sons ready to bind themselves to a permanent exile for no higher guerdon . It is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the required stamp will be prepared to make a similar sacrifice on behalf of their country . I have not left myself space in this article to enter upon such matters as the necessity , to which Americans must become reconciled , for the establishment of // a permanent civil service for the management of her colonies , the best tests by which the number of candidates for service in Asia may most fittingly be selected , and many other points bearing upon the question at issue , all of which are worthy of careful consideration . At almost every step America will be called upon to surrender some preconceived idea , some national prejudice , some cherished tradition of her people . In the East she will be dealing with men of an inferior race , and her theories of human equality must be abandoned . The natives under her control will decline to disregard the real distinction between class and class which , despite all disclaimers , exists in the United States as rigidly as in Europe . In other words , only men who have the manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any chance of success in administering this Eastern colony , and the United States must either resign herself to failure , or allow the civil service devoted to the East to be drawn from what can only be termed the aristocracy of the land . France , Germany , and Spain have tried to work with materials of a coarser type , and their example is not encouraging . In this lies yet another lesson which the ancient and eternal East will teach the youngest of the white races . The encouragement of Chinese immigration is viewed by a large number of Americans with superstitious horror , and the arguments against it , where these rice-eaters compete with white laborers , as in Australia and the Western states of the Union , are sound . In the Philippines , however , where the native population is composed of indolent brown folk , the yellow man will be the best tool that the executive can lay their hands on for the rapid development of the islands . It is a commonplace in the Malay states that withdut the aid of Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how great their energy , would have effected little . The same will be found to apply to the new American possession ; and if they be managed with skill and firmness by men who understand their character , the Chinese make as useful and as peaceable citizens as any government can well desire . The United States will have no difficulty in procuring the services of men who know the Chinese intimately in their own country , and no American prejudice should be suffered to interfere with the work of introducing as large a number of Chinamen into the archipelago as can be induced to immigrate . Another point upon which the administrators of the Philippines will find it necessary to act with caution is that of the religious beliefs of the people . The majority of the natives of the islands are Roman Catholics ; and though they have had occasion to complain of the action of their priests with reference to interference in temporal affairs , and though they retain many of their pagan superstitions , they will resent keenly any attempt to tamper with their faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion no less jealously ; and the Americans should make it clear from the first that they intend to respect the convictions of their new subjects , and will take no part in aiding missionaries who desire to effect their conversion to other creeds . As one who desires whole-heartedly to see the American nation succeed in Asia in a degree as signal as that of the other section of the Anglo-Saxon race , I wish the people of the United States three things : a speedy abandonment of the present policy of armed aggression ; the selection of a band of men who possess the instinct for the rule of a brown people ; and a reliance upon the moral influence of the higher over the lower breed instead of mere brute force . By that path , and by no other , lies the highroad to success .
