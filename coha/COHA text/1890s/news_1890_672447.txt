txt A discovery has just been made ' which has caused a good deal of talk among the few members of Congress who know the facts . On the 10th of this month Secretary Blaine sent to the President a letter calling his attention to the fact that the Pan-American Congress had adopted a report in favor of an international American monetary union , with the suggestion that , as a basis for this union , an international coin be issued , to be used in all the countries concerned . Mr. Blaine asked for the appointment of three delegates , on the part of the United States , to represent the United States at the International Monetary Union to be held here next January , and for an appropriation to meet the necessary expenses . Two days later the President sent this communication to Congress with a brief message commending these suggestions and hoping " they will receive the prompt consideration of Congress . " In the Senate the papers were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations , and in the House to the Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers had been received , Senator Hale had introduced an amendment to the DiploMatie and Consular bill " to enable the President to complete the work and carry into effect the recommendations of the International American Conference , " and among its items was one providing for the holding of this International Monetary Union and the appointment of the Commissioners , the sum of $15,000 being appropriated for expenses of the conference and pay of the Commissioners , to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of State . This amendment attracted little attention at the time , as it only related to the Pan-American Conference , a subject which interests very few persons in either branch of Congress , and it was agreed to with practically no debate . The Diplomatic bill was agreed to in conference July 10 , the date of Mr. Blaine 's communication , and sent to the President July 12 , the date of the President 's message . Two days later the President approved the Diplomatic bill . While this ' was going on , neither the members of the Senate committee nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ' which Mr. Blaine sought to attain had already been provided for in an Appropriation bill , and , on the House side , Mr. Blaine 's letter and the President 's message were referred to a sub-committee of the Coinage Committee to consider what should be done in the matter . It was while this sub-committee was discussing the question that , by chance , it was learned - what had already been done . To say that the committee was surprised is to put it mildly , and at first its members were at a loss to understand what Mr. Blaine was after . Mr. Blaine , of course , knew of the adoption of the Hale amendment and that the bill had been agreed to in conference , and , under those circumstances , the sending of his letter to the President and the latter 's message to Congress seemed to be an unnecessary , if not an impertinent , piece of business . It set the Representatives to thinking , and they think they have solved the problem . John Sherman is the Chairman of the Senate Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Blaine and the majority of Mr. Elaine 's schemes he is also opposed to free silver . The majority of the House Committee on Coinage is also against free silver . An international monetary union with the Latin-American countries , they say , could only be on the basis of a silver currency which , in the eyes of the opponents of silver , would be a great deal worse than the Free Silver bill which was defeated a Short time ago . Mr. Blaineew that his letter would be laid to sleep in the committees and no action would be taken on it until it was too late , and lie took this means to steal a very adroit march on his enemies . The appropriation having been made and the President having signed the bill , Mr. Blaine need have no further cause to worry . Members of the Coinage Committee , however , are considering the advisability of making a report on Mr. Blaine 's letter , and if they do they will read the Secretary of State a lecture on his peen-oar way of doing business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last received their copies of the Force bill as It has been provisionally put together by the Republican members of the Committee on Privileges and Elections . That it is a provisional draft of the bill is stated in the note accompanying each copy , ' which requests each Senator to read the measure carefully and to give the committee the benefit of his best judgment as to any rhauges which ought to be made 11/ its language or provisions . Messrs . Hoar and Spooner expect to receive replies to-morrow , and the measure will be submitted to a caucus very soon , perhaps to-morrow night . It turns out that the majority of the Elections Committee have done something more than smooth down the phraseology of the House bill . One of the most important provisions of the Lodge bill was that bringing into life the old law authorizing the employment of troops at the polls . This has beencut out , and it is not likely that the caucus will instruct Mr. Hoar to put it back . The opposition to the " bayonet clause " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tile House bill has been so changed as to allow Circuit Court Judges to use their own discretion about accepting Supervisors of Election named by the Cluef Supervisor , so that the Judges may appoint others if they think it advisable . The Senate committee ) also provides that no person who has joined in petitioning for the proposed supervision of an election shall be appointed a Supervisor . Another important change , it is said , is an amendment by which an appeal may be taken from the decision of a Board . of Supervisors to a Circuit Court Judge . The latter 's decision is to betinal , and if any person presents a certificate of election signed by a Circuit Court Judge his name must go upon the roll of the House of Representatives and stay there until the House have takes it off . Messrs Spooner and Hoar have applied the smoothing-down process to the provisions relative to the verification of registry lists in small cities so as to make them apparently less objectionable . They have done the same to the various penalty clauses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lees severe than in the House bill . That the bill will be accepted by the caucus in just its present shape is not at all certain . It is not satisfactory in all itsparts to all of the Re- publican members of the Elections Committee . Some of them have reserved the right to offer amendments hereafter , although they join in submitting the measure to their party colleagues . It remains to be seen how far their work will commend itself to the caucus . It will be much easier to satisfy the caucus as to the terms of the bill than to find forty-three Republicans who will bind themselves to forcethrough the Senate any bill the caucus may indorse . That is the stumbling block in the way of the Force bill . hours in the consideration of District business , including the Atkinson Railroad bill . Tuesday and Wednesday are to be given up to the Agricultural Committee , - which will seek to secure action upon the Compound Lard and Meat Inspection bills if not interfered with by the General Deficiency bill ? The Elections Committee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina contested election eases , and expects tv fill in the remainder of the week in that way if opportunity offers . The General Deficiency bill , now pending , contwins one item which , if allowed to stand , will open the door to many more of the same kind in future bills . It provides for the payment of $500 to Commander Royal B. Bradford of the navy for services in installing an electric light plant in the Interior Department . Commander Bradford was at the time Inspector of Electric Lighting in the navy , and was ordered by the Secretary of the Navy to do this work under direction of the Secretary of the Interior . If this compensation is allowed it will establish n precedent by which every officer of the army or navy who is detailed for duty under another department can claim extra compensation to his salary . Among others who would profit by it would be Capt . Thomas L. Casey , Jr. , Corps of Engineers , who was detailed a few day ago for duty under the Secretary of the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing depot ; Tariff willbe the principal theme of discussion in the Senate this week . So far all the Demoeratie members of the Committee on Finance except Mr. Carlisle have delivered speeches against the pending bill . and he is expected to address the Senate Monday . It is impossible to say how long the general debate will last , as almost every Democratic Senator is understood to have a formal speech prepared for delivery . The advocates of the bill to transfer the Revtime Marine from the Treasury to the Navy Department will call it up in the morning hour , hoping to reach a vote . Although the bill is opposed by some of the most experienced and able Senators on the floor , it is concededthat , if a vote is reached , it will be passed by a decisive Majority . Unless the demand for the passage of the River and Harbor bill grows stronger than it is at present . the managers of that measure will not endeavor to bring it before the Senate this Week .
