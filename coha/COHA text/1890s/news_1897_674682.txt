txt Perhaps no man ever lived more economically in the City of New York , paying his way and earning the respect of those with whom he came in contact , than George H. Blanchard , who was found dead yesterday in the Raines law hotel , 352 West Forty-fourth Street , in the room he had occupied nearly a year and a half Scrupulously heat . in his attire , always clean and well shaven , he was an anomaly in the district , and the other lodgers during his life regarded him with curiosity , and since his death have invented many romances to account for his presence among them . On July 21 , 1899 , he rented a bedroom from Henry Benz , the proprietor of the hotel , paying a month 's rent , $6 , in advance . He paid a like amount on the 21st of each succeeding- month , never a day ahead of time and never a day behind . He took with him to the hotel a small stove , a few pictures , a trunk , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly well dressed and was bright and active , carrying the seventy-five years he gave as his age as many men a score of years younger . He was quiet and gave no trouble . Every morning he arose at 10 o'clock , and left the house , returning at midday to leave again in an hour or so . Sometimes , but not often , he spent an evening in the barroom , with , but not of , the other lodgers , listening to their talk , but seldom joining in it . About a week after he hired the room a woman , described last night by Benz as young and well dressed , called to see him . He was out , and she asked to see his room . It was shown to her , and she said she hoped Mr. ' Blanchard would find it satisfactory . Called Her His Niece . When Mr. Blanohard was told of the visit he said the woman was his niece . Once again the same woman called when he was out , and went away without leaving any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel people say letters came for him on stationery marked " Windsor Hotel , " and he said they were from his niece . He was not communicative , and only twice during all the time lie lived at the hotel did he speak of himself or any relatives . Once was about three weeks ago when he said his nephew at college near Boston " had made a hit . " He said the nephew 's name was Andrews , and he had just made a great speech . The other time was when the question of shipbuilding was broached . He talked so enthusiastically on the subject that one of his hearers remarked , " You seem to know something of ships ? " The old man laughed and said : " Know something about them Why , I 've built and owned them . " Then he lapsed into silence . Early last week he appeared weak and suffering , and Mrs. Benz suggested that he consult a doctor . " No doctor can help me , " he said , quietly . " It 's old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retired earlier than usual . When he had not been seen at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon and did not reply to knocking at his door , Benz notified the police , and the door was broken open . He was dead in his dead , having evl- ' dently died in His body was taken to the Morgue and his effects were carried to the West Forty-seventh Street Police Station that the police might examine his papers and try to find his relatives . It was during the examination that they learned the manner of his life for the past few months A cash book neatly and carefully kept and balanced each month for fourteen years showed that he had once had command of more money than his surroundings at his death would have indicated , and the record of his daily expenditures posted to Nov. 1 showed that he had existed either at the expense of free lunch counters or on less money than ' appears possible . Each month 's expenses in detail were told on a sheet of paper borrowed from some hotel , and the totals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and completed to Nov. 1 . In all the entries there is not a blot nor an erasure , and the balances are ruled out in red ink : His List of Ex-nenses . The personal expenditures for seven months of the present year were as follows : For April , ( written on St. Cloud Hotel paper , ) total expenses , including room rent , $9.22 ; for May , ( on Continental Hotel paper , ) $0.42 ; for June and July , ( on St. Denis paper , ) $9.93 and 87.88 , respectively ; for August , ( on Broadway Central paper , ) $0.88 , and for September and October , ( on Hoffman House paper , ) $8.41 and $0.11 , respectively . The largest expenditure on any one day , according to the list , was 29 cents , made up of flour , 8 cents ; coffee , 16 cents ; meal , 5 cents . This last item , " meal , 5 cents , " appears nearly every day . The " 8 cents ' worth of flour " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weekly allowance ; milk , 7 cents , appears every two weeks . Other entries on the book refer to larger amounts . For instance , Jan. 4 , 1884 , received for Alabama claim $1,074 ; Feb. 6 and Oct. 15 , 1884 , paid on Alabama claim $9 and $9.75 ; Sept. 24 , 1884 , by one-half Alabama claim , *155 . C. Menziiheimer &; Co. , Wall Street , Sept. 1 , 1889 , to margin 100 shares C. &; R. Island at 102 , $1,060 . Then again there were items of loans made and repaid , such as " Loaned Harrington for paint $2 , . $1 , $1.50 , " &c.,; and " received'from Harrington , " &c.; Details of a journey costing $257 to Washington , Chicago , and Cincinnati followed the Alabama claim items and other smaller charges for railroad fares . In all the papers , and there were two paper boxes full , there was no mention of any regular source of income . Another curious thing was that none of the lists of expenditures included the item of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always spotless , and the dozen or more shirts , collars , and cuffs found in his trunk were clean , starched , and ironed . Among the papers was book No. 148.068 of the Union Dime Savings Bank , issued in September . 1883 , to Abigail Andrews . The deposits ranged from $25 to $100 . The last deposit was made in January , 1896 , and the last withdrawal two months later . The book shows a credit balance of $1.37 . No Trace of His Niece . It was thought , as Mr. Blanchard had referred to his nephew Andrews , that Abigail Andrews might be his niece , the woman who had written to him from the Windsor Hotel . The clerk there , however , said he knew no one of that name . Outside one envelope was written : " Plans of George H. Blanchard 's lots in Evergreen Cemetery , Portland , Me . " In the envelope was a record of the births , marriages , and deaths of the Blanchard family , dating back to 1814 . The most recent recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. , Feb. 1 , 1S89 , and Almira B. Perkins . who died in 1896 . There was also the card of Frank M. Flood , 278 Congress Street , Portland , Me. , Superintendent of the Evergreen Cemetery . On the bullhead of W. H. Flattau , auctioneer , was a statement showing that on May 7 last Mr. Flattau had sold for Mr. Blanchard five oil paintings , a liqueur set , and a gas stove , for $12.45 . In the pockets of the clothes the old man took off when he went to bed Tuesday night were $1.27 in cash and a handsome gold watch and chain of modern make . Many theories concerning the old man were evolved around ' the hotel last night . Among them was one that he was a miser , very rich , but too mean to spend his money . The man who thought that reminded his hearers that he had once bought . Mr. Blanchard a glass of beer . He was promptly contradicted by Mr. Berry , who said Mr. Blanchard had ' made it a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drank upon ' paying for it himself . Other theory was that Mr. Blanchard had a small income , and had starved himself to Day for the education of the niece and nephew of whom he had spoken .
