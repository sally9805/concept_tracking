txt It is a queer ? notion of how to get votes that the gang in Brooklyn have . On Saturday a lot of them invaded the rooms of the Young Men 's Democratic Club and tried to prevent an indorsement of Mr. SCHHLttl.X and to force one of Mr. Boom . Had they succeeded , do they really think that any-member of the club who wanted to votes for SCHIEREN would on that account vote for BOODY f Or do they suppose that the genuine members of the club would not have got the facts before the voters and so have turned the spurious indorsement of BOODY into an effective influence for SCIIIEREN 1 The whole proceeding was on the level of these fellows ' intelligence . They are not only wicked , but thick-headed , and the more they have their own way the more they tend to defeat their own objects . Quite in lines with theirsgeneral blundering is their attempt to stop the sale of TEIE NEw-Ytak Turns in  --  Brooklyia . They seem to imagine that a business concern with the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to balk a vulgar , shallow trick of this sort . These are so accustomed to dealing with the keepers of saloons and contractors dependent on the ring for daily bread that they have a notion that they can deal with a well-established newspaper in the same manner . So far as THE TIMES is concerned , they have already found out their mistake . Meanwhile , how do the people of Brooklyn like the idea 9f keeping for another term a Mayor who is ruder the thumb of this kind of a ring 7 The incident is of no sort of consequence to THE TIMES and only adds interest to a fight in which it already had entered with the intention of carrying " to a finish , " but it threw ? a good deal of light on the character and methods that have prevailed in the Brooklyn City Government . and will go on from bad to worse unless Mr. BOODY shall be driven out . One of the five towns in Connecticut that paid $34,000 to facilitate the passage of the bill which transferred from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Hartford , which contains the capital city . This town 's share of the fund was a little more than ? $15,000 , and the expenditure of the money gill be discussed at a town meeting to be held to-day . The annual meetings of three of the five towns have already been held . and at one of them a committee of investigation was appointed . The meeting in Hartford promises to be quite interesting . The Democratic State Convention was in terms urged to nominate MAYNARD for the Court of Appeals to " pay the debt " the party owed him . This appeal was made by Mr. RIDGWAY , District Attorney of Kings County . It was sustained by the vote of Mr. PEARSALL of the same county , now candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court in the Second District . The - debt " thus acknowledged was the stealing of a seat in the Senate . What Mr. PEARSALL 'S standard of equity would be , were he elected a Judge , is thus made plain . His opponent is Mr. GAYNOR , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capable Judge , exactly the opposite of Mr. PEARSALL . The surrender of FRAIN:cis H. WEEKS by the Government of Costa Rica is to be regarded as an act of friendliness and international comity , whatever assurances of reciprocal action may have been asked or granted . The occasion may have been used for suggesting the desirability of a regular treaty of extradition between the two countries , and that desirability may have been officially conceded . But there is no reason to assume that WEEKS would not have been , given up regardless of such consideration . There is no public or national interest to be served by refusal to surrender fugitives from justice whose criminal violation of the laws of their own country is clearly shown . It is for the mutual interests of all civilized countries that this should be done , and crimes like those with which WEEKS is charged are of a kind that it is the least safe to allow to go unpunished . Modern society rests so much upon confidence that betrayal of trust and embezzlement of funds in the keeping of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tolerated . No doubt Costa Rica would have surrendered WEEKS on the evidence presented of his crimes in any case , but the occasion was one which showed conclusively enough that a reciprocal obligation to surrender fugitives from justice ought to be entered into by the two countries .
