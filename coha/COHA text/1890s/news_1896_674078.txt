txt The reason why the vote in the State Senate against transferring the Pavey School bill from the Cities Committee to the Committee on Education is to be regarded as a test of . the position of that body on the whole question of school reform in this city is that the Committee on Cities is a political concern devised by Mr. PLATT to serve his own ends . It has its hands full of party schemes , while the Committee on Education is not a busy one . If a bill remodeling the school system of this city is not a proper measure for its consideration , it is difficult to see what use there is in having a Committee on Education at all . Mr. PLATT 'S Chairman of the Cities Committee , a countryman from the Oswego-Madison district , remarked that the bill had little reference to the subject of education or the management of schools , but related to a " political department of the metropolis . " That reveals the PlattLhuterbach-Tammany idea of what a Department of Education is for . Whether there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers and the conduct of schools or a Board of Superintendents trained in educational work is , according to that- idea , not a matter of education or school management , but of offices and patronage . Mr. ELLSWORTH , the Republican leader of the Senate , expressed the same idea , declaring that this bill affected , not education , but the " framework of the government " of the municipality . Therefore it should go to a political committee . The theory of the Pavey bill is that the control and direction of the public schools of this city is a matter of education which should not be perverted by politics . The theory of the Page bill is that it is a matter of city government , of offices and appointments , and association with political influence . That is the plain difference , and it determined the committee reference and the vote by which the reference was decided . The Platt and Tammany Senators voted together , and the Republicans generally were on the side of keeping the schools in politics instead of devoting them to education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Legislature , which bids fair to be the most partisan and the least publicspirited that has sat at Albany in many a year .
