txt The Navy Department at 4 o'clock posted the following bulletin : " The Monterey has been ordered to Mar nila to reinforce the Asiatic Squadron . " The Monterey is a tower of strength in herself , and her addition to Admiral Dewey 's force , together with the dispatch of thousands of troops to Manila , is ample evidence that the Administration has assumed no half-hearted attitude toward the Philippines question , and is determined to take no chalices of dispossession until such time as the United States itself has arranged for the disposition of the islands . The Monterey is probably the most formidable monitor in the world , yet she corm bines with the enormous offensive and defensive qualities of the monitor type a sea-worthiness that is almost phenomenal . The Monterey is described technically as a barbed turret , low free board monitor of 4,000 tons ' displacement . She is 256 feet long , 59 feet beam , and 14 feet 6 inches draught . She carries in two turrets , surrounded by barbettes , two 12-inch and two 10-inch guns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-pounders , four 1-pounders , and two Gatlings . The turrets are 71/2 and 8 inches thick i and the sur-rounding barbettes are 14 inches and 111/1 inches of steel , and against this armor all the batteries in Manila might thunder away without effecting an entrance . The Monterey 's personnel is 19 officers and 172 men . and once she is safely in the entrance-of Manila harbor nothing in the Spanish Navy would be likely to budge her from her poSt . Her dispatch therefore may have important bearing upon the plans of the Spanish Government , so openly published , of sending reinforcements to Manua . The only doubt is to the feasibility of sending the Monterey is her small coal capacity . She has bunker , room for only 20.0 tons of , coal , arid though more might be stored on her decks , it is doubtful whether she could at the utmost carry more than enough coal to take her to Honolulu , one-third of the way to the Philippines . It is probable that the Monterey will go in convoy , and after exhausiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must either be towed about 2,000 miles of her trip or perform the difficult operation of coaling at sea . In the absence of any official information , the inference is drawn that the Strategy Board considers it at least probable that the Spaniards may dispatch their Cadiz reserve squadron , including the first-class battleship Pelayo , to the Philippines , and that the Monterey has been selected to relieve Admiral Dewey as the only warship in Pacific waters approaching the battleship class . Whether the Navy Department has information of the Spanish plans which it has not made public is not known , but It is within the probabilities that it is advised of the actual dispatching of a squadron of Spanish men-of-war to retake the Philippines from Admiral Dewey . It is not supposed for a moment that the Monterey would be started on the long and tedious journey to Manila unless the naval authorities had good ground for believing that she Would be needed there to combat vessels of more formidable type than Admiral Dewey 's Ships . Whether the dispatching of the bfg monitor to Manila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself is not known , but that is considered unlikely . It is thought to be much . more probable that the Board of Naval Strategy has acted on its own initiative in the matter , based on the possibility of the Spaniards sending a formidable squadron to the islands . With the Charleston , which sailed from San Francisco to-day for Manila , and the Monterey . it is pointed out that Dewey would be prepared to meet any fleet the Spaniards can possibly send against him . The Monterey is considered one of the most powerful fighting vessels of the new navy , apd she would be a full match ' for the Pelayo , the crack battleship of the Cadiz squadron . The 69 eat need of the expedition is transports . It is now three weeks since Dewey fought the battle of Manila Bay , but , with the exception of the small number of men sent forward by the cruiser Charleston , not one step actually hag beeh-faken toward dispatching him the reinforcements he needs .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
