txt The force of the coal miners ' strike seems to be broken by the substantial failure to make it general in West Virginia and in Illinois . The only hope that the leaders of the strike had of being able to enforce their demands lay in their ability practically- to stop production and bring the pressure of interests thus injured upon the employers . The very considerable but still partial stoppage which they effected only increased the profits of the operators still running their mines , and put these in a position to offer better terms to their own men , as in many instances they seem to have done . Two plans for a peaceable settlement have been .. proposed . ' One is what is - known as " uniformity ' plan . " The chief features ofs this - , Were . the , uniform regulation of the screening and weighing of the coal , under joint inspection by representatives of employers and the men , and the abolition of all " company stores . " The plan seems to have been good as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate basis for permanent good relations . It has failed as yet to receive the assent of the Eastern operators , and without almost complete accord it can not be carried out . The other plan is that of general arbitration . This is likely to be accepted in Illinois , but is rejected flatly by President RA . TCHFORD of the Miners ' National Executive Board . The danger now impending is that , as the chances of defeat increase , the miners already out may break into violence . That ' Would be most pitiful , for it could have but one result ? final repression , which would have to be more ' severe the longer it was delayed . It should therefore be carefully guarded against and where necessary be met promptly . In the meanwhile there have been admissions made by such men as Senator HANNA , President DE AnmiTT , and Col. REND as to the real sufferings and wrongs of the miners that ought to lead to some permanent readjustment . That would be a matter of justice , of humanity , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
