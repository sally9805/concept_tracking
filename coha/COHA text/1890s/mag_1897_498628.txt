BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER . GRANT 'S DASH FOR PETERSBURG . THE START FOR THE JAMES . T dark on the evening of June12 the famous march to the James began . General Grant had acted with his usual secrecy in regard to important movements , and had spoken of his detailed plans to only a few officers upon whose reticence he could rely implicitly , and whom he was compelled to take into his secret in order to make the necessary preparations . The orders for the movement were delivered to commanders in the strictest confidence . Smith 's corps began its march that night to White House , its destination having been changed from Coles 's Landing on the Chickahominy ; and on its arrival it embarked for Bermuda Hundred , the position occupied by Butler in the angle between the James River and the Appomattox . A portion of Wilson 's division of cavalry which had not accompanied Sheridan pushed forward to Long Bridge on the Chickahominy , fifteen miles below Cold Harbor . All the bridges on that river had been destroyed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream under great difficulty ; but they soon succeeded in reaching the opposite bank in sufficient numbers to drive away the enemy 's cavalry pickets . A pontoon-bridge was then rapidly constructed . Warren had kept close to the cavalry , and on the morning of the 13th his whole corps had crossed the bridge . Hancock 's corps followed . Burnside set out on the road to Jones 's Bridge , twenty miles below Cold Harbor , and was followed by Wright . Cavalry covered the rear . Warren moved out some distance on the Long Bridge road , so as to watch the routes leading toward Richmond and hold the bridge across the White Oak Swamp . He was to make demonstrations which were intended to deceive Lee and give him the impression that our army was turning his right with the intention of either moving upon Richmond or crossing the James above City Point . How completely successful this movement was in confusing the enemy will be seen later . General Grant started from his camp near Old Cold Harbor on the night of June 12 . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds that it was difficult to see more than a short distance , and the march was exceedingly tedious and uncomfortable . The artillerymen would at times have to walk ahead of the battery horses , and locate the small bridges along the road by feeling for them . GRANT 'S SECRETIVENESS . AFTER the general had got some miles out on the march from Cold Harbor , an officer of rank joined him , and as they rode along began to explain a plan which he had sketched , providing for the construction of another line of intrenchments , some distance in rear of the lines then held by us , to be used in case the army should at any time want to fall back and move toward the James , and should be attacked while withdrawing . The general kept on smoking his cigar , listened to the proposition for a time , and then quietly remarked to the astonished officer : ( ( The army has already pulled out from the enemy 's front , and is now on its march to the James . ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets could be kept . He had never been a secretive man until the positions of responsibility in which he was placed compelled him to be chary in giving expression to his opinions and purposes . He then learned the force of the philosopher 's maxim that ( ( the unspoken word is a sword in the scabbard , while the spoken word is a sword in the hand of one 's enemy . ) ) In the field there were constant visitors to the camp , ready to circulate carelessly any intimations of the commander 's movements , at the risk of having such valuable information reach the enemy . Any encouraging expression given to an applicant for favors was apt to be tortured into a promise , and the general 823 // naturally became guarded in his intercourse . When questioned beyond the bounds of propriety , his lips closed like a vise , and the obtruding party was left to supply all the subsequent conversation . These circumstances proclaimed him a man who studied to be uncommunicative , and gave him a reputation for reserve which could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( American Sphinx , * ( ( Ulysses the Silent , ) ) and the ( ( Great Unspeakable , ) ) and was popularly supposed to move about with sealed lips . It is true that he had no ( ( small talk ) ) introduced merely for the sake of talking , and many a one will recollect the embarrassment of a first encounter with him resulting from this fact ; but while , like Shakspere 's soldier , he never wore his dagger in his mouth , yet in talking to a small circle of friends upon matters to which he had given special consideration , his conversation was so thoughtful , philosophical , and original that he fascinated all who listened to him . STEALING A MARCH ON THE ENEMY . THE next morning ( June 13 ) the general made a halt at Long Bridge , where the head of Hancock 's corps had arrived , and where he could be near Warren 's movement and communicate promptly with him . That evening he reached Wilcox 's Landing , and went into camp on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crossing was to take place . Hancock 's corps made a forced march , and reached the river at Wilcox 's Landing on the afternoon of June 13 . Wright 's and Burnside 's corps arrived there the next day . Warren 's corps withdrew on the night of the 13th from the position to which it had advanced , and reached the James on the afternoon of the 14th . The several corps had moved by forced marches over distances of from twenty-five to fifty-five miles , and the effect of the heat and dust , and the necessity of every man 's carrying an ample supply of ammunition *nd rations , rendered the marches fatiguing in the extreme . Although the army started on the night of the 12th , it was not until the next morning that Lee had any knowledge of the fact , and even then he wholly misunderstood the movement . He telegraphed to Richmond at 10 P. M. on the 13th : " At daybreak this morning it was discovered that the army of General Grant had left our front . Our skirinishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover the enemy , were withdrawn , and the army was moved to conform to the route taken by him . . . . * It VOL . LIIJ. - 104. will be seen from this that Lee was occupied with Warren 's advance directly toward Richmond , and made his army conform to this route , while Grant , with the bulk of his forces , was marching in an entirely different direction . On the 14th General Grant took a small steamer and ran up the river to Bermuda Hundred , to have a personal interview with General Butler and arrange plans for his forces to move out at once and make an attack upon Petersburg . Grant knew now that he had stolen a march on Lee , and that Petersburg was almost undefended ; and with his usual fondness for taking the offensive , he was anxious to hasten the movement which he had had in contemplation against that place , to be begun before the Army of the Potomac should arrive . His instructions were that as soon as Smith 's troops reached their destination they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared from Butler 's troops ,  --  about 6000 ,  --  and move at once against Petersburg . General Grant returned to Wilcox 's Landing at 1 P. M. He had sent a despatch from Bermuda Hundred to Washington , giving briefly the situation of the army and the progress of the movement . That afternoon reports were received showing pretty definitely Lee 's present position ; for Grant , with the energy and system which he never failed to employ in securing prompt information regarding his opponent 's movements , had had Lee 's operations closely watched . THE PASSAGE OF THE JAMES . THE work of laying the great pontoon-bridge across the James began at 4 P. M. on June 14 , and was finished by midnight . It was twentyone hundred feet in length , and required one hundred and one pontoons . These pontoons were attached to vessels that were anchored above and below for this purpose . Admiral Lee 's fleet took position in the river , and assisted in covering the passage of the troops . Hancock began to move his corps on ferry-boats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 15th his entire infantry had been transferred to the south side of the James , with four batteries of artillery . By 6:30 A. M. three ferry-boats had been added to the number in use , which greatly facilitated the passage of his wagons and artillery . Butler had been ordered to send sixty thousand rations to Hancock that morning . Hancock waited for them till eleven o'clock , and then started for Petersburg without them . General Grant now received the following answer to his despatch // of the day before to the President : 4 begin to see it . You will succeed . God bless you all . A. Lincoln . ) ) By midnight of the 16th the army , with all its artillery and trains , had been safely transferred to the south side of the James without a serious accident or the loss of a wagon or an animal , and with no casualties except those which occurred in the minor encounters of Warren 's corps and the cavalry with the enemy . This memorable operation , when examined in all its details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in logistics . A BRILLIANT SPECTACLE . As the general-in-chief stood upon the bluff on the north bank of the river on the morning of June 15 , watching with unusual interest the busy scene spread out before him , it presented a sight which had never been equaled even in his extended experience in all the varied phases of warfare . his cigar had been thrown aside , his hands were clasped behind him , and he seemed lost in the contemplation of the spectacle . The great bridge was the scene of a continuous movement of infantry columns , batteries of artillery , and wagon-trains . The approaches to the river on both banks were covered with masses of troops moving briskly to their positions or waiting patiently their turn to cross . At the two improvised ferries steamboats were gliding back and forth with the regularity of weavers ' shuttles . A fleet of transports covered the surface of the water below the bridge , and gunboats floated lazily upon the stream , guarding the river above . 826 Drums were beating the march , bands were playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's front showed that be and the enemy were still exchanging compliments ; and mingled with these sounds were the cheers of the sailors , the shouting of the troops , the rumbling of wheels , and the shrieks of steam-whistles . The bright sun , shining through a clear sky upon the scene , cast its sheen upon the water , was reflected from the burnished gun-barrels and glittering cannon , and brought out with increased brilliancy the gay colors of the waving banners . The calmly flowing river reflected the blue of the heavens , and mirrored on its surface the beauties of nature that bordered it . The rich grain was standing high in the surrounding fields . The harvest was almost ripe , but the harvesters had fled . The arts of civilization had recoiled before the science of destruction ; and in looking from the growing crops to the marching columns , the gentle smile of peace contrasted strangely with the savage frown of war . It was a matchless pageant that could not fail to inspire all beholders with the grandeur of achievement and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived and whose skill had executed this masterly movement stood watching the spectacle in profound silence . Whether his mind was occupied with the contemplation of its magnitude and success , or was busied with maturing plans for the future , no one can tell . After a time he woke from his reverie , mounted his horse , and gave orders to have headquarters ferried across to the south bank of the river . On arriving there , he set out for City Point ; but he had MAP OF THE PETERSBURG CAMPAIGN . // ridden only a short distance when a small steamer came along , and as he wished to reach City Point as quickly as possible to direct operations from there , he decided to go aboard the boat . It was hailed , and took him on , with Parker and a couple of other staffofficers . The rest of us went by land , so as to take some instructions to Hancock 's corps and to familiarize ourselves with that part of the country . Upon reaching City Point , headquarters were established on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appomattox rivers . I have said that the passage of the James had been effected without the loss of an animal . A proper regard for strict veracity requires a modification of the statement . The headquarters mess had procured a Virginia cow the rich milk of which went far toward compensating for the shortcomings in other supplies . While preparing to ferry across the river , the cow was tied to a tree to prevent her from turning deserter , and in the hurry of embarking was entirely forgotten . The mess felt the loss keenly until another animal was procured . That evening at the dinnertable , when reference was made to the incident , the general said : ( ( Well , it seems that the loss of animals in this movement falls most heavily upon headquarters . ) ) W. F. SMITH 'S ATTACK ON PETERSBURG . GENERAL WILLIAM F. SMITH had disembarked his troops at Bermuda Hundred during the preceding night ( the 14th ) , had started immediately upon his movement against Petersburg , and had struck the Confederate pickets the next morning , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle-pits and heavy thickets . After some hard fighting he was driven from his position ; our troops then moved forward , and by half-past one o'clock arrived at a point from which it was thought that an assault could be made upon the intrencbments . Reconnaissances were made during the afternoon , and finally Smith decided that a direct assault would be too hazardous , and at half-past seven o'clock threw forward his troops in strong skirmish-lines . After a short struggle the enemy was forced back from his intrenchments in front of our center and left , and Smith 's second line then made an attack upon the rest of the works . The Confederates were now driven back at all points , four guns were captured and turned upon the retreating troops , and before dark the whole line of intrenchments , about two miles long , had been carried , and three hundred prisoners and sixteen pieces of artillery captured . Instead of following up this advantage with his whole force and seizing the city , Smith again delayed until night came on . Staff-officers from Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marching toward him . The head of Hancock 's troops reached a point a mile in the rear of Hinks 's division of Smith 's command about half-past six , and two divisions of Hancock 's corps were ordered to push on and cooperate in the pending movement . Hancock himself rode forward to where Smith was , to learn the exact situation and participate in the attack ; and though senior in rank , waived his rights in this respect , and left Smith in command of the operations , for the reason that he was more familiar with the ground and the movements of the troops up to that time . It was now after dark , and Smith contented himself with ordering up the two divisions of Hancock 's corps to occupy the works which had been captured . This was not accomplished until about eleven o'clock , and the object of the movement had failed . General Grant 's belief regarding the very inferior force in Petersburg proved to be entirely correct . While the works were well supplied with artillery , about the only available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and Deering 's cavalry of 2000 . Besides this force there was only the local militia , composed of old men and young boys , who had never seen active service , and were no match for veterans . It was a moonlight night ; Kautz and Hinks were quite familiar with the country ; Smith had lost only about 600 men , and a bold dash upon the city after the works had been so gallantly captured would undoubtedly have secured the prize and made a vast difference in the campaign which followed . Instead of letting Butler , the actual commander of the forces , take charge of the operation , the commander-in-chief had especially delegated Smith for it , as he was an educated soldier , and by his intelligence had commended himself to General Grant as an officer well fitted for such a task . Grant had won all his great successes by boldness and the vigor and rapidity of his movements , and it was hard for him to understand how others could be so lacking in these qualities . General Smith said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard rumors that the enemy was crossing the James to reinforce Petersburg , and that he thought it best to hold on to the position he had secured , instead of advancing and taking the // chance of his troops meeting with disaster and losing what they had already gained . When the general felt that his subordinates had made a bold fight and had done their best , he always commended them for any soldierly traits they had displayed . His displeasure was aroused only when officers failed to comprehend the scope of his plans , and neglected to use to advantage the means which he placed in their hands . He had just reason to feel grievously disappointed over the failure of the admirable plan conceived for the capture of Petersburg . He had used all the arts of which he was master in preparing and conducting this memorable movement across the James , which was beset at all points by innumerable difficulties . He had thrown nearly 16,000 troops against Petersburg before Lee had sent a single reinforcement there , and had moved them by transports so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a perfect knowledge of Lee 's movements , Grant had brought the advance of his army in front of Petersburg on the 15th , while Lee was still groping about to discover his opponent 's movements . In reaching this point , Grant had marched more than twice the distance of Lee 's route , and had crossed two rivers , one a most formidable obstacle . It was no wonder that he felt keen disappointment when Smith 's command failed to seize the golden opportunity he had prepared ; but brilliant generals , like eminent sculptors , in executing their best conceptions sometimes find that their tools break in their hands . DONNING SUMMER UNIFORM . THE weather had become so warm that the general and most of the staff had ordered thin , dark-blue flannel blouses to be sent to them to take the place of the heavy uniform coats which they had been wearing . The summer clothing had arrived , and was now tried on . The general 's blouse , like the others , was of plain material , single-breasted , and had four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat of a private soldier , with nothing to indicate the rank of an officer except the three gold stars of a lieutenant-general on the shoulder-straps . He wore at this time a turn-down white linen collar and a small , black ( ( butterfly * cravat , which was hooked on to his front collar-button . The general , when he put on the blouse , did not take the pains to see whether it fitted him or to notice how it looked , but thought only of the comfort it afforded , and said , " Well , this is a relief , ) ) and then added : " I have never taken as much satisfaction as some people in making frequent changes in my outer clothing . I like to put on a suit of clothes when I get up in the morning , and wear it until I go to bed , unless I ht*ve to make a change in my dress to meet company . I have been in the habit of getting one coat at a time , putting it on and wearing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of using a best and a second best . I know that is not the right way to manage , but a comfortable coat seems like an old friend , and I do n't like to change it. * The general had also received a pair of light , neatly fitting calfskin boots , to which he seemed to take a fancy ; thereafter he wore them most of the time in place of his heavy top-boots , putting on the latter only when he rode out in wet weather . PETERSBURG . ON the morning of June 16 General Grant went to the Petersburg front . He was accompanied by most of his staff , and by Mr. Dana , Assistant Secretary of War . The enemy was then constantly arriving and occupying his intrenchments in strong force . Burnside 's corps had just come up , and was put in position on Hancock 's left . At 10 : 15 A. M. Grant sent an order to 1Ieade to hurry Warren forward , and start up the river himself by steamer and take command in person at Petersburg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were in some places strong . They started at a point on the south bank of the Appomattox , about a mile from the eastern outskirts of the city , and extended in the form of a semicircle to a point on the river at about the same distance from the western limits of the city . Petersburg had at that time a population of 18,000 , and was called the ( ( Cockade City ) ) from the fact that at the . breaking out of the war of 1812 it furnished a company which was peculiarly uniformed and in which each man wore in his hat a conspicuous cockade . The probability of Lee 's attacking Bermuda Hundred in force induced General Grant to return to City Point to direct the movements on Butler 's lines . While riding in that direction he met Meade hurrying forward from the steamer-landing . In a short interview , and without dismounting from his horse , he instructed that officer to move at once to the front and make a vigorous attack upon the works at Petersburg at six o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible , across the Appomattox . It was discovered before that hour that the enemy was advancing upon Butler 's front , and General Grant directed me to ride at full speed to Meade and tell him that this made it still more important that his attack should be a vigorous one , and that the enemy might be found weaker there on account of troops having been collected at Bermuda Hundred . I found Meade standing near the edge of a piece of woods , surrounded by some of his staff , and actively engaged in superintending the attack , which was then in progress . His usual nervous energy was displayed in the intensity of his manner and the rapid and animated style of his conversation . He assured me that no additional orders could be given which could add to the vigor of the attack . He was acting with great earnestness , and doing his utmost to carry out the instructions which he had received . He had arrived at the front about two o'clock , and his plans had been as well matured as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of earthworks connecting them , were captured . The enemy felt the loss keenly , and made several desperate attempts during the night to recover the ground , but in this he did not succeed . When I got back to City Point that evening General Grant felt considerably encouraged by the news brought him , and spent most of the night in planning movements for the next day . LEE MYSTIFIED AS TO GRANT 'S MOVEMENTS . AFTER further consultation with the general-in-chief I started again for the front at Petersburg before dawn on the 17th , carrying instructions looking to the contemplated attacks that day . Burnside 's troops surprised the enemy at daybreak by making a sudden rush upon his works , captured his intrenchments , swept his line for a mile , and took 600 prisoners , a stand of colors , 4 guns , and 1500 stands of small arms . Attacks were also made by Hancock and Warren , and more of the enemy 's line was captured , but not permanently held . Telegrams sent by General Lee on June 17 show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in regard to Grant 's movements . At 12 *i. he sent a despatch to Beauregard , saying : ( ( Until I can get more definite information of Grant 's movements , I do not think it prudent to draw more troops to this side of the river . ) ) At 1:45 P.M. he tele graphed : ( ( Warren 's corps crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge on the 13th ; ... that night it marched to Westover . Some prisoners were taken from it on the 14th ; have not heard of it since. * At 4 : 30 he sent Beauregard another despatch , saying : ( ( Have no information of Grant 's crossing the James River , but upon your report have ordered troops up to Chaffin 's Bluff . ) ) Grant , on the contrary , had ascertained from watchers on Butler 's tall signal-tower , which had been erected at Bermuda Hundred , just how many railway-trains with troops had passed toward Petersburg , and learned from the columns of dust that large forces were marching south . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day a close knowledge of Lee 's movements . A CHANGE OF COMPLEXION . COLONEL PARKER , the Indian , had been diligently employed in these busy days helping to take care of General Grant 's correspondence . He wrote an excellent hand , and as one of the military secretaries often overhauled the general 's correspondence and prepared answers to his private letters . This evening he was seated at the writingtable in the general 's tent , while his chief was standing at a little distance outside talking with some of the staff . A citizen who had come to City Point in the employ of the Sanitary Commission , and who had been at Cairo when the general took command there in 1861 , approached the group and inquired : ( ( Where is the old man 's tent ? I d like to get a look at him ; have n't seen him for three years . ) ) Rawlins , to avoid being interrupted , said , ( ( That s his tent , ) ) at the same time pointing to it . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the swarthy features of Parker as he sat in the general 's chair . The visitor seemed a little puzzled , and as he walked away was heard to remark : ( ( Yes , that 's him ; but he s got all-fired sunburnt since I last had a look at him . ) ) The general was greatly amused by the incident , and repeated the remark afterward to Parker , who enjoyed it as much as the others . MEADE IN ACTION . AT daylight on the 18th Meade 's troops advanced to the assault which had been ordered , but made the discovery that the enemy 's line of the day before had been abandoned . By the time new formations could be made Lee 's army had arrived in large force , great activity had been displayed in strengthening the forti // fications , and the difficulties of the attacking party had been greatly increased . The Second Corps was temporarily commanded by D. B. Birney , as Hancock 's Gettysburg xvound had broken out afresh the day before , entirely disabling him . Gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birney ; and while they did not succeed in the object of carrying the enemy 's main line of fortifications , positions were gained closer to his works , and these were held and strongly intrenched . Both of the opposing lines on this part of the ground were now strengthened , and remained substantially the same in position from that time until the capture of Petersburg . General Grant realized the nature of the ground and the circumstances that prevented the troops from accomplishing more than had been done , and he complimented Meade upon the promptness and vigor with which he had handled his army on this day of active operations . Indeed , Meade had shown brilliant qualities as commander of a large army , and under the general directions given him had made all the dispositions and issued all the detailed orders . Grant felt it necessary to remain at City Point in order to be in communication with both Meade and Butler , as Lee 's troops were that day moving rapidly south past Butler 's front . My duties kept me on Meade 's front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personification of earnest , vigorous action in rousing his subordinate commanders to superior exertions . Even his fits of anger and his resort to intemperate language stood him at times in good stead in spurring on every one upon that active field . He sent ringing despatches to all points of the line , and paced up and down upon the field in his nervous , restless manner , as he watched the progress of the operations and made running comments on the actions of his subordinates . His aquiline nose and piercing eyes gave him something of the eagle 's look , and added to the interest of his personality . He had much to try him upon this occasion , and if he was severe in his reprimands and showed faults of temper , he certainly displayed no faults as a commander . When the battle was over no one was more ready to make amends for the instances in which he felt that he might have done injustice to his subordinates . He said to them : ( ( Sorry to hear you can not carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to hold it . I suppose you can not make any more attacks , and I feel satisfied all has been done that can be done. * Lee himself did not arrive at Petersburg until noon that day . After I had returned to headquarters that evening , and had given the general-in-chief reports of the battle in more detail than he had received them by despatches during the day , he sat in his tent and discussed the situation philosophically , saying : ( ( Lee 's whole army has now arrived , and the topography of the country about Petersburg has been well taken advantage of by the enemy in the location of strong works . I will make no more assaults on that portion of the line , but will give the men a rest , and then look to extensions toward our left , with a view to destroying Lee 's communications on the south and confining him to a close siege . ) ) At ten o'clock he turned to his table and wrote the following message to Meade : " I am perfectly satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the assaults of to-day were called for by all the appearances and information that could be obtained . Now we will rest the men , and use the spade for their protection until a new vein can be struck . . . CONDITION OF THE ARMY . IT was apparent in the recent engagements that the men had not attacked with the same vigor that they had displayed in the Wilderness campaign ; but this was owing more to the change in their physical than in their moral condition . They had moved incessantly both day and night , and had been engaged in skirmishing or in giving battle from the 4th of May to the 18th of June . They had seen their veteran comrades fall on every side , and their places filled by inexperienced recruits , and many of the officers in whom they had unshaken con*dence had been killed or wounded . Officers had been in the saddle day and night , securing snatches of sleep for a few hours at a time as best they could . Sleeping on horseback had become an art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their saddles , rest their hands on the pommel , and catch many a catnap while riding . These snatches of sleep were of short duration and accomplished under many difficulties , but often proved more refreshing than might be supposed . There was considerable suffering from sickness in many of the camps . It may be said that the enemy had suffered equally from the same causes that impaired the efficiency of our men , but there was a vast difference between the conditions of the two armies . The enemy had been engaged prin // cipally in defending strong intrenchments and in making short marches ; he was accustomed to the Southern climate , and was buoyed up with the feeling that he was defending his home and fireside . A controversy had arisen as to the cause of Hancock 's not reaching Petersburg earlier on the 15th . Hancock conceived the idea that the circumstances might be construed as a reproach upon him , and he asked for an official investigation ; but General Grant had no intention of reflecting either upon him or Meade . He assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . He recommended them both for promotion to the grade of major-general in the regular army , and each was appointed to that rank . GRANT 'S CAMP AT CITY POINT . THE headquarters camp at City Point was destined to become historic and to be the scene of some of the most memorable events of the war . It was located at the junction of the Jam*s and the Appomattox rivers , and was within easy water communication with Fort Monroe and Washington , as well as with Butler 's army , which was to occupy positions on both sides of the upper James . The City Point Railroad was repaired , and a branch was constructed to points south of Petersburg , immediately in rear of the line held by the Army of the Potomac , so that there might be convenient communication with that army . The new portion of the road was built , like most of our military railroads , upon the natural surface of the ground , with but little attempt at grading . It ran up hill and down dale , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in the distance like a fly crawling over a corrugated washboard . At City Point there was a level piece of ground on a high bluff , on which stood a comfortable house . This building was assigned to the chief quartermaster , and General Grant 's headquarters camp was established on the lawn . The tents occupied a line a little over a hundred feet back from the edge of the bluff . In the middle of the line were General Grant 's quarters . A hospital tent was used as his office , while a snialler tent connecting in the rear was occupied as his sleeping-apartment . A hospital tent-fly was stretched in front of the office tent so as to make a shaded space in which persons could sit . A rustic bench and a number of folding camp-chairs with backs were placed there , and it was beneath this tentfly that most of the important official interviews were held . When great secrecy was to be observed the parties would retire to the office tent . On both sides of the general 's quarters were pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each tent was occupied by two officers . The mess-tent was pitched in the rear , and at a short distance still farther back a temporary shelter was prepared for the horses . A wooden staircase was built reaching from headquarters to the steamboat-landing at the foot of the bluff ; ample wharves , storehouses , and hospitals were rapidly constructed , and a commodious base of supplies was established in the vicinity . The day the wharf was completed and planked over the general took a stroll along it , his hands thrust in his trousers pockets , and a lighted cigar in his mouth . He bad recently issued instructions to take every precaution against fire , and had not gone far when a sentinel called out : ( ( It s against orders to come on the wharf with a lighted cigar . ) ) The general at once took his Havana out of his mouth and threw it into the river , saying : *I do n't like to lose my smoke , but the sentinel s right . He evidently is n't going to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EACH staff-officer took his turn in acting as ( ( caterer ) ) of the mess , usually for a month at a time . His duties consisted in giving general directions to the steward as to ordering the meals , keeping an account of the bills , and at the end of his tour dividing up the expenses and collecting the amount charged to each officer . General Grant insisted upon paying two shares of the expenses instead of one , upon the ground that he invite ( l more guests to meals than any one else in the mess , although this was not always the case , for each officer was allowed to entertain guests , and there were at times as many visitors at table as members of the mess . The officer acting as caterer sat at the head of the mess-table , with the general on his right . It now came my turn to take a hand in managing the affairs of the mess . The general , while he never complained , was still the most difficult person to cater for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beef , and this he could not eat unless it was so thoroughly well done that no appearance of blood could be seen . If blood appeared in any meat which came on the table , the sight of it seemed entirely to destroy his appetite . // ( This was the man whose enemies delighted in calling him a butcher . ) He enjoyed oysters and fruit , but these could not be procured on an active campaign . He never ate mutton when he could obtain anything else , and fowl and game he abhorred . As he used to express it : 4 never could eat anything that goes on two legs . ) ) Evidently he could never have been converted to cannibalism . He did not miss much by declining to eat the chickens which were picked up on a campaign , for they were usually tough enough to create the suspicion that they had been hatched from hard-boiled eggs , and were so impenetrable that an officer said of one of them that he could not even stick his fork through the gravy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often made his entire meal upon a sliced cucumber and a cup of coffee . He always enjoyed corn , pork and beans , and buckwheat cakes . In fact , he seemed to be particularly fond of onlythe most indigestible dishes . He had been eating so little for several days just before I took my turn as caterer that I looked about to try to find some delicacy that would tempt his appetite , and after a good deal of pains succeeded in getting some sweetbreads sent down from Washington . They had been nicely cooked , and I announced them , when they came on the table , with an air of ill-disguised triumph ; but he said : " I hope these were not obtained especially for me , for I have a singular aversion to them . In my young days I used to eat them , not knowing exactly what part of the animal they came from ; but as soon as I learned what they were my stomach rebelled against them , and I have never tasted them Since . ) ) When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table by way of helping to ornament it , and afterward used as dessert . Between the courses of the dinner the general would often reach over to the dish of fruit and pick out a berry or a cherry and eat it slowly . He used to do this in a sly way , like a child helping itself to some forbidden dish at the table , and afraid of being caught in the act . He said one day : " I suppose I ought not to eat a course out of its turn , but I take the greatest delight in picking out bits of fruit and eating them during a meal . One of the reasons I do not enjoy dining out as much as I do at home is because I am compelled to sit through a long list of courses , few of which I eat , and to resist the constant temptation to taste a little fruit in the meanwhile to help pass away the time . ) ) Napoleon was famous for eating out of the various dishes before him with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went beyond picking out small fruits . He was always refined in his manners at table , and no matter how great was the huyry , or what were the circumstances of the occasion , he never violated the requirements of true politeness . He ate less than any man in the army ; sometimes the amount of food taken did not seem enough to keep a bird alive , and his meals were frugal enough to satisfy the tastes of the most avowed anchorite . It so happened that no one in the mess had any inclination to drink wine or spirits at meals , and none was carried among the mess* s supplies . The only beverage ever used at table besides tea and coffee was water , although on the march it was often taken from places which rendered it not the most palatable or healthful of drinks . If a staff-officer wanted anything stronger he would carry some commissary whisky in a canteen . Upon a few occasions , after a hard day 's ride in stormy weather , the general joined the officers of the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never offered liquor of any kind to visitors at headquarters . His hospitality consisted in inviting them to meals and to smoke cigars . LINCOLN 'S FIRST VISIT TO GRANT 'S CAMP . ON June 21 Butler had thrown a pontoonbridge across the James , and seized a 1 ) 0-sition on the north side known as Deep Bottom , ten miles below Richmond . General Grant had directed this with a view to divide the attention of the enemy 's troops , and to confuse them as to whether to expect an attack upon Richmond or Petersburg , and because he had in contemplation some operations on the north side of the James , which he intended to carry out under certain contingencies , in which case the occupation of Deep Bottom might become important . On Tuesday , June 21 , a white river-steamer arrived at the xvharf , bringing President Lincoln , who had embraced this opportunity to visit for the first time the armies under General Grant 's immediate command . As the boat neared the shore , the general and several of us who were with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order that the general-in-chief might meet his distinguished visitor and extend a greeting to him as soon as the boat made the landing . As our party stepped aboard , the President came down from the upper deck , where he had been standing , to the after-gangway , and reaching out his // long , angular arm , he wrung General Grant 's hand vigorously , and held it in his for some time , while he uttered in rapid words his congratulations and expressions of appreciation of the great task which had been accomplished since he and the general had parted in Washington . The group then went into the after-cabin . General Grant said : " I hope you are very well , Mr. President . ) ) ( ( Yes , I am in very good health , ) ) Mr. Lincoln replied ; ( ( but I do n't feel very comfortable after my trip last night on the bay . It was rough , and I was considerably shaken up . My stomach has not yet entirely recovered from the effects . ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arisen to make this scene the supreme moment of his life , in giving him a chance to soothe the digestive organs of the Chief Magistrate of the nation . He said : ( ( Try a glass of champagne , Mr. President . That is always a certain cure for seasickness . ) ) Mr. Lincoln looked at him for a moment , his face lighting up with a smile , and then remarked : " No , my friend ; I have seen too many fellows seasick ashore from drinking that very stuff. * This was a knockdown for the officer , and in the laugh at his expense Mr. Lincoln and the general both joined heartily . General Grant now said : " I know it would he a great satisfaction for the troops to have an opportunity of seeing you , Mr. President ; and I am sure your presence among them would have a very gratifying effect . I can furnish you a good horse , and will be most happy to escort you to points of interest along the line . ) ) Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fully intended to go out and take a look at the brave fellows who have fought their way down to Petersburg in this wonderful campaign , and I am ready to start at any time . ) LINCOLN AT THE FRONT . GENERAL GRANT presented to Mr. Lincoln the officers of the staff who were present , and he had for each one a cordial greeting and a pleasant word . There was a kindliness in his tone and a hearty manner of expression which went far to captivate all who met him . The President soon stepped ashore , and after sitting awhile at headquarters mounted the large bay horse ( ( Cincinnati , ) ) while the general rode with him on ( ( Jeff Davis . ) ) Three of us of the staff accompanied them , and the scenes encountered in visiting both Butler 's and Meade 's commands were most interesting . 1Ir . Lincoln wore a very high black silk hat and black trousers and frock-coat . Like VOL . LJIJ. - 105. most men who had been brought up in the West , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be acknowledged that in appearance he was not a very dashing rider . OT this occasion , by the time he had reached the troops he was completely covered with dust , and the black color of his clothes had changed to Confederate gray . As he had no straps , his trousers gradually worked up above his ankles , and gave him the appearance of a country farmer riding into town wearing his Sunday clothes . A citizen on horseback is always an odd sight in the midst of a uniformed army , and the picture presented by the President bordered upon the grotesque . However , the troops were so lost in admiration of the man that the humorous aspect did not seem to strike them . The soldiers rapidly passed the word along the line that ( ( Uncle Abe ) ) had joined them , and cheers broke forth from all the commands , and enthusiastic shouts and even words of familiar greeting met him on all sides . After a while General Grant said : ( ( Mr. President , let us ride on and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attack on the works in front of Petersburg last week. * ( ( Oh , yes , ) ) replied Mr. Lincoln ; " I want to take a look at those boys . I read with the greatest delight the account given in Mr. Dana 's despatch to the Secretary of War of how gallantly they behaved . He said they took six out of the sixteen guns captured that day . I was opposed on nearly every side when I first favored the raising of colored regiments ; but they have proved their efficiency , and I am glad they have kept pace with the white troops in the recent assaults . When we wanted every able-bodied man who could be spared to go to the front , and my opposers kept objecting to the negroes , I used to tell them that at such times it was just as well to be a little color-blind . I think , general , we can say of the black boys what a country fellow who was an old-time abolitionist in Illinois said when he went to a theater in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well up in Shakspere , and did n't know that the tragedian was a white man who had blacked up for the purpose . After the play was over the folks who had invited him to go to the show wanted to know what he thought of the actors , and he said : ( Waal , layin ' aside all sectional prejudices and any partiality I may have for the race , derned ef I do n't think the nigger held his own with any on em . ) ) ) The Western dialect employed in this story was perfect . // The camp of the colored troops of the Eighteenth Corps was soon reached , and a scene now occurred which defies description . They beheld for the first time the liberator of their race  --  the man who by a stroke of his pen had struck the shackles from the limbs of their fellow-bondmen and proclaimed liberty to the enslaved . Always impressionable , the enthusiasm of the blacks now knew no limits . They cheered , laughed , cried , sang hymns of praise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massa Linkum ! * " De Lord save Fader Abraham ! ) ) ( ( De day ob jubilee am come , shuah. * They crowded about him and fondled his horse ; some of them kissed his hands , while others ran off crying in triumph to their comrades that they had touched his clothes . The President rode with bared head ; the tears had started to his eyes , and his voice was so broken by emotion that he could scarcely articulate the words of thanks and congratulation which he tried to speak to the humble and devoted men through whose ranks he rode . The scene was affecting in the extreme , and no one could have witnessed it unmoved . SOME ANECDOTES BY LINCOLN . IN the evening Mr. Lincoln gathered with General Grant and the staff in front of the general 's tent , and then we had an opportunityof appreciating his charm as a talker , and hearing some of the stories for which he had become celebrated . He did not tell a story merely for the sake of the anecdote , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as our experience went , his anecdotes possessed the true geometric requisite of excellence : they were neither too broad nor too long . He seemed to recollect every incident in his experience and to weave it into material for his stories . One evening a sentinel whose post was near enough to enable him to catch most of the President 's remarks was heard to say , ( ( Well , that man s got a powerful memory and a mighty poor forgettery. * He seldom indulged even in a smile until he reached the climax of a humorous narration ; then he joined heartily with the listeners in the laugh which followed . He usually sat on a low camp-chair , and wound his legs around each other as if in an effort to get them out of the way , and with his long arms he accompanied what he said with all sorts of odd gestures . An officer once made the remark that he would rather have a single photograph of one of Mr. Lincoln 's jokes than own the negative of any other man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke of the improvement in arms and ammunition , and of the new powder prepared for the fifteen-inch guns . He said he had never seen the latter article , but he understood it differed very much from any other powder that had ever been used . I told him that I happened to have in my tent a specimen which had been sent to headquarters as a curiosity , and that I would bring it to him . When I returned with a grain of the powder about the size of a walnut , he took it , turned it over in his hand , and after examining it carefully , said : ( ( Well , it s rather larger than the powder we used to buy in my shooting days . It reminds me of what occurred once in a country meeting-house in Sangamon County . You see , there were very few newspapers then , and the country storekeepers had to resort to some other means of advertising their wares . If , for instance , the preacher happened to be late in coming to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time while the people were waiting by notifying them of any new arrival of an attractive line of goods . One evening a man rose up and said : ( Brethren , let me take occasion to say , while we re a-waitin ' , that I have jest received a new inv'ice of sportin ' powder . The grains are so small you kin sca'cely see em with the naked eye , and polished up so fine you kin stand up and comb yer ha'r in front of one o ' them grains jest like it was a lookin ' - glass. hope you 11 come down to my store at the crossroads and examine that powder for yourselves . ) When he had got about this far a rival powder-merchant in the meeting , who had been boiling over with indignation at the amount of advertising the opposition powder was getting , jumped up and cried out : ( Brethren , I hope you 11 not believe a single word Brother Jones has been sayin ' about that powder . I ye been down thar and seen it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains is bigger than the lumps in a coalpile ; and any one of you , brethren , ef you was in your future state , could put a bar'l o ' that powder on your shoulder and march squar ' through the sulphurious flames surroundin ' you without the least danger of an explosion . ) ) ) We thought that grain of powder had served even a better purpose in drawing out this story than it could ever serve in being fired from a fifteen-inch gun . As the party broke up for the night I walked into my quarters to put back the grain of powder , and upon turning round to come out , I found that the President had // followed me and was looking into my tent , from curiosity , doubtless , to see how the officers were quartered . Of course I made haste to invite him in . He stepped inside for a moment , and his eye fell upon a specimen artillery trace , a patented article which some inventor had left the day before in order to have it examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what s that ? ) ) I replied , ( ( That is a trace . ) ) ( ( Oh , ) ) remarked Mr. Lincoln , ( ( that recalls what the poet wrote : ( Sorrow had fled , but left her traces there . ) What became of the rest of the harness he did n't mention . ) ) That night Mr. Lincoln slept aboard the boat which had brought him to City Point . He had expressed to General Grant a desire to go up the James the next day , to see that portion of our lines and visit the flag-ship of Admiral Lee , who commanded the gunboats . All arrangements were made for the trip , and the President 's boat started up the river about eight o'clock the next morning , stopping at Bermud*i Hundred to take on General Butler . Admiral Lee came aboard from his flag-ship , and the party proceeded up the river as far as it was safe to ascend . Mr. Lincoln was in excellent spirits , and listened with great eagerness to the descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , and the objects for which they had been constructed . When his attention was called to some particularly strong positions which had been seized and fortified , he remarked to Butler : " When Grant once gets possession of a place , he holds on to it as if he had inherited it . ) ) Orders had been sent to have the pontoon-bridge at Deep Bottom opened for the passage of the President 's boat , so that he could proceed some distance beyond that point . His whole conversation during his visit showed the deep anxiety he felt and the weight of responsibility which was resting upon him . His face would light up for a time while telling an anecdote illustrating a subject under discussion , and afterward his features would relax and show the deep lines which had been graven upon them bythe mental strain to which he had been subjected for nearly four years . The National Republican Convention had renominated him for the Presidency just two weeks before , and some reference was made to it and to the numberof men who composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our colleges , the Electoral College is the only one where they choose their own masters . ) ) He did not show any disposition to dwell upon the subject , or upon the approaching political campaign . His mind seemed completely absorbed in the operations of the armies . Several times , when contemplated battles were spoken of , he said : " I can not pretend to advise , but I do sincerely hope that all may be accomplished with as little bloodshed as possible . ) ) Soon after his return to City Point the President started back to Washington . His visit to the army had been a memorable event . General Grant and he had had so much delightful intercourse that they parted from each other with unfeigned regret , and both felt that their acquaintance had already ripened into a genuine friendship . MOVEMENT AGAINST THE WELDON RAILROAD . GENERAL GRANT , having decided that it would be inexpedient to attempt to carry the works at Petersburg by assault , now began to take measures looking to the investment of that place by leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he moved out with the other portion against the railroads , with the design of cutting off Lee 's communications in that direction . Wright 's entire corps had been sent back from Butler 's front to the Army of the Potomac , and Martindale 's command had been returned to Butler , so that Meade 's and Butler 's armies were again complete . Meade 's corps were disposed as follows , from right to left of the line : Burnside , Warren , Birney ( Hancock 's ) , Wright . On the morning of June 22 , Wright 's and Birney 's corps moved westward with a view to crossing the Weldon Railroad and swinging around to the left ; but they were vigorously attacked and forced back some distance . They advanced again in the evening , but nothing important was gained . On June 23 , Birney and Wright again moved out . There was great difficulty in preserving the alignment of the troops , as they had to pass through dense woods and almost impenetrable thickets , which made the movement a slow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a portion of Wright 's troops were at work destroying the Weldon Railroad , a large force of the enemy struck his left and drove it back . Darkness soon came on , and nothing of importance was accomplished . Wright was now given authority to withdraw his corps to the position occupied the night before , which was more advantageous . Meade had sent frequent messages to Grant , who was this day at Bermuda Hundred , keeping him advised of the movements in his front ; and that night he telegraphed : " I // think you had better come up here to-morrow if convenient . ) ) General Grant felt considerably annoyed about the operations that day at Petersburg , and regarded the position of the Army of the Potomac as somewhat vulnerable . In extending to the left the center had been depleted , while the left flank was out in the air , and would consequently be weak if a heavy and determined attack should be made upon it . The enemy had made his intrenchments so strong that he could afford to move a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of such an attack . Hancock was much missed from the command of the Second Corps . It was quite natural that Meade should ask Grant to come in person to the lines in front of Petersburg , and it was another indication of the confidence which his subordinate commanders reposed in him . SWAPPING HORSES . AT eight o'clock on the morning of June 24 the general rode to the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac , accompanied by Rawlins , myself , and two others of the staff . In discussing with Meade and some of the corps commanders the events of the two previous days , he gave particular instructions for operations on that part of the line . The guns of the siege-train which he had ordered now began to arrive from Washington . Meade was told that they would be sent to him immediately , and it was decided to spend the next few days in putting the guns and mortars into commanding positions , in the meanwhile permitting the troops to desist from active operations . The heat was now intense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Grant and his staff a comfortable lunch , and late in the afternoon our party started for City Point . Owing to the heat and dust , the long ride was exceedingly uncomfortable . My best horse had been hurt , and I was mounted on a hay cob that had a trot which necessitated no end of ( ( saddle-pounding ) ) on the part of the rider ; and if distances are to be measured by the amount of fatigue endured , this exertion added many miles to the trip . The general was riding his black pony ( ( Jeff Davis . ) ) This smooth little pacer shuffled along at a gait which was too fast for a walk and not fast enough for a gallop , so that all the other horses had to move at a brisk trot to keep up with him . When we were about five miles from headquarters the general said to me in a joking way : " You do n't look comfortable on that horse . Now I feel about as fresh as when we started out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in the world , general , what kind of horse one rides . ) ) He remarked : ( ( Oh , all horses are pretty much alike as far as the comfort of their gait is concerned . ) ) G In the present instance , ) ) I answered , " I do n't think you would like to swap with me , general . ) ) He said at once , ( ( Why , yes ; I d just as lief swap with you as not ) ) ; and threw himself off his pony and mounted my uncomfortable beast , while I put myself astride of " Jeff. * The general had always been a famous rider , even when a cadet at West Point . When he rode or drove a strange horse , not many minutes elapsed before he and the animal seemed to understand each other perfectly . In my experience I have never seen a better rider , or one who had a more steady seat , no matter what sort of horse he rode ; but on this occasion it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal were not always in touch , and he saw that all the party were considerably amused at the jogging to which he was subjected . In the meantime " Jeff Davis ) ) was pacing along with a smoothness which made me feel as if I were seated in a rocking-chair . When we reached headquarters the general dismounted in a manner which showed that he was pretty stiff from the ride . As he touched the ground he turned and said with a quizzical look , ( ( Well , I must acknowledge that animal is pretty rough . ) ) SHERIDAN RETURNS . SHERIDAN had arrived on June 20 at White House , on his return from the expedition to the north side of the North Anna River , upon which he had been sent on the 7th . As soon as Lee learned of Hunter 's success he sent Breckinridge 's troops to oppose him ; and hearing that Sheridan had started , he ordered Hampton 's and Fitzhugh Lee 's cavalry commands to move against our cavalry . They were to attack Sheridan during the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to be caught napping . He advanced promptly toward Trevilian 's Station , and in a well-conceived and brilliantly executed battle defeated the Confederate cavalry , and then effectually destroyed several miles of the Virginia Central Railroad . He now obtained information from the prisoners he had captured that Hunter was in the vicinity of Lynchburg and not likely to reach Charlottesville ; and as the enemy had thrown a large force of infantry and cavalry between // Hunter and him , and as he was encumbered with a large number of prisoners andwounded , and his supply of ammunition was nearly exhausted , he felt that it would be useless to try to make a junction with Hunter , and decided to return to the Army of the Potomac by way of White House , where ample and much needed supplies were awaiting him . On his arrival , orders were given that this depot should be broken up on the 22d , and the train of nine hundred wagons which had been left there was- crossed to the south side of the James River , having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry . On the 26th Sheridan came in person to Grant 's headquarters , and had an interview with him in regard to the results of his expedition and the further operations which he was expected to undertake at once on the south side of Petersburg . Sheridan was cordially greeted on his arrival by the general-in-chief . He was at all times a welcome visitor at headquarters , as his boundless enthusiasm , buoyant spirits , and cheery conversation were always refreshing . The general , after learning all the details of Sheridan 's expedition , told him that he fully approved his judgment in not attempting , under the contingencies which had arisen , to reach Hunter ; but , as usual , the general did not dwell at length upon the past , and promptly began the discussion of the plans he had in view for the cavalry in the future . WHERE POcAHoNTAs SAVED JOHN SMITH . A DAY or two afterward , Grant paid a visit to Butler 's lines ; and while he and the staff were riding out to the front they came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved the life of Captain John Smith . Whether it was the exact spot or not , it was regarded in that locality as historic ground ; and Virginians , who take a particular pride in well-known family names , seemed to honor Pocahontas especially , no doubt because she was largely instrumental in preserving the Smith family to posterity . In the efforts to account for the attempted execution of the prisoner , there is a story told , about the truth of which there is a lingering uncertainty . It is to the effect that , when the captain fell into the hands of the Indian chief , he was rash enough to state , in reply to questions as to his identity , that his name was ( ( John Smith ) ) ; and that the noble red man thought he was trying to perpetrate a prac tical joke on him , and was roused to swift vengeance by such an ill-timed pleasantry . In climbing a rather steep hill at this point , the party had to move along a narrow bridlepath . The general was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , with Badeau bringing up the rear . The trees were soon found to be so near together that a horse and rider could not pass between them when keeping in the path , and we turned out to the left , where the woods were more open . Badean 's near-sightedness prevented him from seeing very far ahead , and he was not paying much attention to his horse , but simply letting him go along as he pleased . Suddenly we heard a cry from him : ( ( I m going off ! I say , I m going off ! * On looking round , we found his horse climbing up the path with a tree on each side , between which he could scarcely squeeze . When Badeau 's knees reached the trees his saddle was forced back , and as the horse struggled on his rider finally slid off over the animal 's tail . Then came the cry , ( ( See here , I m off ! ) ) and Badeau and the saddle were seen lying on the ground . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march up the hill as if nothing had happened . General Grant stopped , and looking back at the ludicrous sight presented , fairly screamed with laughter , and did not recover his equanimity during the remainder of the ride . Nothing could have been more amusing to him than such an accident ; for , as he was an exceptionally expert horseman , awkwardness on the part of a rider was more laughable to him than to most people . Badeau , with the assistance of an orderly , had his horse resaddled , and mounting again , soon joined the cavalcade . General Grant cracked jokes at his expense all the rest of the ride ; and for two or three days afterward , when he would be sitting quietly in front of his tent , he would suddenly begin to shake with laughter , and say : *I can t help thinking how that horse succeeded in sneaking out from under Badeau at Bermuda Hundred . ) ) GENERAL JAMES H. WILSON 'S RAID . WHILE the enemy 's cavalry was north of the James , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some days , it was decided to send Wilson 's division of cavalry , which had remained with the Army of the Potomac , and four regiments of the cavalry of the Army of the James under Kautz , to the south of Petersburg , with a view to striking both the South Side and the // Danville railroads . This cavalry command started out on the morning of June 22 . It was composed of nearly 6000 men and several batteries of horse-artillery . It first struck the Weldon , then the South Side Railroad , and afterward advanced as far as Roanoke Station on the Danville road , inflicting much damage . On the 29th , after severe fighting , it found itself confronted and partly surrounded by such a heavy force of the enemy that there was no means of cutting a way through with success ; and it was decided to issue all the remaining ammunition , destroy the wagons and caissons , and fall back to the Union lines . The troops were hard pressed by greatly superior numbers , and suffered severely upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reaching the Army of the Potomac on July 1 . The expedition had been absent ten days . It had marched three hundred miles , and destroyed a large quantity of rolling stock and about fifty miles of railroad . The loss in killed , wounded , and missing amounted to about 1500 men . All the guns and wagons were destroyed or abandoned . The cavalry supposed that the infantry of the Army of the Potomac would be in possession of Reams 's Station at the time of their return , but that station was still in the hands of the enemy . The destruction of communications by Hunter , Sheridan , and Wilson gave the enemy serious alarm ; but by dint of great effort he soon made the necessary repairs , and was again able to bring supplies to Richmond by rail . In the meantime the siege of Petersburg had begun , and it was now Grant 's intention to make the investment as complete as possible , and to take advantage of every opportunity to inflict damage on the enemy , and give him battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable . On June 29 , Grant felt anxious about the fate of the cavalry and the progress of Wright 's corps , which had been sent to Reams 's Station to Wilson 's relief , but did not reach there in time . He rode out to the Petersburg front with his staff , held interviews with Meade , I3urnside , and Smith , and visited the lines to make a personal inspection of the principal batteries . He became impressed with the idea that more field-artillery could be used to advantage at several points , and when we returned to headquarters that evening he telegraphed to Washington for five or six additional batteries . From the 4th of May until the end of June there had not been a day in which there was not a battle or a skirmish . The record of continuous and desperate fighting had far surpassed any campaign in modern or ancient military history . THE STAFF ENLARGED . IN view of the important operations which were to be conducted from City Point , General Grant made some changes in the organization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the exhibition of signal ability as chief quartermaster of the Army of the Potomac , was assigned to duty as chief quartermaster upon the staff of the general-in-chief . Grant and he had been classmates at West Point , and were on terms of extreme intimacy . Ingalls was exceedingly popular in the army , and both officially and personally was regarded as an important acquisition to the staff . Lieutenant-Colonel M. R. Morgan , an efficient and experienced officer of the commissary department , was added to the staff of the general-in-chief as chief commissary ; thirty years after he became commissary-general of the army . Soon after General M. R. Patrick was made provost-marshal-general , and General George H. Sharpe was assigned to duty as his assistant . The latter officer rendered invaluable service in obtaining information regarding the enemy by his employment of scouts and his skill in examining prisoners and refugees . Captain Amos Webster was placed on duty as assistant quartermaster . Assistant Surgeon E. D.W. Breneman , U. S. A. , was assigned to look after the health of those at headquarters ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared to attend made his work exceedingly light . In discussing at this time the large amount of rations which had to be supplied by the subsistence department , and the system required in its management , General Grant said : ( ( When I first had an independent command there were so few experienced men about me that I had to sit down at night and teach officers of the staff departments how to make requisitions for supplies , and fill out the blank forms furnished by the government when such blanks could be procured . I had acted at times as quartermaster and commissary in the old army , and was of course familiar with all the forms used in preparing papers . Word was brought to me one day that a new regimental commissary had gone aboard a commissary boat on the // Mississippi and presented a requisition for rations for his men . The officer in charge looked at it in amazement , and exclaimed : ( Why , there are not half enough rations aboard this entire steamer to fill that requisition . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , said : ( Why , you re filling requisitions for all the other regiments in our brigade ! ) ( Regiment ! ) cried the commissary . ( You mean a corps . ) The regimental commissary then discovered that he had made out his requisition on a corps blank . ) ) A hospital had been established at City Point large enough to accommodate 6000 patients , and served a very useful purpose . The general manifested a deep interest in this hospital , frequently visited it , and constantly received verbal reports from the surgeons in charge as to the care and comfort of the wounded . A telegraph line had been established on the south side of the James which connected by cable across Hampton Roads with Fort Monroe . From that place there was direct telegraphic communication with Washington . This line was occasionally broken , but by dint of great effort it was generally well maintained and made to perform excellent service . The general headquarters had become an intensely interesting spot . Direct communication was jept open as far as possible with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general-in-chief was directing , and information of an exciting nature was constantly received and important orders were issued . The officers on duty had an opportunity to watch the great war drama from behind the scenes , from which point they witnessed not only the performance of the actors , but the workings of the master mind that gave the directions and guided all the preparations .
