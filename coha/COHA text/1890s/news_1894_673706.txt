txt It is a matter of Poetic justice that the overwhelming defeat of David B. Hill was aided by the distracting multiplicity of ballots which was the result of his fatuous opposition to the simple Australian system when he was Governor . He repeatedly vetoed provisions for a form of ballot and method of using it that would have made voting easy and expeditious , and he compelled a makeshift which gave the voters twenty-odd ballots to handle yesterday , perplexed the most intelligent citizens , and obstructed and delayed the polling of the vote so that thousands were lost . Men who found themselves exasperated with more than twenty ballots from which to make selections , and with the necessity of folding them all and keeping separate those to be voted , must have been disposed to reject that having Hill 's name at the head when they remembered that he was responsible for the complicated system . The necessity of voting one complete ballot or taking the trouble to scratch and paste led many to vote against candidates whom they might otherwise have accepted , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hope and expectation that it would serve his machine better than a / simpler one , and in it his machine has been tangled and brought to wreck . No doubt his defeat of genuine ballot reform had been laid up against him among his other offenses by honest Democrats , and it helped to pile up the majority under which he and his allies lie buried . The ridiculous system which swamped the voters in a sea of paper was an outrage upon ' their rights and deprived many of . the chance to exercise them , but there is , comfort in the reflection that its author was submerged in the flood . The clean sweep will clear the ground for the rational method of balloting which so many States have adopted with entire success , and which New York would have been the first to adopt but for David B. Hill .
