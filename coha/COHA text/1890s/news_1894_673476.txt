txt Another practical step has been taken in the move to protect the news service of the United Press turd to continue the distribution of the news to all clients and customers . Four of the original members of the old Associated Press have signed an agreement to this effect among themselves , and the last legal paper for its enforcement was executed yesterday . The four papers are The Herald , Sun , Tribune , and Times . Probably no legal document so binding in its form was ever agreed to by any newspaper in this country . This step , together with some others now under consideration by the clients and associates of the United Press , will result in the organization of the leading newspapers of the Atlantic seaboard into an association which will not only cover the Eastern territory more thoroughly than ever from a news point , but will also insure additional extensions of the service in Western territory . Since the fact was made known that the United Press service would be rendered to all applicants , excepting always at points that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination being to protect these to the fullest extent  --  numbers of applications have been received and favorably passed upon . Among these new clients are The Baltimore World , The Cincinnati Tribune . The Galesburg ( Ill . ) News , The Youngstown lohlol Vindicator , The Cleveland World , The Aurora News , The Little Rock ( Arkansas ) Press , The Charlestown ( West Va . ) Gazette . The Los Angeles ( Cal . ) Telegram . The Chicago National Drovers ' Journal , The Olympia ( Washington ) Olympian . The Kansas City World , and the Topeka Daily Press . Two contracts were signed yesterday and there are other applications to be acted upon .
