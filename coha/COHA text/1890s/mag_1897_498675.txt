BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER . SIEGE OP PETERSBURG AND RAIDS ON WASHINGTON . A DISAPPOINTED BAND-MASTER . FORKS had been thrown across the neck of land upon which City Point is located . This intrenched line ran from a point on the James to a point on the Appomattox River . A small garrison had been detailed for its defense , and the commanding officer , wishing to do something that would afford the general-in-chief special delight , arranged to send the band over to the headquarters camp to play for him while he was dining . The garjrison commander was in blissful ignorance of the fact that to the general the appreciation of music was a lacking sense and the musician s score a sealed book . About the third evening after the band had begun its performances , the general , while sitting at the mess-table , remarked : " I ye noticed that that band always begins its noise just about the time I am sitting down to dinner and want to talk . ) ) I offered to go nd make an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to ( ( cease firing , ) ) and my services were promptly accepted . The men were gorgeously uniformed , and the band seemed to embrace every sort of brass instrument ever invented , from a diminutive cornet-a-pistons to a gigantic double-bass ho.rn . The performer who played the latter instrument was encaged within its ample twists , and looked like a man standing inside the coils of a whisky-still . The broad-belted band-master was puffing with all the vigor of a quack-medicine advertisement , his eyes were riveted upon the music , and it was not an easy task to attract his attention . Like a sperm-whale , he had come up to blow , and was not going to be put down till he had finished ; but finally he was made to understand that , like the hand-organ man , he was desired to move on . With a look of disinheritance on his countenance , he at last marched off his band to its camp . On my return the general said : 4 fear that bandmaster 's feelings have been hurt , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a per-95 son who has no ear for music . ) ) A staff-officer remarked : ( ( Well , general , you were at least much more considerate than Commodore , who , the day he came to take command of his vessel , and was seated at dinner in the cabin , heard music on deck , and immediately sent for the executive officer , and said to him : ( Have the instruments and men of that band thrown overboard at once ! ) ) ) HUNTER 'S RAID . HUNTER 'S bold march and destruction of military stores had caused so much alarm that Lee , as has been said before , was compelled to send Breckinridge 's force and Early 's corps to the valley of Virginia . Hunter continued to drive back the troops he encountered till he reached Lynchburg . There he found that the strength of the works and the combined forces brought against him would prevent the further success of his raid . On June 18 he decided to exercise the discretion which had been left to him in such a contingency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , besides compelling Lee to detach troops from his own army , was the burning of Confederate cloth-mills , gunstock and harness factories , and foundries engaged in the manufacture of ammunition , the destruction of about fifty miles of railroad , and the capture of three thousand muskets , twenty pieces of artillery , and a quantity of ammunition . The stringent orders given by Grant to Sigel , and by him turned over to Hunter , who had succeeded him , were prepared with a view to preventing all wanton destruction . They were in part as follows : ( ( Indiscriminate marauding should be avoided . Nothing should be taken not absolutely necessary for the troops , except when captured from an armed enemy . Impressments should be made under orders from the commanding officer and by a disbursing officer . Receipts should be given for all property taken , so that the loyal may collect pay and the property be accounted for . ) ) Notwithstanding these orders , there were some houses burned and damage done to individual property during this raid . // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early discovered that he had been outmanceuvered , and on the night of the 12th began a retreat . Grant had now but one anxiety , which was to have an efficient head selected for the command of the troops that he was collecting to operate against Early . He sent a despatch to Halleck , saying : ( ( Give orders assigning Major-General Wright to supreme command of all troops moving out against the enemy , regardless of the rank of other commanders . He should get outside the trenches with all the force he possibly can , and should push Early to the last moment , supplying himself from the country . ) ) The next day ( July 13 ) Wright moved forward with his command , following up Early . There had been several days of serious perplexity and annoyance at headquarters . The commanders had to be changed , and the best results possible obtained with the material at hand . Twice the wires of the telegraph line were broken , and important messages between W*ishington and City Point had to be sent a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time that Hill 's corps had been detached from Lee 's front , and there was some anxiety to know whether it had been sent to Early or to Johnston , who was opposing Sherman ; but the rumor was soon found to be groundless . Grant 's orders now were to press the enemy in Maryland with all vigor , to make a bold campaign against him , and destroy him if possible before he could return to Lee . Early , however , had gained a day 's start9 and although a number of his wagons and animals and some prisoners had been captured , no material damage was inflicted upon him . On July 20 he reached Snicker 's Ferry , and the chase was abandoned . Early continued his march to Strasburg , where he arrived July 22 . GRANT AS A WRITER . THE general had occupied himself continually during this anxious and exciting period in giving specific instructions by wire and messengers to meet the constantly changing conditions which were taking place from day to day and from hour to hour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater importance than those which were sent from headquarters at this time . His powers of concentration of thought were often shown by the circumstances under which he wrote . Nothing that went on around him , upon the field or in his quarters , could distract his attention or interrupt him . Sometimes , when his tent was filled with officers talking and laughing at the top of their voices , he would turn to his table and write the most important communications . There would then be an immediate ( ( Hush ! ) ) and abundant excuses offered by the company ; but he always insisted upon the conversation going on , and after a while his officers came to understand his wishes in this respect , to learn that noise was apparently a stimulus rather than a check to his flow of ideas , and to realize that nothing short of a general attack along the whole line could divert his thoughts from the subject upon which his mind was concentrated . In writing his style was vigorous and terse , with little of ornament ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of staff once said : *There is one striking feature about Grant 's orders : no matter how hurriedly he may write them on the field , no one ever has the slightest doubt as to their meaning , or ever has to read them over a second time to understand them . ) ) The general used Anglo-Saxon words much more frequently than those derived from the Greek and Latin tongues . He had studied French at West Point , and picked up some knowledge of Spanish during the Mexican war ; but he could not hold a conversation in either language , and rarely employed a foreign word in any of his writings . His adjectives were few and well chosen . No document which ever came from his hands was in the least degree pretentious . He never laid claim to any knowledge he did not possess , and seemed to feel , with Addison , that ( ( pedantry in learning is like hypocrisy in religion-a form of knowledge without the power of it. * He rarely indulged in metaphor , but when he did employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as when he spoke of the commander at Bermuda Hundred being ( ( in a bottle strongly corked , ) ) or referred to our armies at one time moving ( ( like horses in a balky team , no two ever pulling together . ) ) His style inclined to the epigrammatic without his being aware of it . There was scarcely a document written by him from which brief sentences could not be selected fit to be set in mottos or placed upon transparencies . As examples may be mentioned : " I propose to move immediately upon your works ) ) ; 4 shall take no backward steps ) ) ; the famous 4 propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer , ) ) and , later in his career , ( ( Let us have peace * ( ( The best means of securing the repeal of an obnox // bus law is its vigorous enforcement ) ) ; *I shall have no policy to enforce against the will of the people * ; and ( ( Let no guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen he happened to pick up , and never stopped to consider whether it was sharp-pointed or bluntnibbed , good or bad . He was by no means as particular in this regard as General Zachary Taylor , of whom an old army rumor said that the only signature he ever made which was entirely satisfactory to him was written with the butt-end of a ramrod dipped in tar . General Grant 's desk was always in a delirious state of confusion ; pigeonholes were treated with a sublime disregard , and he left his letters piled up in apparently inextricable heaps ; but , strange to say , he carried in his mind such a distinct recollection of local literary geography as applied to his writingtable that he could go to it and even in the dark lay his hand upon almost any paper he wanted . His military training had educated him to treat purely official documents with respect , and these were always handed over to Colonel Bowers , the adjutant-general , to be properly filed ; but as to his private letters , he made his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold no more , and then he discharged their contents upon his desk in a chaotic mass . The military secretaries made heroic struggles to bring about some order in this department , and generally saw that copies were kept of all letters of importance which the chief wrote . Whatever came from his pen was grammatically correct , well punctuated , and seldom showed an error in spelling . In the field he never had a dictionary in his possession , and when in doubt about the orthography of a word , he was never known to write it first on a separate slip of paper to see how it looked . He spelled with heroic audacity , and ( ( chanced it on the correctness . While in rare instances he made a mistake in doubling the consonants where unnecessary , or in writing a single consonant where two are required , he really spelled with great accuracy . His pronunciation was seldom , if ever , at fault , though in two words he had a peculiar way of pronouncing the letter d : he always pronounced corduroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immejetly. * GRANT DEVOTES ATTENTION TO SHERMAN . WHILE planning means for the defeat of Early , General Grant was still giving constant attention to the movements of Sherman . That officer had been repulsed in making his attack on Kenesaw Mountain , but by a successful flank movement had turned the enemy 's very strong position , and compelled him to fall back over the Chattahoochee River on July 4 . On the 17th Sherman crossed that river and drove the enemy into his defenses about Atlanta . It now looked as if Sherman would be forced to a siege of that place ; and as he was many hundreds of miles from his base , and there was only a single line of railroad to supply him , it was more than ever important that no troops should be allowed to leave Virginia to be thrown against his lines . Grant was frequently in consultation with // Meade in regard to preventing the enemy from withdrawing troops from Petersburg . The Southern papers received through the lines gave very conflicting accounts of the operations on Sherman 's front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcement of Johnston , and expressed the belief that there would be vigorous movements made to break Sherman 's communications . In a despatch to Halleck Grant said : " If he Sherman can supply himself with ordnance and quartermaster 's stores , and partially with subsistence , he will find no difficulty in staying until a permanent line can be opened with the south coast . ) ) The general directed a large quantity of the stores at Nashville to be transferred to Chattanooga . There was another contingency which he mentioned , and which he had to devise steps to guard against  --  a determination on the part of the enemy to withdraw the troops in front of Sherman and move them quickly by rail to Petersburg , and in the meantime march Early 's corps back to Lee and make a combined attack ujion the Army of the Potomac . This , Grant believed , would be done only in some extreme emergency , and in case the enemy felt convinced that Sherman was so far from his base of supplies that he could not move much farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contemplation at this time for preventing troops from being sent from Virginia was to start Sheridan on a raid to cut the railroads southwest of Richmond . Important news reached headquarters on July 17 to the effect that General Joe Johnston had been relieved from duty , and General Hood put in command of the army opposed to Sherman . General Grant said when he received this information : " I know very well the chief characteristics of Hood . He is a bold , dashing soldier , and has many qualities of successful leadership , but he is an indiscreet commander , and lacks cool judgment . We may look out now for rash and ill-advised attacks on his part . I am very glad , from our standpoint , that this change has been made . Hood will prove no match for Sherman . ) ) He waited with some curiosity to know just what policy Hood would adopt . As was anticipated , he came out of his lines and made an attack on July 20 , but was repulsed with great loss . He made another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of Atlanta , but was again driven back . On the 28th he made another bold dash against Sherman , but in this also he was completely defeated , and fell back within the defenses at Atlanta . In the battle of the 22d General McPherson was killed . When this news reached General Grant he was visibly affected , and dwelt upon it in his conversations for the next two or three days . " McPherson , * he said , **was one of . my earliest staff-officers , and seemed almost like one of my own family . At Donelson , Shiloh , Vicksburg , and Chattanooga he performed splendid service . I predicted from the start that he would make one of the most brilliant officers in the service . I was very reluctant to have him leave my staff , for I disliked to lose his services there , but I felt that it was only fair to him to put him in command of troops where he would be in the line of more rapid promotion . I was very glad to have him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His death will be a terrible loss to Sherman , for I know that he will feel it as keenly as I. McPherson was beloved by everybody in the service , both by those above him and by those below him . ) ) GRANT 'S TREATMENT OF HIS GENERALS . IN the midsummer of 1864 General Grant had an increasing weight of responsibility thrown upon him every day . While he was requiring his commanders to sleep with one foot out of bed and with one eye open , lest Lee might make some unexpected movement which would require a prompt change in the general plan of operations , he had to devise new methods almost daily to check raids in different parts of the country , protect the capital , save the North from invasion , and lay vigorous siege to Petersburg , which had been rendered as nearly impregnable by the enemy as the art of the military engineer was capable of making it . He was constantly embarrassed , too , by some of his subordinates . General W. F. Smith was engaged in quarrels with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrimonious personal warfare was progressing between Butler and him , and his bitter criticisms of Meade had aroused the resentment of that officer , which added a new phase to the general quarrel . Grant finally made up his mind that he would either have to relieve General Smith or several prominent commanders , and the result was that Smith was given a leave of absence , and was never recalled . General Grant felt that in the true interests of the service this had become absolutely necessary in order to restore harmony and coöperation . As a commander General Butler had not been General Grant 's choice . The general-in-chief , // when he assumed command of the armies , found Butler in charge of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina , and utilized him to the best advantage possible . He had always found him subordinate , prompt to obey orders , possessed of great mental activity , and clear in his conception of the instructions given him . He was a good administrative officer , though often given to severe and unusual methods in enforcing discipline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within his department ; yet he did not possess the elements necessary to make an efficient officer in the field . As he was inexperienced in fighting battles , Grant felt reluctant to give him charge of any important military movement . One embarrassment was that he was the senior officer in rank in Virginia , and if General Grant should be called away temporarily , Butler would be in supreme command of the operations against Petersburg . The general struggled along under this embarrassment by keeping matters under his own direction when But1er ' *s forces were employed in actual battle , and by sending an experienced corps commander to handle the troops in the immediate presence of the enemy . General Meade 's irritability of temper , and over-sensitiveness to implied censure or criticism on the part of the newspapers , led him at one time to tender his resignation as commander of the Army of the Potomac . General Grant talked to him very kindly on the subject , soothed his feelings , and induced him to reconsider his intention . The generalin-chief did not mention the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been prevented . If Meade had resigned at this time , Hancock would have succeeded him , and Ingalls , who had shown such signal executive ability. , might possibly have been given an important command . Ingalls and I expressed a desire repeatedly to serve in command of troops , as such service gave promise of more rapid promotion and was more in accordance with our tastes ; but the general always insisted upon retaining us on his staff.1 General Meade was a most accomplished officer . He had been thoroughly educated in his profession , and had a complete knowledge of both the science and the art of war in all its branches . He was well read , possessed of a vast amount of interesting information , 1 A reference to this subject occurs in ( ( Around the World with General Grant , ) ) by the Hon. John Russell Young , who accompanied him upon his tour . The language used by General Grant in one of his interviews With Mr. Young is reported as follows : " Ingalls in com had cultivated his mind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign officers visited the front they were invariably charmed by their interviews with the commander of the Army of the Potomac . He was a disciplinarian to the point of severity , was entirely subordinate to his superiors , and no one was more prompt than he to obey orders to the letter . In his intercourse with his officers the bluntness of the soldier was always conspicuous , and he never took pains to smooth any one 's ruffled feelings . There was an officer serving in the Army of the Potomac who had formerly been a surgeon . One day he appeared at Meade 's headquarters in a high state of indignation , and said : ft General , as I was riding over here some of the men in the adjoining camps shouted after me and called me ( Old Pills , ) and I would like to have it stopped . ) ) Meade just at that moment was not in the best possible frame of mind to be approached with such a complaint . He seized hold of the eyeglasses , conspicuously large in size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose with both hands , glared through them at the officer , and exclaimed : ( ( Well , what of that ? How can I prevent it ? Why , I hear that , when I rode out the other day , some of the men called me a ( d-d old goggle-eyed snapping-turtle , ) and I ca n't even stop that ! ) ) The officer had to content himself with this explosive expression of a sympathetic fellowfeeling , and to take his chances thereafter as to obnoxious epithets . In view of the want of harmony which often prevailed , the service would have suffered severely if an officer of a different character had been in supreme command ; but Grant was so complacent in his manner , so even in temper , and so just in his method of dealing with the conflicting interests and annoying questions which arose , that whatever his subordinates may have thought of one another , to him they were at all times well disposed and perfectly loyal . GRANT 'S EQUANIMITY . THROUGHOUT this memorable year , the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , General Grant never in any instance failed to manifest those traits which were the true elements of mand of troops would , in my opinion , have become a great and famous general . . . . Horace Porter was lost in the staff . Like Ingalls , he was too useful to be spared . But as a commander of troops Porter would have risen , in my opinion , to a high command. ) ) - EDITOR. // his greatness . He was always calm amidst excitement , and patient under trials . He looked neither to the past with regret nor to the future with apprehension . When he could not control he endured , and in every great crisis he could ( ( convince when others could not advise . ) ) His calmness of demeanor and unruffled temper were often a marvel even to those most familiar with him . In the midst of the most exciting scenes he rarely raised his voice above its ordinary pitch or manifested the least irritability . Whether encountered at noonday or awakened from sleep at midnight , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an army commander or of a private soldier serving as a courier or a scout , he listened with equal deference and gave it the same strict attention . He could not only discipline others , but he could discipline himself . If he had lived in ancient days he might , in his wrath , have broken the twelve tables of stone : he never would have broken the laws which were written on them . The only manifestation of anger he had indulged in during the campaign was upon the occasion , hereinbefore mentioned , when he found a teamster beating his horses near the Totopotomoy . He never criticized an officer harshly in the presence of others . If fault had to be found with him , it was never made an occasion to humiliate him or wound his feelings . The only pointed reprimand he ever administered was in the instance mentioned in the battle of the Wilderness , when an officer left his troops and came to him to magnify the dangers which were to be feared from Lee 's methods of warfare . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but treated them all with consideration , led them to communicate with him freely and intimately ; and he thus gained much information which otherwise he might not have received . To have a well-disciplined command he did not deem it necessary to have an unhappy army . His ideas of discipline did not accord with those of the Russian officer who , one night in the Moscow campaign , reprimanded a soldier for putting a ball of snow under his head for a pillow , for the reason that indulgence in such uncalled-for luxuries would destroy the high character of the army . GRANT AS A THINKER . IT was an interesting study in human nature to watch the general 's actions in camp . He would sit for hours in front of his tent , or just inside of it looking out , smoking a cigar very slowly , seldom with a paper or a map in his hands , and looking like the laziest man in camp . But at such periods his mind was working more actively than that of any one in the army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service . He studiously avoided performing any duty which some one else could do as well or better than he , and in this respect demonstrated his rare powers of administration and executive methods . He was one of the few men holding high position who did not waste valuable hours by giving his personal attention to petty details . He never consumed his time in reading over court-martial proceedings , or figuring up the items of supplies on hand , or writing unnecessary letters or communications . He held subordinates to a strict accountability in the performance of such duties , and kept his own time for thought . It was this quiet but intense thinking , and the well-matured ideas which resulted from it , that led to the prompt and vigorous action which was constantly witnessed during this year , so pregnant with events . He changed his habits somewhat at this period about going to bed early , and began to sit up later ; and as he preferred to have some one keep him company and discuss matters with him of an evening , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire until the chief was ready for bed . Many a night now became a sort of ( ( watch-night ) ) with us ; but the conversations held upon these occasions were of such intense interest that they amply compensated for the loss of sleep they caused , even after a hard day 's ride at the front . The general , however , did not always curtail the eight hours of rest which his system seemed to require ; for he often pieced out the time by lying in bed later in the morning when there was no stirring movement afoot . WHY GRANT NEVER SWORE . WHILE sitting with him at the camp-fire late one night , after every one else had gone to bed , I said to him : ( ( General , it seems singular that you have gone through all the rough and tumble of army service and frontier life , and have never been provoked into swearing . I have never heard you utter an oath or use an imprecation . ) ) ( ( Well , somehow or other , I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( When a boy I seemed to have an aversion to it , and when I became a man I saw the folly of it . I have always noticed , too , that swearing helps to rouse a man 's anger ; and when a man flies into a passion his adversary who keeps cool always gets the better of him . In // fact , I could never see the use of swearing . I think it is the case with many people who swear excessively that it is a mere habit , and that they do not mean to be profane ; but , to say the least , it is a great waste of time . ) ) His example in this respect was once quoted in my hearing by a member of the Christian Commission to a teamster in the Army of the Potomac , in the hope of lessening the volume of rare oaths with which he was italicizing his language , and upon which he seemed to be placing his main reliance in moving his mule-team out of a mudhole . The only reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing sart'in : the old man never druv mules . ) ) MEADE AND WARREN . ON July 22 General Grant called upon the aides to go with him to Meade 's headquarters . Soon after our arrival there , Meade mounted his horse and rode out with us to visit Warren . The meeting between Meade and Warren was not very cordial , in consequence of a rather acrimonious discussion and correspondence which had just taken place between them ; but they were both such good soldiers that they did not make any display of their personal feelings while engaged in their official duties . A Pittsburg newspaper had stated that Meade had preferred charges against Warren for disobedience and tardy execution of orders . Warren at once wrote to Meade , asking him what truth there was in it , and if the rumor was correct that he had told General Grant that he had threatened him ( Warren ) with a court martial if he did not resign . Meade replied , denying the statement of the newspaper , but said he had been offended by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently in the presence of subordinates , and the want of harmony and cooperation which he had exhibited , and that he had spoken to Grant about this , and had gone so far as to write a letter to him asking that Warren might be relieved ; but that , in the hope that disagreements might not occur in future , and in order to avoid doing him so serious an injury , he had withheld the letter . A thorough examination of Warren 's front and other parts of the line was made . Sharp firing occurred in front of Burnside , which was thought to indicate something of importance ; but it was only a random fusillade on the part of the troops , kept up between the parts of the lines which were quite close together . VOL . LIV. - 14 . SEWARD VISITS GRANT . SATURDAY , July 23 , William H. Seward , the Secretary of State , came down from Washington to visit General Grant and see the armies . He arrived at seven o'clock in the morning on the steamer City of Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general had seen but little of the distinguished Secretary of State previous to this time , and was very glad to welcome him to City Point , and make his more intimate acquaintance . He presented the officers of the staff who were in camp at the time , and invited them to take seats under the tent-fly in front of his quarters , where he and the Secretary were sitting . Mr. Seward was profuse in his expressions of congratulation at the progress which had been made by the Union armies in the East , and their successes generally throughout the country . We soon began to realize that he fully merited his reputation as a talker . He spoke very freely in reference to the progress of the war , and more particularly about our foreign relations . He had conducted our many delicate negotiations with foreign nations with such consummate ability that every one was anxious to draw him out in regard to them . The first topic of conversation which came up was the unfriendliness of our relations with England the first year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open break with that power in regard to the " Trent affair , ) ) in which Commodore Wilkes , commanding the U. S. S. San Jacinto , had taken Slidell and Mason , the Confederate emissaries , from the English vessel Trent , upon which they were passengers . Mr. Seward said : ( ( The report first received from the British government gave a most exaggerated account of the severity of the measures which had been employed ; but I found from Commodore Wilkes 's advices that the vessel had not been endangered by the shots fired across her bows , as charged ; that he had simply sent a lieutenant and a boat 's crew to the British vessel ; that none of the crew even went aboard ; that the lieutenant used only such a show of force as was necessary to convince the ( contraband ) passengers he wanted that they would have to go with him aboard the San Jacinto . The books on international law were silent on the subject as to exactly how an act such as this should be treated ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided , after a serious discussion , that whatever was to be done should be done promptly , and that , under all the circumstances , it would be wise // and prudent to release the prisoners captured , rather than contend for a principle which might not have been sound , and run the risk of becoming involved in a war with Great Britain at that critical period . The great desire of the Davis government was to have this incident embroil us in such a war , and we were not anxious to please it in that respect . Our decision in the matter was the severest blow the Confederacy received in regard to its hope of ( assistance from abroad . ) ) ) This naturally led to the mention of a more recent event upon the seas  --  the destruction of the Alabama by the Kearsarge . General Grant had rejoiced greatly at this triumph of our sister service the navy , and admired immensely the boldness and pluck exhibited by Winslow , the commander of the Kearsarge , in forcing the fight with the Confederate cruiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Winslow was a man after his own heart , who acted upon the commendable military maxim , ( ( When in doubt , fight . ) ) Mr. Seward was asked whether he had in contemplation any steps to take Englan&amp;to task for the action of the British yacht Deerhound for picking up and carrying off our prisoners . He said : " I have communicated with our minister at London , directing him to lay before the British government our grievance in this matter . I feel pretty well convinced that the captain of the Deerhound had arranged with Semmes , the captain of the Alabama , previous to the fight , to transfer to the yacht certain moneys and valuables which Semmes had aboard , so as to carry them to England for him , and to occupy a position during the figbt near enough to render assistance under certain contingencies . It was reported that Captain Winslow asked the captain of the Deerhound to rescue the crew of the Alabama , who were drowning when that vessel was sinking ; but that did not seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue all the men . It appears that many of Semmes 's guns were manned by British gunners , and the wounded who were picked up were carried to England and cared for in a British naval hospital . The circumstance is a most aggravating one , and we have given Great Britain to understand that such acts will not be tolerated in future by this nation . ) ) General Grant then brought up the subject of the empire in Mexico , which was supported by Louis Napoleon . The general 's services in the Mexican war had made him thoroughly well acquainted with Mexico , and he not only had deep sympathy for her people in their present struggle , but was a stanch supporter of the Monroe doctrine generally , and was opposed on principle to any European monarchy forcing its institutions upon an American republic . Mr. Seward expressed himself at great length upon this subject , saying among other things : ( ( I have had a very exhaustive correspondence on this subject with Louis Napoleon*s ministry . He has tried by every form of argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start that when an American state has established republican institutions , no foreign power has the right to use force in attempting to subvert the government formed by its people and set up a monarchy in its place . When an American republic becomes a monarchy by the voluntary act of its people , the matter is no affair of ours , as the people are always the rightful source of authority ; but in the present instance a European emperor has stepped in to deprive the Mexicans of the right of republican freedom . I have been insisting very forcibly that Louis Napoleon must withdraw his army from Mexico . Why , rumors have reached us from time to time that his forces were to advance across the Rio Grande , by an understanding with the Davis government , and take possession of the State of Texas . We shall never feel easy until those troops are withdrawn . ) ) General Grant said : ( ( While we do n't want another war on our hands before we finish the present one , yet I feel that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our present struggle . As soon as the war of secession ends , and I think it is coming to a close pretty rapidly , we will have a veteran army in the West ready to make a demonstration upon the Rio Grande with a view to enforcing respect for our opinions concerning the Monroe dcctrine . I regard this expedition to Mexico not as a movement of the French people , bi$ as one of the ambitious schemes of Louis Napoleon , which shows that he has as little respect for the French people 's opinions as for our own . The French people are our old allies ; it is natural that we should have a great regard for them , and there is a very close bond of sympathy between the two countries ; but Louis Napoleon does not represent the people of France . I hope that his power may some day cease , and that France may become a republic , and I do not think that day is far distant . ) ) Mr. Seward remarked , ( ( Yes ; we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want any war over it ; we have certainly had enough of war. ) ) // One of the party remarked to Mr. Seward that he always seemed to have an abiding faith in the triumph of the Union cause . The Secretary replied : ( ( Yes ; though we have passed through many gloomy periods since the breaking out of the war , I have always felt confident that the integrity of the Union would be preserved . It is a part of my philosophy to believe that the American republic has now , and will have for many years to come , enough virtue in its people to insure the safety of the state . Sometimes there does not seem to be any virtue to spare , but there s always enough . ) ) After some further conversation , Mr. Seward , by invitation of General Grant , visited some of the nearest camps ; and in the afternoon General Butler accompanied the Secretary on his steamer on a trip up the James River as far as it was safe to go . Mr. Seward was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engagement to be in Norfolk in the evening , he felt compelled to start for that place in the afternoon , as soon as his steamer returned from the excursion up the James . PREPARING THE PETERSBURG MINE . AT this time the general-in-chief was devoting much of his attention to the planning of an important movement in connection with the explosion of the famous Petersburg mine , which had now been completed . The operations attending it were novel and interesting , though the result was the greatest disaster which occurred during the siege of Petersburg . After the assaults on the 17th and 18th of June , Burnside 's corps established a line of earthworks within one hundred yards of those of the enemy . In rear of his advanced position was a deep hollow . In front the ground rose gradually until it reached an elevation on which the Confederate line was established . Colone ' Pleasants , commanding the 48th Pennsylvania regiment , composed largely of miners , conceived the idea of starting a gallery from a point in the hollow which was concealed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his earthworks , and there preparing a mine large enough to blow up the parapets and make a sufficiently wide opening for assaulting columns to rush through . Before the end of June he communicated the project to Burnside , who talked the matter over with General Meade . It was then submitted to General Grant for his action . This point of the line was in some respects unfavorable for an assault ; but it was not thought well to check the zeal of the officer who had proposed the scheme , and so an authorization was given for the undertaking to continue . There was a main gallery , 511 feet long and 4* feet square , and two lateral galleries . The terniinus was under the enemy 's parapet , and at a depth of about 23 feet below the surface of the ground . These preparations were completed July 23 , and the mine was soon after charged with eight thousand pounds of powder , and made ready for use . A movement preliminary to its explosion was begun on July 26 , that required the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general-in-chief had planned with great care . It involved making a feint against Richmond , which should be conducted with such a show of serious intention that it would induce Lee to throw a large portion of his command to the north side of the James ; and leave the works at Petersburg so depleted that the movement on Burnside 's front would have in its favor many chances of success . Hancock 's corps drew out from its position on the afternoon of the 26th , and made a rapid night march to Deep Bottom on the north side of the James , and was followed by Sheridan with the cavalry . This entire force was placed under Hancock 's command . On the morning of the 27th it advanced and captured a battery of rifled guns . I had been sent to Hancock that morning , and foiifnd him with his troops , lying upon the grass with some of his staff during a lull in the firing . I threw myself on the ground beside him while we conversed in regard to the situation , and informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Suddenly firing broke out again in front , and we all sprang to our feet to mount our horses . Hancock wore a thin blueflannel blouse , and as I rose up one of my spurs caught in the sleeve , and ripped it open from wrist to elbow . I felt not a little chagrined to find that I was the means of sending this usually well-dressed corps commander into battle with his sleeve slit open and dangling in the air , and made profuse apologies . There was not much time for words , but Hancock treated the matter so good-naturedly in what he said in reply that he at once put my mind at ease . General Grant rode out on the field in the afternoon , arriving there at half-past three o'clock , for the purpose of determining upon the spot what the possibilities were on that side of the river before giving directions for carrying out the rest of his plans . Lee was // now rushing troops to the north side of the James to reinforce the defenses of Richmond . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's left , was vigorously assaulted . by a large body of infantry , and driven back a short distance ; but he promptly dismounted his men , made a determined counter-attack , and drove the enemy back in confusion , capturing two hundred and fifty prisoners and two stands of colors . This engagement was called the battle of Darbytown . Now that Grant had satisfied himself that more than half of Lee 's command had been sent to the north side of the James , he made preparations to throw Hancock 's corps again in front of Petersburg , and carry out his intended assault upon that front . It was decided that the attack should be made at daylight on the morning of the 30th . In the meantime , in order to keep up the deception and detain the enemy on the north side of the river , many clever ruses were resorted to , in which the general-in-chief 's ingenuity and rare powers of invention*were displayed to the greatest advantage . Meade and Ord were directed to cease all artillery firing on the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a view to convincing the enemy that the troops were moving away from that position . Hancock withdrew one of his divisions quietly on the night of the 28th , and moved it back , while he remained with his two other divisions north of the James until the night of the 29th , so as still to keep up the feint . On the 28th Sheridan had the pontoonbridge covered with moss , grass , and earth to prevent the tramping of horses from being heard , and quietly moved a division of his cavalry to the south side of the James . He then dismounted his men , , concealed his horses , and marched back by daylight , so that the enemy would suppose that infantry was still moving to the north side . A train of empty wagons was also crossed to that side in sight of the enemy . Steamboats and tugs were sent up the river at night to the pontoon-bridges , and ordered to show their lights and blow their whistles for the purpose of making the enemy believe that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so successful that they detained the enemy north of the James all day on the 29th . Immediately after dark that evening the whole of Hancock 's corps withdrew stealthily from Deep Bottom , followed by the cavalry . On the morning of the 30th Lee was holding five eighths of his army on the north side of the James , in the belief that Grant was massing the bulk of his troops near Deep Bottom , while he had in reality concentrated his forces in the rear of Burnside at a point fifteen miles distant , ready to break through the defenses at Petersburg . EXPLODING THE MINE . ON the afternoon of July 29 the general-inchief proceeded with his staff to Burnside 's front , and bivouacked near the center of his line , to give final instructions , and to be upon the spot when the assault should be made . Burnside had been carefully instructed to prepare his parapets and abatis in advance for the passage of his assaulting columns , so that when daylight came the troops would have no obstacles in their way in moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ord had been moved to a position in Burnside 's rear . Burnside had proposed to put Ferrero 's colored troops in advance , but Meade objected to this , as they did not have the experience of the white troops ; and in this decision he was sustained by Grant , and white troops were assigned to make the assault . Burnside , of course , was allowed to choose the division commander who was to lead the attack ; but instead of selecting the best officer for the purpose , he allowed the division commanders to draw straws for the choice , and the lot fell , unfortunately , upon Ledlie , who was by far the least fitted for such an undertaking . Meade had joined Grant at his bivouac *iear Burnside 's headquarters , and every one was up long before daylight , aiding in communicating final instructions and awaiting the firing of the mine . Now came the hour for the explosionhalf-past three o'clock . The general-in-chief was standing , surrounded by his officers , looking intently in the direction of the mine ; orderlies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spoken , and the silence of death prevailed . Some minutes elapsed , and our watches were anxiously consulted . It was found to be ten minutes past the time , and yet no sound from the mine . Ten minutes more , and still no explosion . More precious minutes elapsed , and it became painfully evident that some neglect or accident had occurred . Daylight was now breaking , and the formation of the troops for the assault would certainly be observed by the enemy . Officers had been sent to find out the cause of the delay , and soon there came the information that the match had been // applied at the hour designated , but that the fuse had evidently failed at some point along the gallery . Another quarter of an hour passed , and now the minutes seemed like ages ; the suspense was agonizing ; the whole movement depended upon that little spark which was to fire the mine , and it had gone out . The general-in-chief stood with his right hand placed against a tree ; his lips were compressed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he uttered few words . There was little to do but to wait . Now word came that the men of the 48th Pennsylvania were not going . to permit a failure . Not knowing whether the fuse had gone out or was only ( ( holding fire , ) ) a search through the long gallery meant the probability of death to those who undertook it ; but Lieutenant Jacob Douty and Sergeant Henry Reese , of the 48th Pennsylvania , undertook to penetrate the long passageway and discover the cause of the failure . They found that the fire had been interrupted at a point at which two sections of the fuse had been defectively spliced . They promptly renewed the splice , an*l as soon as they emerged from the gallery the match was again applied . It was now twenty minutes to five , over an hour past the appointed time . The general had been looking at his watch , and had just returned it to his pocket when suddenly there was a shock like that of an earthquake , accompanied by a dull , muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air great volumes of earth in the shape of a mighty inverted cone , with forked tongues of flame darting through it like lightning playing through the clouds . The mass seemed to be suspended for an instant in the heavens ; then there descended great blocks of clay , rock , sand , timber , guns , carriages , and men whose bodies exhibited every form of mutilation . It appeared as if part of the debris was going to fall upon the front line of our troops , and this created some confusion and a delay of ten minutes in forming them for the charge . The crater made by the explosion was 30 feet deep , 60 feet wide , and 170 feet long . One hundred and ten cannon and fifty mortars opened fire from our lines . Soon fatal errors in carrying out the orders became painfully apparent . The abatis had not been removed in the night , and no adequate preparations had been made at the parapets for the troops to march over them ; the d*bouch6s were narrow , and the men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crater they found that its sides were so steep that it was almost impossible to climb out after once getting in . Ledlie remained under cover in the rear ; the advance was without superior officers , and the troops became confused . Some stopped to assist the Confederates who were struggling out of the debris , in which many of them were buried up to their necks . The crater was soon filled with our disorganized men , who were mixed up with the dead and dying of the enemy , and tumbling aimlessly about , or attempting to scramble up the other side . The shouting , screaming , and cheering , mingled with the roar of the artillery and the explosion of shells , created a perfect pandemonium , and the crater had become a caldron of hell . GRANT 'S ADVENTURE BETWEEN THE LINES . WHEN it was found that the troops were accomplishing so little , and that matters were so badly handled , General Grant quickly mounted his horse , and calling to me , said , ( ( Come with me. * I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single orderly , we moved forWard through some intervening woods , to make our way as far as we could on horseback to the front of the attack . It was now a little after half-past five . We soon came to a brigade lying upon its arms . The general said to an officer near by , who proved to be General Henry G. Thomas , a brigade commander , ( ( Who commands this brigade ? ) ) *I do , ) ) he replied , springing up from th' ground suddenly , and manifesting no little surprise to find that the voice of the person addressing him was that of the general-inchief . ( ( Well , ) ) remarked the general , ( ( why are you not moving in ? ) ) The officer replied , ( ( My orders are to follow that brigade , ) ) pointing to the one in front of him . Then , after a pause , he added , ( ( Will you give me the order to go in now ? ) ) ( ( No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the instructions of the division commander , **you may keep the orders you have , ) ) and moved on to the front . A Pennsylvania regiment was now met with knapsacks piled on the ground , and about to move to the attack . The commanding officer made a salute , and the general returned it by lifting his hat . The men now recognized him , and it was all the commander of the regiment could do to keep them from breaking out into a cheer , although all noise had been forbidden . The officer said to me some years after : ( ( If the general had given me only a slight nod of the head that morning I should have been delighted ; but when I saw him , at such a trying // moment , look at me and politely take off his hat , it brought the tears to my eyes and sent a big lump into my throat . ) ) The enemy had now rallied his men upon the line in the rear of the crater , and there was fieavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After proceeding a short distance I said : ( ( General , you can not go much farther on horseback , and I do not think you ought to expose yourself in this way . I hope you will dismount , as you will then be less of a target for the enemy 's fire . ) ) Without saying a word , he threw himself from his horse and handed the reins to the orderly , who was then directed to take our animals back to the edge of the woods , while we proceeded to the front on foot . The general had by this time taken in the situation pretty fully , and his object was to find the corps commander , to have him try to bring some order out of the chaos which existed . Upon inquiry it was ascertained that Burnside was on our left and some distance farther in advance . General Grant now began to edge his way vigorously to the front through the lines of the assaulting columns as they poured out of the rifle-pits and crawled over the obstructions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even at this early hour of the morning the heat was suffocating . The general wore his blue blouse and a pair of blue trousersin fact , the uniform of a private soldier , except the shoulder-straps . None of the men seemed to recognize him , and they were no respecters of persons as they shoved and crowded to the front . They little thought that the plainly dressed man who was elbowing his way past them so energetically , and whose face was covered with dust and streaked with perspiration , was the chief who had led them successfully from the l , *Tilderness to Petersburg . Some officers were now seen standing in a field-work to the left , about three hundred yards distant , and Burnside was supposed to be one of the number . To reach them by passing inside of our main line of works would have been a slow process , as the ground was covered with obstacles and crowded with troops ; so , to save valuable time , the general climbed nimbly over the parapet , landed in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's fire . Shots were now flying thick and fast , and what with the fire of the enemy and the heat of the midsummer Southern sun , there was an equatorial warmth about the undertaking . The very recollection of it , over thirty years after , starts the perspira tion . Scarcely a word was spoken in passing over the distance crossed . Sometimes the gait was a fast walk , sometimes a dog-trot . As the shots shrieked through the air , and plowed the ground , I held my breath in apprehension for the general 's safety . Burnside was in the earthwork for which we were heading , and was not a little astonished to see the general approach on foot from such a direction , climb over the parapet and make his way to where the corps commander was stationed . Grant said , speaking rapidly : ( ( The entire opportunity has been lost . There is now no chance of success . These troops must be immediately withdrawn . It is slaughter to leave them here . ) ) Burnside was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience of orders and the general bungling had been so great that Grant was convinced that the only thing to do now to stop the loss of life was to abandon the movement which a few hours before had promised every success . The general then made his way on foot , with no little difficulty , to where our horses had been left , mounted , and returned to where we had parted from Meade . FAILURE OF THE ASSAULT AT THE MINE . INSTRUCTIONS were reiterated to Burnside to withdraw the troops ; but he came to Meade in person and insisted that his men could not be drawn out of the crater with safety ; that the enemy 's guns now bore upon the only line of retreat ; and that there must be a passageway dug to protect them in crossing certain dangerous points . Both of these officers lost their tempers that morning , although Burnside was usually the personification of amiability , and the scene between them was decidedly peppery , and went far toward confirming one 's belief in the wealth and flexibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meade had sent Buruside a note saying : ( ( Do you mean to say your officers and men will not obey your orders to advance ? If not , what is the obstacle ? I wish to know the truth . ) ) Burnside replied : ( ( I have never , in any report , said anything different from what I conceived to be the truth . Were it not insubordinate , I would say that the latter remark of your note was unofficerlike and ungentlemanly . ) ) It was quite evident that the conference was not going to resolve itself into a **peace congress . ) ) However , both officers were manly enough afterward to express regret for what they had written and said under the excitement of the occasion . Although Ledlie had proved a failure , // other division commanders made gallant efforts to redeem the fortunes of the day , but their men became disorganized , and huddled together inextricably in the crater . When the confusion was at its worst Burnside threw in his division of colored troops , who rushed gallantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men already crowded together there . As a colored regiment was moving to the front in the midst of this scene of slaughter , a white sergeant , who was being carried to the rear with his leg shot off , cried out : ( ( Now go in with a will , boys . There s enough of you to eat em all up. * A colored sergeant replied : ( ( Dat may be all so , boss ; but de fac ' is , we hab n't got jis de bes ' kind ob an appetite for em dis mornin ' . ) ) The enemy soon brought to bear upon the crater a mortar fire , which did serious execution . There were many instances of superb courage , but the most heroic bravery could not make amends for the utter inefficiency with which the troops had been handled by some of their officers . It was two o'clock before all the *urvivors could be withdrawn . The total losses amounted to about thirtyeight hundred , nearly fourteen hundred of whom were prisoners . Thus ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forethought , and executed up to the moment of the final assault with consummate skill , and which yet resulted in absolute failure from sheer incapacity on the part of subordinates . Burnside had given written orders which were excellent in themselves , but he failed entirely to enforce them . When the general-in-chief and staff rode back to Petersburg that day , the trip was anything but cheerful . For some time but little was said by him , owing to his aversion to indulging in adverse criticisms of individuals , which could not mend matters . He did not dwell long upon the subject in his conversation , simplyremarking : ( ( Such an opportunity for carrying a fortified line I have never seen , and never expect to see again . If I had been a division commander or a corps commander , I would have been at the front giving personal directions on the spot . I believe that the men would have performed every duty required of them if they had been properly led and skilfully handled. * He had no unkind words for Burnside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's usefulness . Two weeks afterward Burnside was granted a leave of absence , and did not serve again in the field . General Parke , one of his division commanders , and an officer of eminent ability , was placed in command of the Ninth Corps . Grant and Rurnside , however , did not break their amicable relations on account of this official action , and their personal friendship continued as long as they both lived . A surgeon told us a story , one of the many echoes of the mine affair , about a prisoner who had been dug out of the crater and carried to one of our field-hospitals . Although his eyes were bunged and his face covered with bruises , he was in an astonishingly amiable frame of mind , and looked like a pugilistic hero of the prize-ring coming up smiling in the twenty-seventh round . He said : " I 11 jest bet you that after this I 11 be the most unpopular man in my regiment . You see , I appeared to get started a little earlier than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano ; and as I was comm ' down I met the rest of em a-goin ' up , and they looked as if they had kind o ' soured on me , and yelled after me , ( Straggler ! ) ) ) A NEW COMMAND FOR SHERIDAN . GENERAL GRANT ordered the cavalry and a corps of infantry to start south at daylight the next morning , before the enemy could recross the James River , with instructions to destroy fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon Railroad . That night , however , information of the crossing of the Potomac by Early 's troops compelled the general to change his plans and send Sheridan to Washington with two divisions of his cavalry . Early , finding that pursuit had been abandoned , and that the Union forces had returned to Washington , put his army in motion and started to return to Maryland . His advance reached Chambersburg , Pennsylvania , on July 30 ; and finding no troops to oppose them , burned the defenseless town , and left three thousand women , children , and unarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreating , was overtaken by Averell , and completely routed . General Grant now expressed himself as determined not only to prevent these incursions into Maryland , but to move a competent force down the valley of Virginia , and hold permanently that great granary , upon which Lee was drawing so largely for his supplies . The most important thing was to find a commander equal to such an undertaking . No one had commended himself more thoroughly to the general-in-chief for such a mission than Sheridan , and he telegraphed Halleck to put // Sheridan in command of all the troops in the field , and to give him instructions to pursue the enemy to the death . Sheridan reached Washington . on August 3 . Halleck telegraphed expressing some other views in regard to the disposition to be made of Sheridan , but they did not prevail . On the evening of the 3d the President sent to General Grant the following remarkable telegram , which is so characteristic that it is given in full : ( ( I have seen your despatch in which you say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in the field , with instructions to put himself south of the enemy and follow him to the death ; wherever the enemy goes , let our troops go also . ) This , I think , is exactly right as to how our forces should move ; but please look over the despatches you may have received from here even since you made that order , and discover , if you can , that there is any idea in the head of any one here of ( putting our army south of the enemy , ) or of ( following him to the death ) in any direction . I repeat to you , it will neither be done nor atte*inpted unless you watch it every day and hour , and force it . ( ( A. LINCOLN , President. * It will be seen from this that the President was undoubtedly possessed of more courage than any of his advisers at Washington , and that he did not call for assistance to protect the capital , but for troops and a competent leader to go after Early and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted an officer of Grant 's aggressiveness to force the fighting and send the troops after the enemy , even if the capital had to be left temporarily without defense . General Grant received the President 's despatch at noon of August 4 , and he left City Point that night for Hunter 's headquarters at Monocacy Station in Maryland , reaching there the next evening , August 5 . He ordered all the troops in the vicinity to move that night to the valley of Virginia . The general had now a delicate duty to perform . He had decided to put General Sheridan in command of the active forces in the field ; but he was junior in rank to General Hunter , and in order to spare the feelings of Hunter , and not subject him to the mortification of being relieved from duty , the generalin-chief suggested that he remain in command of the military department , and that Sheridan be given supreme control of the troops in the field . Hunter removed all embarrassment by saying that , under the circumstances , he deemed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from duty . This unselfish offer was accepted , and Sheridan was telegraphed to come at once from Washington to Monocacy by a special train . Grant met him at the station , and explained to him what was expected of him . His present army consisted of nearly thirty thousand men , including eight thousand cavalry . Early 's army was about equal in numbers . Grant said to Sheridan in his instructions : ( ( Do not hesitate to give commands to officers in whom you have confidence , without regard to claims of others on account of rank . What we want is prompt and active movements after the enemy in accordance with the instructions you already have . I feel every confidence that you will do the best , and will leave you as far as possible to act on your own judgment , and not embarrass you with orders and instructions . ) ) This despatch was eminently characteristic of Grant ; it affords a key to his method of dealing with his subordinates , and explains one of the chief reasons why his commanders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left to the exercise of an intelligent judgment ; that if they did their best , even if they did not succeed , they would never be made scapegoats ; and if they gained victories they would be given the sole credit for whatever they accomplished . As soon as Sheridan moved south the enemy was compelled to concentrate in front of him , and the effect was what Grant had predicted  --  the termination of incursions into Maryland . The general returned to City Point on August 8 . Rawlins had broken down in health from the labors and exposures of the campaign , and had been given a leave of absence on August 1 , in the hope that he might soon recuperate and return to duty ; but he was not able to join headquarters for two months . Already the seeds of consumption had been sown , from which he died while Secretary of War , five years afterward . He was greatly missed by every one at headquarters , and his chief expressed no little anxiety about his illness , although no one then thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AN INFERNAL MACHINE EXPLODED NEAR HEADQUARTERS . AN event occurred in the forenoon of August 9 which looked for an instant as if the general-in-chief had returned to headquarters only to meet his death . He was sitting in front of his tent , surrounded by several staff-officers . General Sharpe , the assistant // GENERAL GRANT HASTENING TO ORDER THE RECALL OF THE ASSAULTING COLUMN . ( SEE PAGE 110. ) // provost-marshal-general , had been telling him that he had a conviction that there were spies in the camp at City Point , and had proposed a plan for detecting and capturing them . He had just left the general when , at twenty minutes to twelve , a terrific explosion shook the earth , accompanied by a sound which vividly recalled the Petersburg mine , still fresh in the memory of every one present . Then there rained down upon the party a terrific shower of shells , bullets , boards , and fragments of timber . The general was surrounded by splinters and various kinds of ammunition , but fortunately was not touched by any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right hand by a bullet , one mounted orderly and several horses were instantly killed , and three orderlies were wounded . In a moment all was consternation . On rushing to the edge of the bluff , we found that the cause of the explosion was the blowing up of a boat loaded with ordnance stores which lay at the wharf at the foot of the hill . Much damage was done to the wharf , the boat was entirely destroyed , all the laborers employed on it were killed , and a number of men and horses near the landing were fatally injured . The total casualties were forty-three killed and forty wounded . The general was the only one of the party who remained unmoved ; he did not even leave his seat to run to the bluff with the others to see what had happened . Five minutes afterward he went to his writing-table and sent a telegram to Washington , notifying Halleck of the occurrence . No one could surmise the cause of the explosion , and the general appointed me president of a board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in taking the testimony of all the people who were in sight of the occurrence , and used every possible means to probe the matter ; but as all the men aboard the boat had been killed , we could obtain no satisfactory evidence . It was attributed by most of those present to the careless handling of the ammunition by the laborers who were engaged in unloading it ; but there was a suspicion in the minds of many of us that it was the work of some emissaries of the enemy sent into the lines . Seven years after the war , when I was serving with President Grant as secretary , a Virginian called to see me at the White House , to complain that the commissioner of patents was not treating him fairly in the matter of some patents he was endeavoring to procure . In the course of the conversation , in order to impress me with his skill as an inventor , he communicated the fact that he had once devised an infernal machine which had been used with some success during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small box filled with explosives , with a clockwork attachment which could be set so as to cause an explosion at any given time ; that , to prove the effectiveness of it , he had passed into the Union lines in company with a companion , both dressed as laborers , and succeeded in reaching City Point , knowing this to be the base of supplies . By mingling with the laborers who were engaged in unloading the ordnance stores , he and his companion succeeded in getting aboard the boat , placing their infernal machine among the ammunition , and setting the clockwork so that the explosion would occur in half an hour . This enabled them to get to a sufficient distance from the place not to be suspected . I told him that his efforts , from his standpoint , had been eminently successful . At last , after many years , the mystery of the explosion was revealed . This occurrence set the staff to thinking of the various forms of danger to which the general-in-chief was exposed , and how easily he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary guard mounted at the headquarters camp , we would quietly arrange a detail of ( ( watchers ) ) from the members of the staff , so that one officer would go on duty every night and keep a personal lookout in the vicinity of the general 's tent . This was faithfully carried out . It had to be done secretly , for if he had known of it he would without doubt have broken it up and insisted upon the staff-officers going to bed after their hard day 's work instead of keepingthese vigils throughout the long , dreary nights of the following winter . The general never knew of this action until his second term of the Presidency , when he made the discovery through an accidental reference to it in his presence by a visitorwho had heard of it . He then expressed himself as feeling very much touched by the service which had been performed with aview to his personal protection .
