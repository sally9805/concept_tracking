txt IT remains to consider some larger assumptions which have been extensively made by writers taking the side adverse to what they usually call the traditional theology . 1 . While the experience of life shows on every side that habit hardens by use , that the gristle passes into the bone , that under the laws of our nature we travel steadily towards the unchangeable in cases where bias has been habitually and permanently indulged by repetition of acts , the lessons of this experience are to be cast aside with respect to the laws which are to govern character in the world to come , and the unchangeable will there undergo a process of transformation and reversion , by becoming a pliable and docile material fashioned upon new laws contradictory of the old . 2 . WhiLe the justice of punishing wickedness is admitted , and it is held , or not denied , that the measure of our punishment will be found in the amount and character of our iniquity , and it is moreover felt to be unreasonable for us to impose limitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of measuring the cause , the single point of duration is picked ( so to speak ) out of the case , and it is laid down , without any question raised on severity and intensity , that the prolongation without limit of suffering in any form , whether forensically inflicted or by natural laws as the fruit of character acquired in this life , // must be under all circumstances incompatible with the justice of God . 3 . That the character of the Almighty is rendered liable to changes which can not be repelled so long as the idea remains that there may by His ordinance be such a thing as never ending punishment , but that it will have been sufficiently vindicated at the bar of human judgment so soon as it has been established and allowed that punishment , whatever else it may be , can not be never-ending . As regards the first of these features of the new teaching , which has already been touched in part , does it not amount to a gratuitious substitution of speculation for experience , and is such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or as a desperate venture of mental rashness ? To my mind it stands in the latter category . It would be thought strange to teach a reversal of some great law of the natural universe ; for instance , a displacement of the law of gravity in favor of a law of repulsion between material substances . Yet it is conceivable that such a change might be brought about as to take small effect upon the main work and purpose of our existence , as our relation to it might be susceptible of adjustment . But the laws of our own constitution and growth , by which our destiny is redeemed from the sport of chance and bound into a whole , supply the standing ground on and from which we are to confront and act upon the universe . How can the propounders of such a scheme rationally expect that future inquirers will accord to their novel , we might say newfangled , notions , a respect which they themselves have withheld from the most intimate and universal facts of human experience ? As respects the second and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who make them are in good faith impressed with an apprehension lest the character of the Almighty should suffer , in the estimation of a portion of His creatures , from the currency of tenets which they deem to be irreconcilable with His essential attributes . There is something that is touching , and perhaps also something that is startling , in this enterprise . It was bold on Milton 's part when he undertook " To justify the ways of God to man , " // entertainment , without much consideration , of similar designs . And the first condition to be reasonably asked of them is that they should measure at the outset the scope and extent of their undertaking . Also that they should weigh the question whether , in our present state of clouded limitation , we are to hold ourselves bound . or invited to clear the present dispensation under which we live of all the moral anomalies , disparlties , and apparent con - tradictio*s lying around us ; and if so , whether it would not seem to be in the natural order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present existence , concerning which we are armed at least with a store of experimental knowledge , rather than launch upon a series of adjustments for the world future and unseen , on ground which we can not firmly tread , and in an atmosphere which we have no lungs to breathe . Evil , according to this philosophy , has no right to a place in this world . They therefore set themselves to work to dislodge it , at least in hypothesis , by assuming that , at some uncertain time , there shall be a reign of universal happiness ; and , moreover , there is also to be taken for granted the accompaniment of universal goodness . The reply suggests itself : " Jesus I know , and Paul I know , but who are ye ? " When the prophets portended a flood of blessing , when the apostles proclaimed a coming triumph of righteousness aud peace , the first referred in vision to , and the last brought into possible and visible action , a scheme of means adequately equipped with motive power , whereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this new forecast of the future advisedly , or at least manifestly , passing by the remedial system now in action , steps out into the void that lies beyond it . Not like the cautious Butler , who reckons upon nothing without a foresight of means adequate to the end in view , they make no addition to the " going machinery** of redemption ,  - -  but totally anticipate results without any indication of the means to produce them . Do they not truly stand as men who make bricks without straw , and anticipate the flowers and fruits of their garden without sowing any seed to produce them ? Wickedness and suffering within the bounds of creation are , as they conceive , disparaging to the Creator , and inevitably bring into question either His wisdom , His justice , or His power . They therefore do not indeed provide , but suggest , a sweeping scheme for their removal , thrusting out of the way any established laws of // our nature which would hinder the consummation . Evils shall vanish ; suffering shall have an end ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real or solid vindication ? Does it not rather include within itself the materials of a hopeless dilemma , and therefore the doom of inevitable failure ? lEvil is to be employed or tolerated up to a certain date , and then , for the honor of God , is to cease . But before that date it has ex hypothesi been employed or tolerated ; and where was the honor of God then ? If it was compatible with the honor of God for a time , why may it not continue compatible , so as to make use of it hereafter ? If employed , or tolerated , this was either with reason or without . If without reason , we have no security against its continuance without reason . If with reason , how can we know that the reason which operated before may not also operate after ? If it is wise , if there be a vindication at present veiled from our view , how can we presume to say that there is a date at which it must cease to be available ? If unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wise for the shorter ? If wise for the shorter , how can we tell whether it may be also wise for the longer ? There are special dangers attending upon labor which is volunteered ; and an imperfect vindication may be worse than no vindication at all , especially in the view of those who see there is open to us an alternative in the reservation of our judgment until the day when the secrets of the Divine wisdom shall be laid open , or more open , to our view . Let us endeavor still further to exhibit the perilous , and totally ineffectual , nature of these doubtless well-meant attempts to take into our hands the exculpation of Divine Providence . As we see , the objectors of the present day to what they term the teaching of the " traditional theology " appear to think that , when they have got rid of the element of endless duration in the matter of future punishments , they have thereby attained to a satisfactory vindication of the Divine character from the charge of inflicting excessive and unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very serious matter to undertake at all the vindication of the character of the Divine Being , especially for us who do so little to maintain , improve or repair our own ; since it seems to imply , at least for the moment , the possession of a kind of superior position ; or to allow that idea , or its results at least , to find their way into the mind . But apart from any // scruple or difficulty on this score , it does not appear to me that this vindication , however honorably sought , is , or can be , attained by us with our present limited supply of knowledge and means of inquiry . The utmost the vindicator can do seems to be to abate or cancel a single point in the indictment , which it is the practice of negationists to bring against the character of God . It is objected to the doctrine of endless punishment that there is no proportion between offences committed in our narrowly bounded life and the wide field of an unlimited existence , over the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now speak of the recorded replies to this objection , which may or may not be satisfactory . But let us give the objector all he asks ; and then inquire whether , by expelling the element of endlessness from punishment , we so alter the spectacle presented to us by the conditions of human destiny , that we can take upon ourselves to bring them all into harmony ( and this is the purpose in view ) with the character of an all-wise , allrighteous and all-powerful God . We have to meet the challenge of the negationist in other and separate lists . " Show me the justice , " he demands , " of placing the responsibility of existence upon creatures , who have no choice given them in the matter , and then weighing them down with tendencies to mischief inherited from their ancestors : with pressure due to adverse and sometimes ap . parently domineering environment ; with suggestion , attraction , menace , danger in every form ; with an evil bias rooted in themselves through a degeneracy of nature asserted by our highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but too largely established by corroborating experience ? Is not , " he asks , " your free will , on which you so much rely as an argument , frequently placed under an amount of solicitation or pressure such as , in the judgment of every equitable observer , comes indefinitely near to the aspect of coercion ? " I go further and ask whether the objector may not press us , his respondents , with a wider question , and put the following words into his mouth : " You take shelter behind the free will of the human being , which you allege enables him to deal with each action , and with every situation , in detail . But you can not deny that there is a broader question , the question of existence itself . This existence is admitted to be attended with danger ; and yet there was neither a consent // obtained from us as a condition of our entering on it , nor liberty granted , with a free passage provided , to enable us to lay it down . What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore-knowledge that the misuse of this freedom would bring them into misery ? Why were they to be made examples of the law which annexes misery to a failure to do right , without their first being freely made parties to a trial upon that issue ? Does not the title to be free upon each of the parts carry with it a corresponding claim to be free upon the great question of existence , which sums up them all ? " To his challenges I am able to make no fuller reply than this , that , according to our faith , every man will be judged with full allowances for every adverse incident of his lot , and that God will enable all , who sincerely strive for it , to overcome alike the circumjacent and the indwelling sin , or will in any and every case deal with them according to most exact justice . Then he asks me : " Why were they solicited , and vexed , and stained with evil in any shape ? There is no such thing as a universal right inherent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is hoped , believed , or even known , that with immense effort they will overcome it . " But , I reply , this evil is for them a means of good , and , by means of the training they receive , they attain to more and higher good than they could have attained without it . But I have not yet fully repelled my assailant . He is again upon me , and he says : " What , then , means your sovereignty of a good power who , in the case of man , is dependent upon our evil urinciple for the best accomplishment of His design ? Add to this what I am entitled to ask : How far does the necessity for this ill-assorted aid extend ? Does it go beyond the case of man , and is the whole universe tainted with evil as the condition of becoming good ? If man is an exception , why is he only placed under this disadvantage , and at the same time told that he is an object of spe*ial if not exceptional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , there is one order of beings , made known to us by Scripture , and , as many will say , also by experience , with regard to whom the question legitimately arises . These are the fallen angels . Are these , too , under discipline , and intended to reap the harvest of the greater good ? If not , why not ? " But , you reply affirmatively , then you contemplate the loss from the universe of the power by which this beneficial action of evil is // maintained ? And this runs up into the fir*al question . " Evil is a thing abhorrent to the divine nature ; furnish me with an adequate reason why it came into the world . " I am obliged to reply that no such reason is in my actual possession , that I must look for it to the region of Faith , and to some province of that region which has not yet been opened , but which is still enveloped in clonds and darkness . So then all that our objector has done is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantitative deduction from the charges advanced by negationists against the charaeter of God . But the matter is one which can not be disposed of , nor essen tially affected , by any merely quantitative process . The vindication of the character of God is a business that ought not to be undertaken by halves . If we are compelled to halt in the operation before placing that character in the light in which it ought to stand to the eye of some high and sinless intelligence , it may after all be better to take refuge in our own humble condition , and accept the problems of existence under the limited and imperfect forms in which alone God has permitted ns to approach them . Faith and reason unite to assure us that the world to come will be a world of readjustment ; where the first shall be last , and the last first , and where both good and evil shall receive their just rewards . This answer covers the whole field . But attempts at vindication , nuwarranted , precipitate , and mistaking our poor twilight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recoil upon their projectors . I suppose that most of us , if thinking at all upon the*coming conditions of our companion pilgrims who precede us on their passage into the shadows of death , must think , upon a survey of .9 the field of our experience , that they defy in innumerable cases our feeble powers of estimation , those cases namely in which some real form of goodness seems to have a real , perhaps a st+ong and permanent , hold , but where it had not taken conscious and deliberate effect in full conformity to the Divine will . Take , for example , the instances in which , apart from any distinct self-devotion to God , life has been principally or systematically spent in the endeavor to diminish human suffering ; and this , perhaps , with the exercise of much active renunciation and self-denial . Or again , where it has been similarly given to that improvement of // the temporal conditions of human life , which , in a greater or a less urgent degree , the majority of our fellow-creatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appeared to need . Or again , where men apply their thought and means not to the indulgence of their appetites but to the improvement and expansion of their own powers for purposes of eventual utility . In all these schemes for bettering God 's wori* , regard to the Lord of that world , and humble dependence on His power and benediction ought to have their proper place ; which , by the supposition , has not , or not in due measure , been given to it . Or let us turn our view to another and extended category of those classes who embrace the Divine word with what they think to he an entire willingness , nay , with a sanguine exultation . I do not now speak of the modes in which this state of mind may be contaminated by a self-confidence in utter antagonism to the true life of the gospel , but to the more simple , less entangled case when the broad propositions of religion are accepted , but accepted too near the surface , without measuring them against the entire thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are but partially applied and allow of the retention of this or that habit which either falls short of , or even is on its own ground in obvi9us conflict with , the laws of the Divine life . These appear to be allowable illustrations of the manner in which we shall find that certain suppositions of Butler leave unimpaired all the stringent , as well as all the soothing , life teachings of the gospel ; but yet supply the mind in its permitted excursions beyond the grave , which are so often suggested by strong motives of nature and affection , with many ideas such as at once feed us with hope and comfort , and widen our horizon of thought upon the providential scheme and upon the blessings and eventual reach of the Incarnation , that grand remedial instrument on which we rest all our hopes . In comparison and contrast with the three more prominent theories or doctrines on the condition of man in the world to come , let us now turn to that larger teaching on the subject , which , though only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest after he has parted from the formal but Uuxitcd. discussion to which his first chapter is devoted . li* suggestions do not ostensibly touch the lines of prevailing controversies : but they tend somewhat to modify the idea of an immediate and unconditional finality in the condition of the human // soul following upon death , which the Reformation of the sixteenth century , from the particular circumstances of its origin , did so much to foster . Even in his first chapter , Butler intimates that death may issue in not only a continuation but an enlargement of existence ; in a state when , through the widening of conditions , what we now deem to be above nature or beyond it , may be found to be thoroughly natural. * And here I ask leave to spend a moment in confessing the comparative security and satisfaction with which I follow the steps of Butler on the rare occasions when he speculates , as comparing him with other speculators . I feel like one resting on the wings of a great and strong bird , when it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ount as easily as it will descend . With this notion of Death , as leading to enlargement , Butler 's very marked views respecting habit , growth , and evolution , as pertaining to our nature , are strongly in accord . It was from or with these views that he was led to question the philosophy , if not the theology , which with such shallow wisdom seems to teach us that with death the book is closed , at any rate until the Resurrection and the Judgment , by which it sets no great store , and for which it leaves indeed but little room . Such a man as Butler could not be hasty to assume that , if the interval be one of conscious life and action , it can pass without leaving behind it legible traces of its influence upon character . Butler , as a sedulous observer of what was going on around him , was struck by the great advances which , probably , having Newton in his mind , he conceived to have been recently effected in natural knowledge . The universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense . * It is an inference from this grand physical disclosure that there must be some scheme of Providence vast in proportion to it . Next he noticedt the essential tendencies of virtue or goodness to acquire for itself augmentation of power . These tendencies may be expected to operate freely and with energy , when the grievous hindrances which now beset them shall have been removed . They have the signs , what may be termed the air , of belonging to the peculiar conditions of the present life . It is *Ana*. , I .. i. , 31. t Ibid. , I iii .. 28 . I ibid. , I. iii .. 30. et alibi . // therefore probable that , in the world to come , they may not reappear as now . Should this be so , many souls of men , incapable of normal evolution in the present state , may be found to be capable of it when a favorable change in the balance between auxiliaries and impediments shall have been effected . This may have no more the character of a paradox than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outweigh twenty , will outweigh five . Powers , the action of which was suspended by the adverse preponderance , will emerge into the open , and find scope for action , when that preponderance has been removed or reversed . The discoveries , partly effected in Butler 's time , of the vastness of the material universe at once led his profound and searching spirit to inquire whether , under the guidance of his master principle of analogy , he found cause to draw from the fact of those discoveries in the physical order any collateral inferences in respect to the moral and spiritual world . He did not indeed help to mislead his fellow men by teaching , as is now the fashion in some quarters , that the immense enlargement of the visible kingdom of God proves the insignificance of the world which we inhabit , or discredits the idea that it can be the scene of an exceptional and peculiarily illustrious dispensation , such as is exhibited in the Incarnation of our Lord . his speculation was the very opposite of this precipitate , shallow and barren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that , when traced home to its principle , it is detected in the offence of using the weights and measures of the physical universe as the criterion of moral and spiritual magnitude . On Butler 's mind these grand disclosures had the effect of widening his conception of the possible scope of the natural and moral government exhibited to us in Nature and Revelation . In effect they suggested to him an enlargement of the purpose and working of the Incarnation itself beyond the scope of the common conception , both popular and theological . For , says Butler , rising to the highest degree of confidence which he ever allows himself to indulge , it is certain that , as the material world appears to be in a manner boundless and immense , there must be some scheme of Providence reaching outside the material world , arid vast in proportion to it. * With this weighty observation he winds up a course of thought in which he has pointed out that virtue , so sorely restrained and * Anal. , I. , iii. , 27. // hampered here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its impediments , and be placed under conditions favorable to its full development and corroboration . And further , that , being thus in itself enlarged and enhanced , it might ; be exhibited to , and might form a power of attraction for , others who had not yet been drawn to it . And this might happen " amongst one or more orders of creatures " ; and the benefit might accrue " in any distant scenes or periods , " to those among " any orders of vicious creatures " having among them some who were capable of amendment , and of being recovered through a just sense of virtue. * Thus does Butler appear to have embraced the ideas , first , that the developments of character effected through the Incarnation of Christ might operate upon beings subject to the Creator , but not belonging to the human race ; and , secondly , that , also within the limits of the human family itself , persons who had not in this life in any manner perceptible to us actually crossed the line which divides righteousness from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that transition , provided their characters were still in such a state as to leave them capable of effectual amendment . This limitation is undoubtedly of importance . It secures morality , the religious discipline - of life , and the whole scheme of the Christian revelation , against that general dilution , and indeed virtual dissolution , of responsibility in conjunction with the present life which must result if mankind , so powerfully predisposed to a relaxed belief , were instructed to assume that the exercises of this life might be multiplied in , perhaps , an interminable series of existences , and had no exceptional character , no final and determining effect . We may take it for granted that Butler noticed , in common with every careful observer , the equivocal condition in which so many appear to quit the world . Let us first take some of the less difficult among these cases . They have not ceased truly and in their inmost selves to desire good , but they have not brought that desire , sincere yet overweak , to good effect . They perform freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without murmuring every dispensation administered to them from without by His will ; they even exhibit much of unselfish devotion to the interests of their fellow men ; andyet they have not conformed to the supreme law which in God 's own world *Anal. , I , , iii. , 27. // places the root and centre of all our vital purposes not only in subjection , but in an active conformity , to His sovereign will : for , where positive love and service are due , mere non-resistance forms no legitimate substitute for them . And yet the heart will not desist from asking : Are not such fruits of partial good , such tendencies towards effectual and supreme good , as mark this multitude of souls , worth preserving , and is it reasonable to suppose they can only be cast away as of none account ? It would be still less reasonable to suppose they could be recognized as adequate and normal fruits of the Incarnation of Christ , or represent a spiritual condition which can be permitted to continue unless in train to what is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe . It may then perhaps appear that Butler has found or approached the true meeting point of these contrary but not contradictory suggestions , in the noteworthy section which is probably to be regarded as the crown and copingstone of Butler 's comprehensive and diversified reflections on our condition in the future state . But these suppositions are indeed no more than an extension of the rational and philosophical belief which the greater part of the Christian Church has always held respecting the laws which govern the condition of the believing dead . The Church has walked in the path opened for it by St. Paul through his prayer on behalf of Onesiphorus . It has condemned our accepting what is termed the sleep of the soul ; a speculation amounting to a suspension of human existence , and alike at variance with Scripture , which . describes the active enjoyments and even sufferings of the dead , and with reason , which exhibits to us our nature as constituted with a view to discipline and advance through the prolongation of existence and through the action it entails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive state , and the appointed office of the interval between death and resurrection is reasonably believed to be the corroboration of every good and holy habit , and the effacement of all remains of human infirmity and vice . The extension suggested by Butler amounts to this : that , while the view of the Church in general only extends to those who have before death given evidence of repentance and faith such as the human eye can reasonably appreciate , still , as he suggests , where this evidence falls short , the root of the matter may be there notwithstanding , and the Almighty may // reserve to His own jurisdiction the development necessary to cover both the ground which a more palpable sanctification had in other cases visibly secured anterior to death , and that remainder of progress generally reserved for accomplishment hereafter , even by souls of a clearly manifested faithfulness to their Lord . Under such a view as Butler 's , then , of the teaching of our religion as to the dead , it would appear that there may be introduced , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , a body whose position , relatively to that of the other believers , may be compared with that of the laborers in the vineyard hired at the ninth and the eleventh hours . True , indeed , that , according to the parable , we are not entitled to say that they had known of and had refused or neglected any earlier offer . But then it may be also true of these , so to speak , belated spirits , that they , either as a class or in particular cases , owed their backward condition rather to the want of opportunity than to a greater perverseness of the will or a more obstinate slackness to hear and to obey . Be this as it may , there are two things on which we may rest with considerable , if not indeed with undoubting , confidence . The first is that there will be no murmuring against the Master 's bounty , no grudge as towards those newly admitted to a share of the reward . The second that , in all cases where the smaller degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the environment of the man , he will take no benefit by his delays ; the sum of whatever enjoyments he may by them have unlawfully secured in this jife will not in the least degree contribute to his final happiness or augment its sum total ; but , on the contrary , will have left behind tracks of the course that has been trodden , and will have impressed tendencies , or left stains upon the soul which have had to be reversed or effaced by a process of discipline , happy indeed in its result , but of which we have no right to assert , as indeed we haveno such right in other cases of departed spirits , that the redeeming and consummating process will be accomplished without an admixture of salutary pain . I have slightly sketched one class of cases , by way of illustrating Butler 's supposition , where much good had been generated by the discipline of life , but where it still remained defective in its relation to the central good , and may have sorely lost thereby . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on // which there would be no advantage in descanting . The fundamental idea lying at the root of his conception is this : that the appreciation of character and of moral action is a high matter , in which our means of judgment are scanty and feeble , that we are therefore not competent to pronounce , in the intermediate region between manifest excellence and glaring sin , upon the state of souls ; that , as they may be worse so they also may often be better than the evidence available for our use would warrant our declaring or assuming ; that , while the determining impulse may have been received during life , the direction of the resulting movement may not as yet have been exhibited in our sight , and that this awful reckoning which will set the last first , and the first last , is not permitted to us , but is reserved for eyes more penetrating as well as more just . It may be thought , and perhaps justly thought , by persons of more experience and perspicacious reflection than myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Unseen , I have not succeeded in conforming to his Christian and philosophic circumspection . Should this be so , I can only regret my being unequal to discharging the duty of an intelligent disciple ; and I cherish the hope that my errors are not either wanton or contumacious . The Master , at least , is here open to no charge . His speculations on behalf of departed spirits which have not while in the flesh given evidence cognizable by us of their reunion with God , are not loosely projected into space . They are for those only who are " capable of amendment , and being recovered to a just sense of virtue . " If we have no adequate means of judging who these may be , our incapacity may suggest the further question : Why should we have such means ? The premature possession of them might bring about a relaxation . of the bonds of moral obligation . Such is the account I should presume to give of the pregnant thoughts expressed by Butler in the remarkable section we have now before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangerous figment of those who please their imaginations by gratuitously supposing , to the grave disparagement of the Scriptures and the great redemption , that a new state or states of probation for us lie beyond the dread barrier of the grave . The question he raises is not that of a new probation , but only whether the present probation may take more complete effect under circumstances more felicitous than those of the terVOL . CLXJI. - NO. 4Th. 48 // restrial life . He does not add any thing to the Incarnation , but he asks a guarded question as to the manifestation of results which in their essence have been alr**ady wrought though not developed ; and he gives us hope of*.hereafter rescuing a wider domain from the sway of evil or of its consequences , without weakening in the present critical state the laws of righteous award . As a general apology for the papers which will be herewith brought to a close , I advance a proposition which , at least in its general terms , will not be gravely contested . Those who are conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy may , nevertheless , render a real , though limited , service if they can eject from it matter gratuitously imported ; draw attention to conceptions by which it has been both widened and perplexed ; relieve it from the pressure of unwarranted assumptions ; secure upon a field of doubtful speculations a temper of reserve ; and make contributions towards narrowing the issues upon which men have found or thought themselves to be divided . In pursuit of this general aim , the following measures have here been adopted . 1 . To call into question the title of what is termed natural immortality to the place which it now largely holds in the religious mind of our generation ; and to exhibit it as a contested and undecided matter of philosophical speculationas to which we do not possess material sufficient to warrant the assertion of any duty either to affirm or to deny . 2 . To point out that early Christianity was not saddled with the responsibilities attaching to this opinion , and therein possessed a freedom which has been impaired by its unauthorized encroachments and tacit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if part oi the Christian faith . 3 . To show that the Christian religion , properly so-called , is less directly implicated in these contentions than has been 6ommonly supposed ; and thankfully to put under view the wisdom and moderation of the early Christian Church in the construction of its Creeds. 4 . To describe the three formally developed modes now chiefly prevalent in the presentation of the subject , and leave it to be considered whether there is not good reason sometimes firmly to eschew and condemn , and sometimes at least to stop short of affirming , various propositions which one or other of them has advanced . // 5 . To point attention to the diversities of phrase and idea , with which the lot of those rejected in the world to come is set forth by our Lord . My mind is swayed towards the belief that the combined effect of the several declarations is to indicate a Divine purpose of reserve as to all which lies beyond the broad and solemn utterance hereinbefore cited from St. Paul ; and that the firm assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be found more effective for the practical repression of sin than its development into more copious and detailed , but less certainly authorized , expositions . 6 . To bring into view the guarded enlargement of the common field of view , which Butler has conjecturally supplied , and in which he abates nothing from the efficacy of the Incarnation of the Saviour , bfit adds to the sum of its beneficent results . All this the present writer has set out as subject to correction , worthy at most only of being deliberately pondered , in the hope that the wheat may be duly winnowed from the chaff . A similar sense of the evils and dangers of self-confidence governs me in the attempt to sketch the frame of mind into which , not as a teacher of religion , but as a private Christian , he seeks to cast his own contemplation of the subject . The future life , says Butler , is the foundation of all our hopes and all our fears , such hopes and fears as are worthy of any consideration . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion withheld from present view is of such extended range , as to throw the present bounded scene not indeed into insignificance , but into minuteness . In what St. Paul described as the fulness of time , * gospel was proclaimed , tidings of joy and gladness , with a background , it is true , of penal retribution for the obstinately disobedient , but still with joy and gladness for their principle , their determining character ; inasmuch as , had it been otherwise , the great gift so long kept for the maturing process in the womb of time would have not been an euangelion , but a dusangeliom to man . The leading office of the gospel , in its bearing on the world to come , was to make known not misery but salvation . Its direct concern was with the moral and spiritual part of man ; the part in which he had received a deadly wound ; the part which supplies the true enduring basis of what he is , the basis of his character . To heal that wound , to supply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not furnish him with particular information as to the conditions of the life to come ; but , leaving his ignorance to be dispelled at the proper season when it comes , revealed the one great secret which comprised in itself every other that concerned him , the mode and means of his reunion with God . But in the shadow of this glorious teaching lay the inevitable question : What shall be the lot of those who reject it ? This question was small and remote for the hundred and twenty elect soals* in the upper room set upon pursuance of the truth and the right . But it gradually grew large and larger still for the Church as it spread from land to land , and obtained the world 's confessed urovision f or professed allegiance . The or meeting this question was ready to hand . It lay , in a certain sense , outside the gospel , and was anterior to it , like the other laws of our human nature , and of the government of the world by its author . But this law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged by the gospel the law of " indignation and wrath , tribulation , and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil , " t yet acknowledged with a sorrow which is shown by the comparatively fluctuating or shadowy manner in which this sad reverse of the picture is handled  --  the inseparable but obscure under side , so to speak , of the great foundation stone of peace and happiness . How much do we know of the lot of the perversely wicked ? They disappear into pain and sorrow ; the veil drops upon them in that condition . Every indication of a further change is withheld , so that if it be designed it has not been made known , and is nowhere incorporated with the divine teaching . Whatever else pertains to this sad subject is withheld from our too curious and unprofitable gaze . The specific and limited statements supplied to us are , after all , only expressions in particular form of immovable and universal laws-on the one hand , of the irrevocable union between suffering and sin ; on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full , but only in part disclosed , and having elsewhere , it may be , their plenary manifestation , in that day of the restitution of all things for which a groaning and travailing Creation yearns.
