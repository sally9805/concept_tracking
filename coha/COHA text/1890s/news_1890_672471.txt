txt A new phase of the Biddeford disfranchisement outrage , referred to in the Biddeford dispatch to Tan Tiaras of this morning , has been partially developed since yesterday . The Biddeford Board of Aldermen has been arrested and brought before a United States Commissioner , here in Portland , charged . with oonspiring to commit an offense against the United States , in that it did not , in making up the list of voters of the city of Biddeford , strike off the names of the 514 persons who have been disfranchised by that body of reliable Republioans known as the Supreme Court of the State of Maine . The Aldermen were arrested late last night by United States Marshal Saunders , and were in the august presence of United States Commissioner Band at high noon to-day . United States District Attorney Dyer appeared as prosecutor , and S. O. Strout appeared for the defense . One Witness Was examined , and then the hearing was adjourned until next Monday , each Alderman being placed under bonds of $1,000 . It Is understood that when Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that no further testimony will be taken until Sept. 10 , two days after the State election . The politicians of Portland are puzzled to know what the prosecution is aiming at , but there can scarcely be a doubt that the proceed. - Lug is exclusively in the nature of bulldozing . The Aldermen make up the city cheek list , and obviously what the Republicans wish to do is to scare them so that they will not dare to disobey orders which may issue from the Republican . City Committee of Biddeford relative to the making up of that list . The Biddeford Aldermen were arrested under sections 5,440 and 5,512 of the United States Revised Statutes . Section 5,44.0 provides that when two or more persons conspire to defraud the United States in any manner , and one or more do any act to effect the object of the eonspiracy , they shall be liable to a fine of V. to $10,000 , or imprisonment not more than two kn years . Section a , 512 provides that any officer , owingly and willfully registering as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fined not more than $500 , or imprisoned not more than three years , or both . The usual voting lists had been made up in Biddeford by the Assessors , and had been file &; with the Town Clerk , and had probably been posted in the usual way . These lists had been certified to be correct in the purely perfunctory manner in which it is commonly done preparatory to the usual session of the Aldermen of the town , when objections to the qualification of the voters can be made , the voters cited in , and the lists freed from error by due hearing and decision by the board . After the voting lists had been thus prepared and deposited with the Clerk , the Aldermen had no power to strike from or add thereto a single name . Section 5 of the State statutes provides : " After such lists are thus prepared , deposited with the Clerk , and posted , the Selectmen shall not add thereto nor strike therefrom the name of any person , except M open session on one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voters , nor shall they strike from said list the name of any person residing in the town without notice first given that his right to vote is questioned and an opportunity for hearing on one of such days . " The State requires that four days before the day of election the board shall be in session to receive evidence of the qualification of voters , and they can not alter the preliminary lists before that time . Bare is where the peculiar character and significance of the Reed-like performance of yesterday comes in . Suddenly and between the time when the voting lists had been deposited with the Town Clerk and before the time provided by law for the Aldermen to sit and decide upon the qualification of alleged voters borne on the list the members of the board are arrested , charged with conspiracy against the United States , and put under heavy bonds for further appearance . There is no evidence that the Board of Aldermen proposes to do anything illegal respecting the cheek list . The declaration has been made , in edasi-oflicial way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reed 's court and that no attempt would be made to vote any person known not to be entitled to vote . Whoever has taken the pains to visit Biddeford , in order to investigate the diafranohisemeat outrage . must have been convinced that the Democrats of the city , although under a sense of the great iajustice done them , were possessed of the intention to net strictly in accordance with law . Perhaps the best evidence of what their intentions are may be found in the fact that they propose to pat such of the disfranchised men as are susceptible of immediate naturalization through a new process of naturalization before the Federal court in this city . It is a foot that for the last four days a Biddeford attorney has been giving all of his time to the preparation of applications for naturalizes don , and this attorney expects to be engaged in this work exclusively from now until election day . To-morrow morning the first installment of applicants will appear in the United States court , before Judge Webb , and it is expected that during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be naturalized in this court and in the State Court . Probably 150 of ? the disfranchised ones are not susceptible of immediate naturalization because they did not come to this country before they were eighteen ' years old , but if no unforeseen obstacles permit ' there will be a sunicient number of de novo naturalizations to more than make up for those who must wait two full years before they may renew their citizenship . lf , then , the Democrats of Biddeford are undertaking at an expense of not loss than $2,500 to do a thing which shows that they recognize the deoltion of the court as binding , and to do a thing which would avoid any apparent call for partisan action upon the part of the Aldermen , it Is clearly a gross injustice to attribute to the Aldermen an intention to be guilty or partisan action . It is clear that the Federal court has been used in this instance in an unwarrantable and before this , unheard-of manner , as . a piece of political machinery . In the course of an able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters of the First ' District are called upon to say whether they will sanction this prostitution of the legal processes of the United States court to secure Mr. Reed his desired majorities , and if , in their attachment to him and their party , they will " give their ' sanction to having men arrested before they have committed or can commit a crime , in order that citizens may learn that Mr. Reed can tight with every weapon , lawful or unlawful . that he chooses to put his hand to . " The editorial concludes with these words : " air . Seward once said to a visitor at the State Department in the them of the civil war : ' I can touch this little hell mid cause the arrest of any citizen in the United states . ' Mr. Reed can touch the proper wires and legal officers can be subjected to detention and arrest , not for any public purpose , but to save the Speaker from the trouble of coming home to meet the labors of his campaign . Citizens of York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sanction such campaign measures as these . To say the least , they are new in the politics of Maine . "
