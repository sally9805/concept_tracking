txt The New-York , New-Haven and . Hartford Railroad Company has at last decided , it appears , to use steam heat in all of its passenger cars . For two or three weeks two trains equipped with apparatus for warming the cars by water . that has been heated by steam from the locomotive have been running between this city and Boston by way of the New-England Company 's road , and , now it is announced that fifty of the New-Haven Company 's cars will be equipped- in the same way within a few days . The woik is to be ? continued at the company 's shops , it is said , until every passenger car on the road shall have its steam and . hotwater pipes . At the same time it may be noticed that the example set by this State with respect to legislation concerning the heating of cars will probably be followed by Massachusetts , for a bill forbidding the use after Nov. 1 , 1892 , of " a stove or furnace kept inside the car or suspended therefrom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The laws of Rhode Island forbid the use in cars , after Dec. 1 next , of common stoves or of auy. heater not approved by the Railroad Commissioner , and of 875 passenger : cars in use on roads in that State 443 are heated by steam . Now that a system of steam heating has been approved by the New-Haven Company , it may be expected that a satisfactory law relating to this subject will be passed in Connecticut whenever that State shall have a Legislature that can do something .
