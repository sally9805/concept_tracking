A GREEK PRIME MINISTER : CHARILAGS TRICOUPIS . " POOR charming Greece ! How she is to get out of her scrapes I do not see , but I love her all the same . " So , not long ago , wrote a friend , a careful student of Greece , her people and politics ; and I am sure that any one who has taken even a passing interest in her later history will echo his feeling . More than fifty years have passed since her struggle for freedom from Turkish rule awoke the sympathy and aid of Europe ; but though more than once since then her importance in the ever living " Eastern question " has made European diplomatists anxious on her account , in America the Greece that we know is still that of Pericles and Aristotle . We know that there is a free modern Greece , but what she has done , what she is doing , we know little about ; few of us suspect that the Greek of to-day is not merely proud of his ancestors of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even hopeful of emulating them in many fields , and that he often expects a speedy realization of his dreams of conquest . Still less often do we think that the effort of Greece to attain and to imp*rove the highest civilization of Europe , in spite of her poverty and the heritage of ignorance and disorder and misrule of the Turk , has many lessons that statesmen may well heed . Yet the progress of Greece within the last thirty years is astonishing . In habits of life , in wealth , in facilities for education , in the development of the arts and sciences , in government , in all that tends toward refinement and culture , the Greece of to-day is not to be compared with that of a generation ago . Many mistakes have been made ; many undertakings have failed . The people in the country districts are yet not well educated . The country to-day is so deeply in debt that its solvency is a matter of doubt ; but the progress has been wonderful , and in the achievements of the past lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greece has been that these changes have been brought about especially through the influence of a few chosen leaders . The form of government is parliamentary , and hence democratic in spirit ; but probably in no other country of Europe is there so little popular initiative , so much reliance upon the political leaders For one thing , it serves to develop strong , self - reliant , though possibly at times reckless leaders , upon whom , in great part , must fall the praise or the blame of all public acts . For the last dozen years , the most prominent of these leaders has been Charilaos Tricoupis , a man who , in the opinion of more than one member of European cabinets , is a great statesman in a small country , but a man who would have been a great statesman in any country . He comes of a well-known political family . His father , Spiridion Tricoupis , perhaps best known abroad as the author of the // standard history of the Greek Revolution and the eulogist of Lord Byron , at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that history , and as a litt6rateur , poet as well as historian . His father 's brotherin-law , Maurocordatos , was perhaps the most prominent political actor on one side of the revolutionary struggle , while Spiridion Tricoupis himself was a member of several cabinets , and in 1855 Prime Minister ; he had studied in France and England , was once envoy extraordinary to France , twice envoy extraordinary at London , and was accredited there a third time , when he refused the appointment in order to become Prime Minister at home . Charilaos Tricoupis , born at Nauplia , in Greece , in 1832 , had thus , from his father 's long residence abroad in France and England , the inestimable benefit not only of a thorough knowledge of the languages , learned when he was young , but , what is of vastly greater importance for a statesman , a sympathetic understanding of foreign politicians and peoples and of their institutions , acquired much as a native acquires it . Though he studied at Athens and had a careful home training in Greece , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the diploma of law . In 1852 he was made attach6 of the Greek legation in London ; in 1855 he became secretary of legation there , and in 1862 he was made eharg6 d'affaires . Tricoupis began his political career in Greece in 1863 , when , on the occasion of the revolutionary change of dynasty , he was chosen with his father , by Greeks in England , as their representative in the National Assembly , though he took no especially prominent part in the proceedings . From the time when he was first chosen member of the Boul6 ( Chamber of Deputies ) from Missolonghi until to-day , with the exception of one year , he has been either in political life at home , or on some special mission abroad . In physique , as his portrait would show , he is very robust and strong , carrying his sixty-two years with the vigor of a man twenty years younger . His powers of work and endurance are simply phenomenal , though one may perhaps question at times the judgment of the man who so abuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the burden upon him not merely of the treasury , but of all the multifarious duties in the way of local government , office-distributing , and general dictatorship that fall to the lot of the Prime Minister of Greece , he often works from eighteen to twenty hours a day , and , so far as one can learn , makes no provision at all for regular recreation or rest . At his house , one day , his sister told me that he had gone to bed that morning at three o'clock , and at seven was again in his office at the treasury department . People who wish to see him on business have , at times , appointments made late in the night , when lie is more likely to have leisure than when , in the daytime , his anteroom is thronged with visitors . A Greek Prime Minister needs unlimited powers of endurance , for his work is almost that of a dictator , with corresponding duties , while his political opponents are ever watchful to catch him napping , and often do not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ago , the opposition filibustered and talked on the budget from four o'clock in the afternoon until ten the next morning . Divided into relays , they talked against time , raising technical points , and using all the arts common to such tactics . Members read , yawned , slept , went to the lobbies and elsewhere in small squads for refreshments , keeping well within call of the party whips ; but for sixteen hours Tncoupis never left the Chamber , sitting quiet , watchful , apparently unwearied and needing no refreshment . At another session he remained fourteen hours , and was led finally to rest a moment only by the ruse of a friend , who sent for him to give advice on an iinpor* // tant question concerning the matter in hand . In the lobby he found his friend with a freshly prepared cup of chocolate , and no further matter to settle . Many people , friends and opponents , say of him , " Tricoupis has no physical wants . " To his scorn of physical feeling and indulgence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great part , doubtless , his remarkable versatility and breadth of knowledge ; a versatility that his friends are fond of comparing with Gladstone 's , though until his knowledge manifests itself more in print few will be prepared to go so far . Certainly , however , this knowledge is extraordinary . A few moments ' talk with him on politics shows not merely . the politician of the keenly practical type , who deals with men as they are , and who knows their weaknesses well , but shows also the political philosopher and student , the master of comparative constitutional law and practice . One might expect this , perhaps , from a lifelong political and diplomatic training ; but he is also generally conceded to be easily the first financier of Greece , and he would be a great ; financier anywhere . Yet - and this illustrates his power of acquisition and reasoning - one of the members of the cabinet , and himself commonly considered one of the strongest students of finance in the country , a man well worthy to be minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him well , in 1874 , Tricoupis was not a financier , was not even a strong student of finance , not having turned his attention that way . Later , the question became of vital importance , and he took it up . In an almost incredibly short time , he had become a master of the subject , in theory and in practice , as applied to Greece . " Nearly every educated Greek knows French well ; but Tricoupis speaks English also , practically like a native Englishman , with perfect readiness and mastery of idiom . Though he does not pretend to the same familiarity with German , yet he speaks the language with Germans who call to see him , and has a like command of other tongues . A Prussian general said that he had rarely known a politician with so good a knowledge of military affairs . When in 1886-88 the question of buying ironclads for the Greek navy came up , he was found by naval men and shipbuilders to be thoroughly conversant with the problems of their work . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , science , the last book of travel , - he takes an interest in it . He does so much that his breadth of knowledge is remarkable , and in all concerning his special work he is profound . To his interest in archaeology is due in great part the rapid development of the study and of the museums in Greece . The best laws favoring the extension and direction of the museums have been his ; and he has given the greatest aid and encouragement to foreign schools in his country , not merely officially , but personally aiding them in securing sites for buildings and in arranging streets near at hand . The relation of the central government to local government in Greece , as well as the personal ascendency of Tncoupis as Prime Minister , is clearly shown by an experience of the English and American Arclueological Schools . A narrow street running by their properties had become a place for deposit of nuisances by people in the neighborhood ; so much so that it seemed best to the schools to have it closed . On trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were advised to see Tncoupis . The directors of the schools accordingly sought an interview with him , and stated their case . As one of them said afterwards , Tricoupis appeared at once to see the whole case in all its bearings . He stated to them , very briefly , but very completely , all the disadvantages of such a procedure , and asked if they still wished to have the street closed . When they said Yes , he promised that it should // be done . They did nothing more ; but , to their great surprise , - for promptness in such matters is rarely expected anywhere , - within a few days workmen appeared , and the street was closed . In speaking to him afterwards of the relations of the central government to the city government , this case came up , and I asked him how the Prime Minister could thus direct a purely local affair . He replied that it had not seemed necessary to him to explain to the directors the course of proceeding . It would have taken time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ; so he had promised it . In fact , he had simply brought the case before the local authorities , and the matter had been arranged by them . He added , " Because I speak English , a large part of the public business of the English and American residents comes to me first ; and it is often , as in this case , easier for me personally to see that it is done than to send them to the local authorities . " It is , however , also true that it is a much surer way . Owing to the fact that the prefects of departments , to use the corresponding French term , are appointees of the central government , and that these prefects have practically unlimited control - at any rate , through obstruction - over the local finances by means of a veto and power of amendment , the Prime Minister can , if it should seem to him wise , bring overwhelming pressure to bear upon the local officers . In consequence , when the Prime Minister promises that something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no idle promise , depending upon the whim of a local city council for its fulfillment . It will probably be done without opposition , for the Prime Minister , as a sensible man , will not bring forward a bad case ; but if the council does object , the Minister - if he is strong and willing to risk the political influence of his acts - is in a position to block completely the wheels of local government . In speaking of Tricoupis as an orator , - for he is easily , especially from the standpoint of a thoughtful Englishman or American , the greatest orator of modern Greece , - it is not a little amusing to note that Greeks are impressed , even in his speaking , by his power of endurance . " I have seen him speak four hours at a stretch without taking a sip of water , " said one of his admirers , " while Delyannis " ( his chief political rival ) " drinks glass after glass in a budget speech . " I have even seen the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather malicious story of a motion to adjourn the House in the middle of one of his speeches , on the ground that the members were tired out , and of the reply by the president , that if the orator could stand it , he thought they would hare to . On the other hand , * German admirer says , on the authority of one of Tricoupis ' political opponents : " He does not speak ; he roars from the tribune . He does not refute ; he tears his enemy to pieces . His dialectic power not only persuades , but carries away like a torrent . " In fact , his oratory is impressive from the evident sincerity and power of the orator , and from the nature of the subject matter . Tricoupis ' power of very condensed lucid statement is most exceptional . In his budget speeches , he shows rare clearness and force in the exposition of a difficult subject . To these qualities are added a coolness of judgment , a willingness to look to the hottom of things and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very persuasive in an orator . His frankness , lately , in openly recognizing the bankrupt condition of the treasury illustrates his direct way of dealing with difficulties , while his striking statement of the case shows his oratorical power . In its English dress , one of his budget speeches lacks , as it must , perhaps , in translation , something of the polish of phrase and of allusion and apt comparison that make a similar speech by Gladstone really de // lightful reading ; but it is no less clear or persuasive . His diction , too , is said by the Greeks to be remarkably pure , and even classic in tone , - the highest praise for a Greek to give it , - though I believe that some of his political opponents , who , to make capital , call him the " Englishman , " and speak of his foreign training as if it made him a less patriotic Greek , affect at times to find in his pronunciation and style a lack of the true native flavor of idiom . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that he has not lacked patriotism . Rather , his love for Greece and his vigor in her behalf have won him the compliment of consideration by foreign courts that has not always been friendly . When , for example , in 1870 , it was proposed to send him to Constantinople as minister , Turkey objected at first . As acting minister for foreign affairs at the time of the Cretan insurrection , he had been , for Turkish taste , too positively and emphatically a Greek , with the " great idea " that it is the duty of Greece to watch over the interests of all people of Greek blood wherever found . Though for the last ten years he has been exhorting his countrymen to reasonable patience in the carrying out of their plans for territorial extension ; though he is often denounced at home as unpatriotic , because he is too cool-headed to permit his people to rush unreasonably into an unequal conflict before their own resources and power are more fully developed , yet he has the hot blood of the Greek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows self-control better . In 1878 , however , when he thought that France , at the Berlin Conference , was betraying the interests of Greece , his words of blame were so stinging that it gave his political opponents a chance to pass a vote of apology to France for them . It should be remembered , too , that Russia , even if she did not press her objection , did not wish him to be the Greek member of that Conference , though it had been proposed to send him there . It was known on all hands that he was the ablest and boldest Greek for such a position . So in 1885 , at the time of the Bulgarian coup d ' etat , when he was out of power , and Delyannis , then Prime Minister , mobilized the Greek army , to get also , if possible , a slice of Turkish territory , he criticised the action sharply , not because it was warlike , but because it was not warlike enough . Before Greece did anything of importance the powers blockaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gained nothing but a large increase of debt , and a vigorous hint to King George that if he prized his crown he must not let such things happen again . Tricoupis , now , would have acted more quickly . " Had we been in power , " said he , in speaking of the event lately , " our policy would have been to seize promptly as much of the territory as we could hold , before Turkey could guard it , and then to open negotiations . Possession is often nine points of the law , but in such cases it is ninetynine points out of a hundred . " Of course his opponents say that he could not have done better than did Delyannis ; but still they confess that he often has a way of doing more than he promises , and that he is not afraid . He is , nevertheless , Machiavellian enough ( I am one of those who see much to admire in Machiavelli ) to think it wise to be prudent , and not to keep other nations unfriendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudence is noticeable in his personal conduct . For example , he makes it a principle never to receive a present . It would not do to let even a suspicion of his personal honesty and honor arise . His diplomatic training also appears in a most interesting light in his correspondence with the foreign office when he was so skillfully conducting the negotiations that led to the cession of the Jonian Islands to Greece . We are the more im // pressed with the diligence and ability and pluck and character of the man when we reflect that , a young man but thirty-two years of age , he found himself pitted against the shrewdest and best trained diplomats of Russia and Austria . In a letter dated March 2 , 1864 , occurs a sentence or two which , though innocent enough , would have delighted Machiavelli himself- Referring to a declaration which Earl Russell had said that he would send him , Tricoupis writes : " I have not refused to accept it , in order that I may send it to Athens , but I am resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be silent on some subjects than to make reservations , as by thus acting we lead others to suppose that we accept the proposals which had no reservations . " It would be unfitting , of course , to attempt to give in detail , in such an article as this , any account of Greek finance , and of the part that Tricoupis has played as minister of finance , yet this is perhaps his highest claim to statesmanship . The general nature of his policy , however , and the principles by which he has been guided are simple , complicated as are the specific problems . Greece , on account of her limited area , is not a wealthy country , but she ought to pay her running expenses and the interest on her debt . This , in the opinion of English financial experts as well as of Tricoupis himself , she is fully able to do without burdening industry to the point of exhaustion . Instead of running behind each year , as she has usually done , she should get a budget balance , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner resources of the country can not be properly developed*wi*hout means of communication that will enable producers to reach markets at a distance . It is , therefore , Tricoupis thinks , the only wise policy , if one looks to the future , to build good roads and railroads as fast as the country can afford them . He thinks , too , that she can afford a good many . The country can not develop its own resources without them . And besides , Greece is especially well fitted in many ways to attract tourists , if only the means of access to the chief places of interest are not too rare and expensive . Tourists in large numbers are a source of wealth , as Switzerland has long since proved . For this reason , also , it will pay to build roads . There must be a sound currency to do business with . An irredeemable paper currency not only brings difficulty into budget calculations , an enormous loss in exchange in buying abroad and in paying interest on the public debt abroad in gold , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a poison in the business circulation , making it speculative , uncertain , and weak . Greece has a paper currency badly depreciated , gold standing at points fluctuating between 150 and 175 as political prospects change . Seldom does it fall to one man twice to do away with such a blighting influence on financial prosperity as paper money is , yet Tricoupis has done this once , and it is his plan to do it a second time , if the present policy succeeds . Rarely is the statesman whose position depends upon the will of the people so courageous and self-sacrificing that he is willing alone to take into his hands the responsibility of such an act , especially if it brings with it an increase of taxation and a probable fall from power ; yet such a man is Tricoupis . In 1883-84 , he raised a loan , withdrew surplus paper , and abolished legal tender at one stroke , coupling with fiscal reforms an increase in taxation and his scheme of internal improvement . In 1885 , largely in consequence of the increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and in his year of absence from office he was compelled to see a useless mobilizationof the army , to which we have already referred , that added millions to the already heavy burden of the debt , and a reintroduction of the legal tender money that he had made such efforts to abolish . And now it has been his policy to abolish it // once more , though we must await the event to see if he can succeed . Such , briefly , is and has been his policy , - sound money , internal development , a budget balance , even with high taxes . To be sure , with this have gone many reforms in taxation . Indeed , the whole system has been revised and bettered , though , to save his country 's credit , he has not shrunk from increasing taxation . So long as this increase is not carried so far as to cut into the sources of income , as every student of finance is aware , no harm is done , and Tricoupis knows his country well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a year ago , according to foreign finance experts , the country showed no signs of exhaustion . The perplexities of the finance minister in Greece , however , are not more the weight of taxation than the difficulties of collection , due to the nature and habits of the people , and to the trouble in securing continuous support in carrying out any policy that involves an increase of taxes . The opposition promises a lessening of taxes , but the opposition never gets a balance for the budget ; and a late finance minister , M. Carapanos , who told me a year ago that he *ras endeavoring to found a party that should be devoted to a principle instead of being personal , as most Greek political parties are , and who , according to late papers from Athens , has secured enough followers in the House to give his party a name , the Progressive , - this N. Carapanos recommended an understanding with the creditors of the state by which they should receive in hand sixty per cent of the interest money due them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when the resources of the country enable us to do so . " So long as Greece showed no more signs of exhaustion than it did a year ago , a finance minister who did not earnestly strive to balance his budget and pay his country 's obligations was either ignorant , or was simply cowardly and playing for popular support ; knowing that if he continned his policy the future had nothing for him but bankruptcy and repudiation of debts . Tricoupis prefers the honor of his country to popular applause , though the six months that he was out of office last year have made the task almost hopeless even for him . He has had to cut down two payments when they were due , though he hopes to complete arrangements promptly for meeting the others . This leads me to consider him briefly as an administrator , and to note some of his views on the nature of Greek politics , as well as to consider certain problems that a Greek Prime Minister finds confronting him ; for a Greek Prime Minister is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is more autocratic , and at the same time more dependent upon personal favor . Since King George came to the throne there has been only one legislative body , the Bouh* , and , as in England and France , the Prime Minister is dependent upon his majority there . As , however , with this majority he can pass into law any bill . without reckoning later with Senate or House of Lords , and as also the number of deputies is small , the value of individual votes is great . The members know their value , and do not hesitate to bring about concessions of various kinds from the cabinet . Of course I do not mean to say that all members of the Boul6 sell their votes for favors . Rather , as the matter was stated to me by more than one Greek in a position to know , it is not wise for the government to offend members , if it wishes to remain in power . When a member asks the government for an office for one of his faithful constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the frontier be allowed to remain in the capital , or that a teacher be transferred to some more pleasant locality , the government wishes to grant the favor , and often does so . The practice is not materially different from that which holds with us at times , only the member can make his influence more directly felt // on the executive ; he may vote against him ; and the members are not so held within party traces as in England and in the United States . It is said that Tricoupis is moved less than any other minister by such requests from members . He is not so easily accessible ; his rather cool demeanor and businesslike way of looking at things do not encourage the asking of favors . Indeed , he is said to lose votes at times by summary refusal of such petitions ; and yet , doubtless , when he is in office , office-mongering is carried on in his cabinet , and without his express disapproval , if not directly by himself . In a country given over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has yet done much to check the evil and to put things on a better basis . He has passed more than one law providing for qualifications for office holders that should insure the selection of fit men for office . When Delyannis was last in power , he repealed these laws and changed many office holders , intending , *s he himself told me , to pass better laws on the same subject , since these were faulty ; but , he said , he was dismissed by the King before he could carry out his intention . Tricoupis afterwards reenacted his former laws , though not , his enemies say , before he had put out iDelyannists , and put in his own friends . The practice of removals on party grounds is evidently active on both sides , though all recognize the evil , and are honestly endeavoring to remove it , with still the strong temptation that we find at home to do so in good part at the expense of the opposite party . " I think , " said M. Tricoupis , " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint non-political officials at will , though I do believe in a strong executive with much power and responsibility . The government should not have its hands too much tied , but should be able really to do something . " In fact , whatever may be said by friends or enemies , he is the only one who has deliberately gone ahead to deprive himself , by legislation , of the burden of office-mongering , though M. Sotiropoulos , the late Prime Minister , wrote , before accepting office , as if he intended to go even further . What he did I have as yet been unable to learn . Tricoupis is businesslike in the conduct of public affairs . Officials say that they must work harder when he is in office ; but as he is a hard worker himself , they can not complain . Indeed , it is his intense earnestness in work , and his unwillingness to spare himself in the public service , as well as his consummate ability , that , rather than any personal courting of favor , give him his firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the personal nature of Greek political parties , to which I have already referred , will put this relationship between leader and followers in a clearer light . The political parties in Greece all start in the Boul6 . As soon as a man gets influence enough to direct the votes of a small group of members , he has a party ; and if he is strong , this party may grow until he can control the Boul6 , and later , in a general election , the vote of the people . Thus , Tricoupis himself , first a follower of Kumunduros , but with some vigorous reform notions of his own that won him adherents , in 1872 founded his party with five or six members . In 1879 , his party in the Boul6 numbered fourteen , though in the mean time he had been Prime Minister . And to-day the Greeks - an intensely political nation - are Tricoupists or Delyannists , Carapanists or Rhallyists . The leaders may represent some special ideas , though party lines are not closely drawn on principles ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , the allegiance to party is a personal allegiance to the chief . Throughout the country , each party chief has his local leaders of the people , who are more or less faithful to him , and to whom in turn the voters are more or less faithful . I say more or less faithful . A friend of mine in Ath // ens asked a candidate who was soliciting his vote three or four years ago whether he was to support Tricoupis or Delyannis in the next Boule ' . " I can not tell , " he frankly replied , " until after the election , when I can see how matters stand . " As citizens the Greeks are very keen and bright . In the cities they are well read , and are all politicians ; and even in the rural districts , though the rate of illiteracy is high , the political interest seems remarkably strong . When it comes to voting , however , the motives are as mixed as our own . Patriotism , judgment on party questions , fidelity to chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have their influence , as with us . Many candidates expect to put one hundred drachm*e or so with the innkeepers to supply wine and raki free to electors . Elections often cost the candidate ten thousand drachma* , and queer stories are told of election debts and their payment . Even the kumpari system - that is , the relation of godfather to children , which in the Greek Church is a sacred relationship , binding the child to the godfather for life in bonds of duty - has been used to hold votes , a man thus widening his influence greatly . Such methods are employed , of course , only with the more ignorant ; and one must not misjudge the wisdom or patriotism of the Greeks because these things occur . The country is still young in selfgovernment ; and until lately the country districts were far removed from the political centres through lack of means of communication , while the Church and the customs of the people smack strongly of patriarchal government . " The Greeks are the best sons and brothers in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Athens , a Greek , familiar with Europe and America , though the same man had just been telling me some of the above-named weaknesses of his people . Perhaps no other people exhibit their love of fatherland and home as do the Greeks . Witness the magnificent public buildings , museums , and monuments built by the wealthy for the education of their people and the beautifying of their country . Witness also those who come to pass their green old age in Athens , when they have gathered their portion in foreign lands . One of the most striking buildings in Athens , the Academy , built for the use of a society which the Greeks hope some day may rival in reputation the French Institute , was given to his country by a wealthy banker . Now , in a country where the people , in spite of these excellent traits , are often so susceptible to political trickery and art as are the Greeks , Tricoupis stands out sharply distinguished from his fellow-politicians in his habits and manner . He has courted neither politicians nor people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not love him ; they admire , and fear , and trust him . Said a very keen observer , not a Greek , who has passed a dozen years in close relations with the court and politics in Athens : " Tricoupis is an autocrat . Nobody dares do anything without his aid , even in local government , when he is in power . He puts on airs . He is very able , is a genius . He has no physical wants , makes no concessions , will not condescend . Delyannis will drink mastic on a street corner with the coachmen , and is popular ; Tricoupis shuts himself off with his lordly airs . But when the people get into trouble , they want Tncoupis . " " This reserve is his art , " his opponents say , of course ; but to one who has seen him even a little , this reserve appears perfectly natural and sincere . He neither could nor would stoop to other methods ; and , moreover , while he may seem more reserved than most Greeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly foreigners would not consider him lacking in courtesy . His apparent indifference to praise or blame is striking . Indeed , it may fairly be // a question if he is not at times unwise in his neglect of the press ; if he does not really owe it to the country that he is serving to have the side of the government fairly represented before the people and the world . It is an open secret that the governments of France and Italy and other countries keep part of the press subsidized ; they justify themselves on the grounds given above . Tricoupis certainly does not subsidize many papers . Only two out of all in Athens could say a good word for him before his last resignation , and now when he is again in power the situation is about the same . An article in the Contemporary Review a year or two ago says that the gentlemen on the staff of a paper that favored him asked him once to guarantee two seats in the Boul6 . He refused point-blank , and the paper went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tricoupis ordered it closed , regardless of the wish of the paper . There was one more issue of the journal , in which it sought revenge by a violent onslaught on him ; then it stopped . This disregard of opposition is seen in many acts of his . He has never hesitated to increase taxes when it seemed wise to do so , though such an act is always unpopular . Not long ago , in order to lessen expenditures , he suspended the foreign ministers , and left the business of the legations in the hands of the secretaries . In 1887 , he had strength enough to reduce the number of deputies in the Boul6 from two hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty , - a measure which , however useful it might be from the standpoint of economy and of improving the grade of deputies , could hardly make him beloved by the politicians . In 1891 , Delyannis , who was the Prime Minister , increased the number to two hundred and seven , where it still remains . A year or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuition by students in the university , an act which nearly caused a riot in that susceptible class , and brought about a characteristic scene , characteristic both of Greek students and of the stern directness of Tncoupis . A crowd of students gathered in front of his office , and a delegation waited upon the Prime Minister . As sooii as they had announced the purpose of theirvisit , without waiting to hear their argument , he demanded , " Do you come here as students or as citizens ? If as students , you are not competent to discuss the question ; if as citizens , you are unpatriotic , being unwilling to bear your share of the burdens of the country . " Whereupon he turned away to his private office . The students went out ; and when , later , an outbreak was imminent , the cool-headed chief of police turned water on the crowd from the fire hose , and they dispersed . This treatment of the students , just or not , was not a means to secure popularity . To despise popu* larity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trickery is always so ; but when one 's power to do good for one 's state rests in the people , needless severity is weakness and unwisdom . " Sometimes , " said he one day , " it is best for the country to do things that the people do not want just then . " But that does not make one popular . Moreover , it is unsafe as a principle . In rare desperate cases it is true ; at other times it may be true , when the people can be made to see what is best in season to prevent their overthrow of the policy ; but it is always risky , and when it fails may do far more harm than delay would have done . When it was intimated that his proposed line of policy - recalling the legal tender , making a loan , raising taxes - was a bold one , he replied : " We have counted the cost . It is a policy that is sure to defeat us ultimately . Raising taxes , contracting the currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is worth the cost if we can get the policy so firmly established // before we fall that our successors must carry it on after us . Then we have won . " Noble words these , and , I feel sure , sincere ones ; and yet there is the great " if . " Can he get his policy established ? Under the existing circumstances , desperate as they were , he was surely right in making the attempt ; and to his heroic determination at the time Greece probably owes to-day what is left of its financial credit . But still such circumstances are extremely rare . The experience of Greece during the last few years ; its ambition to extend its territory , without the requisite strength ; the checks by the great European powers ; its increasing burden of debt ; its failure as yet to bring all the Greeks in Macedonia , Crete , and elsewhere under its control , as many devotees of the " great idea , " with lack of judgment , hoped that it might soon do ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make not uncommon among Greeks a feeling that their present form of government is not a success , and that it needs serious modification . A prominent member of the cabinet said , not long ago , that he would favor a senate of some kind to check the Boul6 , and to lessen the pressure from its members . Many articles have appeared in the papers , advocating a more active participation in affairs by the King , - practically the advice to the King to act as his own Prime Minister . Lately , again , the King has been blamed for acting too much on his own judgment . One very intelligent Greek - not an active politician , but a man conversant with politics at home and abroad - told me that he really doubted , in view of the experience under the constitution , if the Greeks were yet ready for self-government . In country districts the people are ignorant ; very many can not read or write , and take little interest in politics , except from the personal standpoint with reference to the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that if the King were a somewhat different man , it might be both wise and practicable to abolish the constitution , and to let the sovereign govern as well as reign , with the aid of chosen counselors . Strange views , these , in a popular government of to-day , with the drift toward democracy that is seen throughout Europe ! They all remind us that Greece is not yet free from a touch of Orientalism . The ideas of Tricoupis on the subject are quite different , and are of great interest and value in the present crisis . When these views were set before him , he said that he considered the Greeks a thoroughly intelligent people , though in the country districts many are illiterate . Very many of them are now landowners ; there is land enough for nearly every one to be so , and the laws favor such holding . There is no proletariat in Greece , such as is found elsewhere in Europe ; consequently , there is no socialistic movement there . The interests of the people are well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run , so that it is safe and best to trust them . " This is not true of all countries , " he continued , " but in my judgment it is true of Greece . Political parties are based on principles and interests . On the whole , it is safer and wiser to base action upon the interests of the people . When the people are intelligent enough to recognize these interests , as , I think , the Greeks are , they are ready for self-government . " Lately the people have seemed slow in following his judgment ; and if they were to overthrow him in the next election , it would militate against his opinion regarding them . Believing thus in his people ; knowing that , without a proletariat , and with the great natural resources of the country , the people could well bear an increase of present burdens for the more rapid development of the country , he has not hesitated to push them on in the way of // development . Were they of his mind , were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ability to do all that he has asked , and more , and that it would be wise for them to do so . Keen observers , however , who have lived long in Athens , - not Greeks , - think that he has been a little too far ahead of his people , and that they will not follow him . Recent events would seem to point that way , and yet one can but hope that they will be ready to trust again so strong an intelligence . If Tricoupis has a weak point as a statesman , it is probably this : he is a little too willing to drive public opinion , or rather the public , into the right road , instead of following the slower but surer plan of leading them thither . He possibly pushes his measures - wise ones - too fast . One can but contrast his methods with those of Lincoln in his first term . Lincoln waited until the people were with him , leading them ; and thereby he won . Had his patience been less wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have been so great a statesman as the world now confesses him to have been , however great he might have been in intellect or heart . Tricoupis , nevertheless , in spite of his rather autocratic methods , may fairly be said to have created popular government in Greece ; for until he had stirred the King and people by his articles advocating trust in the people 's majority , and so had won his first premiership , elections in Greece were hardly free , and the government was not in fact really of the people . Now the government is of the majority in the Boul6 . One can but admire his rigid independence and scorn of petty trickery ; but it is not necessary to be careless of popular feeling in order to be upright and honest ; and , moreover , if one is to rely upon the people , one can not be too far in advance of them . In the present financial condition , to avert bankruptcy , heroic measures are needed . It is not a mistake to drive matters now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for roads and railroads and other developing agencies could wisely precede the popular demand and willingness to pay heavy taxes . Doubtless the people were glad to have the improvements , but the result seems to show that they had not counted the cost . Throughout his long political career Tricoupis has remained a poor man , caring only for his work , and living on the meagre salary paid him and the slenderest income from some little inherited property . He lives very modestly , in a rented house , with his sister , who , unmarried also , seems with him to give her life to politics and the state . No sketch of him would be complete without mention of this highly gifted lady , who has been for years his most useful aid . Day after day , and all day long , she receives friends , strangers , constituents , opponents , greeting all with the unfailing tact and courtesy that delight and win , and speaking to each his own language with an accuracy that astonishes one . " Her drawing-room , " well says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the nearest approach to the political and literary salon of the last century . " From what has been written it will be seen that Tricoupis is essentially a man of action . " It is better to make a campaign upon what you have done than upon what you have said and promised , " he declared , in speaking of his policy ; and he acts upon this view . A German writer , in describing him , says that his most striking characteristic is will ; and I think that this opinion is shared by all who come to know him , though on first meeting him , the chief impression upon many people is made by the wonderful rapidity with which he seems to grasp in all its details the subject presented . Delyannis , who from his long years of contest with him ought to know his characteristics well , said of // him , " M. Tricoupis is a man who dares . " The remark was not intended to be complimentary , for Delyannis thinks that he dares do more than he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tncoupis has not hesitated at times to bend the letter when it seemed to conflict with the spirit of the law , or with what he thought to be the real interest of the country ; but in no case have I heard any charge that he ever had a personal end in view , or that he considered anything but the highest interests of his country ; and in most cases those who gave the facts justified them as in themselves wise , but perhaps dangerous , as being precedents which unwise or unpatriotic men might follow . " A man who dares , " a most necessary characterization of all great men , I think an excellent one of him , though I have already shown that he is also prudent , audax et cautus . But he is not vacillating or timid . He is prompt , vigorous , sure . In many things said of him , and in many things that one sees , he reminds one of Bismarck : a man of blood and iron , if need be , in a small country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , doomed to be checked by being thrown out of power every few years , and to see his good work undone by his opponents . Think of his tax reforms , legal tender repeals , civil service laws , set aside , to be remade by him , while he had also to pay the debts uselessly heaped on the country by others . The debts made by him have been in the main for substantial benefits to the country . Greece is too poor and small to cope with Turkey on land ; but a struggle with Turkey every Greek considers inevitable . Tricoupis provided for irondads that would give Greece control of the sea so far as Turkey was concerned ; but at the moment when the ironclads were firing the first salute to their new masters , as they entered the Pira*us for the first time , the minister who had secured them was with the King laying down his office . With all his strength and enthusiasm Tricoupis feels keenly these reverses ; but he knows that the only fortunate outcome for Greece is through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise her by every possible means . He , with the rest of his countrymen , hopes for a greater Greece ; but , as he has written to his people , " the true policy for Greece is to become a strong country . Strengthen Greece morally and in wealth , then she will be sound and right , and ready to take what comes in the future . " The events of the last two ministerial changes in Greece , when Tricoupis resigned , and after a six months ' interval returned to power , serve to throw further light upon his character , the nature of Greek politics , and his relation to the policy of the country and to the King . The basis of his late financial policy was a new loan , which should pay the interest of the old debts for three or four years , enable them to be consolidated , the paper money to be withdrawn , and the tax system arranged to suit the circumstances . The policy originated with him , and was favorably commented upon and declared entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the country . The loan was negotiated , and all was settled but one point . The English bankers wished some English control over the taxes that were pledged to the payment of the loan and its interest . This neither the King nor Tricoupis would grant in any form that would take away the suzerainty of Greece . At length , after long negotiation , it was arranged that these pledged taxes were to be paid into the hands of English trustees , to be remitted to the bankers in question . Both the King and Tricoupis were agreed that the suzerain rights of the people were not alienated , and that the loan might be closed by royal decree , under existing laws . At this point the opposition // press stirred up so violent an outcry , asserting that any such condition was unpatriotic and a sacrifice of Greek sovereignty , thatpublic opinion veered around ; placards appeared denouncing Tricoupis as a dictator , and criticising his policy and the loan as unconstitutional ; and finally the King lost his courage , and suggested the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction . Tricoupis felt that the outcry was uncalled for , and was willing , if backed by the King , as before , to go ahead and sanction the loan by royal decree , as first intended . When the King was unwilling , however , to take the responsibility without the consent of the Boul6 , Tncoupis accepted the suggestion , and telegraphed to London that the loan was to be submitted to the Boul6 for sanction , as the case had been with all other Greek loans . He knew that he could count upon his majority in the Boul6 ; and he wished , as a minister should , to stand by the King in all forms , however unnecessary , without protest . The bankers , in those circumstances , not having confidence in the fickle Boul6 , categorically refused that condition , and insisted upon the decree alone , saying that was sufficient . In consequence , Tricoupis promptly resigned , so as to give his successor as much time as possible to meet the difficulties . Had the King stood by him , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late events show that he was not mistaken in relying upon his majority . The new cabinet struggled through the summer without calling together the Boul6 , but when , in November , the Boul6 met , on the ballot for the presidency the ministry fell on a vote of 102 to 50 against it . Tricoupis ' candidate had more votes than the candidates of all his opponents combined . The King , perforce , has called his great minister again to power , and , with a very strong majority , he takes up the heavy task where he laid it down , - a task made heavier by the weakness of the King and the delay that he had caused . The whole story brings more vividly to view the difficulties of a statesman in a small state , with a people passionate and fickle , hardly ripe for self-government . What the outcome is ultimately to be is doubtful ; what the next few years , or even the next year , may have in store for Greece is a grave problem ; and yet , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the Greeks are not to be a successful nation . At any rate , we may be sure that in power - as he has been most of the time for the past twelve years - or in opposition , Charilaos Tricoupis is to be a prime factor in directing the course of his country . He is easily the greatest Greek of his day , is one of the great statesmen of the century , and his influence must be felt , and felt for good .
