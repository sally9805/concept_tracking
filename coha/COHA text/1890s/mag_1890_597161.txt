OF REVELATION . 11. - THE GRADUALNESS OF REVELATION . JRST the blade , then the - ar , then the full corn in the ear . " This picture Jesus himself drew of the foreseen diffusion of his kingdom . The kingdomwas to be " as if a man should cast seed upon the earth . " He plants it and leaves it ; he sleeps and rises , " night and day . " Meantime the seed springs up and grows , " he knoweth not how . " It goes through , one after another , the stages of development up to the ripeness of the fruit . A parable , it need not be said , is framed to illustrate one point , and is not to be pressed beyond the intended scope . As rain and sunshine are required for the growth of wheat , so we are taught elsewhere that divine influences are needful , and are never disconnected from the operation of the truth in the minds of men . There is enough complementary teaching of Jesus to preclude any mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parable shows the confidence of Jesus in the perpetuity and progress of his kingdom . There resides in it , so he declared , a self-preserving , self-developing life . The seed , once planted , might be left with entire unconcern as to its growth . In these days , when " development " is a word on every tongue , we are often told that the conception of nature and natural law is foreign to the Scriptures . No assertion could be more mistaken . Even on the first page of the Bible , although the design there is to set in the foreground the creative agency of God , we read that the earth was bidden to bring forth the grass , the herb , and the fruit tree , each yielding after his kind , ' ' whose seed is in itself . ' ' In the parable of Jesus of which we are speaking , it is said that " the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself " - that is , to transfer the Greek term into English , " automatically . " That epithet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inherent in the seed which Jesus , through his discourses , his acts of mercy and power , and his patience unto death , was sowing in the world . This grand prophetic declaration , uttered in a figure so simple and beautiful , in the ears of a little company of Galileans , was to be wonderfully verified in the coming ages of Christian history . It is not , however , the progress of Christianity since it was fully introduced by Christ and the Apostles that we have now to consider . The development of the understanding of Christianity on the side of doctrine and of ethics , the advance to a more and more just and enlightened comprehension of the Christian religion , the unveiling of the riches of meaning involved in it , is a fascinating theme . But all this belongs under the head of the iiiferfreta/io91 of Christianity , that term being used in a broad sense . The religion of the Gospel means vastly more to-day than it was ever perceived to mean before . This enlarged meaning , however , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educed from it , through the ever-widening perceptions of Christian men whom the Spirit of God illuminates . The starry heavens are now what they were of old ; there is no enlargement save that which comes through the increased power and use of the telescope . The globe on which we dwell to-day is the same that it was twenty centuries ago . Yet during the past ages there has been a progressive advance in astronomical and geographical discovery . No one commits the blunder of confounding discovery with creation . What we have to speak of now is development and progress in the contents of revelation itself , in the interval between its remotest beginnings and the epoch when the Apostles finally handed it over in its ripe , consummated form to the Church , to be thereafter promulgated in the world . Of divine revelation itself the saying is likewise true : " First the blade , then the ear , then the full corn in the ear . " The fact that revelation was progressive , that it went forward like the advance from dawn to noonday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a natural process merely . Some will be quick to leap to this rash inference . As regards natural religion , the fact that creation is found to have been progressive , that unsuspected links are found to unite its consecutive stages , that the tendency of They imagine that there is no need to call in God to explain nature except where breaks are met 460 // in the chain of mechanical causation . It is enough , they imagine , to be able to trace back the planetary system to a fiery vapor preceding it , as if the existence , or the order , or the beauty , of the astronomic system were thereby explained . If it be true that the plants in their multiplied species or " kinds " spring out of a few primitive germs , or out of only one , the evidence of forethought and will-power in the organization of the vegetable kingdom is not in the least weakened . Nor would itbe effaced if the spontaneous generation of the living from the lifeless were an ascertained fact of science . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God where there is observed an orderly progress of phenomena , which leads to the ignoring or denial of the supernatural in connection with the gradually developing religion of redemption . The critical researches of the time ferret out bonds of connection between successive stages of religious and moral teaching in the sacred volume . As in geology , there is less need than was formerly thought to fall back on the supposition of catastrophes along the path . The rudiments of what once seemed an utterly new form or phase of doctrine are detected at a point farther back . Behind the most impressive inculcations of truth are found the more or less unshapen materials out of which they were framed . The statue is followed back through the different sets of workmen to the quarry where the marble was hewn out of its bed . Before the Lord 's Prayer was given by the Master some of the petitions contained in it had lain , like grains of gold dispersed in a sand-heap , in the arid waste of rabbinical teaching . The first effect on a novice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tales out of which they were woven , is to lessen in some slight degree his previous impression of the poet 's originality . In a much greater degree is this effect produced by the first view of the spoils of the past which Milton gathered - from Homer , the Greek tragedians , Dante - and incorporated into his poems . That revealed religion is revealed , and is not the product of human genius , despite the gradual unfolding of it and the coherence of its parts , becomes more and more evident the more thoroughly the characteristics of it are appreciated . Its unique character finds no explanation in native tendencies of the Semitic race . History belies such a solution , of which Renan is one of the later advocates . This can be said while it is conceded that there were , no doubt , qualities in the Hebrew people which caused them to be selected as the recipients of revelation , and as witnesses for God to the rest of mankind . When we contemplate the true religion in its long , continuous advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when we survey this entire course of history as a connected whole , - we are struck with the conviction of supernatural agency and authorship . When the outcome appears at the end in Jesus Christ and his work , light is thrown back on the divine ordering of the long series of antecedent steps . The accompaniment of miracle is a crowning token , reinforcing all other proofs of the supernatural , and confirming faith by an argument to the senses . In glancing at the historic process of revelation , as that is disclosed by the scriptural documents , there is one transition which none can overlook . It is the contrast , on which the Apostle Paul builds so much , between law and gospel , the old covenant and the new . It is true that the Old Testament is not wanting in proclamations of the merciful character of God . The Apostle Paul himself insists that the Old Testament religion was , in its very foundation , a religion of promise , and that law came in to fill an intermediate space and to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise . His doctrine is , moreover , that even the Gospel contains a new disclosure of God 's righteousness , which was made necessary by his having passed over human sins in the period of comparative ignorance . The Atonement prevents the misconstruction which the divine forbearance in dealing with law-breakers in the earlier times might have occasioned . Still , the earlier revelation of God was predominantly a manifestation designed to impress on those to whom it was made his justice and unsparing abhorrence of transgression . Only as far as ill-desert is felt can pardon be either given or received . An education of conscience must precede a dispensation of grace . The later revelation was one of forgiving love . The superiority of Christianity to the Old Testament religion is the subject of the Epistle to the Hebrews . Its author will show that Christ is the " mediator of a better covenant "  --  a covenant with " better promises . " " For , " he pointedly remarks , " if that first covenant had been faultless , " there would bave been no occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 's love , its inclusion of the Gentile races , was one of the prime elements in the Gospel . This was the " mystery " which had been hid from " ages and generations . The ordinary meaning of the term " mystery , " in the New Testament writings , is not something which is still unknown , or inscrutable , but something which had before been concealed from human knowledge , but had now been brought to light . And the term is specially applied to the purpose of God to show // mercy to the world of mankind - a purpose which had been concealed from men , or at best but obscurely divined . What precisely was the conception of God which was entertained in the earliest periods of Hebrew history is a subject of debate . There are questions which will be settled variously , according to the different views which are adopted respecting the date and relative authority of the documents . That the process of expelling the vestiges of polytheism and image-worship from the practices of the Israelitish people was accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language uttered by the heathen , that the gods of other nations than Israel are real beings , and exercise power , although it may be less than the power of Israel 's God , determines nothing as to the doctrine of Israel 's own accredited teachers . But Jethro , although a Midianite prince , was the father-in-law of Moses , and we find him saying , " Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods . " Jephthah says to a Moabite king : " Wilt thou not possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess ? So whomsoever the Lord our God hath dispossessed from before us , them will we possess . " Even Solomon wavered in his beliefs on this subject . Side by side with the altars of Jehovah , he built altars to foreign gods . Even in the early Church the idea prevailed that the deities of the heathen were demons - really existing , but evil and inferior in power . It would be natural for the less instructed Hebrews to imagine that there was some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worshiped . An indistinct idea of this kind is at least a natural explanation of the story of the attempted flight of the prophet Jonah to Tarshish , which lay on the western border of the Mediterranean . There is a curious disclosure of a natural feeling in the fact recorded , without censure or comment of any sort , of Naaman , the Syrian captain . He craved permission to take into Syria two mules ' burden of earth ,  --  the sacred soil of Israel ,  --  that upon it he might offer sacrifice to Jehovah . Some scholars there are who consider the earliest belief of the descendants of Abraham to have fallen short of a positive monotheism , and to have been rather a monolatry-the worship of one God , to the exclusion of all other worship , but without an explicit disbelief in the existence of other divinities who have respectively their own earthly realms to govern . Then the progress of faith would include , first , the idea of the God of Israel as more powerful than all other deities , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the distinct conviction that all other gods are fictitious beings . But the scriptural evidence in favor of this succession in the phases of faith is scanty . We are speaking now , not of the populace , but of their more enlightened and steadfast guides . The path from a more narrow conception of God to a pure and absolute monotheism is supposed by some to have been through a deepening ethical idea of the attributes of Israel 's God . Wellhausen writes : " Jehovah became the God of Justice and Right ; as God of Justice and Right , he came to be thought of as the highest , and at last as the only , power in heaven and earth . " The reader of statements of this kind should bear in mind that we are in a field where prepossession and theory play a great part . If it could be established that Jehovah at the outset was regarded as simply the tribal god , the sovereign protector of that one people , while the other nations were imagined to have each its own guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure and lofty conception of the only true and Uving God , the world 's creator and ruler , which is presented in soul-stirring language by the most ancient prophets , is a marvel . The transformation is really insoluble on any naturalistic theory . Even on the supposition that there was this gradual uplifting of religion from the low plane on which all pagan nations stood , and that the notion of a mere local divinity , of limited control , gave way to the maj estic conception of one Lord of heaven and earth , the maker of all things , the ruler of nations , the universal sovereign - no conclusion would be so reasonable as that God Almighty took this method of gradually disclosing his being and attributes to that portion of the human race from whom , as from a center , the light of the true faith was eventually to radiate to the rest of mankind . The universal providence of God is a cardinal element in Christian theism . Nothing is independent of him . There is no province set apart from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . XVe can easily understand why , in the early stages of revelation , all emphasis should be laid on the sovereign power of God , and why a clear separation of his direct efficiency from his permissive act should be reserved for a later day . It was always taught , indeed , and holds true for all time , that according to a law of habit , of which the creator of the soul is the author and sustainer , sin engenders further sin . A selfpropagating power inheres in transgression . In numberless examples it is observed that sin is thus the penalty of sin . It is true now , as it was always true , that a loss of moral discernment and a fixedness of perverse inclination are an ordained effect of persistent evil-doing . The law which entails this result is but another // name for a divine operation . Hence it is a false and superficial theology which will find no place for " judicial blindness " and for a " hardening of heart " that deserves to be called a judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in full accord with the Scriptures of the Old . But there are certain forms of representation which , in the introductory periods of revelation , go beyond these statements , and ascribe to God a positive and immediate agency in the production of moral evil . Sometimes the hardening of the heart is spoken of as if it were the end which is directly aimed at . Such passages , taken by themselves , would warrant the harshest doctrine of reprobation which hyper-Calvinism has ever broached . The proper treatment of such passages is not-certainly not in all cases-to pronounce them hyperboles . It is not through unnatural devices of interpretation that we are to rid ourselves of the difficulty which passages of this nature occasion . The reference of them to a fervid rhetoric - in various instances , to say the least - may not be the right solution . We are rather to see in them that vivid idea of God 's limitless power and providence which has not yet arrived at the point of qualifying the conception by theological discriminations . If it be asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sin with the ascription of it to God 's causal agency , the answer is that the inconsistency was not thought of . Reflection was required before the inconsistency referred to could become an object of attention , and the need of removing it be felt . In more than one philosophical systemfor example , in Stoicism - there is found an earnest ethical feeling , which condemns wrong action , side by side with a metaphysical theory as to the origin of evil , which logically clashes with such an abhorrence of it . The two judgments do not jostle each other , because they are not brought together in the thoughts of those who entertain them . Where there is more reflection in the matter , as in Spinoza and his followers , it is still possible to keep up a degree of moral disapproval along with a theory which really ought to banish it as absurd . In the ancient Scriptures , and occasionally in the New Testament ; especially in passages cited from the Old , the evil-doing and perdition of classes of men , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ends in themselves . Being involved in the circle of occurrences which are comprised in the general scheme of Providence , they are no surprise to him who carries it forward . They were foreseen and taken into the account from the beginning . It was arranged that they should be overruled and made the occasion of good . Their relation to Providence is emphasized in speaking of them as being directly aimed at and pursued , so to speak , on their own account . As we follow down the progress of revelation , we see that needful distinctions are more frequently made , and more carefully insisted on . In the second book of Samuel ( xxiv. i ) it is said that God " moved " David against Israel , with whom he was displeased , and bade him go and number the people . The impulse or resolution of David , on account of which David was subsequently struck with compunction , is there said to have emanated directly from God himself . But in the later history ( i Chronicles , xxi. i ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was Satan who " provoked David to number Israel . " The earlier writer does not hesitate to describe God 's providential act as if it were the direct product of his preference , an explicit injunction , and the fact of David 's repentance for doing the act does not present to the writer 's mind any difficulty . The chronicler , from a later point of view , sets forth the act of David in such a way as to exclude , if not to guard against , the supposition that God prompted it . The gradualness of the disclosure of the merciful character of God is one of the most obvious features of revelation . One part of this disclosure pertains to the heathen , and to the light in which they are regarded . It was natural that the contempt and loathing which idolatry and the abominations of paganism excited in the heart of the pious Israelite - feelings which the Mosaic revelation developed and stimulated - should be felt towards heathen worshipers themselves . The hatred thus begotten awakened an impatient desire that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this unmerciful sentiment , and what is really a distinct advance in the inculcation of an opposite feeling , is found in the book of Jonah . There are reasons which have availed to satisfy critics as learned and impartial as Bleek , who are influenced by no prejudice against miracles as such , that this remarkable book was originally meant to be an apologue - an imaginary story , linked to the name of an historical person , a prophet of an earlier date , and was composed in order to inculcate the lesson with which the narrative concludes . This was the opinion , also , of the late Dr. T. D. Woolsey . One thing brought out by the experience of Jonah is that so great is God 's mercy that even an explicit threat of dire calamities may be left unfulfilled , in case there intervene repentance on the part of those against whom it was directed . The prophet who was exasperated at the sparing of the Ninevites was taught how narrow and cruel his ideas were , by the symbol of the // gourd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a night . " He was incensed on account of the withering of the gourd which had shielded his head from the sun . The Lord referred to Jonah 's having had pity on the gourd , and said : " And should not I spare Nineveh , that great city , wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that can not discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much cattle ? " This humane utterance , in which compassion is expressed even for the dumb brutes , is memorable for being one of the most important landmarks in Scripture since it marks a widened view of God 's love to the heathen . To illustrate this truth the narrative was written , and towards it as onward to a goal it steadily moves . The truth of a righteous moral government over the world pervades revelation from the beginning . Obedience to law will not fail of its due reward ; guilt will be punished in a just measure . But under the Old Testament system , nearly to its close , the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horizon was practically bounded by the limits of the earthly life . It was here , on earth , that well-doing was to secure the appropriate blessing , and sin to encounter its meet retribution . The Israelite , like other men of antiquity , was wrapped up in the state . He felt that his weal or woe hinged on the fortunes of the community in whose well-being his affections were , in a degree beyond our modern experience , absorbed . The prophets never ceased to thunder forth the proclamation that the fate of the community would be surely , in the providence of God , determined by its fidelity or its disloyalty to its moral and religious obligations . If they deserted God , he would forsake them . The people were to be rewarded or punished , blessed or cursed , as a body . And so in reality their experience proved . Moreover , as regards the single family , and the individual , the tendencies of righteous action , under the laws of Providence , were then , as always , on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence were in their favor . But in process of time it became more and more painfully apparent that this rule was not without numerous exceptions . The righteous man was not uniformly prospered . He might be poor , he might be oppressed , he might be condemned to endure physical torture , he might perish in the midst of his days . On the other hand , the wicked man was often seen to thrive . His wealth increased . He grew in power and influence . His life was prolonged . How could the justice of God be defended ? How could the allotments of Providence - this disharmony between character and earthly fortune - be vindicated ? This problem became the more anxious and perplexing as the minds of men grew to be more observant and reflective . How to explain the lack of correspondence between the condition and the deserts of the individual ? This problem is the groundwork of the book of Job . A righteous man is overwhelmed by calamities , one after another . His lot is to himself a dark and terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solve it in the only way known to their theology . Such exceptional suffering implies an exceptional amount of guilt . Job must have been a flagrant transgressor . Of this fact his dismal situation is proof positive . The wrath of Jehovah is upon him . Conscious of the injustice of the allegation brought against him , yet unable to confute the logic of it , Job can do nothing but break out in loud complaints extorted by his anguish and the bewilderment into which he is thrown . He can not see any equity in the lot which has befallen him . His outcries give vent to a pessimistic view of the world and of the divine management of it . Another interlocutor brings forward the inscrutable character of God 's doings . What more vain and arrogant than for so weak and helpless a creature as man to pretend to sound the unfathomable counsels of the Almighty , and to sit in judgment on his ordinances ? This , of course , is a rebuke , but contains no satisfactory answer to the questions which the distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given . Afflictions may have other ends than to punish . They may be trials of the righteousness of a servant of God . They are a test to decide whether it springs out of a mercenary motive . Hence , it is not to be inferred that his sufferings are the measure of his ill-desert . Thus a distinct advance is made in the theodicy . New vistas are opened . Pain has other designs and uses besides the retributive function . Yet at the end Job 's possessions and his earthly prosperity are all restored to him . The feeling that even here on earth there must be , sooner or later , an equalizing of character and fortune is not wholly given up . It was revealed , then , to the religious mind , that suffering , besides being inflicted as the wages of sin , might be sent to put to the test the steadfastness of the sufferer 's loyalty to God , to prove the unselfishness of piety , by showing that it might survive the loss of all personal advantages resulting from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience and piety . But relief from perplexity in view of the calamities of the righteous came from another source . This was the perception of the vicarious character of the righteous man s affliction . This idea emerges to view in a very distinct form in the great prophets . The pious portion of Israel , the kernel of the people , // of the sins of the nation , andasameansof saving it from deserved penalties and from utter destruction . This view is brought out by Isaiah in his description of the servant of Jehovah . The conception is gradually narrowed from Israel as a whole , or the select portion of Israel , and becomes more concrete ; so that in the fifty-third chapter the sufferer is an individual , the Messianic deliverer . It is declared that the popular judgment respecting the sufferer , which attributes to him personal guilt , and sees in his lot the frown of God , is mistaken . Penalties are laid on him , he is taking on himself penalties which not he , but others , deserve to bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and death of Jesus , and how abundantly it is set forth in the New Testament , it is needless to say . Who had sinned , the blind man or his parents , that he was born blind ? His blindness , Jesus replied , was not a penalty for the sin of either . This problem of the distribution here on earth of suffering in discordance with desert , of which we are speaking , had new light shed upon it by the gradually developing faith in the future life ; but of this point I will speak further on . Jn general , the contrast between the common run of Old Testament descriptions of the reward of the righteous , and of the New Testament declarations on the same theme , is very marked . In the Old Testament it is riches , numerous children , safety of person and of property , which are so often assured to the righteous . The words of Jesus are , " In the world ye shall have tribulation . " Yet the essential character of God , the eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the government of the world , is at the root the same in both dispensations . He who would appreciate the progress of revelation has only need to compare the silence as to a hereafter and the gloom that encompasses the grave - characteristic features of ancient Scripture - with the definite assurances and the triumphant hopes which are scattered over the pages of the New Testament . On this subject we can trace the advance from the night to the brightening dawn and from the dawn to midday . The hopes and aspirations of the ancient Israelites were bounded by the limits of the present life . Their joys and sorrows were here ; here , as we have seen , were their rewards and punishments . It is true that they did not positively believe their being was utterly extinguished at death . On the contrary , they found it impossible so to think . There was some kind of continuance of their being , vague and shadowy though it was . When it is said of the worthies of old that they died and were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XXXIX. - 65. 465 to their burial - certainly not alone to their burial-that the phrase points , it was used of those who died far away from their kindred . A continued subsistence of some sort is implied in it . Necromancy was a practice which was forbidden by law , and the need of such a law proves that the belief and custom prohibited by it had taken root . The story of the appearance of Samuel , and the occupation of the witch of Endor , show at least a popular notion that the dead could be summoned back to life . Sheol , the Hades of the Israelites , was thought of as a dark , subterranean abode , a land of shades , where existence was almost too dim to be denominated life . There was nothing in this unsubstantial mode of being to kindle hope , or to excite any other emotion than that of dread . In the poetical books Sheol is personifled and depicted as full of greed , opening her mouth " without measure , " and swallowing up all the pomp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaiah , Sheol is represented as disturbed by the approach within her gloomy domain of the once mighty King of Babylon , and as stirring up the shades , the dead monarchs , to meet him . They exult over his downfall and death , crying , " Is this the man who made the earth to tremble , who made kingdoms to quake , who made the world as a wilderness and broke down the cities thereof ? " But this is only a highly figurative delineation of the humiliating fall and death of the arrogant , dreaded sovereign . It is not until we have passed beyond the earlier writings of the Old Testament that we meet , here and there , with cheerful and even confident expressions of hope in relation to the life beyond death . In the later Psalms there is an occasional utterance in this vein . The sense of the soul 's communion with God is so uplifting as to forbid the idea that it can be broken by death . Jesus refers to the Old Testament declaration that God is the God of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the belief in the continued , immortal life of those who stood in this near , exalted relation to the Eternal One . What other - at least , what higher - evidence of immortality is there than is derived from the worth of the soul , and what indication of its worth is to be compared with its capacity to enter into living felloxvship with God ? How can a being who is admitted to this fellowship be left to perish , to exist no more ? Besides this connection of faith in future life with the relation of the righteous and believing soul to God , the demand for another state of being to rectify inequalities here arose by degrees in religious minds . The strange allotment of good and evil , whereby the good man , and not the bad man , was often seen to be the sufferer , and the holy were found to be maligned // and the victims of oppression , led to the expectation of a life beyond , where this confusion would be cleared up and an adjustment be made according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others before and since , have presented as the ground for believing in a future state , was a revelation from God to the Hebrew mind , and not the less so because this belief stood connected with experiences and perceptions that went before . There is a familiar passage in the book of Job in which the hope of a reawakening from death is perhaps expressed . It is the passage beginning , " I know that my Redeemer "  --  or Vindicator- " liveth . " The confessions of hopelessness in earlier portions of the book , the impassioned assertions that there is nothing to be looked for beyond death , are to be counted in favor of the other interpretation , according to which the vindication which Job expected he looked for prior to his actual dissolution . On the contrary , however , it is not improbable that the foresight of an actual reawakening to life is represented as having flashed upon his mind , displacing the former despondency . Certain it is that distinct assertions of a resurrection appear , here and there , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the deliverance of the whole man , body as well as soul , which in process of time comes to be the established belief . It is closely associated with the conviction that in the triumph and blessedness of the kingdom the departed saints are not to be deprived of a share . It was not a belief derived from the Persians , but was indigenous among the Hebrews ,  --  an integral part of revelation ,  --  however it may have been encouraged and stimulated by contact with Persian tenets . Not to refer to statements , relative to a resurrection , of a symbolical character ,  - -  such as the vision of dry bones in Ezekiel ,  - -  we find in the twenty-sixth chapter of Isaiah a passage which is explicit , and , as it would seem , is to be taken literally . In the Revised Version the passage reads , " Thy dead shall live ; my dead bodies shall arise . " There is a critical question , it should be stated , as to the date of the chapter in which these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages of a like purport . In the book of Daniel the resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked Israelites is very definitely predicted . As is well known , the resurrection was an accepted doctrine of orthodox Jews in the period following that covered by the canonical books . In the New Testament immortality , and with it the resurrection , stands in the foreground . Through the death and resurrection of Jesus there comes a new illumination , a signal disclosure of God 's purpose of grace and of the blessed import of eternal life ; so that death is said to be " abolished " and life and incorruption " brought to light " ( 2 Tim . i. io ) . When we leave theology for the domain of ethics , the progressive character of revelation is capable of abundant illustration . The Sermon on the Mount has for its theme that fulfillment of law , that unfolding of its inner aim and essence , which Christ declared to be one end of his mission . Morality is followed down to its roots in the inmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protest against the Pharisaical glosses which tradition had attached to Old Testament injunctions . It is " the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees " which is pointedly condemned . It is still an unsettled question , however , whether the reference to what had been said by or to " them of old time " was intended to include Old Testament legislation itself as well as the perverse , arbitrary interpretations which had been attached to it by its theological expounders . Plainly the injunction of Jesus to love the enemy , as well as the neighbor , goes beyond the directions in Leviticus ( xix. i ' * ' , i8 ) : " Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart . . . . Thou shalt not take vengeance , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . " Here nothing is said of any except the " neighbor . " The prohibition is limited to the treatment of national kinsmen . That the general obligation to the exercise of good-will towards wrong-doers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultivation of a forgiving temper towards all men , finds in the Gospel an unprecedented expansion and emphasis is evident to all readers of the New Testament . A supplication for the pardon of enemies forms a part of the Lord 's Prayer . The hope of personal forgiveness is denied to those who are themselves unforgiving . The example of Jesus , and the pardon offered to the most unworthy through him , are a new and potent incentive to the exercise of a forgiving temper . A glance at the ideals of ethical worth in the early ages of Israel is enough to show how sharply they contrast with the laws of Christ and the type of character required and exemplified in the New Testament . It was once said by an eminent divine that the patriarchs , were they living now , would be in the penitentiary . Polygamy and other practices the rightfulness of which nobody then disputed , the wrongfulness of which nobody then discerned , are related of them , and related without any expression of disapproval . Whoever has not learned that practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a gradual growth , and that even now , // after the generic principles of duty have been set forth in the Gospel , and a luminous example of the spirit in which one should live has been afforded in the life of Jesus , the perception of the demands of morality advances from stage to stage of progress , is incompetent to take the seat of judgment upon men of remote ages . Not long ago , a letter of Washington was published in which directions are given for the transportation to the West Indies and sale there of a refractory negro who had given him trouble . The act was not at variance with the best morality of the time . The letter is one that deserves to cast no shade on the spotless reputation of its author . Yet a like act , if done to-day , would excite almost universal reprobation . To reproach the worthies of Old Testament times as if they lacked the vital principle of unselfish loyalty to God and to right , as they understood it , is not less irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming tools which they used to till the ground . It is not the less imperatively required of us , however , to recognize the wide interval that separates the ancient conceptions of morality from those of the Gospel . Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite , entered , heart and soul , into the cause of Israel in the mortal struggle with the Canaanites . In lending aid to the cause which she espoused she did an act of atrocious cruelty and treachery . She enticed Sisera into her tent , and when he was reposing drove a tent-pin through his head . Yet for her deed she is lauded in the song of Deborah the prophetess ( Judges v. ) , " Blessed above women shall Jael be , the wife of Heber the Kenite ! " Almost the same words were addressed to the Virgin Mary ( Luke i. 42 ) , " Blessed art thou among women ! " What an infinite contrast between the two women to whom this lofty distinction is awarded ! Nothing is better fitted to force on us the perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet in the Psalms with imprecations which are not consonant with the spirit of the Gospel . They belong on a lower plane of ethical feeling . It is one thing to expenence a satisfaction in the just punishment of crime . It is accordant with Christianity to regard with conscientious abhorrence iniquity , whether we ourselves or other men are the sufferers by it . Indifference to base conduct , be the root of this state of mind a dullness of the moral sense , or false sentiment , is , to say the least , not less repulsive , and may be more demoralizing , than the fires of resentment which nothing but fierce retaliation can quench . But the spirit of revenge is unchristian . Christianity teaches us to distinguish between the offense and the offender : the one we are to hate ; the other we are forbidden to hate . Moreover , Christianity never loses sight of the possibilities of reformation in the case of wrong-doers . The Christian considers what an individual might be , not merely what he now is . The benevolent feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral hatred which evil conduct naturally and properly evokes . As regards personal resentment , the Christian disciple is cautioned never to forget his own ill-desert and need of pardon from God , and the great boon of forgiveness in the reception of which the Christian life begins . These qualifications and correctives of passion were comparatively wanting in the earlier dispensation . It is impossible to refer all the imprecations in the Psalms to a feeling of the authors in relation to the enemies of God and of his kingdom . Respecting such even , Jesus invoked not vengeance . He rebuked his disciples when they proposed to call down fire from heaven to destroy the inimical Samaritans ( Luke ix . * ) . No devices of interpretation can harmonize with the precepts of Christ such expressions as are found in the io9th Psalm : " Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow . Let his children be vagabonds , and beg . . Let the extortioner catch all that he hath . Let there be none to extend mercy unto him . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . " The wrath of the author of this lyric against the cruel and insolent one who " persecuted the poor and needy man , and the broken in heart , to slay them , " it is fair to assume was merited . The sense of justice and the holy anger at the root of these anathemas are in themselves right . They are the result of a divine education . But they take the form of revenge - a kind of wild justice , as Lord Bacon calls it . The identification of the family with its head is one of " the ruling ideas " of antiquity . It appears often in the methods of retribution which were in vogue in the Old Testament ages . It gave way partly , and by degrees , under that progressive enlightenment from above through which individual responsibility became more distinctly felt and acknowledged , both in judicial proceedings and in private life . It is the characteristic of Old Testament laws and precepts that in them bounds are set to evils the attempt immediately to extirpate which would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was lacking a full perception of the moral ideal . In the Old Testament expositions of duty , as we have already seen , there is an approach towards that radical treatment of moral evils which signalizes the Christian system . An additional example of this feature of the preparatory stage of revelation may be found in the last chapter // of the book of Proverbs . There " Lemuel , " the name of a king , or a name applied to one of the kings , is apostrophized . He is exhorted to practice chastity and temperance . " Jt is not for kings , 0 Lemuel , it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes strong drink : lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted . " What better counsel could be given ? The judge on the bench must have a clear head . But the counselor , in order to strengthen his admonition , proceeds to say : " Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception to be taken to the wisdom of his precept . The Jews had a custom , resting on a humane motive , to administer a sustaining stimulant or a narcotic to those undergoing punishment , in order to alleviate their pains . Something of this kind was offered to Jesus on the cross . But the counselor does not stop at this point . He says : " Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish , and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts . Let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more . " There need be no hesitancy in saying that this last exhortation is about the worst advice that could possibly be given to a person in affliction , or dispirited by the loss of property . The thing to tell him , especially if he has an appetite for strong drink , is to avoid it as he would shun poison . Yet our remark amounts to nothing more than this , that the sacred author sets up a barrier against only *t part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went thus far but no farther . It is a case where , to quote a homely modem proverb , " Half a loaf is better than no bread . " It would be a great gain for morality and for the well-being of society if magistrates could be made abstinent . On this general subject there is no more explicit criticism of Old Testament law than is contained in the words of Jesus respecting divorce . The law of Moses permitted a husband to discard his wife , but curtailed his privilege by requiring him to furnish her with a written statement which might serve as a means of protection for her . This statute , as far as the allowance to the man which was included in it is concerned , is declared by Christ to have been framed on account of " the hardness of heart " of the people . It fell below the requirement of immutable morality . It was a partial toleration of an abuse which it was then impracticable to seek to cut off altogether . But Christianity lifted the whole subject to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage relation . It superseded and annulled the Mosaic enactment . The advance of the New Testament revelation in its relation to the Old has become , in these days , obvious . But the New Testament revelation , in itself considered , was not made in an instant as by a lightning-flash . It did not come into being in all its fullness in a moment , as the fabled Minerva sprung from the head of Jove . As in the case of the earlier revelation , the note of gradualness is attached to it . The fundamental fact of Christianity is the uniting of God to man in the person of Jesus Christ . Peter 's confession respecting his person is the rock on which the Church was founded . The Epistle to the Hebrews opens with the folloxving striking passage ( as given in the Revised Version ) : " God , having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners , hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son . " The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fragmentary character . They paved the way for the final revelation through the Son , whom the writer proceeds to liken , in his relation to God , to the effulgence of a luminous body . But modern exegesis and modern theological thought , while leaving untouched the divinity of Jesus , and even , for substance , the Nicene definitions of it , have brought into clear light that progressive development of the Saviour 's person of which the Incarnation was the starting-point . Not until his earthly career terminated and he was " glorified " was the union of God and man in his person in its effects consummated . More was involved in his being in the " form of a servant " than theology in former days conceived . Nothing is more clear from his own language respecting himself , as well as from what the Apostles say of him , than that there were limitations of his knowledge . On a certain day Jesus started from Bethany for Jerusalem . He was . hungry . Seeing at a distance a fig tree with leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find fruitit being a tree of that kind which produces its fruit . before putting out the leaves . But when he came to it his expectation was deceived ; " he found nothing but leaves . " Jesus said that he did not know when the day of judgment would occur . Apart from conclusive testimonies of this character , it is evident from the whole tenor of the Gospel histories that he was not conscious of the power to exercise divine attributes in their fullness of activity . The opposite idea gives a mechanical character to his actions and to most of his teachings . How , if he was all the while in the exercise of omniscience , could he " marvel " at the unbelief of certain of his hearers ? That when he was a speechless babe in his mother 's arms he was consciously possessed of infinite knowledge , is an impossible conception . And the difficulties of such a conception are only lessened in degree at any other subsequent day while he was " in the // flesh . " When we behold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his soul poured out in the agonizing supplication : " If it be possible , let this cup pass from me . " The supposition of a dual personality in Christ is not less contrary to the Scriptures and to the Creed of the Church than it is offensive to common sense and to philosophy . Yet he was conscious of his divine nature and origin , and the unfolding within him of this unassailable conviction kept pace with the development of his human consciousness . The dawning sense of the unique relation in which he stood to God comes out in his boyhood , in the words addressed to his mother when he was found with the doctors in the temple , " Wist ye not that I must be in my Father 's hoijse ? " And the limitations of Jesus must not be exaggerated or made the premise of unwarranted inferences . He knew the boundaries of his province as a teacher and never overstepped them . Just as he refused to be an arbiter in a contest about an inheritance , saying , " Who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - so did he abstain from authoritative utterances on matters falling distinctly within the sphere of human science . No honor is done to him , and no help afforded to the cause of Christianity , in attributing to him scholastic information which he did not claim for himself and which there is no evidence that he possessed . It is not less important , however , to observe that , notwithstanding the limits that were set about him by the fact of his real humanit ) T , and as long as he dx velt among men , there was yet an inlet into his consciousness from the fountain of all truth . " No one knoweth the Son , save the Father ; neither doth any know the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him " ( Matt. xi . 27 ) . His knowledge differed in its source , in its kind and degree , from that of all other sons of men . " The words that I say unto you I speak not from myself : but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The divine in him was not a temporary visitation , as when the Spirit dwelt for a brief time - sojourned , one may be permitted to say - in the soul of a prophet like Isaiah . Even then God spoke through the prophet , and the mind of the prophet might for the moment become so fully the organ of God that bespoke through the prophet 's lips in the first person . But in Christ there was an " abiding " of the Father . The union was such that the whole mental and moral life of Jesus was an expression of God 's mind and will . " He that bath seen me bath seen the Father . " As conscience in me is the voice of another , yet is not distinct from my own being , so of Christ is it true that the Father was in him - another , yet not another . And this union , although real from the beginning , culminated in its effects not until a complete ethical oneness was attained , at the end of all temptation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Howbeit not what I will , but what thou xvilt . " This was the transition-point to the perfect development of his being , which is styled his " glorification . " As the risen and ascended Christ , he can be touched with sympathy with the human infirmities of which he has had experience , at the same time that he can be present with his disciples wherever they are - can be in the midst of the smallest group of them who are met for worship . From Jesus himself we have a distinct assurance that the revelation which he was to make was not to end with his oral teaching . Near the end of his life he said to the Disciples , " I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now . " They were not ripe for the comprehension of important truth , which therefore he held in reserve . The Holy Spirit was to open their eyes to the perception of things which they were not yet qualified to appreciate . The communication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apostles took a wider and deeper view of the purport of the Gospel . We find in the Epistles an unfolding of doctrine which we discover in the germ in the conversations and discourses of Jesus . It was impossible , for example , that the design of his death could be discerned prior to the event itself and as long as the Disciples could not be reconciled even to the expectation of it . In isolated sayings of Jesus , in particular in what be said at the institution of the Lord 's Supper , the Atonement is taught . The giving of his life , he said on another occasion , was to avail , in some way , as a ransom . But it was not until the cross had been raised that the doctrine of the cross was made an essential part of Christian teaching , and the great sacrifice became a theme of doctrinal exposition . By this subsequent teaching a void which had been left in the instructions of the Master was filled . In his teaching there were two elements , standing , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one band , he set forth the inexorable demands of righteous law . In this respect no portion of the older Scriptures , in which law was so prominent a theme , is equally adapted to strike the conscience with dismay . On the other hand , there was in the teaching of Jesus the most emphatic proclamation of God 's compassion and forgiving love . These two sides of the Saviours teaching are connected and harmonized in the apostolic exposition of the Atonement . The Apostles themselves , individually , as regards their perceptions of truth , their insight // into the meaning of the Gospel , and its bearings on human duty and destiny , did not remain stationary . How they attained to a more catholic view of the relation of the Gentiles to the Gospel and to the Church must form the subject of a special discussion . Apart from this subject , where their progressive enlightenment is so conspicuous a fact , there can be no doubt that from day to day they grew in knowledge . If we were in possession of earlier writings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that marked differences would appear between them and the Gospel and the First Epistle , which were written when " the Son of Thunder " had ripened into the octogenarian apostle of love . The Apocalypse , so far as the style of thought is concerned , whatever judgment may be formed on other grounds , may quite conceivably have been written two or three decades prior to the date of the Gospel by the same author . When the earliest writings of Paul , the Epistles to the Thessalonians , are compared with his latest writings - with the Pastoral Epistles and the Epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians- we not only find perceptible modifications of tone , but , in the later compositions , we find also views on the scope of the Gospel - what may be termed the universal or cosmical relations of the work of redemption - such as do not appear in his first productions . As a minor peculiarity , it may be mentioned that when he wrote to the Thessalonians be seems to have expected to be alive when the Lord should come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hope or expectation has passed out of his mind . As the Gospel and the First Epistle of ? ohn are the latest of the Apostolic writings , it is permissible to regard them as the fullest and ripest statement of the theologic import of the Gospel .
