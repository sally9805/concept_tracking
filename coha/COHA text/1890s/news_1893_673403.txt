txt The increase of the naval forces in Brazilian waters has been under consideration at the Navy Department this week , but nothing has been decided on in regard to adding to the vessels already at Rio . When it was proposed to send the cruiser New-York out on her final trial trip on Monday , instead of delaying until Dec. 11 , it was , it is said , with the idea that she would be that much sooner in readiness for sea service . A while ago the Secretary of the Navy determined that the New-York should go to Brazil if any necessity arose f or strengthening the naval force in Rio H arbor . The Secretary has not decided what other ships will go to Brazil . The New-York will not be docked while there is a chance that she might be needed in Rio Harbor . The latest news from Rio leaves much to conjecture . Mello 's disappearance from the harbor at Rio is accepted in Washington by naval men as a determination on his part to engage the new steamers America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon as a ruse . and his real and only purpose is to disabre the Government vessels before they can reach Rio . In this proceeding he is regarded as lacking in discretion . The experts say that he has left a diminished force at Rio to be met by the stronger force coming from New York , for no one believes he will be fortunate enough to encounter the America or Nictheroy separately on the high seas , and to meet them both would perhaps endanger his own welfare . The officers of the new steamers are prepared forjust the contingency which is expected . If Mello gets to Rio before the new steamers , and awaits them there , the naval officers here think he will stand a better chance of defeating the reinforcemenits than as if ho leached the high seas for the vessels or left the harbor open for their entrance . If the fighting is to be done at Rio , and it seems likely that the joint appearance of the Agnidaban. the America . and the Nictheroy at the Brazilian port menus nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , and that ship will be the New-York.
