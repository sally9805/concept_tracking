txt The Rebel Craving for Maryland . The rebel Congress has no such exhaustive preoccupation with its own troubles as to be all-forgetful of others . Maryland has still a strong hold upon its sympathies  --  the stronger perhaps , in that it seems to fare so sa , tisfac , torily in'the absence of the friendly coddling it would have received had the original plans of secession been accomplished . The loss of Maryland was indeed a sorry misadventure at the start ; but to discover how their loss was the gain of that Commonwealth adds poignancy to a very natural sorrow . We are not surprised , therefore , to find the Richmond legislators passing resolutions of condolence with the suppressed rebels of Maryland , and promising at an early day to overrun the State , and make the condition of its people as blest as that of their neighbors in the Old Dominion . But what must instantly occur to any ra tional descendant of the CALVERTS and CAL ROLLS , is the extreme . unlikelihood that any such engagements will be fulfilled . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Virginia promised immunity from the foot of LINCOLN 'S banditti ; yet notwithstanding the great bulk of the rebel army is in Virginia , and notwithstanding Virginia set on foot , as she boasted , one hundred and twenty thousand militia , see how the State has been stripped of its proportions . The State of Kanawha , constituting a fourth of the superficies of the old Commonwealth , has continued in uninterrupted enjoyment of its independence . They threatened fiercely in June to pour over the Alleghanies anti subdue the retroceding seceders of the Northwest , and in July , after Bull Run , Gen. LEN was dispatched to till those threats at the head of an admirably provided and greatly strengthened army . But not a soldier of the Confederate army has set foot for the last six months in the new State . The army that was to subjugate it never reached its fron tiers , and beyond the frontiers was repeatedly and disastrously beaten by Union GeneralsAt the latest accounts the campaign was over for the Winter . LEE , baffled and helpless , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Tennessee . The reconquest of the Kanawha rebels had been definitely abandoned . So on the Eastern shore . Without resistance , that important limb of the Virgin . ian body politic has been shorn quite away ; and not a suggestion of recovery comes from the Richmond Bobadils . It is given up with meekness , and quite as a matter of course . There is not even an affectation of the bluster with which such a wrong would have been treated in the Summer . Not only is the thought of aggression , of carrying the war into the North , discarded , but the hope of regaining what has been lost to them , West and East , is quite as distinctly relinquished . When . therefore , the propriety of resuscitating rebellion in Maryland is discussed in the rebel councils , let us understand the question to be purely a Virginia abstraction ; a topic without the least practical significance ; a grasping after what might have been rather than what is to be . They who could not save Virginia , can certainly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
