ARTICLE 1A**THE NATIONAL DEBT , AND THE OBLI GATION TO PAY IT . THE question as to the character of the obligation which the United States assumed by the bonds issued during the late rebellion , especially those bonds commonly called " Five-Twenties , " has assumed grave importance . So long as the attacks upon their credit were confined to such cries as " favored class , " " the money they were bought with is good enough to pay with , " and similar flings , they did not merit reply ; but latterly the opposition has assumed more of the form of argument , and such men as Thomas Ewing , formerly at the head of the Treasury Department , and a lawyer of no small ability , has expressed the opinion that these bonds could be rightfully paid in the irredeenmable notes of the Government , and the chairman of the Senate committee on finance lends the weight of his personal character and his official place to the same construction of the obligation assumed by the United States . We propose to examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the legislation and other cii'cumstances which may serve to throw light upon it . By the reading of the bonds , it appears that the United States promises to pay to the holder , twenty years from date , the amount specified in the bond , reserving however the right to pay the amount at any time after five years , with interest at the rate of six per cent . per annum , payable in coin . There can be no doubt as to the obvious meaning of this promise to pay , for payment can strictly be made in nothing but coin . A man may receive in satisfaction of his debt a note promising to pay it at some future time , he may accept lands or goods in compromise , but payment ex vi termini implies the use of gold or silver or its equivalent . There is no difference of opinion on this point among writers on finance . No nation has attempted anything different from this without incurring reproach and dishonor . Until quite recently this has been the // opinion and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds which the United States have issued before these , which have reached maturity , have been paid in coin . If these bonds had been issued twenty years ago , they would now have been paid in coin , for the United States is this year paying bonds in coin which were issued in 1848 , promising to pay a certain number of dollars in twenty years from their date , in the same form of language as these bonds now in dispute . It can not be denied that the plain and obvious meaning of the language of the bonds is , as we claim , that the bonds should be paid in coin . Does anything appear , upon a more careful *xa mination of the bonds , to change this meaning ? It is argued that because the mode of payment of the interest is especially mentioned , and nothing is said of the mode of payment of the principal , the United States may require the holder of a bond to exchange it for anything they choose to give . It seems to us , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of payment is with the holder of the obligation , and not with the maker . The obligor , as a matter of course , inserts in his obligation all the favorable conditions of which he chooses to avail himself , and his absolute unconditional promise stands for the benefit of the holder of the obligation . A bond is construed most strongly against the maker . Ther* was moreover a good reason , as any one who can remember six years well knows , why this special mention was made of the mode of paying the interest . The nation was engaged in a struggle which called for the expenditure of millions of dollars daily . The treasury of the nation was almost bankrupt , and the opinion was already prevalent that The war could only be successfully conducted by a resort to paper issues . The same act which authorized the issue of these bonds , authorized the issue of paper currency , of promises to pay which the treasury had no present ability to redeem . The United States believed that in twenty years , perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt in full ; but they assured the world that in the meantime , notwithstanding this issue of paper money , the interest should be paid in coin . The clause was inserted not to take away from the force of the obligation , but to give it strength , by the assurance that , even // in the time of insolvency , this debt , with its incident the semiannual interest , should be paid . Another portion of the bond confirms our view of its obligation-that portion providing for the payment of the bonds at the end of twenty years , or at any time after five years , at the pleasure of the United States . Why was this right to pay at any time between five and twenty years reserved ? If the intention was to pay the bonds , it is easy to understand that the United States might desire to choose the earliest time when they were able to pay , either from accumulated resources , or by borrowing so much . money as they might need at a lower rate of interest ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds only other promises to pay , and these bearing no interest , with the confession that these substituted promises could not be fulfilled , the clause which gives the United States this option seems to have no meaning . Indeed , it is difficult to understand why the bonds were issued at all . The United States might at once have issued , their irredeemable promises on demand without interest , and omitted the idle ceremony of issuing bonds . We have thus examined the bonds themselves , and are strengthened in the opinion that the United States can rightfully pay them only in the legal currency of the civilized world . The next point to which we turn our attention is the act of Congress by which the bonds were authorized , and under which they were issued . It bears date February 25 , 1862 , and is entitled " An Act to authorize the issue 9f United States notes , and for the funding or redemption thereof , and for funding the floating debt of the United States . " The title of the act correctly conveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of $150,000,000 of demand notes , bearing no interest , which should be receivable for all dues to the United States , except duties on imports , and for all demands against the United States except interest upon bonds and notes , which shall be paid in coin . The act then authorizes the issue of the bonds now under discussion , to the extent of $500,000,000 , and provides for the funding of the demand notes just mentioned into these bonds . The bill further provides that all duties on imported goods shall be paid in coin , and the coin so paid shall be set apart as a special fund and applied , 1st , To the payment of interest // on the bonds and notes of the United States . 2d , To the purchase or payment of one per cent . of the entire debt of the United States , in each fiscal year , after July 1st , 1862 , which amount is to be set apart as a sinking fund . 3d , Any surplus to be paid into the Treasury . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new way of paying debts , and proclaimed to the world that all demands against them would hereafter be paid in the irredeemable notes authorized by this act , arid that this was a notice to all purchasers that these bonds , whose issue was dow authorized , would at maturity be exchanged for the notes which this act made a legal tender . We do not propose to discuss the constitutionality or the expediency of this legal tender provision . It is in itself a confession of insolvency , of inability to pay . Its justification rests not on legal grounds , but if it can be justified at all , on that vital necessity which is above law , the necessity of preserving the life of the nation , which could be preserved in no other way . The government had not the means needed for carrying on the war , which was now reaching colossal proportions , and demanding hundreds of millions of dollars . This legislation was an attempt to meet the emergency . It proposed a loan of $500,000,000 , and provided a means of enaI*ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the demand notes of the government to furnish a currency for that purpose . There was no necessity for coupling the two issues in one act , as there was no necessary connection between the two kinds of obligation . The legal tender notes might be circulated without the issue of any bonds ; the bonds might be sold , if there was a circulating medium sufficient , without the issue of legal tender notes . Indeed , the fact is indisputable that several millions of bonds were sold before any legal tender notes were issued . There was , however , a reason for embracing these two plans in one act of Congress . What was the reason* It was certainly not to provide rieans for the redemption of the bonds . The title of the act shows that the intention was that the notes should be redeemed or funded by the bonds . The language of the text expresses the same intention , declaring in express words that the legal tender notes would be exchanged for // bonds . Congress in its wisdom had decided that a resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual with drawal of these issues from circulation , not by their payment , but by exchanging bonds for them , and in the same act directed the issue of the bonds to be offered in exchange . They evidently did not intend that paper should be hereafter the circulating medium of the country . They did not authorize its issue without providing for its retirement . The act itself shows , in its very form and language , that Congress regarded this issue of paper money as having only a transitory character , and as designed only for a temporary purpose . How absurd to claim now that the meaning of the law is just the reverse . That the transitory should become the permanent , the means the result ; that the provision for the withdrawal of the paper money by the issue of bonds should be interpreted to allow the withdrawal of the bonds by the reissue of paper money . Again , the amount of legal tenders , which by the act is expressly limited to $150,000,000 , is utterly inadequate to pay $500,000,000 . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund more than three times as large . A sinking fund might be provided of a small amount , which with its accumulations would in the course of time pay the largest debt . But why provide a non-accumulating fund for the payment of a debt just created , and having twenty years to run before maturity ? The reason was widely different . It was a scheme for selling the bonds , not for paying them , as the act expressly provides*that these notes may be exchanged for bonds . The scheme of issuing paper money was not original with the Secretary of the Treasi*ry-it was not first devised in this country ; the same thing had been done before by other treasury officers in other countries and in other ages . It was the old scheme of raising nominal values by inflating the volume of the circulating medium , and of making the bonds appear more valuable by the superabundance ani consequent inferior value of the medium by which th*y were purchasable . If Congress had stopped with this issue of paper money , all might have been well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money was so easily made , that the temptation could not be resisted , and the amount authorized by this act was sub : sequently doubled , and even trebled . Hence all our woes . // April , Not only does it not appear to have been the intention of . Congress to pay these bonds in paper money , but , on the contrary , the mode of payment of the bonds was expressly provided . Coin only could be received for duties or imported goods , and this coin was specially set aside for the paynient of the interest on these bonds , and to establish a sinking fund of one per cent . per annum of the entire debt . If we look then at the act of Congress under which the bonds were issued , is it not evident that their payment in coin was contemplated and provided for . It is true that the act declares that the notes , to be issued under it , should be legal tenders for all debts due from the United States , but it is clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general phrase " debt , " for a special Provision was made for the payment of the bonds in coin by a sinking fund . The legal tender issue was intended and expected to be temporary only , while the bond issue might not be paid for twenty years , when the country would have the ability to pay in coin . It is sometimes argued as if this act of Congress ignored the distinction between gold and government paper money . The reverse of this has been shown to be the case . The first part of the act provides for the issue of paper which might answer a temporary purpose , the latter part directs the issue of bonds the payment of which in gold was provided for . The distinction betwee&amp; gold and government paper is not confined to this act ; it has been repeatedly recognized by Congress . That body indeed has nevel ' yet enacted the folly of declaring an irredeemable promise of the government equal to gold and silver . At differenL times Congress ha* passed laws at variance with the idea that coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have by different enactments declared : 1 . " United States notes shall 1e received the same as coin , at their par value . " They are not its equivalent . 2 . The Secretary of the Treasury may " purchase coin at such rates and upon such terms as he mayjudge most advantageous . " The value of legal tenders is variable . 3 . The Secretary may exchange the second issue of legal tenders for bonds on such terms as he may deem for the public interest . // 4 . The expressions " lawful money , " " par value , " " face value " are repeated in other laws . The intrinsic value of coin is thus implied . 5 . On the 17th June , 1864 , it was declared unlawful to make any loan of money not in coin to be repaid in coin ; or to make any loan in coin to be repaid by currency other than coin . We may add to the considerations already presented , the repeated declarations of the Secretaries of the Treasury , the statements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the positive assurances of the government agents through whom the bonds were negotiated , and the entire absence of any claim at the time these bonds were negotiated that they could be paid in anything else than coin . All these form part of the res gesta3 and enter into the consideration of the proper construction of the obligation of the United States . In fourteen years the first issue of these bonds must be paid . Does any one suppose that without gross mismanagement the present paper issues of the Government will continue to take the place of gold and silver for so long a time ? Why then is this question of the medium of payment fourteen years hence raised at the present time ? It can be for no honest purpose ; it is the charlatanry of demagogues , the trick of politicians ,  - -  let it be frowned upon and rebuked with the indignation of all reflecting and candid men . Has the United States the ability to pay this debt ? That the interest can be paid has been shown by the experience of several years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than sufficient ias been received by the United States to meet the accruing interest , and it is clearly shown by Commissioner Wells , in his able report on the subject , that these laws may be so amended as to relieve industry , and still yield sufficient revenue for all purposes . It is manifest by his showing that , without oppressing the business of the country , a sinking fund also can be established , which will slowly but surely liquidate the debt . We will not reproduce his statements and arguments . But considering the present ability of the country to pay the interest established , we shall adduce a few facts which show the great // increase in material wealth in the Northern States , tending to prove that the ability to pay this debt is rapidly indreasing , and must be sufficient . No census of the wealth of the nation has been taken since 1860 , so that we can not compare the statistics of production of that year with later years . Such miscellaneous statistics as have been hastily gathered from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are not able always to compare the same years , but the evidence is sufficiently strong . THE PRODUCTION OF GRAIN . In 1860 there were forwarded from Chicago , 31,108 , ' 759 bushels of grain . 1863 " " " 54/741,639 1860 " " Milwaukee , 16,710,580 1863 " " 16,992,335 " 1860 " " Green Bay , 350,032 1863 " " 1,288,790 1860 " " Toledo , 14,850,861 1863 " " 21,567,963 1860 " " Buffalo , 37,089,461 " 1863 " " " 64,735,510 The same general fact is true of Cleveland , Cincinnati , St. Louis , and other centres of the grain trade . The increase in the production of beef , pork , petroleum , coal , and ore , is even in greater ratio than that of grain . The product of the Lake Superior min*es has increased more than tenfold since 1860 . The number of tons of freight transported on the leading railways of the country affords an indication of the increased production of the country . We annex some statistics of this class . In 1860 on the Erie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1865 " " " " 2,234,349 " 1860 on the New York Canals , " 4,650,214 1866 " " " 5,775,220 1860 on the NewYork CentralR .

" 1,559,061 1866 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the port of New York in 1862 , was $149,179,591 ; in ' 1867 , it was $178,210,409 . These values represent the surplus products which were sold to foreign countries . The aggregate of the domestic exports from all the Northern ports is larger than the domestic exports of the whole country , including cotton , before the rebellion . It is not unreasonable to believe , that with the Southern States restored to a condition of prosperity , and yielding their fair proportion to the wealth of the nation , our ability to pay will be so much increased , that the debt may be liquidated without oppressive taxation . Another question remains to be briefly considered . In what way can specie payments be restored ? The United States is in the situation of a man who has engaged in an enterprise which , he believes , will in the end be profitable , but which requires a long time for this result . The payment of his debt is pressing upon him now , and he has not the present ability to pay . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial return , and is not saleable . He has only one course to pursue , namely , to obtain the consent of his creditors to postpone the payment of his indebtedness to such a time as he may expect to earn money to pay it ; and then by the practice of rigid economy , and by strenuous efforts to render his property productive , he will in time succeed in ' acquiring tile means of ' extinguishing his indebtedness . The United States engaged in the great enterprise of subduing the rebellion , an enterprise of great prospective profit , but the profit can be fully secured only in future years , through the increased peace and happiness and prosperity of the whole country . // The first step to be taken is to relieve the pressure of the indebtedness which is presently payable , but which there are not sufficient present means to pay . This indebtedness consists of the " seven-thirty " notes , the compound interest notes , the three per cent . certificates , the demand notes , amounting in the aggregate to about $700,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount can not be at once paid . This debt did not originate in any transaction by which the United States received any immediate available means with which to make payment . It represents rather what it has lost than what it has gained , as in the case of a merchant who has given his notes for goods which have been destroyed by fire . It must then be funded in bonds having a period of years before payment can be demanded . Then by economy in all departments of the government , and by a judicious development of the resources of the country , the nation may in a few years be in a position to pay all its indebtedness . To exchange an indebtedness which is not yet payable , into that which requires immediate payment , without the means to pay it , is suicidal . The circulating medium of the country is already too large , and the issue of $2,000,000,000 more of government notes to enter into the currency of the nation would be disastrous in the extreme . If the government can not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that relief must be obtained by funding the pressing indebtedness of the government , we are not unmindful of the fact , that a large part of this debt enters into the circulating medium of the country , which ought not to be unreasonably disturbed . The considerations which have been adduced in a previous part of this Article , to show the increased traffic of the country , seem also to indicate that a larger amount of ciirculating medium is now needed than was required by the traffic of the year 1860 . It cannotbe possible , however , that the business of the country requires three times as much as it did then . Grant that high prices require larger capital and larger profits on the investment of capital , and that the business of the country has increased fifty or even one hundred per cent. , the amount of paper now in use is much too large . As an evidence of this look at the price of unskilled // labor , perhaps as good a standard as any of the *onlition of an irredeemable circulating medium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common laboring man , it is the resultant of the price of the necessaries of life . Look at the enormous combinations for speculation in everything that can be bought and sold , the ease with which money is borrowed to monopolize the markets even in the necessaries of life , and no doubt can remain that there , is vastly more paper money in the United States , than is needed in a healthful state of things . Let the floating debt be funded and let the government begin to prepare for the payment of what it owes , by strict economy and by so adjusting the imports and taxes as to relieve those branches of industry which are now overburdened with taxation , and increase the productiveness of the country by encouraging the various branches of industry . In this way only can the amount of the debt be earned , and it must be earned , if it is to be paid . That this young and vigorous nation can and will , in a comparatively few years , with its rapidly increasing population and productive ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be doubted by any one who examines the facts .
