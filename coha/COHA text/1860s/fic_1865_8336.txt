Child , Lydia Maria Francis , 1802-1880 : OLD FOLKS AT HOME . from Poems , in Looking toward sunset ( 1865 ) More pleasant seem their own surroundings , Though quaint and old , Than newer homes , with their aboundings Of marble , silk , and gold . For ' t is the heart inspires home-feelings , In hut or hall , Where memory , with its fond revealings , Sheds a tender light o'er all . They love the wonted call to meeting , By their old bell ; They love the old familiar greeting From friends who know them well . Their homesick hearts are always yearning , When they 're away ; And ever is their memory turning To scenes where they used to stay . L. M. C. Child , Lydia Maria Francis , 1802-1880 : OLD FOLKS AT HOME . from Poems , in Looking toward sunset ( 1865 ) They love the places where they wandered When they were young ; They love the books they 've often pondered , They love the tunes they 've sung . The easy-chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ample slippers , warm and cozy , And the dear old bed at night . CHORUS . Near their hearth-stones , warm and cheery , Where , by night or day , They 're free to rest when they are weary , There the old folks love to stay . L. M.
