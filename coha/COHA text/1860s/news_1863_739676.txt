txt The hearts of the French people are ready to burst withlmotion at the events in Poland . The glorious speeches of M. BOTLIEAN , the Prince PONIATOW . SKI , the Count WALEWSKA and the P rinceNapourox in the French Senate , yesterday and the day before , added more fuel to the flame , and , to-dav , the whole cost in men and money of the unpopular and " unfortunate " Mexican exped , ition is to be kept a secret from the public . The only French journal which has published the report of the Committee of the American Senate on foreign mediation , is the France , one of the journals which is most hostile to the Union ; There was no order on the subject , and this abstention is due to the general belief that the Emperor feels that he has made a mistake in America , and would be wounded at seeing too much prominence given to the affair . Both His Majesty 's attempts at an intervention were , as I told you at the time , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation of the Democratic party of the North . Now , however , that the patriotic men of this party are rejecting the proffered mediation , all parties in this country seem anxious to let the matter drop with as little noise as possible . This does not prevent the hostile Press , however , from continuing their misrepresentations on the progress of events in the United States ; but the few lines they publish are generally on the supposed peace tendencies in the North , and are evidently designed to keep before the French people the idea that the war is soon to cease . Many new pamphlets are out as well on Mexico as on Poland , and M. LABOVLATI , Professor at the College of France . a gentleman whose Monday lectures at the College are attended by a large , number of American gentlemen and ladies , and whose ardent defence of the course of the Union will be gratefully remembered by our countrymen , has just published a book of six hundred pages on the United States , entitled Paris in America , over the fictitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sarcastic , witty , and philosophic criticism on French political and social lite as compared to that of the United States , and deals such hard blows at certain highidignitaries in France , that one is astonished at not seeing the book seized by the police . I send you a copy of this important and most entertaining book , and hope to see it republished in English , for it is eminently worthy of translation , MALAKOFF. nation is ready to march to the rescue of the struggling " France of the North . " The four orators mentioned above recapitulated the crimes of Russia , and the sufferings and heroism of Poland in an eloquence of language which will ring through Europe like the awakening of a new era for the suffering nationalities . Each of these orators will approve the Government in demanding of Russia the independence of Poland , and of backing up the demand with a declaration of war in the event of a refusal , even if all Europe were to be set in flames by the event . The Viscount DE LACCERRONNIRRE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counseled moderation and a trust in diplomacy , while the Marquis los LeaocazJAQUELIN ( a clerical of the most reactionary type , ) undertook the ungrateful task of defending Russia and of maligning the revolution . But when he ventured to declare that the present movement in Poland was the work of MAllINI and the Socialists , and tnat the French Government had in its possession a proof of the fact , he was Anet by an indignant and energetic exclamation from Count WALEWSRA of " It is false ! " backed up by the Prince NAPOLEON , who cried out " Good , Good ! " with an addition very much like " Hit him again in the same place ! " The fact is the young Dictator , Lasoiswicz , has taken pains to eliminate from the movement every element which would imply that it had ? anything to do with a general European revolution , or that it was anything else than a local question between Poland and her Russian masters . Thus he refused the proffered aid of GARIBALDI , and he also gent back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who desired to take a command , but who , unfortunately , was known to sympathize with the advanced revolutionary party . Thus LANOIEWICZ conciliates both extremes , for , having been a revolutionist himself , while under the protection of GABILALDI , he can not , by these measures of exigency , be estranged from that party . M. BILLAULT , the Minister el the Government , declared that , notwithstanding the lively sympathies of the Government and people of France for Poland , they could not interfere to the extent of a war with Russia , and hoped the Senate would vote the " older of the day , " ? which it did by 109 to 17 . This vote leaves the Government free to act as it pleases , but with the understanding , however , that it is to obtain by negotiation with Russia an amelioration in the condition of Poland . During the course of the debate in the Senate , an instructive incident in regard to Mexico was produced . The Marquis De LA Rocmusonzust was declaiming against going to war for Poland ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy l into China , Cochin China and Syria , but she could ' not engage in this new enterprise . He continued thus : " We have been drawn innocently , and without suspecting it , into Mexico . We have sent there about 50,000 men and the . entire navy of France . *Objections . ) You say 34,000 men , and I am willing to accept that number . We have , therefore , 34,000 men in Mexico . " A Memese  --  That is already too many . MARQUIS DR LA ROCUILIAQUELIN  --  I do not find that we have sent there too many men . But with such an enterprise on our hands , there are too many men engaged to commence a new one of such gigantic proportions as this one will be . I say , therefore , ( and the Senate will comprehend my idea , ) that I approve entirely the sending of troops to Mexico . We were engaged , we were obliged not to abandon the enterprise ; in fine , we were engaged against our desire in an unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we must not engage ourselves at random elsewhere , because afterward we are no longer masters of the consequences . Principiis obsta . MARQUIS DR LA Rocnsammems  --  Exactly , and to speak like the honorable M. Duns Principiis obsta , sera medicine paratur . Laugh . It is for that that you hear me speak as I do . Do you desire that we should make wart Oh ! if we were forced to it . assuredly every man in France would fly to arms if the honor and the interest of the country were at stake ; but for a foreign people , however much sympathy we may have for them , we ought first to think of ourselves . I demand of our Admirals , could ' we engage in any sort of a European war without having our fleets at our disposition ? Have . we them at this moment ? ( General rumor . ) FIRST PRESIDENT DR Roosa  --  These are things that ought not to be said . Bases Haussamen  --  We can always have men , fleets and Money when the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RocasJsonsini  --  I ; say that in the situation where we now are , we can not be too prudent , and we ought . if for no other reason than our menaced finances , avoid every engagement foreign to &c.; These observations of Senators when off their gourd are both curious and instructive . The number of linen sent out to Mexico up to this time for all the services is , according to the Government people theau'elves , about 51,000.
