ARTICLE VI. - PRESIDENT JOHNSON 'S TOUR , AND HIS POLICY . TILE ostensible design of the recent journey of President Johnson was to pay honor to the memory of Stephen A. Douglas . Mr. Douglas has no title to reverential or grateful remembrance . Among all the public men who have figured prominently within the last few years , he was , perhaps , the most mischievous and dangerous . A sharp , logical intellect , an energetic will , a restless ambition , with an abundant stock of audacity , were his leading characteristics . His moral sentiments were feeble ; at any rate they exerted no perceptible influence upon his public conduct . The general cast of his mind , as well as the style of his manners , and the truculent tone which he adopted in his speeches , fitted him to represent the lower tendencies of American society , and to draw after him a large following . Nothing prevented him from reaching the o*oal of his ambition but the invincible jealousy and repug-b nance of the Southern leaders *hom be had done his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified with only one highly important public measure , and that was one of the most iniquitous measures for which our national Legislature has ever made itself responsible . He led in the movement for the repeal of the Missouri compromise . He pretended that he considered the provision for the exclusion of slavery , which was contained in that compromise , unconstitutional , although he had himself moved to extend the Missouri line to the Pacific . He also pretended , likewise against his own virtual declarations , as well as against all evidence , that the Missouri restriction was contrary to the spirit of the compromises of 1851 . After all , he had not the manliness to give a distinct , unambiguous character to his own boasted doctrine of " squatter sovereignty . " The people of a territory , he affirmed , have a right to legalize or exclude slavery ; but whether that right belongs to the people prior to their act of forming a State Government , whether , during the territorial condition , slavery is // protected or prevented by the Constitution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , when driven to a corner , he flatly refused to answer . They were judicial questions , he said , and must be determined by the Supreme Court . They were determined , as all our readers know , in the Dred Scot case . The truth is that Mr. Douglas dared not set himself against the Southerners by giving such an interpretation to his " great principle of self-government , " as would allow to freedom a fair chance . He lent himself to the conspiracy for making Kansas a slave State , and stood by President Pierce in all his shameful endeavors to secure the dominion of the invading " border ruffians " over the actual settlers of that territory . Only after a usurping and therefore illegal legislature had called a convention doubly illegitimate , and that convention had refused to submit to the people the constitution which it framed , but only the question whether other slaves besides those already in the territory might be introduced , did Mr. Douglas falter in his allegiance to the pro-slavery party . But in the meantime a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside at the Democratic convention held at Cincinnati in 1856 , and the more timid and supple Buchanan had been nominated for the Presidency . How far the subsequent course of Douglas was influenced by this fact , we do not undertake to determine . For his opposition to the Lecompton constitution , let him have whatever credit he deserves . It stands recorded in history that he was instrumental in overthrowing the ancient , righteous policy of excluding slavery from the territories of the Union , and in introducing a delusive theory of popular sovereignty , which he curtailed , at the behest of slavery , to the smallest proportions . The vehemence of his attacks upon all who resisted his flagitious movement for the repeal of the Missouri compromise must be fresh in the recollection of many . When three thousand ministers of New England , among whom were such names as Jeremiah Day and Lyman Beecher , sent in their protest against the Nebraska act , it will be remembered how coarsely and violently Mr. Douglas assailed them , seizing on the pretext afforded by the circumstance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after the bill had passed that body , although it had not yet gone through the // House , and therefore had not become a law . " They know not what they are talking about ; " " they ought to be rebuked , and required to confine themselves to their vocation ; " " they have followed the lead of a circular which was issued by the abolition confederates in this body , " - such are some of the elegant phrases in Mr. Douglas 's speech . When the secession movement began , Mr. Douglas , though smarting under the reiterated proofs of ingratitude which he had experienced at the hands of the South , was ready for a compromise . He had not the moral courage to come out for coercion , though at first he was inclined to do so . He sat and heard with apparent approbation the speech of his intimate political associate , Mr. Pugh , who to the extreme delight of Davis , Toombs , and the other conspirators , argued at great length against the right of the government forcibly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country at that eventful crisis had possessed no firmer and bolder friends than Mr. Douglas , ruin would have befallen us . As far as human foresight can judge , his reinoval from the earth at the time when it occurred , was a happy event for the country . It is impossible to say what that restless , aspiring , audacious politician might not have chosen to do , had he lived to witness the vicissitudes through which we were obliged to pass in the course of the war . lie had more power for evil than any other , while his character and previous history contained no guarantee that evil would not be his choice . We might pass over the career of Mr. Douglas in charitable silence , but when there is a call for peculiar tokens of respect for his memory , we are justified in expressing the opinion that an impartial judgment will pronounce him better entitled to reprobation than to honor . The higher qualities of a Christian statesman did not belong to him ; the essential qualities of a gentleman he wholly lacked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , one that does him no credit . But the President and Secretary of State had a different end in view . Their journey to Mr. Douglas 's tomb was like Mr. Douglas 's famous journey in quest of his mother . It was an electioneering tour , elaborately devised by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seward for the purpose of kindling popular enthusiasm in behalf of their new-fledged patty . // It is not the first example of a shrewd scheme for managing men , which disappoints its inventors . The dignitaries who planned this expedition may reflect for their consolation , that they are not the first victims of disappointed hope . Community in grief , Cicero assures us , is a great solace ; and the same truth is expressed in a more homely way in the axiom , " misery loves company . " If it is not considered disrespectfui to our rulers , we commend to them the familiar lines of Burns The best laid schemes o ' mice and men Gang aft a-gley ; An ' lea'e us naught but grief and pain , For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down the patriotic Republican party , and build up on its ruins a new party to be composed of the enemies of the country and its lukewarm friends  --  a party that would be sure to use all its power in undoing the great work of the last five years ,  --  deserved to come to shame . The arrangements for this tour were not less discreditable than the motive of it . General Grant and Admiral Farragut , the two foremost heroes of the war , were requested to accompany the President ; and such a request from a superior officer they did not feel at liberty to decline . They were to form the tail of the kite . The well-earned respect which they command was to be feloniously appropriated to aid the political scheme *f Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seward . The result showed that the American people are intelligent enough to make proper distinctions even among persons who travel in the same company . The deportment of General Grant and Admiral Farragut was such as to lend no help to the political plotters who had harnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the quiet observation of General Grant when he appeared upon the balcony where Mr. Johnson had been storming for half an hour on the frightfhl dangers impending over the country . " I have been taking a nap since this began , " was the remark of the taciturn General . This great organization of clap-trap for carrying captive the people , signally failed . But neither the real nor the pretended design of the tour , nor the arrangement respecting Grant and Farragut have inflicted // a tithe of the disgrace upon the leading civilians of the party , which their own demeanor has inflicted . As far as Mr. Johnson is concerned , his previous speeches had not inspired the public with very glowing anticipations . But it is generally agreed that , during his tour , in his intemperate abuse of " the Radicals , " in violent *ttacks upon the Legislative branch of the government , and in tedious self-laudation , he has fairly outdone himself . Yet the wrathful harangues of Mr. Johnson are scarcely more mortifying than Mr. Seward 's poor attempts at facetiousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earnestness . But it would be no compliment to Mr. Seward to charge him with sincerity in his praise of Mr. Johnson , whom he styles , we observe , " the second Cato . " Mr. Seward is lamentably deficient in what a recent writer styles " the enthusiasm of humanity . " He has done great service in advocating human rights , yet has never succeeded in drawing to himself any feeling of warm veneration . The heroic qualities of human character nature has denied him . He has never been able to forget himself in a whole-souled devotion to a noble cause . He stands intellectually upon the border ground that separates the statesman and the mere politician , so that one is ever at a loss in which category to rank him . From the time that he was set aside at Chicago by the first convention that nominated Mr. Lincoln , his course has excited constant distrust among his former friends and supporters . Through the whole war we have never felt sure of him . Men not prone to suspicion have feared that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigue . It is unfbrtunate for a man of so much talent to instinctively prefer a crooked path to a straight one . As he grows old , he over-estimates his powers of management , lie puts an increasingly low estimate upon moral forces . The interest of the hour sways his conduct . He makes an idol of expediency . Yet for many years Mr. Seward fought a good fight . For his own fame , not less than for the common good , it is to be lamented that he did not finish his course in the same line of honorable service . Seeing this man , once the recognized leader of the party of freedom , and unusually observant of the proprieties of public station , striving now to pull down the edifice which he has helped to // build , and acting the part of a jester in the late excursion of the President , we involuntarily revert to the familiar lines of Johnson , in the " Vanity of Human Wishes : " " From Marlborough 's eyes the streams of dotage flow , And Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defection of leaders of the Republican party has served to bring out in bold relief the intelligence arid firmness of the party itself . The country has been instructed hy the tremendous struggle through which it has passed . The people are determined not to be cheated out of the fruits of the war , now that so great a price has been paid for them . However intrenched an individual may be in their regard , his influence is gone the moment that he falters on this vital point . Even Mr. Beecher , a sincere , noble , and courageous man , when he is betrayed by his over trustful temperament and constitutional good-nature , into the advocacy of a hasty , unsafe reconstruction , finds himself without a following . This clear perception of the character of the crisis on the part of the body of the people augurs well for the future . But we have no wish to dwell on the personal characteristics of President Johnson and his leading advisers . There are two great topics which demand notice , the character of the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he would seem disposed to force it upon the country . All know time difficulty which has been experienced in setling the exact theory on which the war should be prosecuted . The Seceders and their Northern allies maintained that there is no power of coercion , and hence no power of self-preservation , in the Federal Government . If a State chose to withdraw from the Union , even if it were held that such an act of secession is without law , it was claimed that there is no remedy in the hands of the National government . The country might fall to pieces , but no one was authorized to lift an arm to save it . This was virtually the ground taken by Mr. Buchanan in his last annual message . . Tlme views of Mr. Johnson and his abettors relative to the position of the rebel communities at // the close of the war , are of a piece with that suicidal theory which the loyal people of the country indignantly rejected . When the arms of the rebels have been wrested from their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting itself by excluding them from political power , but is bound to permit these same rebel communities , instantly , and without conditions , to resume their place in the general government. , , There are legal difficulties , we are assured , in the way of any other course . Either their independence must be allowed or their privileges at once restored . The anti-coercion theory , and the theory of Mr. Johnson agree in leaving the country without a shield against its enemies . In opposition to Mr. Johnson 's theory , we affirm that the inhabitants dwelling south of a line which was defined in the declaration of Congress fixing the boundaries of the war , were by their own act of insurrection , the belligerent enemies of the United States , who were still liable indeed to punishment by municipal law , but also subject , if overcome , to all the penalties imposed by the just laws of war upon conquered enemies . We affirm that de facto , though not de jure , they carried their States out of the Union , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , at the close of the war , the inhabitants of the belligerent territory found themselves , to use the language of Mr. Johnson himself , " deprived of all civil government . " Their States had ceased to exist in an organized form . They had destroyed the governments which had connected them with the Federal Union , and the governments which they had set up had been destroyed by the Federal authority . There lay the territory within the limits and under the power of the Union . There were the inhabitants , subjugated by the military force of the Union , and exposed to the penalty of treason as well as to the consequences laid down in the rules of civilized warfare . It is true that there were loyal individuals in each of the seceding States who never voluntarily submitted to the rebellion ; but in each of those States they were comparatively a handful . Such persons are of course exempt from personal responsibility for action in which they took no part , and deserve all the rewards of faithfulness which the National Government can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Policy . Oct. , But they must share in the consequences of the act of the political community of which they are a part , so far as these consequences affect its position as a political body . The acts of secession , we repeat , must be looked upon as done by the rebel States , not righteously , not legally , but actually . It is just as idle to attempt to regard their action as void of all effect upon their political status , as it would be to consider a Louse as actually standing because the fire that consumed it was the lawless work of an incendiary . The inhabitants of the revolted States were left by the war without State governments . This is conceded by Mr. Johnson himself . Now , is the National Government bound to reinstate those States , and restore them to their former privileges in the family ? If so , by what obligation ? We deny the existence of such an obligation . We do not at this moment inquire what is the best course to be taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case . Over the people who constituted these political communities , who went out of the Union de , facto , made war upon it in their organized character , the iNational Government has the right of the conqueror . What if Mexico , seizing upon a favorable moment , should make a causeless and cruel war upon the United States , and should be defeated by a prodigious exertion of force on our part-all know that we should have the right to dispose of the hostile people , and of their territory , in such a way as to secure ourselves for the future . It might , for example , be found requisite to appropriate their territory . Whence could our government derive this right ? Not from any specific clause of the Constitution ; but it is a right inherent in every government ,  --   --  the right to redress a wrong , and deprive the aggressor of the means of doing evil . This is an established doctrine of international law . But this doctrine is equally applicable in the case of a gigantic insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a civil war does not tie the hands of the victor , and rob him of the right of self-protection at the moment when force has given him the supremacy , and he has succeeded in disarming his adversary . International law is a science of justice and common sense . " Dum ratio manet , lex manet . " It is a dictate of reason that the same rule should apply to a // civil contest , which , as in the case of the late struggle , assumes the character of a territorial war . As far as the right is concerned , we are authorized to dispose of the rebel confederation , including their territory and the rebel inhabitants , as we may judge necessary for the future security of the country . We may forbid the resuscitation of the States which were tie facto carried out of the Union ; we may permit the rehabilitation of some , and deny this privilege in the case of others ; we may divide or combine them anew , changing their boundaries ; we may do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of the country require . This right belongs to the government , because it is a government ; and there is no more need of an explicit clause in the Constitution to warrant its exercise , than there would be , in the case before supposed , for the reduction of Mexico to provinces , or the occupation of its territory under some other system of administration . It is absurd , and a gross affront to common sense , to assert that those political communities must either be actually making war upon the nation , or else taking an equal part in its government . It will be said that our view of the matter is inconsistent with a resolution of Congress , which declared that the war was not waged for purposes of conquest or subjugation . The war , it will be said , was actually carried forward on a different theory . We reply that the resolution of Congress may be taken as a declaration of policy , and not as a limitation of right . As a declaration of policy even , its force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal of the rebels to avail themselves of the hope which it held out to them , in case they should voluntarily return to their allegiance . They chose to fight it out to the last ; and yielding only to force , they have no right to make their appeal to such a declaration . It involves no pledge to them , nothing of the nature of a contract which the nation is bound to fulfill . The rebels gave up not until resistance was no longer possible ; and hence they are debarred , and their attorneys for them , from insisting upon that interpretation of the war which happens to be advantageous to them in their present situation . Had they found in that interpretation an indu3ement to abandon their criminal enterprise , then they might , perhaps , have founded on it some claim . In truth , // however , no uniform interpretation of the character of the war has prevailed . It was made by the act of Congress a territorial war . The Supreme Court applied to it the rules which govern an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as it deems best with reference to its subdued enemies , and that we are not restricted by any past professions to which they have a right to appeal . While we hold that the powers of the Government in the settlement of this contest are thus extensive , we agree that sound policy dictates the resuscitation and restoration of the rebel States . We only claim that this is a measure not of legal obligation , but of clemency . It is agreed , then , on all hands that the Southern States are still to exist , and that their governments are to be reconstructed . And here we lay down the proposition that the National Government is empowered to prescribe the method of this reorganization , and on what conditions it shall be considered complete and valid . Take the case of South Carolina . There is a community , within the limits of the United States , but having no other government . The State Government has been destroyed by the act of the inhabitants in connection with their rebellion against the national authority . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not only conquered belligerents , but are liable to be tried , convicted , and punished for treason and other crimes . Moreover , more than half of the entire population have passed from a condition of servitude to freedom , and to the enjoyment of equal civil rights . Is it not plain that the terms and conditions on which the nation will recognize an organization calling itself a State government in this community , must be determined by the nation itself ? What classes of inhabitants shall take part in the formation of that new government to hold the place of the government extinguished by the rebellion ? What security shall be given that this new organization will not become another instrument for inflicting measureless wrongs and evils upon our common country ? What guarantees shall be afforded against a repetition of secession and rebellion , or against less open attacks upon the nation , such as attacks upon its financial credit ? It // surely belongs to the victorious party , to the loyal States , to the national authorities , to determine these questions . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the disloyal communities are vanquished enemies and subdued rebels , and that those States are no longer in " practical relations with the Union . " The opposite doctrine is a political absurdity . It is the doctrine that a State may at any time go out of the Union ( de facto ) for hostile purposes , and , having done all the mischief in its power , may come back again at any moment , and on its own terms . In going out of the Union it violates , as a civil community , a sacred compact , and is liable to all the consequences of so perfidious an act . This proposition implies no sanction of the right of secession ; it asserts the opposite ; but it does admit the power of secession . And who can deny that for four years the Southern States were actually out of the Union by the act of their own will ? We are saved from the necessity of arguing for the right of the National Government to impose conditions upon the rebel communities , by Mr. Johnsou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he caused to be assemb*ed in the Southern States , that they should disown the rebel debt , and give their assent to the anti-slavery amendment of the Constitution . He himself imposed conditions upon them . He required of them such stipulations as he thought it b*st to require . In doing this he fully admitted the right for which we now contend . In a case like the present , political guarantees in the shape of Constitutional Amendments , which are practically irrevocable , are of the highest consequence . We have always sup . posed that the mass of the population which was engaged in the rebellion must ultimately regain political power . It would neither be wise nor feasible to exclude them permanently from this privilege , constituting , as they do , nearly the whole population in the disloyal States . But just for the reason that we regard this liberal policy as destined to prevail , and as , on the whole , wise , do we insist on the necessity of extorting sufficient guarantees which shall stand in the Constitution as a perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imperative need that the legitimate results of the war // should be thus secured , and the future safety of the country be guarded . Stipulations of the nature described , when incorporated in the thndamental law , are invaluable . They may , perhaps , be disregarded for a season , since it is impossible to find an infallible safeguard against human passion ; but they are likely to prove effectual for their end . Once established , they will not be allowed to become a dead letter . We are aware that a logical difficulty is raised in relatioii to the validity of the assent , which is given by the conventions in the rebel States , to the amendments of the Constitution . It is urged that if they have not their privileges as members of the Union , they are incompetent to give this ratification , while , if they have their privileges , it can not be extorted . We attach little force to this objection . For , in the first place , a ratification of these amendments on their part is equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these additions , and is part and parcel of their act of restoration to the Union . In the second place , we believe that a ratification of such amendments by three fourths of the loyal States is sufficient to give them validity . The disloyal States would have no more ground of complaint than they have against the passage of the same amendments by two-thirds of a Congress in which they are not represented . in both cases they are disabled from acting by their own act and fault . If they choose to sunder their practical relations to the Union , the operations of the Government are not to be thereby blocked . The United States are still competent to carry on their government , and , if they see fit , to amend their Constitution . If , during the existence of the war , the loyal people of the country had felt it desirable to alter the Constitution in some particulars , would they have been precluded from doing so by the inability of the rebel States to act in the matter ? We trow not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is such a ratification on the part of the communities not yet restored to their privileges as States ? We reply ,  --  " much , every way . " Not all adopt the view which we have just set forth , as to the competency of the loyal States themselves to amend the Constitution . Moreover , such a ratification by the rebel States is equivalent to a solemn stipulation . It debars them from ever calling in question the // validity of such amendments . They come back into the Union with a pledge of acquiescence in these changes . They consent to them , even if their consent is not strictly requisite to give them validity . The National Government is master of the situation . It has the power and the right to prescribe to the rebel communities the conditions of readmission to the privileges of States in the American Union . The next question is , to which branch of the Government does the exercise of this power and right peculiarly belong ? It pertains , we answer , to the Legislative Department . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " all Legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives . " The Executive can recommend measures to the " consideration " of Congress ; he possesses a qualified veto with respect to the enactments of that body ; and in case of a disagreement between the two Houses as to the time of their adjournment , he is authorized " to adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper . ' This is the limit of his influence on the legislation of the country . Moreover , he is liable to impeachment for treason , bribery , and other high crimes and misdemeanors . For all such offenses he can be arraigned by the House of Representatives before the Senate , and this body , the Chief Justice presiding , is competent , by a vote of two.thirds of the members present , to depose him from his office , to disqualify him from ever again holding any office under the United States , and to hand him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , and punishment , according to law . " Such are the bounds which the Constitution has set to the powers of the Executive ; so stringently has it guarded against usurpation , on his part , of the functions which are lodged elsewhere . When the civil war has been brought to a close by the overthrow of the enemy , the terms of settlement fall within the proper scope of legislative action . A strong analogy to the work of reconstruction is presented in the process of converting territories into States . In either case a State government is to be formed where none exists . In the instance of a territory aspiring to // the privileges of a State , the usual and regular course of procedure is for Congress to pass an " enabling act , " authorizing given classes of inhabitants , which are designated in the act , to choose a convention , and form a Constitution . After this instrument has been framed , it is submitted to Congress for their approval , and if it is found to be satisfactory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We bring forward this example for the purpose of showing that the business of admitting , or read mitting States , pertains especially to the Legislative Branch . If we turn to the precise question before us , it will be evident thut the Executive has no powers , under the Constitution , in the matter of reconstruction , except war powers . He m*y establish a military government over a revolted district ; he may appoint provisional governors who are clothed with military authority . But when hostilities are at an end , and the time has come for supplanting military by civil rule , his control in the revolted States expires . He has no authority qualifying him to declare who shall , and who shall not , take part in the formation of new State Governments . Neither is he empowered to dictate what sort of a constitution shall be formed , or what further action the convention , when once assembled , shall take . We do not object to his offering suggestions and recommendations . He may invite the people in such a community to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may advise them as to the steps which he deems best for them to take . But the govern ment which they may form under his auspices is experimental in its character ; it can not demand a recognition from Congress . Nothing that is done in the business is of any force until Congress shall have given it force by an express act of recognition . From this statement , the nature and extent of the President 's usurpation of authority are evident . He has insisted that the organizations which have been created by his agency in the Southern States , shall be deemed , to all intents and purposes , State governments ; and he has required that Congress shall limit itself to the examination of the personal qualifications of the individuals who derive their credentials , as IRepresentatives or Senators , from these organizations . This work // must be done , he consistently demands , by each House for itself . He has thus aimed to take the whole work of reconstruction and restoration out of the hands of Congress , where it rightfully belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the readmission of the seceded State , and the recognition of the new government in it , were the work first in order ; and that this work belonged to Congress as a whole , and not to either house acting separately . The appointment of the Joint Committee of fifteen was the legitimate consequence of this position . Thus President Johnson stands before the country in the character of an unsuccessful usurper of powers that do not be . long to him . In the prosecution of his indefensible policy , he has gone so far as to question , in the most insulting and offensive terms , the right of the present Congress to legislate upon any subject , alleging as a reason the continued exclusion of representatives from the rebel communities . He has dared to characterize Congress as a body pretending or assuming to be a congress , as hanging on the verge ot the government , as a Congress not of the United States , but only of a part of the States . His violent invectives against Congress have indeed come down upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be passed over lightly . Should he continue these revolutionary and outrageous assaults upon the Legislative Branch of the Government , we trust that he will be brought before the bar of the Senate to answer for his misdemeanors . He richly deserves to be impeached ; and we firmly believe that , if he perseveres in his course , the people who have carried this great war to a glorious termination , will have the energy and courage to bring him to a condign punishment . It is to be hoped that he will take warning in time , and save the country from the necessity of deposing a Chief Magistrate . Ever since this long struggle began , a mischievous influence has been conceded to legal quibbles . The first movers of secession proposed to destroy a great Government , and break a powerful nation in pieces-all according to law . South Carolina pretended to reclaim the Federal territory within her limits and on her border , by the right of eminent domain . // The United States were to be robbed of their forts , arsenals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Mr. Buchanan and his Cabinet a long time to discover that the United States held such property as a sovereign , by right of dominion , and not as a private proprietor . Then each Southern State was to be made independent by a brief but most lawful process , simply by the vote of a convention revoking the original acceptance of the National Constitution . We happen to know that Jefferson Davis intended to get possession of the city of Washington , in like manner , by due process of law . It was a settled principle , he said , that a gift which is no longer available to the uses designated by the donor , reverts to him . Now Maryland was to secede ; and Maryland and Virginia being out of the Union , Washington could no longer be used for a capital of the United States . It must revert to the States which originally granted it . By them it could be given to the new Confederacy . We doubt not that the knavish lawyers who managed the Southern Confederacy could have found some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrisons , and the starvati ) n of prisoners . The good cause has also suffered from the operation of a perverse casuistry . There was an absurd fear , at the outset , in regard to the exchange of prisoners , as if the conceding of certain belligerent privileges involved the resigning , in case of our success , the right to deal with our enemies as traitors to be punished by municipal law . There has been an unwillingness to look upon the rebellion as anything but the act of individuals ; as if the acknowledgment of the plain fact that the war was waged by the Southern States in their corporate capacity , carried with it some admission of the legal validity of secession . Now there is a ready casuistry by which the President and his political friends would tie the hands of the victor , and give free room to the spirit of rebellion , which threatens to transfer itself from the field of battle to the halls of legislation . It is high time to treat this momentous subject on the broad principles of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public law . There are two modes of feeling in respect to our late war , and much depends on which of them is adopted . Some are disposed to ignore , as far as possible , the whole contest . All dis // cussion of the merits of it , they think , should be given up . If the rebellion involved crime in its supporters , that crime is to be buried in oblivion . We are not to assume that we were in the right , and the insurgents in the wrong . If the gallantry of our soldiers is to be praised , care must be taken to give equal credit to the armies of the rebellion . No open allusion to the great conflict must be made , except as " a state of unpleasantness " which we have all to deplore and remember no longer . Now we argree that , as far as practicable , bard words should be spared . But there are some difficulties in the line of policy just described . The prime difficulty is that such a course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most iniquitous movement , or it was righteous . The subduing of it was either a sin or a glorious achievement , ever to be remembered with joy and with gratitude to Heaven . Justice to the martyrs in this terrible war forbids us to pass over in silence their heroic services . They are to be honored and praised , and wherever they lie , monuments should be raised to them . It is a wrong done to their memory when the cause for which they gave their lives is spoken of with bated breath , lest somebody should be offended , and when their deeds must be hushed up . Let there be no ignoble boasting over a prostrate enemy . Let there be forbearance and kindness . But let us not act as if we were ashamed of our conduct . Let us not act as if we were not the victors , but the vanquished . And when , in Congress or elsewhere , a voice is raised in defense of this rebellion , or in accusation of those who put it down , let there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general subject of the war , we shall not be likely to cast away the proper fruits of it by a pusillanimous yielding to new menaces , or by a blind , unwarranted trust . We shall firmly insist that the freedmen shall have their rights , that all who have been faithful to the Union shall be well treated , and that such political guarantees shall be given by the South as will secure the country , so far as solemn stipulations can secure it , against the recurrence of the direful evils from which we have just escaped . When that sagacious Englishman , Mr. Cobden , traveled in this country several years ago , he remarked that the Republican party was deficient in pluck . He meant what // may be called political pluck . The multitude of intelligent persons who compose this party do not lack personal courage . This has been sufficiently proved in the war . But the party has seemed to hesitate about using the power it has once gained . It has allowed too much weight to the loud , threatening talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very moment when it has least need to falter . Having carried the country in an election , a great party should fearlessly give effect to its principles , by embodying them in legislation . The so-called Democratic party has never failed to act on this maxim . The Republicans will do well to imitate their example in this particular . Let the men who talk about a " rump Congress " be given to understand that their talk has no further significance than to disclose their own factious , unprincipled character ; but *hat on the instant when they venture to lift a finger in resistance to the enactments of this " rump Congress , " they will be ground to powder . There can be no question that the preponderance of power in this country-of intellectual power , of moral power , and of numbers too ,  --  is on the side of the great principles and tendencies of which the Republican party is the champion .
