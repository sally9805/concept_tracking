txt ART . XI . - The White Hills ; their Legends , Landscape , and Poetry . By THOMAS STARR KING . With Sixty Illustrations by ANDREW , from Drawings by WHEELOcK . Boston : Crosby , Nichols , &amp; Co. 1860 . Small 4to. pp. 403 . MOUNTAIN scenery , beyond all other forms and aspects of nature , generates strong local attachment . The most intense love of country has always been found in dwellers among the hills . No homes have been fought for with such earnest , self-sacrificing patriotism , as wild and even barren , rocky fastnesses . Mountaineers can be destroyed in their homes more easily than they can be driven from their homes ; and none feel the hardship of exile and expatriation so keenly as they . // Summer tourists are bound by the same law of attraction . On other routes of travel they seek the zest of novelty , and are perpetually exploring regions previously unvisited ; but the mountain journey or sojourn invites their return for season after season , and the same steps are retraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fascination , and a joy that never reach their climax . This is due in part , we doubt not , to merely physical experiences . The pure , thin , bracing air of elevated regions is inhaled with a conscious luxury , which seldom accompanies the process of breathing on the plain or by the sea-shore . The sum of vitality is doubled , and the life of two days seems condensed into one . The undulating paths , the alternate ascent and descent , bring in turn all the muscles employed in locomotion into exercise , and give them in turn relief and relaxation , so that not only does the enthusiastic pedestrian find his capacity enhanced , but , as we have learned by repeated trial , the horse , in whose case the journey is a mere affair of muscle , can measure day by day a greater distance , and for a greater number of successive days , in a hilly country than on level ground . But the transcendent charm of mountain scenery is its unceasing novelty . On no two days , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sunlight , cloud , and vapor are presented in combinations that change as often , and are as incapable of repeating themselves , as the groups of glittering objects in a kaleidoscope . The caps , wreaths , and fillets of azure mists , the shadows of moving clouds , the prismatic hues that clothe barren crags with a transfiguring glory at sunset , the passage of dense columns of vapor among the hills and over the valleys , are at every moment as fresh a joy to the beholder as if the like had never been seen before . The midsummer day is too short , the brief midsummer night too long , for a feast of beauty and grandeur served by elemental spirits that know how to greet their guest with a new surprise at every moment . It is no wonder , then , that Mr. King , having once become conversant with the White Hills , should have resorted thither for a series of years , and made himself familiar with the entire hill-country through a circumference of many miles . There // is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravine that he has not descended , not a practicable mountain-path that he has not trodden ; and he has moved everywhere with a keenly-observant eye , with a spirit sensitive to every ray of beauty , with a joyous love of nature , and an unsurpassed power of phototyping upon th mental retina the impressions made upon the visual organ . The results of these rich and fruitful years are before us in the book under review . This work lacks no claim upon the general interest which such a work could proffer . In the lowest , yet to a novice the essential capacity of a guide-book , it is full and perfect , delineating in detail every route , with its periods , stations , and facilities . As a topographical manual , it leaves nothing to be desired , describing the whole face of the country , and entering into the minutest features of every striking view and every salient object . Its literary finish is exquisite . It is a poet 's survey , and we never miss in a single page the poetic afflatus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom " the signs and wonders of the element " utter praise . With his own magnificent prose-poem , Mr. King has tastefully interwreathed all the choice literature and poetry of the White Hills ; and at the same time has put into fitting shape , not only the local history , but the rich legendary lore - much of it before unwritten - which has been handed down from the rude pioneers and among the hardy settlers in a region so prolific of wild and perilous adventure , and so well fitted to nourish weird and strange beliefs and imaginings . The author has been admirably seconded by the artists whose aid he has employed . The subjects of the drawings are selected with the most judicious care , and are sketched and engraved with consummate skill ; while a clearly-drawn map of the whole surrounding country aids the reader in assigning its geographical site to every object and scene portrayed . Our description of the book would be defective , and our recognition of its varied merits inadequate , without emphatic mention of two chapters for which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuckerman of Amherst College . One of these is a narrative of the discovery and successive explorations of the White Hills ; the other a sketch - scientific in its thoroughness , // popular in its style - of the vegetation of the mountains and of their elevated base . The White Hills are accessible , on the ordinary routes of travel , from four different directions , and by the valleys of as many different rivers . The quickest access , and that which now attracts the greatest number of tourists , is by the valley of the Androscoggiu and by the Grand Trunk Railway . From the Alpine House , at the Gorham station , a stage-road of seven or eight miles leads to " The Glen , " from which it is generally believed the ascent of Mount Washington is effected with the least difficulty , and at which the partially constructed carriageroad to the summit commences . Between the Alpine House and the Glen House are obtained the only unobstructed views of the four highest mountains , with their intervening spaces and no other portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime . An hour 's ride from the Alpine House brings the traveller to the Falls of the Androscoggin at Berlin , " where the river pours its whole tide through a narrow rocky gateway , descends a hundred feet in the course of a few hundred yards , and then shoots its rapids directly towards the swelling bulk of Mounts Madison and Adams , that tower but a few miles distant , and form the northeastern wall of the Mount Washington chain . " The route of the Saco valley is to be preferred for the lengthened enjoyment of slow and gradual approach to the heart of the mountains . He who enters through this gate , for forty miles or more , has the grandeur of the mountain scenery growing before him with every turn and elevation of the road , until he finds himself in the span-wide defile of the Notch , with its sentinel cliffs on either side , the compressed current of the Soco bubbling over its stony bed at his feet , and the Flume and the Silver Cascade tossing their spray in the sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saco valley the tourist may enjoy the most charming lake navigation in New England ; on one , that of the deep , islandless Sebago , and two smaller lakes , with one of which it is connected by the most romantic little river , so narrow that the steamboat is brushed at the same time by the trees on both banks , and so tortuous that the pilot more than once completely // reverses his course , and steers in the opposite direction to that of his destined port , - on the other , that of the Winnipiseogee , with its hundreds of picturesque islands , its grand amphitheatre of environing hills , and its vistas through which " Alps on Alps arise . " This valley undoubtedly commands the greatest variety of view , and North Conway , which lies upon it , about thirty miles from Mount Washington , has become a justly favorite place of summer sojourn for the endless diversity of blended mountain , sky , and cloud scenery it presents , and for the numerous excursions which may be made within easy distance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pemigewasset valley is the natural avenue to the Franconia range . Here is a defile - less narrow , wild , and oppressive , but in some respects even more sublime , than the Crawford Notch - flanked by Mounts Lafayette and Cannon . Near this defile is " the great stone face , " over which almost unceasing tears pour from the clouds , fall into the Profile Lake beneath , and form one of the most prolific feeders of the little stream which gives name to the valley . Echo Lake , the Flume , and the Basin are among the almost numberless objects of surpassing beauty and grandeur , that render the region of Franconia hardly less attractive than that of the White Mountain group . The Connecticut valley may be reached , either by the White Mountain Railway , of which Littleton is the terminus , or by the Grand Trunk Railway , with a pleasant drive of twelve miles from Northumberland to Lancaster . No other road of equal length commands such a diversity of mountain and river scenery as that between Littleton and Lancaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley , with the Mount Washington chain in the distance , is one of the most charming spots we have ever visited . From a hill in the vicinity of the village are obtained views of the entire range , only less in detail than those near the Alpine House , and even superior in magnificence , especially when the entire mass of crag and forest looks out from its winter environment of sheeted and drifted snow . We regret that Mr. King had not so enlarged his plan as to // include the Dixville Notch , about forty miles from Lancaster . It is approached by passing up the Connecticut valley as far as Colebrook , and thence by an abrupt and perilous road of thirteen miles in an easterly direction . This defile , just wide enough for a carriage-way , is flanked by nearly perpendicular walls of mica-slate , eight hundred feet in height , rising in needles and pinnacles , and bearing , from some points of view , a close resemblance to vast architectural ruins . From the summit of one of these peaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of almost unequalled grandeur , embracing an immense extent of meadow and forest , lying in a basin nearly enclosed on every side by an amphitheatre of mountains . Near the Notch is the Flume , a chasm more thoroughly Avernine in its aspect and surroundings than any other similar gorge we have ever beheld , overshadowed by sombre foliage , the whole scene wild , dark , and dank , with a stream of almost Styx-like blackness pouring into the blackness below , - the very spot where the ancients would inevitably have sought an opening to the infernal regions . If it be asked by which of the four avenues the White Mountains should be approached , we can only give our advice , backed by our own example , to try them all , and not in summer only , but in winter too ; for while the penetralia of the mountain-gorges can be explored , and the peaks ascended , only in the warmer season , there is hardly a view from any attainable station which has not its beauty intensified , and its grandeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the peculiar tone of the scenery , and by the rich and various prismatic partings of the sunlight as reflected from colossal icicles , frozen waterfalls , glazed piles of snow , and floating crystals of congealed vapor . Let no one imagine that he can be qualified even to talk about the White Hills by one of those rapid , business-like excursions in which our pleasurelovers are wont to " do up " the picturesque of this and that place of fashionable resort , checking each site on the guidebook , - the pencil-mark the only memento of their having seen it . One should remain days - were it possible , weeks - at each of the principal stations , in order to know what a marvellous diversity of phases the same rocks , trees , and waterVOL . XC. - NO. 186. // courses can assume by the shifting of the lights and shadows . Then , too , in passing from place to place , from valley to valley , one needs to be choice as to times and modes of conveyance . There is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over after nightfall , or on a rainy day , or on the middle seat of a crowded coach . We have made trial of every mode of locomotion among the mountains , and our preference , simply as tourists , is for a walk with staff and knapsack , with no pre-arranged plan , and , we would add , with no constant and inevitable companion , but with freedom to join always the most pleasant party for the day , to lead or follow in the adventure that holds forth the richest promise , and to heed no counsel but that proffered by the aspects of the heavens and the condition of the watercourses . We verily believe that in this complete independence and autonomy more of the enjoyment to be drawn immediately from nature can be secured , than under the necessary restrictions even of the society we love best . Yet we remember that " it is not good that the man should be alone , " and our own experience tells us that , while the power , beauty , and majesty embodied all around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the aggregate of our enjoyment is greatly enhanced when shared , multiplied when divided , with those whom God has given us . But let a family party be chary of trusting wholly to public modes of transit other than railroads . Far better is it , and hardly less economical , to have a carriage - open , of course - and horses at one 's own command , - horses , too , of approved discretion and self-control , worthy to be left unwatched by the roadside for an occasional digressive stroll or clamber , and amenable to the guidance of the feeblest of the party , while the stronger indulge in the frequent luxury of walking . We are glad to find that Mr. King has done ample justice to the heroes of the mountains , and to their heroic age , which may be said to have expired when Abel Crawford ceased to breathe . He was in every sense a noble man . Of considerably more than six feet in height , lithe of limb , with a giant 's might of arm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every possible emergency , he in 1790 lived alone in // a log hut on the mound called the Giant 's Grave , at the foot of which , half a century later , stood Fabyan 's great hotel . Shortly afterward , he settled on the well-known site where he spent the residue of his days . His was the pioneer mind and hand in all the early and slow stages by which the country between Bethlehem and Bartlett was made accessible , and was annexed to the civilized world . " He assisted in cutting the first footpath to the ridge , and at seventy-five , in the year 1840 , he rode the first horse that climbed the cone of Mount Washington . " When more than eighty years of age , he was returned as a member of the New Hampshire Legislature , and in this new capacity he not only was an object of curious interest , but by his shrewdness and sound practical wisdom evinced the capacity of the tamer of beasts to bear an honored part in the affairs of state and government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eye undimmed , and his majestic form but slightly bowed , - his snowwhite hair hanging in waving masses , rather than curls , over his neck and shoulders , - till he quietly sank into his last slumber at the ripe age of eighty-five . His son Ethan has , we suppose , had no equal , in these latter centuries and among civilized men , in physical strength . Wrestling , hand to paw , with a bear was for many years an every-day conflict with him , nor did he deem it a feat worthy of special commemoration , when he bore in his arms an exhausted traveller from the summit of Mount Washington to the fireside of his own house . But for the details of his hardihood and his sufferings , as well as for the still higher heroism of his patient , brave , and true Christian wife , we must refer our readers to Mr. King 's appreciating narrative and eulogium . It is impossible for us , in the brief space and time left at our disposal , to give our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have done better than this , if we shall have induced them , by the meagreness of our analysis as contrasted with the richness of the theme , to resort with a merely whetted appetite to the book itself . We close by extracting the following eloquent description of what , says our author , " we can not hope to see again . " We once witnessed near Lake Winnipiseogee a spectacle which // might be described , mutatis mutandis , in nearly the same words , and which still remains foremost in beauty , first in glory , among our own remembrances of travel . Mr. King copies the record made by him at the time . He was on his return ride from Berlin Falls to Gorham . " The vapors hung in heavy masses over the principal ridges , but the west was clear . There was evident preparation for a magnificent display , - a great banquet by the sun to the courtier clouds , on retiring from office that day , - a high carnival of light . As I turned the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slight shower began to fall down the valley of Mount Carter , and a patch of rainbow flashed across the bosom of the mountain . From point to point it wandered , uncertain where to locate , ' but at last selected a central spot against the lowest summit , and concentrated its splendors . " The background of the mountain was blue-black . Not a tree was visible , not an irregularity of the surface . It was one smooth mass of solid darkness , soft as it was deep . And the iris was not a bow , but a pillar of light . It rested on the ground ; its top did not quite reach to the summit of the mountain . With what intense delight we looked at it , expecting every instant that its magic texture would dissolve ! But it remained and glowed more brightly . I can give you no conception of the brilliancy and delicacy , the splendor and softness , of the vision . The rainbow on a cloud , in the most vivid display I ever saw of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The red predominated . Its intensity increased till the mountain shadow behind it was black as midnight . And yet the pillar stood firm . Is not the mountain on fire ? ' said my companion . Certainly that is flame . ' Five minutes , ten minutes , fifteen minutes , the gorgeous vision stayed , and we steadily rode nearer . Really , we began to feel uneasy . We expected to see smoke . The color was so intense that there seemed to be real danger of the trees kindling under it . We could not keep in mind that it was celestial fire we were looking at , - fire cool as the water-drops out of which it was born , and on which it reclined . It lay apparently upon the trees , diffused itself among them , from the valley to the crown of the ridge , as gently as the glory in the bush upon iloreb , when the angel of the Lord appeared unto Moses in a flame of fire , out of the midst of a bush ; and he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bush was not consumed . ' " It seemed like nothing less than a message to mortals from the internal sphere , - the robe of an angel , awful and gentle , come to bear a great truth to the dwellers in the valley . And it was , no doubt . It meant all that the discerning eye and reverent mind felt it to mean . // That Arabian bush would have been vital with no such presence , perhaps , to the gaze of a different soul . To him that hath shall be given . ' A colder , a sceptical spirit would have said , possibly , There is a curious play of the sunbeams in the mist about that shrub , ' or , it may be , would have decided that he was the victim of an optical illusion , and so would have missed the message to put the shoes from his feet , because the place was holy ground . Nearly twenty minutes the pillar of variegated flame remained in the valley of Mount Carter , as if waiting for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice to issue from its mystery . Then , lifting itself from its base , and melting gradually upwards , it shrunk into a narrow strip of beauty , leaped from the mountain summit to the cloud , and vanished . " It seems difficult to connect such a show , in memory , with Gorham , ' - so hard a name , a fit title for a rough , growing Yankee village . But such is the way the homeliest business is glorified here ; such is the way the ideal world plays out visibly over the practical , in all seasons , and every day . Only have an eye in your head competent to appreciate the changes of light , the richness of shadows , the sport of mists upon the hills , and you can look up every hour here , from the rough fences and uncouth shops of Yankee land , to the magic of fairy land . While that show was in the height of its splendor , I asked an old farmer , who was hauling stones with his oxen , what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his eye , and said , indifferently , It s nice , but we often have em here ; gee-haw , wo-hush ! ' Yes , that s just the truth , We often have em , ' - often have the glories of the Divine art , passages of the celestial magnificence , playing over our potato-fields ; therefore the most of us pay no attention to them , - count them as matters of course , keep coolly at our digging , and wait for something more surprising to jar us from our scepticism , shatter the crusts of the senses , wake us to a feeling of mystery , and startle us , through fear , into a belief or consciousness of God . " The iris pillar suggested the burning bush on Horeb . As I close this letter , that passage broadeus to my thought , into a symbol of a mightier truth . What statement is so competent as that to set forth the relation of the Creative Spirit to the universe ! In Moses ' time , nature , in the regard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it has grown , through the researches of the intellect , to a tree . The universe is a mighty tree ; and the great truth for us to connect with the majestic sciences of these days , and to keep vivid by a religious imagination , is , that from the roots of its mystery to the silver-leaved boughs of the firmament , it is continually filled with God , and yet unconsumed.
