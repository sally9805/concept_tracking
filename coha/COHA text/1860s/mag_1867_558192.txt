THE influence of our recent war in developing the " national " sentiment of the people can hardly be over-estimated . It was the conclusion of a long series of conflicts between the // idea of a loose confederacy , exposed to the secession of a disaffected section , and the idea of States forever united to promote the common welfare of all the inhabitants . As the nation was vindicated in the final appeal to the decision of arms , so in a multitude of important although minor issues there has been a like assertion of the power of the people , acting through the general government , to secure for themselves benefits which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , national banks have almost superseded State incorporations , and their bills are current throughout the land . National securities have become the favorite investments , not of rich capitalists only , as heretofore , but of workingmen , farmers , mechanics , teachers , ministers , and other men of little income and less savings . A national railroad , stretching over half the continent , is in progress , to bind the East and West together . The nation has pronounced itself in favor of an international system of weights and measures . A National Academy of Sciences has been instituted . Appropriations have been made by Congress , and delegates have been sent abroad , to represent us at the exhibition of national industry in Paris . A national Commissioner of Agriculture has been appointed . Nor has public instruction been neglected . A national Department of Education has been established , and a national Commissioner appointed to promote as far as possible the progress of sound and liberal views of intellectual culture . More than this , a vast domain , surpassing the area of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriated by Congress for the promotion , throughout the land , of industrial or scientific schools , colleges , and universities . We shall not now discuss the tendency of such legislation , nor question how far it promotes the dignity , the prosperity , and the happiness of the United States , or how far it lessens the popular regard for States rights and the dread of a centralized government . We merely call attention to this noteworthy aspect of the times in its relations to popular education , and to the obvious fact that the withdrawal of the extreme sectional men from the halls of Congress has made it possible to mature and carry out some plans for the national welfare which in earher // days *yould have been certainly voted down , and which in time to come , whatever be the conditions of reconstruction in the South , can never be undone . Under these circumstances we think that the epithet employed for the first time in the heading of this article is a fit designation of a class of institutions rapidly organizing in all the loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , the " National Schools of Science , " distinguished from all other schools and colleges by the reception of an endowment from the nation , obliged to conform to certain requirements of the national legislature , and bound to print and publish annually a report of their progress . lit is true that the general government has no other control over them than to insist upon a fulfilment of the requirements of the statute by which they were created . But the nation gave birth to them ; the nation provided their dowry ; the nation is to reap the benefits which they are designed to render . Very few persons understand the momentous significance of the Act of Congress " for the Benefit of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts , " which was passed by Congress on the 17th of June , 1862 , and became a law , by the approval of President Lincoln , on the 2d of July iihmediately following . Our New England readers will associate the earlier of these dates with the anniversary of the battle of Bunker Hill , the earliest occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfdetermining power of the American people were exhibited to the world . Hereafter the same anniversary will recall to the minds of scholars the earliest act of Congress for the promotion of national popular education . Other grants there have been , we are well aware , for purposes of instruction , but this is the first which regards the wants of all the States . It is very remarkable that so important a measure should have been carried through the House of Representatives by its friends under the operation of that summary procedure in parliamentary tactics known as " the previous question . " The only broad and statesmanlike speeches , on the general principles of the bill and the probable influence of its enactment , were made by the author of the measure . Many other persons spoke upon the subject , especially in the Senate , but nearly all that was said had reference to minor points involved in the // general plan , and had little regard to its characteristic features . So , too , in the several States of the North there has been but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities of the country . Each State is solving the problem of what to do with the public grant in its own way , with reference to its own wants , and according to its own understanding of the Congressional intent . Some persons may not object to this , but will point to it as one of the many illustrations of the self-confidence and promptness of action which distinguish our countrymen . We are not sure that this mode of procedure is the best . We can not but regret that an educational problem so important as that which is involved in the establishment of these National Schools of Science is to be settled , at any rate for a time , with so little comparison of views among the educators of the country , and so little discussion of the principles of mental training . A grant of land , imperial in extent , is devoted to the creation and encouragement of five-and-twenty colleges , one in each of the loyal States , which are to be followed , it is probable , by the creation of five-and-twenty more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted States of the West . These colleges are to differ from most of those already established , in the classes of persons for whose special benefit they are founded , and in the modes of instruction they will employ . Yet there is no public conference of scholars or statesmen respecting the legitimate scope of the institutions ; no inquiry in regard to the wants of this country or the experience of others ; no sharp and clear announcement even , in the act of Congress which confers the grant , of the character to be aimed at in the new establishments ; no thoroug*h discussion in the periodicals of the day respecting the changes which are possible and desirable in the national education . All at once the country is involved in perplexing inquiries . The problem is complex as well as difficult , requiring time not less than wisdom to solve it . It involves so many unknown quantities , that well-defined conclusions can not be reached at once , if indeed they are ever to be attained . The broadest culture , the deepest insight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and of letters as means of disci // pline , and a sagacious power of adapting means to ends , are essential to the wise determination of the questions involved in the establishment of these institutions . But , as usual , this country can not wait for the slow gathering of wisdom . " Something must be done . " The land has been granted , the schools must begin . Stated in its barest form , the problem to be solved is this : How can the methods and results of modern science be made most conducive to the education of American young men ? Stated in its fullest expression , there is no point in the theory of intellectual discipline and the methods of human culture which the problem does not involve . " This is a republic where the will of the people is the law of the land , " says our highest military leader to the highest public functionary of the land . It is true in education as in politics and war . The people hold the power , the people will decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment , they will try exploded notions , but they will never lose sight of the end in view . They will secure " the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes . " When that is accomplished , and not till then , universal education will be the characteristic of the continent , as in earlier days it has already been of some portions of New England . We regard it as a promise of future good , that the new " Department of Education " in the general government at Washington has been first intrusted to one of the most experienced and enlightened advocates of public instruction in this country , and that one of his earliest official proceedings is to seek out and bring together the results during the last five years of the action in the different States respecting the Congressional appropriation for the purposes of national education . The circular mentioned at the beginning of this article presents a series of questions addressed to the authorities of the new Schools of Science , and when their returns are received we shall have a curious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of the original enactment of Congress , and of many of the separate State enactments upon this subject , with full accounts of two institutions already in vigorous progress . In no other place can so much be seen of the method in which the Congressional grant has been applied . // The titles of other pamphlets which we have prefixed to our remarks are selected from a large number which we might have given , as affording a good idea of the character of discussions which are now in progress . We shall not remark on them separately , for our intention is to present the general rather than the local aspects of the subject we have taken up . Prior to the bestowal of the Congressional grant , schools of science , under various designations , had been established in various places , and many of the older classical colleges had arranged for partial or optional courses of study , which were supposed to be called for by students who would not devote themselves to Latin and Greek . Some of the largest of the large endowments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been directed to institutions of science rather than of literature . The names of Stephen Van Rensselaer , James Smithson , Abbott Lawrence , Peter Cooper , Joseph E. Sheffield , Abiel Chandler , Blandina Dudley , and George Peabody will remind the reader of a series of princely gifts , the object of which has been to promote the knowledge of natural science among our countrymen . Most of these donors had acquired their own fortunes , and had clearly seen the value of training in mathematical , physical , and natural science as a preparation for life , as well as the importance of scientific researches in promoting the development of our natural resources . Other kindred benefactions might be named , but those now cited are enough to show that , independent of what the government might do , schools of science were not likely to be neglected by the people of this country . The pioneer among these scientific schools was that at Troy , founded by the late Stephen Van Rensselaer , and long under the direction of Amos Eaton , the well-known naturalist . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engineering . For a long time it stood alone . The gift of Abbott Lawrence to Harvard College , in 184T , for the foundation of a scientific school , attracted very general attention ; and within a few years , at Harvard , at Yale , at Dartmouth , at Union , at Columbia , and at some other younger colleges , scientific schools were established , nominally on the footing of the professional schools of law , medicine , and theology , but // practically ( in some instances at least ) affording to the scholars a course of stndy parallel , but by no means equal in discipline , to the usual college course . In New York , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Illinois , and other Western and Central States , vigorous efforts , with more or less success , had been put forth to organize agricultural schools , which should train practical farmers for their work , and should help forward the science of agriculture by investigations and experiments . An " Institute of Technology , " on a very liberal plan , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means exclusively , to the training of mechanical engineers and others engaged in manufacturing occupations . Under all these different forms there may have been , when the Congressional Endowment Bill was passed , twenty institutions which could be grouped under the general title of scientific schools . They were variously termed , in popular or official phraseology , scientific schools , polytechnic schools , technological schools , agricultural schools ; and they differed as much in worth and in influence as they did in name . In one respect they were alike they were all imperfectly endowed . Most of them were also on an experimental basis , - no person being able to say exactly what they might , could , or should be . Still they were very significant indications of the spirit of the age . They showed a desire for an advanced education on some other basis than the literature of Greece and Rome . They showed the willingness of rich men to give to scientific colleges . They showed the popular craving for what was vaguely termed , for want of a better word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form or other , provision would be made for education in those branches of useful knowledge which tend to exhibit the Creator 's works in their true aspects , and likewise in those which are immediately connected with the material advancement and civilization of mankind . Such , in brief , was the provision made foi scientific education in this country at the time when Congress gave a new and definite impulse to the movement . The private influences which were at work urging on our representatives at Washington to encourage " agricultural schools " by a gift of public lands , we can not here attempt to rehearse . There were busy // and devoted men in New York , Pennsylvania , and Illinois , who spared no effort within their power to secure a national appropriation . The history of Congressional action on this subject begins with the assembling of the Thirty-fifth Congress , in December , 1857 , at the outset of Mr. Buchanan 's administration , in the days of Kansas outrages , - the beginning of the end of the dominion of slavery . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Agriculture , Mr. Justin S. Morrill , introduced a bill appropriating to the several States a portion of the public lands , for the purpose of encouraging institutions for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts . Opposition manifested itself at once , and the bill , instead of being referred , as the author desired , to the Committee on Agriculture , fell into the hands of its enemies in the Committee on Public Lands . Four months later , on the 15th of April , 1858 , the chairman of the latter committee , Mr. W. R. W. Cobb of Alabama , reported back the bill , recommending that it should not pass . Mr. Walbridge of Michigan , from the same committee , presented a minority report favoring the measure . The introduction of the subject at this time led to very little debate or inquiry in respect to the various sections of the bill . Its author appeared determined that it should pass or fail to pass , as a whole , and that it should not be altered and ruined by attempts to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only elaborate speech in its favor , and Mr. Cobb made the only effective speech in opposition . The " previous question " was ordered by the House , and the bill was called by the very small majority of one hundred and five to one hundred . A change of three votes would have killed it . This occurred on the 22d of April , . 1858 . The Senate also referred the measure , when it came from the House , to the Committee on Public Lands , and they reported it back , without advising either its rejection or its passage , and Congress adjourned without action having been taken on the part of the Senate . Two months of the following winter passed by before this bill was reached . Then , by the energetic efforts of Senators Wade , Harlan , and Stuart , and in spite of the opposition of Senators Jefferson Davis , J. M. Mason , and // Pugh , the bill , slightly amended , was passed , by a vote of twenty-five to twenty-two , on the Yth of February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate would have defeated it . The House concurred in the amendments which had been made , and the bill went to the President . It soon came back with his veto . The objections which he raised , partly of a constitutional and partly of a theoretical character , were forcibly put ; and they may be consulted by those interested in the history of the bill as a clear and strong statement of the views of the opposition . When the bill returned to the House , it could not be expected that a two-thirds vote could be secured over the President 's veto . On putting the question , the advocates of the measure stood firm , one hundred and five ayes ; four of the opponents were gone , and the noes were ninety-six . So the bill was not passed . Nothing illustrates the changing aspect of affairs throughont the land better than the legislation of the Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth Congresses respectively . In the new Congress of President Lincoln 's administration , the very same bill which had failed before was introduced to the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1862 . It went to the Committee on Public Lands , and , eleven days later , was reported back favorably by Senator Harlan . For a month its fate was pending in the Senate . Its opponents asked for delay , and raised objections , not only to its general principles , but to specific provisions . On the 10th of June a vote was reached , and the Senate , by a vote of thirty-two to seven , passed the bill . The minority was composed of Senators Doolittle , Grimes , Saulsbury , Wright , Howe , Lane , and Wilkinson , - the three last named having taken the most active share in the debate . The bill went to the House , and , without any other debate than an able speech from its author , Mr. Morrill , was adopted by the decisive vote of ninety to twenty-five . This occurred , as we have said , on June 17 , 1862 . In a few days it received the signature of Abraham Lincoln , and became a law of the land . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of the bill and its earnest advocate had // the satisfaction of seeing accomplished a most important service to the people of this land . We give a summary of the act in its author 's own words . " The bill proposes to establish at least one college in every State upon a sure and perpetual foundation , accessible to all , but especially to the sons of toil , where all the needful science for the practical avocations of life shall be taught , where neither the higher graces of classical studies , n6r that military drill our country now so greatly appreciates , will be entirely ignored , and where agriculture , the foundation of all present and future prosperity , may look for troops of earnest friends , studying its familiar and recondite economies , and at last elevating it to that higher level where it may fearlessly invoke comparison with the most advanced standards of the world . The bill fixes the leading objects , but properly , as I think , leaves to the States considerable latitude in carrying out the practical details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the general reader , may be given in the following terms - I. Every State may receive a quantity of public land equal to thirty thousand acres for every one of its Senators and Representatives in Congress , under the census of 1860 . II . The mode in which this laud may be selected and located is restricted by various provisions , the most important being that no State may locate its scrip within the limits of another State , - although its assignees may do so . III . All expenses of location , management , taxation , etc. must be paid from the State treasuries , in order that the entire proceeds of the sale of lands may remain undiminished . IN . The proceeds are to be invested in safe stocks , yielding at least five per cent per annum , and the interest " shall be inviolably appropriated , by each State which may take and claim the benefit of this act , to the endowment , support , and maintenance of at least one college where the leading object shall be , without excluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts , in such manner as the Legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe , in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life . " V. This grant is made on the following conditions -1 . Each // State shall guarantee the entir* capital of the fund it receives , except that one tenth of the capital may be devoted to thereof may be applied to building or repairs . 3 . Any State receiving the grant must provide an institution within five years . 4 . An annual report shall be made and distributed . 5 . If lands improved by railroads are selected , the number of acres will be diminished . 6 . No State while in rebellion may have the benefit of this act . L No State may receive the grant unless its Legislature formally accepts it within two years of its approval by the President . VI . Certain provisions are made respecting the location of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations , etc . Some modifications of the law , not affecting its general characteristics , have been subsequently made by acts of Congress , approved April 14 , 1864 , and July 23 , 1866 . By the latter , the time in which a State may signify its acceptance of the grant is extended to three years from the date of the amendment , that is , to July 23 , 1869 , and Territories ( which were not included in the original measure , though mentioned in its title ) are allowed three years after their admission as States within which they may avail themselves of this national bounty . The time within which every State must establish at least one college is also somewhat extended . The tenor of these amendments is obviously such that the rebellious States of the South and the coming States of the West , so soon as they are received into good and regular standing as States , may share in the benefits now enjoyed by the old and loyal members of the Union . ' Thus the grant becomes completely national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favor bestowed in time of war for the special benefit of the North . The law , then , contemplates the early establishment and endowment of not less than thirty-seven national schools of science . Including the Territories as now organized , this number rises to forty-four , that being , according to our count , the present number of States and Territories , loyal and disloyal , which constitute the Union , - not including Sitka . Any State // may elect , however , to establish *iiore than one of the proposed colleges , and the number of Territories is sure to be increased . It is safe , therefore , to say that Congress has provided for the institution of nearly fifty colleges on a national basis . Let us now look more closely into the terms of this enactment . Among the ideas which are often advocated in this country , but which are wisely kept out of the Morrill bill , are many crude and rash notions in respect to the objects and methods of instruction . Many persons , aiming to benefit the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution to be adopted in every State , and would have hampered the bill with objectionable features . In proof of this , we need only turn to a pamphlet published by the Agricultural Department at Washington , with strong official commendation , in which the writer gives such directions as these - " Let the model farm comprise , if practicable , exactly one hundred acres , and be of a regular shape . " Let this be divided into portions comprising " exactly ten acres . " One of these parallelograms , " the model garden , " may be laid off " on the plan of Mercator 's Projection , so that the prime meridian may pass through Behring 's Straits " ; the buildings will then " occupy the central vacancy in the Pacific Ocean , while each seed sown and shrub or bulb planted may be made to grow on such representative spot in the garden as it occupied in its native soil . " Even if there were no d*anger that such extravagances as these would find place in legislation , it would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Greek , or a predilection for manual labor , or a determination that a farm should in all cases be secured . Some advisers would have thought it essential that the general government , in providing the endowment , should perpetually exercise the right of inspection or direction . Military men might have been tempted to insist on a military organization for the discipline of the students . But all such objectionable restrictions are happily omitted from the act of Congress . It contains everything which is essential , and nothing which is unessential , to the end in view . The people of every State are left free to determine how the scientific education of the industrial classes may be most efficiently promoted within their several limits . // The most noteworthy phrase in the bill is the clause which defines the character of the projected institutions , and which we have quoted verbatim in the fourth paragraph of the above analysis . It states in the clearest terms that the object of the national liberality is to provide instruction in " such branches of learning as are related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific and classical studies , and including military tactics . " It does not seem possible to misapprehend this st*Ctement . Yet every week we are surprised to find that this broad and comprehensive basis of the grant is not understood , even among intelligent men , who should be correctly informed . The act is almost always called " The Agricultural College Bill , " which is as truly a misnomer as if it were called " The Public Lands Bill . " In the Indexes of the Congressional Globe and of the United States Statutes at Large , in the laws of most of the separate States , in the official messages of Governors , Comptrollers , and the like , " Agricultural College " is the term employed to indicate the essential feature of the law . This is an error , - an injurious and dangetous error , likely to lead to many popular complaints respecting the institutions established by Congress . Even so intelligent a writer as the accomplished Farmer of " Edgewood , " in one of his latest volumes , gives an undeserved fling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the erroneous impression that only agriculture should be taught in these national schools of science . The mechanic arts , however , are placed on the same footing as agriculture , and the liberal education of the industrial classes is as much an object of the grant as their practical training . In short , any branch of human learning may lawfully receive attention in these schools , provided only that it does not preclude attention to the study of natural science in its applications to human industry . Even a university with all its faculties may be maintained with the proceeds of the grant , if they are adequate to such an outlay , provided always that the promotion of agriculture and the mechanic arts is kept prominently in view . The popular misapprehension requires correction . If the title " National Schools of Science " does not find favor , let the term " Colleges of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts , " // " Industrial Universities , " or the more familiar and indefinite phrase " Scientific , " " Polytechnic , " or " Technological " School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomplete designation " Agricultural Colleges " continue to find favor . It has already led , in some places , to unpleasant discussions with farmers and their friends , who have claimed all the advantages of the grant , without reference to the many other " industrial classes " in the community . The truth is , that in our country all belong to the industrial classes . All are intent on work . No birthright , no entailed estate , no aristocratic title , no official position , exempts the American from laboring with brain or hand , or with brain and hand , for the benefit of his fellow-men and the promotion of the general civilization . It is the comprehensiveness of the Morrill bill which constitutes its highest excellence . At the same time , while we insist upon the catholicity of this measure , we can not and would not overlook another fact which is just as clear . Scientific schools , not classical colleges , are established by the act . The terms of the law , the explanations of its author , the intent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mathematical , physical , and natural science , the investigation of the laws of nature , are to be the predominant study , rather than language , literature , and history . The latter may be , the former must be , included . No slight is cast upon the classics , the venerated means of human culture , the acknowledged instruments of high intellectual discipline . They may hold their place ; but other studies must predominate in the new institutions . In other words , the general government lends its co-operation to the development of the national wealth , and bestows its bounty on institutions in which mOn of all political , ecclesiastical , and religious opinions may , if they will , unite . A third point to be considered in the provisions of the Morrill bill is the magnitude of the domain set apart for these new institutions . The enactment furnishes them with a truly magnificent endowment , especially in the more populous States , and will enable them in their youth to outstrip in dignity and influence many of the older half-endowed colleges which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance the number of " portions " each State is entitled to re // 509 ceive , and also the total number of acre* . The reader will remember that thirty thousand acres is allotted for every Senator and Representative in Congress . It is not absolutely certain that all the States will accept the grant , but there is hardly a doubt that such will be the case . Belays in " reconstruction " afford the only occasion for doubt .

Thus a total of nine million five hundred and ten thousand acres of land is set apart for the promotion of scientific education . It appears safe to estimate that this will yield , on the average , one dollar per acre , although much has been already sold at a lower price , and the market value of the scrip is very much below a dollar . Some of the States have taken measures , directly or indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands within their // own limits , in such a way as to secure a very much larger amouut than a dollar per acre . In New York , for example , Mr. Cornell of Ithaca has taken the scrip at its market value , aud is now devoting his rare financial ability to the disposal of it , in such quantities and on such terms as will enormously increase the proceeds , which he bestows on the institution , already endowed by a gift from his private purse of half a million dollars . If our estimate is not too large , ( and we feel confident that unless there is bad management it will be too small , ) Congress has provided funds which will amount to ten millions of dollars for the endowment of the thirty-seven new colleges . The bounty of the several States and of private individuals is likely to make large additions to this amount . To begin with , the buildings must be provided from other sources than the national gift , and local generosity is not likely to stop with providing the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their share of the public domain ninety thousand acres . Twenty-one States receive over two hundred thousand acres each , and three receive over five hundred thousand acres . The Empire State gaiiis the lion 's share , nearly a million acres , - nearly three times as much as Massachusetts , and more than five times as much as Connecticut . If the land were in one parcel , it would make a territory of fourteen thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine miles , equal to the States of Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut combined , and larger than either of the three kingdoms , Holland , Belgium , and Hanover . Moreover , the proceeds of this gift are to be invested in permanent funds guaranteed by the several States . One tenth may be taken for sites or for farms , but no more , - not a dollar for bricks and mortar . Hence the entire capital , or at least nine tenths of the capital , will remain forever secured for the national schools or colleges of science . A fourth point , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act , is the obligation of every institution to prepare an Annual Report , and to send copies of the same to all kindred institutions in the land and to the Secretary of the Interior . This secures publicity , - the safeguard // of all endowed institutions . The whole country will know what is done in every State to give efficiency to the Congressional grant , and the experience of every locality will be at the service of every other . This alone is a great protection against blunders and errors , as well as against improper appropriations or squanderings of the income . Other points involved in the bill are worthy of consideration , but we have now considered its most significant features . A more liberal or a wiser educational endowment it would be hard to find proceeding from any government on the face of the globe . The , influence of Congress terminates , as we have already said , in these general regulations , all details of organization and management being left to the several States . By means of the laws collected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to trace out the second phase in this remarkable history , and to see in what different ways , from Maine to California , the same idea has been worked out . We should exhaust the space at our command if we undertook to give a complete narrative of the legislative enactments and discussions in the twenty-seven loyal States . We therefore refer the reader to the pamphlet just mentioned for accurate copies of what may be termed " the charters " of the institutions yet established , while we restrict ourselves to some points of comparison which are interesting and instructive . The earliest question which has arisen in nearly or quite every State has been the expediency of establishing one or more than one national college with the proceeds of the grant . It was natural that , in States where several classical colleges were already in existence , all inadequately equipped , some hesitation should be felt about beginning a new institution , and that each existing college should desire to receive a portion of the endowment for industrial or scientific instruction . In New York such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were skilfully answered by Mr. White ( now Chancellor of Cornell University ) , in a speech in the Senate of that State , in March , 1865 . We have thrown away , he said , in the collegiate system of New York , " the benefits arising from concentration of higher educational effort , and // have accepted the evils arising from scattering and division , until , instead of one or two strong institutions , we have a score of small colleges , each feeble , each poor , each incompletely equipped , each obliged to resort to continual beggary , each forced to abate something from thorough discipline . " Similar arguments against a division of the grant may be = found in Professor Whitney 's California Report , and in the Reports of Professor J. B. Turner of Illinois ( who is known in that State as the pioneer advocate of industrial education ) , and also expressed in terms of great eloquence and force in a message of Governor Andrew to the Legislature of Massachusetts . These views have generally prevailed . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a single institution . In Massachusetts alone , to the surprise of the rest of the country , a division was thought wise , and two institutions , one of agriculture , and the other of the mechanic arts , are already in successful operation . This , however , must be admitted , that the evils of division will be less serious in Massachusetts than in almost any other locality . A second question , closely connected with the first , has been the wisdom of combining the national school with some already existing institution . In this respect , also , the friends of concentration have generally triumphed , - not always by bestowing the grant upon a corporation already existing , but commonly by creating a distinct corporation , and then locating the new institution adjacent to , or in connection with , some older college . In New England , for example , all the States but Maine have placed the industrial colleges where the advantages of libraries and museums already collected may be freely made use of . In New Hampshire , though a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is to be in fact a department of Dartmouth College . Vermont brings her scrip to the University at Burlington . Massachusetts gives one third of her grant to the Institute of Technology in Boston , and two thirds to an agricultural school established near Amherst College . Rhode Island bestows her scrip on Brown University . Connecticut finds in that department of Yale College known as the Sheffield Scientific School just such an institution as was // described in the act of Congress , and invigorates it by the gift of the national bounty . New Jersey follows the example of Connecticut , and bestows on the Scientific School of Rutgers College her share of land . In Pennsylvania , Maryland , and Michigan , where agricultural colleges were already in successful operation , they have secured additional strength by the new endowment . In some of the Western States , the State Universities have been the recipients of the grant ; for example , in Wisconsin and Kentucky . In other States , as West Virginia , Indiana , Iowa , Minnesota , Illinois , and California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be organized , and not necessarily in connection with older institutions . ' One State alone , the Empire State , has made the national grant the basis of a new University , distinct from all existing institutions in the State , and likely at an early day to eclipse them all in wealth , in collections , in instructors , and in students . A citizen of Ithaca , Hon. Ezra Cornell , offered to the State two hundred acres of suitable land , and half a million of dollars in money , provided that the Legislature would concentrate the national gift and his gift in a new University at Ithaca . The offer was accepted , and a scheme for the organization of the " Cornell University " is projected in a pamphlet of the Chancellor , which we give in our caption . A third question has often arisen in respect to the desirability of procuring farms for the several colleges . In most of the States it has been thought expedient to do so , and permission to make the purchase has been granted by the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave doubts are entertained whether a college farm can be wisely and economically administered . If it does not pay its expenses , farmers will be likely to scoff at " book laming " as very good for lawyers , but very poor for those who till the soil , and Legislatures will censure the management of a " model " farm which does not pay its own way . On the other hand , if experiments are to be made , the idea that they will pay expenses is as absurd as to expect that expenses will be paid by ' the experiments of a chemical lecture-room . Onr Legislatures are so largely made up of gentlemen from the rural
