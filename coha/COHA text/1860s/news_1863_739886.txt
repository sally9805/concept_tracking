txt The recommendation of the President in gard to encouraging immigration , has not received as yet the public attention which it deserves . He states , what all see to be true , that the nation is ! in a transitional and peculiar condition , when measures may be advisable , which would not be so in ordinary times . He calls attention to the great dearth of labor in agriculture and the mines , seeing clearly that the especial loss in this war is not so much the destruction and wear of property , as the loss of labor . And yet , - he informs us , " tens of thousands . of people throng our foreign Consulates , " desiring cheap assistance for immigration , and he accordingly asks that Congress would take into consideration the propriety of furthering this immigration by some pecuniary aid . It has always been understood by those guiding public affairs in this country that our richest mine of wealth lay in.the constant influx of foreign labor . We all know that it is not so much the inexhaustible alluvial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rocky Mountains , which have made us wealthy , as these united with our free supply of labor . In view of this , during a time of war , and with an immense debt heaping , up , Congress has given almost the first instance in history of a National Legislature offering the land of the country without price to the settler .. This liberal measure has made a profound impression in Europe . The instinct for owning land is one of the most profound instincts in the human breast . For the hard-pressed laborer , the cottier , the small tenant , the mechanic and farmer in Europe , an El Dorado seems presented when they hear that a landed estate is offered them for nothing in the rich and free Western World . No wonder that , though war is desolating so many of our provinces , they throng in " ten thousands " our Consulates for help in reaching this continent . So great is the inducement offered by this Homestead Law and our high wages , that immigration will have probably doubled this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been taken up of the public lands . But the question which the President lays before Congress is , whether this source of wealth can not be increased at the present time . Or , in other words , can the nation afford to pay something toward the transport to America of every able-bodied man from Europe who desires to settle here ? We can judge something of the value of each man now in this country , from the money paid for a recruit . We know that the least pecuniary estimate , is $300 , and that vast numbers receive nearly $700 . The Government must have men , and , if the war should be protracted , the public will pay $1,000 for a private soldier if it becomes necessary . Now for every new laborer introduced there is the place filled of an enlisted soldier , and the loss to the community somewhat compensated . There are few immigrants now whose unskilled labor is not worth $250 per annum over and above the food which they earn and crnsume . It may be safely assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet probably $20 per head would be enough assistance to turn a great pile of immigrants to our coasts . If judiciously managed , there could not be a more profitable appropriation . What die nation most needs now is men . A great deal of careful organization would be necessary , so that the Government should not be putting into a few hands a gigantic " job ; " but skillfully arranged between the Consuls , the ship-owners , and the Government , we could land hundreds of thousands . of German and Trig ' laborers within a short time , to be distributed over the whole country . We earnestly invoke the attention of our legislators to this important subject .
