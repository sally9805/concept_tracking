ARTICLE IV. - PERSONAL HISTORY OF LORD BACON . Personal History of Lord Bacon , from unpublished papers . By WILLIAM HEPWORTH Dixox , of the Middle Temple . 1861. 8vo. pp. 421 . Boston : Ticknor &amp; Fields . Bacon . By Hon. Jou* W. EDMONDs . Knickerbocker , April , 1861 , page 378 . THE moral character of Lord Bacon has always been a nuisance to the friends both of science and morality . The deriders of the former have pointed to him as a proof of the pernicious influence of great scientific acquirements . The friends of the latter have been constantly taunted with the depravity of one whose maxims lie at the foundation of systems of morality . Any man who could justly rescue the reputation of the great philosopher from the load of opprobrium under which it has sunk would be regarded as a benefactor of the human race . When therefore we saw a work advertised , with a pretentious assurance that the author had had access to new sources of information , from which the purity of Lord Bacon 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it with avidity . But we were soon compelled to come to the conclusion , that Dixon 's Personal History of Lord Bacon is a failure and a cheat . There is in it scarcely anything new , except a few letters written to himself and an elder brother , when boys or young men , by their mother , and their answers , from which it may be inferred that the mothers of those days had much the same maternal fears and anxieties as those of the present age , and that the future chancellor and his brother gave about as much occasion for them , as the fast young men of this generation . But the principal part of the book consists of a labored attempt to deny facts , which have again and again been established , beyond all reasonable doubt , and to reason away inferences , against the clear light of reason // itself . Mr. Dixon need not have informed us that he was a lawyer of the Middle Temple . His statements betoken a conscience which has been deadened by a fee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the cause of his client . His bitter hostility to Coke is as unreasonable as his indiscrimumating partiality to Bacon . He regards Bacon 's misfortune as owing to his great rival ; and falls into the very common error of barristers , who suppose that they vindicate the character of their own client , simply by blackening that of the opposite party . He dwells with great gusto on the overawing vulgarity and barbarity of the champion of the common law , which led him to exclaim , while prosecuting Sir Walter IRaleigh for treason , " Thou art a monster ; thou hast an English face , but a Spanish heart , "  --  and " all that he " ( Lord Cobham ) " did was by thy instigation , thou viper , for I thou thee , thou traitor ! " But he improves greatly on this violation of decency and propriety . Coke , when somewhat advanced in life , was fortunate or unfortunate enough to marry a young and beautiful second wife ; " a prize , " Dixon says , " with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The grizzly old bear of an attorney general marries this dainty and willful dame . " " Old , grim , penurious , " " close , supple , learned , grinding , cold to his dependents , cringing to his superiors ; " such are some of the choice epithets with which he commences his attack . When speaking of the conduct of Coke , at a subsequent period , he says , " Coke yells for the blood of papists " - " Coke pours on tliei* " ( certain members of the House of Commons ) " his gall . " " While Coke is slowly sliming round his prey , " &amp;c . Such is the style in which the defender of one great man considers it necessary to speak of another because he was the opponent of the object of his admiration . There can be no apology for such a course . No abuse of Coke tends in the slightest degree to prove that Bacon was an honest man . Such unbecomin0 language may pass with some for smartness of style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The author shows still greater weakness , in ascribing the fall of Bacon to the enmity and assaults of Coke , and then ostenta // tiously enumerating the subsequent misfortunes and final disgrace of the latter ,  --  if the censure of such a king as James I can be called a disgrace ,  --  as proog that Bacon was unjustly condemnned . Does he mean to intimate , that these misfortunes were a just judgment from heaven for aiding in the punishment of such a saint as Bacon ? Such loose reasoning may perhaps be pardonable in a lawyer of the Middle Temple . But what excuse has Judge Edmuonds for falling into the same error ? For we can not conceive for what other purpose he , too , has formally enumerated the subsequent calamities that befel Lord Coke . He certainly had tried cases enough , both as Advocate and Judge , to know that the character of the prosecutor , unless lie is a witness , has nothing to do with the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused , and that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the malice of the enemies of the prisoner had stimulated to action the officers of justice . The only true mode of defending a person , charged with a crime , is by proving that he is not guilty of it , and not by showing that some other person is guilty either of that or some other offense . Dixon is evidently a man who , in the reign of Charles I , would have justified all his arbitrary acts , however much he may attempt to conceal this leaning towards arbitrary power . It may seem to him , therefore , that the deprivation , by King James , of the office of Chief Justice , was a disgrace to Coke . But we had a right to expect better things of Judge Edmonds . If e knew , or should have known , that no act in the whole career of Lord Coke ought to elevate him so much in our esteem , and consign his name to immortality , as that which was the cause of his downfall . When the question was put to the judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes his interest or prerogative concerned , and requires judges to attend him for advice , they ought to stay proceedings till his majesty has consulted them , all the other judges , trembling for fear of losing their places , cringingly said yes . What said the Chief Justice ? " When the case happens , I shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do , " and by that noble answer sealed his doom . He // understood perfectly well that the question was , whether the judges should permit the king to interfere in the administration of justice , and he disdained to be a supple tool of arbitrary power . But Mr. Dixon , true to his instincts , makes this magnanimous conduct the ground of a charge against Coke of contumacy , and pretends that what the king claimed was a matter of prerogative which had repeatedly been conceded to him by the judges . His defense of Bacon in this transaction required the condemnation of Coke , as the king was undoubtedly instigated by the Lord Chancellor to set this trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this attempt of his to bring the judges to submit to the interference of royalty in the discharge of their official duties , but he has the audacity to justify his conduct in persuading them to allow the king to obtain privately their opinions as to points of law in which state criminals were interested , in order that he might be sure of the result , if he should order prosecutions . This conduct on the part of Bacon has been severely censured both by IMlacaulay and Lord Campbell . But Dixon asserts with an air of triumph that he has found a precedent in a case where a poor Arian preacher had been condemned to the stake by an Ecclesiastical Court , and King James consulted the judges privately whether he had power to order an execution on such a judgment . The judges advised that he had , and the vain king had the satisfaction of knowing that his power extended to the burning of a poor parson . This Dixon calls a precedent in point , thereby showing that lie is as poor a lawyer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the instance condemned by Bacon 's biograpliers , the judges were consulted as to a point of law which was to come before themselves , and as to which they were bound to decide , without having prejudged it . In the pretended precedent , the case was not pending before them , and never would be . The king , as an executive officer , merely took their opinion as to what lie had the power to do in a case pending as it were before himself . The distinction is too palpable // not to have been discerned by any one who was not blinded by prejudice . The Personal History of Lord Bacon is not , in our opinion , as any one may see from the instances which have been produced , worthy of any further notice , and the Article written by Judge Edmonds seems to be but a mere echo of some of its most objectionable enunciations . But , at the present time , it is important that the characters of Lord Bacon and Lord Coke , if brought before the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one can deny that Lord Bacon possessed a gigantic intellect , an astonishingly clear perception of truth , a power of penetrating the future which was almost prophetic , and a wisdom in the accomplishment of his purposes which his not been surpassed since the days of Solomon . If he was guilty of any folly , it was in allowing his correspondence to be transmitted to posterity ; for , by the record which is thus preserved , it can be demonstrated that he was a pertinacious office seeker , a cringing , unprincipled statesman , and a corrupt magistrate . If these do not make a man " the meanest of mankind , " it is not easy to conceive what would . His efforts to obtain office were unceasing from early youth to the decline of life . Before he was twenty years old , we find him begging his uncle Cecil for some office , to avoid the study of law . As soon as he was admitted to the bar , he solicited him again for a privilege to which he was not entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thirty-one , he writes to a friend in power , " to speak plainly , though perhaps vainly , I do not think the ordinary practice of the law , not serving the Queen in place , will be admitted a good account of the poor talent that God hath given nie . " His uncle , the Lord Treasurer , tried to satisfy his demands by procuring for him the reversion of the Lord Treasurership of the Star Chamber , worth about eight thousand dollars a year , but because he was not to come into possession till after twenty years , he complained that it was " like another 's fair ground battening upon his house , which might mend his prospect , // but did not fill his barns . " When the office of Solicitor General became vacant , he plied all his friends by the most earnest and abject solicitations to obtain it for him . lie reminds his uncle , Lord Burghley , that his father obtained an important office when he was but twenty-seven years old . lie suggests to the Lord Keeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely piece of wood to make a true servant of . " lie urges his friend Essex , who was ready to serve him , to use all his influence with the Queen . He finally makes a direct application to her majesty . But he has , in his own peculiar way , most forcibly described the pertinacity of his suit . " For to be , as I told you , like a child following a bird , which , when he is nearest flieth away , and lighteth a little before , and then the child after it again , and so in infinitum ,  - -  I am weary of it , and also of wearying my good friends . " Having failed of obtaining the office from Queen Elizabeth , he renews his efforts to obtain the same place from the vain but arbitrary James , and now his true character displays itself more fully . To Lord Salisbury he writes , " Although I know that your future is not to need an hundred such as I am , yet I shall be ready to give my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes , " Not that I vainly think I shall be able to do any great matters , but certainly it ( the appointment ) will force me to use a more industriOILS observance and application to such as I honor so much as I do your lordship . " But the assurance that he will use the office if he receives it , as the mere tool of the court , is more distinctly shown in a letter which lie wrote to the king . He reminds him that in a late parliament , with reference to certain matters in which the king took a deep interest , he was ever careful , and not without good success , sometimes to put forward that which was good , sometimes to keep back that which was not so good . " " In all which I was diligent and reasonably happy to execute those directions which I re*eived either immediately from your royal mouth or from my Lord of Salisbury , " and urges strongly the promises of favor which his majesty had from time to time made . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it till lie // became impatient for further promotion , he enters into an intrigue to remove the Attorney General to the place of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas , and thus make a vacancy for himself . For this change he draws up among others the following reasons , which are equally dishonorable to himself and to the king . " i*irst , It will strengthen the king 's causes greatly aiuongst the jhdges , for both my Lord Coke will think himself near a Privy Counselor 's place , and thereupon turn obsequious , " ( evidently judging others by 's place will come in well to the other and hold him hard to it , not without emulation , between them , who shall please the king best . " IBut the higher the office for which he sues , the more degraded he becomes . After objecting to the king that Lord Coke would not enable him to mount his saddle , meaning , probably , the prerogative which was James 's hobby horse ; that Hobart would keep it pent up , lie promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not make such short turns upon him ; " but that " when a direction is once given , it shall be pursued and performed . " It was , doubtless , by such protestations that he finally obtained the highest office in the giftof the king . After his degradation from the Woolsack , his old desire for office returned and he was again willing to humble himself to obtain it . He sues for the provostship of Eton College , seeming to be unconscious that a man who had been convicted of bribery was not a proper guardian of young men . That Bacon was a cringing , unprincipled statesman , can easily be inferred from the quotations which have already been made . When he first entered Parliament he appears to have had just ideas of liberty and to have been governed by his convictions . IBut as soon as he discovered that such a course would be a bar to promotion , he yielded and never afterwards resisted tire claims of an arbitrary sovereign . We have seen that Ire advocated tire atrocious claim of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain their views with reference to state criminals who would be brought before them for trial . We have seen , also , that he encouraged the // king in asserting the right to interfere where his interest was concerned in civil snits . He defended the right of the king to raise money by benevolence as a matter of right and hypocritically , as we must believe , described the king " as a constant protector of the liberties , laws , and customs of the kingdom . " Indeed , his whole political career was disgraced by pitiful subserviency to men of great influence , and especially by flattering the vanity and encouraging the pretensions of a weak , conceited , and arbitrary monarch . That he was guilty of receiving bribes when Lord Chancellor , is fully established by his own confessions , as well as by the most unanswerable proofs . That he was capable of such a crime can easily be believed , when we have seen that he was ready to sell himself to obtain the office . As soon as the charge was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself of those subtle powers of analysis , which were his peculiar characteristic , attempted to vindicate his conduct to his own conscience by dividing the cases in which a judge can receive money from a suitom* into three classes ; first , when lie receives it during the pendency of the suit , on a promise to show favor , of which he makes strong protestations of innocence ; secondly , when he receives the money , without taking pains to inquire whether the suit is ended or not ; and , thirdly , when he receives it , after the cause is ended , as a gratuity . Without denying that he himself comes under the last two heads , he unqualifiedly asserts that the first only is involved in moral guilt . His denial of being guilty of direct bribery , on a memorandum which seems intended for his own private use , * without a denial of having received money from his suitors , under other circumstances , is a strong implied admission of the fact . Yet , Mr. Dixon , strange as it appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence which lie has discovered of Lord Bacon 's innocence . What conduct is this on the part of a judge ? What right has he to receive money from a party to a suit , which either is pending before him , whether known to him or not , or which he has already decided ? What consideration , other than a corrupt , or , at least , an immoral one , can there possibly be for the re // ceipt of such money ? If the case is still pending , though without his notice at the time , can he forget when he comes to make the decision , that he is under an honorary obligation to one of the parties ? If the money is not received till after the decision is made , what consideration is there for it , unless it is some favor which the prevailing party supposes has been shown to him by the judge , or the purchase in advance of his good will in some future litigation ? What chance of success would a poor man have in a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge that a decision in favor of the latter would be followed by some valuable gift , while one in favor of the former would be a source of no pecuniary benefit , and at the same time probably would incur the enmity of a man of influence ? Mr. Dixon tries hard , but in vain , to give the presents , which he admits the Chancellor took , the nature of fees . But the attempt is too glaringly absurd to require a refutation . Bacon also virtually acknowledged his guilt , by addressing a jesuitical appeal to the peers , containing what could be taken to be a confession or not , according to circumstances , and suggesting that they might regard it as sufficient to justify them in depriving him of his office without any further punishment . Finding , however , that this would not answer his purpose , he , as a last resort , sent what he himself styled " The Confession and humble Submission of me to Lord Chancellor . " It is doubtful whether , in the whole history of judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt was ever made . The force of it is materially strengthened by the fact that no man understood the meaning of language or the law of evidence better than he . When , therefore , he concludes by saying , " Upon advised consideration of the charge , descendina in*to my conscience , and calling my memory to account , so far as I am able , I do plainly and ingenuously confess that I am guilty of corruption , and do renounce all defense , and put myself upon the grace and mercy of your Lordships " - who can doubt his guilt ? The fullness of the confession seems to have struck the peers with astonishment , and led them to doubt whether the docu // ment could be genuine . A committee was therefore appointed to wait upon him , to whose inquiries he exclaimed , with great emotion , " My Lords , it is my act , my hand , my heart . I beseech your Lordships to be merciful to a broken reed . " After such reiterated confessions , by a man fully acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be any rational doubt of his guilt , to the full extent of the charge Yet Mr. Dixon would have us believe that he humbled himself to utter a lie , destructive to his character , for the sake of reducing the extent of his punishment . It is a sufficient answer to this suggestion to say , that a man who would be guilty of such an act to save the loss of property , would not hesitate to resort to accepting bribes to gain it . Judge Edmonds , taking it for granted that such a great man as Lord Bacon must necessarily be a good one , adopts another theory , and labors hard to prove that as Curtius sacrificed himself for the good of his country , so Bacon sacrificed himself for King James . Well might Bacon , if he could have foreseen this suggestion , have exclaimed , save me from my friends ! We know nothing that presents his conduct in a more contemptible light . St. Paul says , " Peradventure for a good man , some would even dare to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man would ever sacrifice himself for a fool and a tyrant . Dixon and Edmonds would have both saved themselves the trouble of attempting to establish theories , which no sound minded man would ever adopt , if they had simply regarded Bacon as they would any other man , and supposed him capable of speaking his real sentiments . Mr. Dixon and Judge Edmonds both take pains to bring prominently to view the subsequent assertions of innocence made by Bacon after his fall , leaving their readers , who are not familiar with rules of evidence , to draw the inference that he was not guilty . Such a course was unworthy of the legal science and judicial experience of at least the learned Judge . What would he have said to a prisoner , who , having been convicted on his own deliberate confession in the presence of the Court , had objected to a sentence of punishment on the ground that he was innocent ? // It is worthy of notice , that all the vices of Lord Bacon 's character were homogeneous , and the proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the procurement of office will naturally be followed by the prostitution of it to unworthy ends , and the corruption of it for the sake of gain . Bacon 's moral character had at least the merit of consistency . There is one act in the life of Lord Bacon for which lie is severely censnred both by Macaulay and Lord Campbell , but commended by Dixon , regarding which we are satisfied that lie is right and they are unjust . Bacon owed his advancement as much , in all probability , to the bold and unwearied efforts of the Earl of Essex , as to any other cause . That generous nobleman had shown himself a true and sincere friend . After his headstrong rashness had made him a traitor , Bacon was called upon by the Queen to assist in prosecuting him for the treason , and he complied with the request , and undoubtedly aided in procuring a conviction . For this conduct , the authors , to whom we have referred , charge him with the grossest ingratitude , . and insi*t that he ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to have appeared against one who had been his patron . We can not give our assent to this view of the duty of a couiiselor at law , especially when called upon professionally to support the government . His paramount obligation , we say , is to his country . Treason absolves a man from all the bonds by which friendship or gratitude have united him with the traitor . Suppose the present Attorney General of the United States had owed his present position to the influence of Jefferson Davis . If an opportunity should present itself of indicting the Head of the IRebellion , would lie be required , by any sentiment of gratitude-indeed , would lie be called upon by any principle of honor , to abandon his position , and deprive his country of hi* services on such an occasion * Bacon may have been , as he is charged , governed by mere selfishness in turning agaimist his friend , lie may have goiie beyond what was required of him in the managemerit of the prosecution , although of this we find but slight evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by // a sense of duty , it is uncharitable and unjust to ascribe his actions to unworthy motives . We turn with satisfaction from the contemplation of such a character , however much we may admire his intellectual powers , and however grateful we may be to him for his gifts to the cause of science , to one , whose mental abilities were much inferior , but whose moral character was above reproach . Lord Coke , we are free to admit , was penurious , a failing which was more excusable then , when preferment and influence depended so much on the possession of wealth , than it would be now . He was harsh and overbearing , a natural accompaniment of his conscious superiority in his profession , and he was selfopinionated and conceited , a not unusual failing of those who are regarded and treated by their associates as oracles . But he still was steadfast and immovable in the maintainance of what he believed to be the right . It ought not to be expected that such a toad-eater , as Mr. Dixon was designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity of such rough independence of thought and action , as characterized that noble specimen of humanity , whom it seems to be one principal design of his work to depreciate and denounce . He reiterates over and over again the charge of avarice , yet he admits that Coke made all his money by the labors of his profession , and by his rigid economy , and not , as did the hero of his romance , by subserviency and bribery . Both aspired to offices of high distinction , and both obtained them , but by very different means . In their day , there were two ways of obtaining officeone through the favor , and the other through the fears of the monarch ,  --  one by gratifying his wishes , and the other by obtaining the confidence of the people . Bacon depended on the former , and Coke on the latter . Bacon obtained office by fawning and promises , Coke by demanding it as a matter of right , and threatening the consequences of a refusal . That Coke never would stoop to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bacon 's own letters , in which he repeatedly warned King James of the danger to his prerogative if he ever conferred much power upon his rival . In one instance he wrote to the king , apparently apologizing // for his treatment of Lord Coke , " I was sometimes sharp , it may be too much , but it was with the end to have your Majesty 's will performed , " evidently implying that his antagonist was resisting the king 's pleasure . At another time , Bacon wrote to the king with reference to Lord Coke , showing at the same time his own subserviency and his adversary 's firmness , " I am omnibus omnia for your majesty 's service ; but he ( Coke ) is by nature unsocial , and by habit popular , " ( that is , a friend of the people ) , " and too old now to take a new ply . " lie was a true patriot . His devotedness to the common law of England increased his attachment to the country in which alone it prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots strike the deeper into the soil , the more it is twisted by storms . He loved the people of England , and was always the champion of their rights , in opposition to the encroachments of royal power . He manifested this by his course in the House of Commons ; by his carrying through it the Petition of IRight , one of the great safeguards of liberty ; and by that noble refusal to which we have referred , to pledge himself in advance to allow any interference by the king in the administration of justice , although he must have known that by so doing he was almost sure to lose the highest object of his ambition . It is an unfortunate time to bring forward , in this country at least , the political and moral example of Lord Bacon for the admiration and imitation of the American people , and to hold up the stern and rigid characteristics of Lord Coke , as objects of ridicule and reproof . We have suffered quite enough from hypocritical office seekers , and ravenous office holders . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buchanan and Floyd , not to name that son of New England who has made the cheeks of the descendants of the Pilgrims burn with shame , of each of whom , when found in places of honor and trust , it might be said , as of the worm in the fable , when found on the topmost branch of a lofty tree , he crawled there . Well is it for the citizens of this great republic , that occasionally one may be found of whom it may be said as of // Abdiel , " among the faithless , faithful only he ; " a few such men as Dickinson and bit , who , like Lord Coke , are governed by principle and not by interest , and who are as ready to resist the demands of a dominant party , when opposed to the rights of the people , as he was to resist the demands of an arbitrary sovereign . If Coke , overcome by the pernicious influence of Bacon , had tamely yielded , and thereby secured for himself that seat which was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , there is no certainty that England would not now have been under a rule as despotic as that of Anstrian tyranny , or that any Pilgrims would ever have planted the seed of liberty in the soil of America . If Dickinson and bolt , and their noble compeers , had sacrificed their principles at the shrine of party , there is a strong probability that the American government , if sustained at all , would have lost its most essential element , and would have been a hissing and a byword , instead of a glory among the nations of the earth . No arithmetic is sufficient to calculate the amount of evil , which in the course of centuries may be done by the omissions and commissions of such a gigantic time-serving politician as Bacon ; no human intellect can comprehend the extent of blessings that may be heaped , not only on a single nation , but upon the whole family of nations , by the acts and example of such a noble champion of the right as Coke . Honor then to whom honor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreath around the imperishable column erected to the umemnory of Lord Bacon , for the unspeakable benefits which he has conferred upon it , but let no one , especially let no American , hold him up as an example , either of integrity or patriotism
