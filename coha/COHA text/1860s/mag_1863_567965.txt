ARTICLE 111. - REPLY TO PROFESSOR PARKER . Boston Post , Nov. 29 , Dec. 8 , 12 , 20 , 27 , 1862-Jan. 3 , and Feb. 18 , 1863 . Letters to the Rev. LEONARD BACON , ID . D. , New Haven , Conn . To THE HON. JOEL PARKER , LL . D. , Royal Professor of Law in Harvard College , Cambridge , Mass . Sm ,  --  If the seven letters which yon have addressed to me in the columns of a Boston newspaper , had been digested into a pamphlet addressed directly to the public , I might have criticized it in the humble capacity of a reviewer without regarding the debate as in any sense a personal one between you and me ; or I might have been silent without seeming to confess that your strictures on a newspaper article from my pen are unanswerable , or to deem them unworthy of notice . But your letters , as they lie before me , are in the nature of a challenge to a personal debate . Either I must reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely silent ; and if I am silent after such a challenge , that will of course be construed as meaning either that I have no respectful opinion of your letters , or that I dare not attempt a reply . The conductors of the New Englander have therefore conceded to me the privilege of answering your letters by a review in the form of a letter to their author . When I speak of a personal debate , I do not use that word " personal ' * as implying any departure from the rules of controversial courtesy . I do not complain of your letters in that respect ; nor do I intend that you shall have any reason to complain of my answer . Yet I may be allowed to say , at the outset , that you are , and I am not , a professional lawyer ; that having held a high judicial office , and being now a Professor in the Law School of Harvard College , you have attained an enviable eminence in your profession ; and that therefore your opinions on the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , may be expected to have with at least a large part of the public , an authority which mine can not have . It gives me pleasure to say farther , that unless I am misinformed , ypu have done yourself honor , both as a lawyer and as a citizen , by repudiating the gross iniquity and chicanery of the Dred Scott decision , and all the policy of President Buchanan 's administration in regard to slavery ; that you have been uncompromisingly opposed to the extension of slavery and to its existence in any territory of the Union ; and that your opposition to President Lincoln 's administration began in an unfortunate attempt so lately as last autumn to organize a party in Massachusetts , which should at once sustain the President and defeat the rei4ection of Senator Sumner . There are disloyal men in the loyal states-men whose sympathies are with the rebellion more than with the government-men who hold that the moral and political opposition to slavery which characterizes the free-labor states is opposition to the Constitution and the Union , and that therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part a crime-men who seem to have hardly any other conception of the Constitution than that it was instituted for the purpose of guaranteeing and nationalizing the institution of African slavery . Having no respect for these men , or for any of them , high or low in position , I am happy to be assured that you are not one of them . Without farther preface , I proceed to the questions which you have invited me to discuss with you . The first of these questions , you will allow me to say , requires a more accurate statement than you have given . Your statement of the question is such  --  or rather , your various statements are so discordant-that I am at a loss to know whether there is really any disagreement between us about it , or what the proposition is which one of us maintains and the - oth&amp;r denies . You begin with the announcement that you have undertaken to perform " a duty which some one owes to the profession of the law and to the community generally ; " *and you describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of vindicating the right of the gentlemen of the Bar to form their opinions upon legal subjects , and especially upon the construction of the Constitution of the United States , and to express those opinions in any manner consistent with due courtesy to others , without being subjected to censure , sneers , abuse , and vituperation , by a class of clergymen who assume to know more of constitutional law than the tribunals and officers created and constituted for the purpose of discussing and determining legal questions . " Is this your statement of the point on which you expect me to join issue with you * If so , there is no dispute between us . The right which you have undertaken to assert for " the gen tiemen of the Bar " is cheerfully conceded ; and if the right needs to be vindicated , I am as ready as you are to vindicate it against all comers . As for the " class of clergymen who assume to know more of constitutional law than the tribunals and officers created and constituted for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , nor will I undertake to defend them . After expatiating a little on this statement , you put the question in a somewhat different way : - " If the clergy really have the best set of rules by which to determine our constitutional rights and duties . " Allow me to say that on this question I have no dispute with you . I have never pretended that clergymen , whose professional business is to expound the documents of our religion , have any better rules , or any other rules , for the interpretation of documents , than the rules which are prescribed to your profession for the interpretation of written laws and constitutions . What other clergymen may have said or implied , is no concern of mine , inasmuch as I have never made myself responsible for them . Should you be able to discover a clergyman who says that the " clero ' " have other and better rules of interpretation than those which are recognized in your prot*ssion , I shall accept the fact as proof of what needs no proof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little further , I find still another statement of the question . After admitting " that among the lawyers themselves there is a difference of opinion upon various questions of constitutional law , " you say ,  --  " But that is not at all material to the present inquiry , which has no reference // to the differences of construction by different lawyers , but is whether clergymen are entitled to pass final judgment , and overrule any and all lawyers with whom they differ on such subjects . " Do you really think , my dear Sir , that this is the question between you and me ? When you made that statement of the question , did you mean to pretend that , either explicitly or by any implication , I have claimed in behalf of clergymen the right " to pass final judgment " on questions of constitutional law ? But what else could you mean , if you considered at all the force of the words you were writing ? Surely you must have had a very contemptuous opinion of my understanding , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced to discuss such a question with you or with anybody else . The occasion on which you have challenged me to this debate , was an article which was published in the Congregationalist of October 31st , and which the editor of that journal took the liberty of announcing as mine . In that article not one word was said concerning the rights or prerogatives of clergymen-not one word having the remotest allusion to the clerical profession . I wrote not as a clergyman but anonymously , and the mention of my name by the editor was neither intended by me nor expected . How is it , then , that you undertake to raise upon that article an issue between the clerical profession and the legal ? I respectfully deny your right to demand that I shall defend any proposition for which I have not made myself directly or indirectly responsible , or shall discuss with you in this public manner any question not germane to the matter of that article . For the sake of showing more distinctly how wide of the mark your aim is , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more calmly and accurately than you seem to have done , all that portion of my newspaper article which can be regarded as having any relation to this first question , whatever it may be . The President 's " great proclamation " of September 22d , was the subject on which I ventured to offer some observations from my own point of view . After showing first that the President had not been coerced into that great measure , against his own judgment , by the importunity of self constituted // advisers ; secondly , that the necessity for it had become , in my view , obvious to all who care more for the Constitution and the Union than for slavery ; and , thirdly , that the proclamation marks a definite stage in the progress of the war , I touched another topic in these words : " Concerning the constitutional power of the President to issue such a proclamation , I have no shadow of a doubt . I am aware that some lawyers have undertaken to argue from the Constitution , against the right of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But though a hundred lawyers should undertake to convince me that the government is restrained by the Constitution from defending its own existence in a civil war , or that there is any one of the rights of a belligerent which it may not exercise in the territory of a state which has rejected the Constitution , and made war upon the Union , they can never impose that absurdity upon me , nor upon any man who is not willing to abnegate his own common sense in favor of somebody else 's professional sense . I have a great respect for lawyers in their place , but I must be permitted to remember that lawyership is not the same thing with statesmanship ; and to insist that the Constitution of the United States , like the Bible , is to be interpreted by the common sense of the people . I find that the inaugural oath of the President , as prescribed in that document , binds him to the duty , not merely of supporting , like all other officers of government , but of preserving , protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ability . I find that the Constitution , in order that he may perform his oath , makes him " Commander-in-chief of the army and navy . " I find that though Congress has the right to declare war , the President alone has the right to make war . To my common sense , the right and the duty to make war against the enemies of the United States , be they foreigners or rebels , involves , or rather is the right and the duty of conquering and crushing them by every legitimate method of war . Has the President a right by the Constitution , and is it his duty , to wage war in South Carolina-has he a right , and is it his duty to bombard cities , to burn villages , to cut down groves and forests , to obstruct harbors , to turn rivers from their channels , and to mow down regiments of men in battle , when these measures are necessary to a speedy and thorough conquest-has he a right to do all this in defiance of the only government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a right to proclaim that , after a certain day , unless the people of that state shall in the meantime reestablish a state government under . the Federal Constitution , no distinction shall be recognized among them but the distinction between friends and enemies of the United States , and that every friend , whatever his former condition , shall be recognized and protected as a freeman ? Shame on the law-logic which undertakes to mystify our common sen*e ! Admit that slaves are property , ( though the Constitution does not know them in any other character than that of persons ' ) , what then ? Is there any preilminent sacredness in that particular kind of property ? If the President , or a military commander , acting by his authority , may seize private property , when needed for military purposes-if he may take cotton , provisions , forage , horses , and all sorts of cattle , from the loyal as well as // the disloyal-giving to loyal owners an assurance of indemnity hereafter ; may he not also take this property with a like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion of all that property from private ownership to the use and service of the United States , by a proclamation of freedom to the slaves , is necessary , as a means of crushing the enemy , then that is just the thing which he must do , or violate his oath to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . ' " What then is my offense ? It is not that I have denied " the right of the gentlemen of the Bar to form their opinions upon legal subjects , and especially upon the Constitution of the United States , and to express their opinion in any manner consistent with due courtesy to others . " It is not that in behalf of the clergy , or as a clergyman , I have pretended to have a better " set of rules by which to determine our constitutional rights and duties " than lawyers have . It is not that I have claimed for the clergy the prerogative of F ' passing final judgment " on questions of constitutional interpretation . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion that I am a clergyman . Surely you need not be told that in relation to any question of jurisprudence to be decided by a court , von are the professional elericus , and I am simply a layman . All my offense is , that being in the language of your profession a layman , I have claimed for myself , in common with all citizeus , the right of private judgment concerning the meaning of the Constitution , and that , in exercising my right of private judgment , I have dared to reject the opinion , not of all lawyers , but of " some lawyers , " concerning the powers which the Constitution permits the President to wield against the enemies of the United States . The study and practice of your profession tends , or should tend , to exactness in the statement of a disputed proposition or question . If a student in your office , being entrusted with the task of drawing a declaration for the plaintiff or a plea for the defendant in a civil action , should miss the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise an issue between yourself and me , about the mutual relations of your profession and mine , I think he would receive a severe rebuke . Should I attempt to state the case for you , when you have so greatly failed in stating it for yourself , I might expose myself // to the charge of presumption . Without undertaking to do in form what I think you ought to have done , I will venture to make a or two leadino* in that direction . suggestion Evidently you were displeased that I , not being a lawyer , and being a clergyman , have professed to think for myself on a certain question of constitutional interpretation , and have published an opinion confessedly differing from that of " some lawyers , " among whom ( though I had no thought of you , and almost no knowledge of you , at the time ) you happen to be included . Allow me to say that you might have saved yourself some trouble if you had more carefully considered the ground of your displeasure before you began to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the considerations which I offered in support of it ; what is the principle which I violated , and which you are called to vindicate ? Is it that your profession has exclusive rights which I have invaded by thinking for myself , and saying what I think ? Or is it that my profession divests me of rights which are common to all other citizens ? Let me suggest , respectfully , that in taking occasion from the paragraph above cited , to raise an issue between " the gentlemen of the Bar " and " the clergy , " you ought to have taken your position frankly upon one or the other of these two principles , or upon both . Do you hold that when all citizens are enquiring what the President may do , and what he may not do to save the Union and the nation from being destroyed by this rebellion , no man who is not a lawyer has any right to difier in opinion from any man who is a lawyer ? Or , do you hold that though other citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such questions , the fact of my being a clergyman divests me of that right ? The paragraph , which I have quoted , is all that I said about the constitutional right of the President to issue his great proclamation . It is the only paragraph in which I made any allusion to lawyers ; for the other aspects and bearings of the proclamation involve no legal question . The question , for example , whether the President from the beginning of the war , has always intended to adopt this extreme measure if he should // find it impossible otherwise to suppress the rebellion , is no more a question of jurisprudence than it is a question of medicine or theology . The question whether the President was right or wrong in thinking that the time had come for this extreme measure , and that the attempt to restore the Constitution and the Union without recognizing the manhood of the enslaved population held in subjection by the enemies of the United States had been kept up till its futility was sufficiently demonstrated , is not a question on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the opinion of an expert . Nor is the question whether the proclamation marks a definite stage of progress in the prosecution of the war , ( if there be any doubt on the point ) , a law question . You seem to have an inkling of a distinction between the question whether the proclamation is expedient and necessary as a measure of hostility against the belligerent enemies of the United States , and the question whether ( its expediency and necessity being admitted ) it transcends the constitutional powers of the President , and violates his inaugural oath ; and yet you apply , as a personal reproach to yourself , not only what I said about " some lawyers " who hold that the President has no power to proclaim the emancipation of persons held in slavery by the belligerent enemies of the United States , but also what I said about a certain class of politicians and demagogues , who pretend that peace can be obtained , and the Union restored by our continuing to make war against the rebels with only one hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their unceasing war with their millions of slaves . A few words of explanation on this point are due to your feelings . I offer then , for your relief , this explanation . First . In all that I wrote , I had no thought of you either as a politician or as a lawyer . Much as it may be to my disadvantage , I must confess that I had no knowledge of yonr antipathies and sympathies , or your views concerning the proclamation ; and that if I had been asked , Who is the colleague of Prof Parsons in the Law School at Cambridge , my memory might not have enabled me to answer . Secondly . When you say that I brand " all lawyers , and all others who do not concur // with me in having no doubt concerning the EIGHT to issue the proclamation , " and that I charge them " with disloyalty , ' debasing homage to slavery , ' and with an intent to divide the Union or subvert the Constitution , " ' you are entirely mistaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I had in view , and whom I denounced as " in fact disloyal to the Constitution , " remains unchanged . A moment 's thought will tell you who they are . You know who the men are " who have so long paid a debasing homage to slavery for the sake of saving the Union ' that they are now willing to sacrifice the Union for the sake of saving slavery- " They are the men who at this moment are talking in New York and New Jersey , in Illinois and Indiana , in Pennsylvania and Kentucky , about a reconstruction of the Union with New England left out . They are the men who at this moment are plotting and moving for a compromise with the perjured and bloody traitors that rule the rebellion . It was to that sort of men that I had reference when I expressed my conviction that they " expect nothing else and intend nothing else than some concession to the rebels , which shall either divide the Union or subvert the Constitution . " I may have occasion to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present it is enough to admit , frankly , that if there are men endowed with an ordinary share of common sense , who deny the necessity of the military policy inaugurated by the proclamation , and " talk about bringing the war to an end in some other way , " and who at the same time do not expect either a recognized division of the Union or the restoration of it by the concession of new guarantees to slavery against freedom ,  --  I was mistaken . You seem to be sensitive about my saying that " I have a great respect for lawyers in their place " but must nevertheless " be permitted to remember that lawyership is not the same thing with statesmanship , and to insist that the Constitution of the United States , like the Bible , is to be interpreted by the common sense of the people . " What is the place of a lawyer ? He may be a judge , and then his place is on the bench , applying the law to the individual cases , civil and criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may // be a professor of law , and then his place is in the chair of instruction , giving lectures , hearing recitations , initiating his pn ; pils into the science of law , and training them for the profession . If he is neither judge nor professor , his place is in his office , giving advice to clients and drawing law papers , or at the bar conducting and arguing the causes which are entrusted to him . That is what IL mean when I say that I have a great respect for lawyers in their place . I honor the profession . I have no sympathy with any vulgar prejudice against it . I recognize it as indispensable to the administration of justice in society , and inseparable from the working of a government in which the rights of property and person are protected by law . I honor the illustrious names of the great lawyers who have adorned the profession by their abilities and their virtues . At the same time my personal acquaintance with lawyers , eminent on the bench or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such stndies and pnrsuits as theirs are an invaluable discipline , morally as well as intellectually . So much for the respect that is due to lawyers in their place . A lawyer , then , is in his place when he is attending to his professional business in the courts or in his office ; just as a clerygymen or a physician is in his place when p*rforining the duties of his profession . Bnt when a lawyer meddles with public affairs , with questions of political economy or of national policy-that is , with questions of statesmanship , he is not less ont of his place as a lawyer , than a physician who meddles with the same questions is out of his place as a physician . Statesmanship , whether as a science or as an art , instead of being exclusively within the domain of yonr profession , is wholly outside of it-just as it is wholly outside of the medical profession . Of course , I do not mean that when a man becomes a lawyer , he loses his right to think and to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean is , that his right to think and speak on public affairs belongs to him not as a lawyer but as a citizen ; and that , therefore , the physician , the civil engineer , the schoolmaster , or college professor , the merchant , the manufacturer , the farmer , and even the clergyman , being citizens as well as he , have precisely the same right . // Lawyers are an intelligent class ; their professional knowledge , and the discipline of their professional studies and pursuits , qualify them to bear an important part in the discussion of public questions ; but other men are also intelligent , and may contribute something , each from his own stand-point , to a wise and safe decision of questions in which all are interested . Even if I should concede that in this democratic country lawyers as a class are more likely than any other class to have the special knowledge and training which qualify a man for statesmam. ship , I can not forget that some disadvantages , as well as many advantages in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that profession . Your profession , as well as mine , has its infirmities , its technical ways of thinking , its narrow traditions , its superstitious deference to formulas ; and these must be thrown off before the mere lawyer can become a true statesman . You have not forgotten what Burke said of Grenville : " He was bred in a profession . He was bred to the law , which is , in my opinion , one of the first and noblest of human sciences , a science which does more to quicken and invigorate the understanding , than all the other kinds of learning put together , but it is not apt , except in persons very happily born , to open and liberalize the mind exactly in the same proportion . " " ' Nor can you have failed to note what he said of lawyers on another occasion : " Lawyers , I know , can not make the distinction for which I contend , because they have their strict rule to go by . But legislators ought to do what lawyers can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great principles of reason and equity and the general sense of mankind . These they are buund to obey and follow ; and rather to enlarge and enlighten law by the liberality of legislative reason , than to fetter and bind their higher capacity by the narrow constructions of subordinate artificial justice . " f So much for the difference between lawyership and statesmanship . You admit " that among the lawyers themselves there is a difference of opinion upon various questions of constitutional law . " Indeed the fact was too notorious to be overlooked , that , on this very question concerning the constitutional power // of the President , you are at variance with lawyers whose eminence in the profession is equal to yours . Why , then , have not I the same right to dissent from you that you have to dissent from President Lincoln , who , as you know , is an eminent lawyer , and from Attorney-General Bates , who is , professionally , more eminent still , and from the multitude of eminent lawyers in Congress and in all the loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure announced in the Proclamation is legitimate in the present condition of the country ? You make no reply , that I have heard of , to the exhaustive argument of Mr. Whiting. * Why not ? Why pour out your seven vials of reply upon so slight a thing as a newspaper article from a Connecticut clergyman ? You forego " The joy which warriors feel In foemen worthy of their steel , " that you may stoop to an argument with me . Why ? I can see no other reason than that you deem it quite tolerable for lawyers to differ among themselves on the meaning of the Constitution , and qnite intolerable for a man who is not a lawyer , or at least for a clergyman , to differ in opinion on the same subject from any man who is a lawyer . What , then , am I to do ? As a citizen and elector I have responsibilities of which I can not divest myself . I share in the sovereignty not only of my own state but of the United States . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an elector I must vote to sustain or condemn the administration in its conduct of the war . But if there is no right of private judgment on the meaning of the Constitution-if I , being not a lawyer but a clergyman , have no right to differ in opinion from any man who is a lawyer-I am in a predicament in which God , I am sure , never intended to put any responsible creature . Under the obligation of an oath , as sacred as that of a juror , I must either sustain the administration or condemn it on this very issue of its conformity to the Constitution ; and yet , inas * The TVar Power8 of the President , and the Legislative Powers of Congress in relation to Rebellion , Treason , ani Slavery . By WILLIAM WrnTING . Boston : John L. Shorey. // much as I am not a lawyer but a clergymen , I must not differ in opinion from any man who is a lawyer . I can not adopt your opinion , for in that case I shall differ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bates , the Attorney-General , and from President Lincoln , and from all the lawyers in the cabinet , and from many sagacious , learned , and upright lawyers with whom I am personally acquainted . I can not adopt their opinion , for in that case I shall differ from you , and I know not how many more , whose professional learning and integrity I would not disparage . Shall I retain a lawyer as my constitutional adviser , and " go it blind " under his direction ? But even in that case must I not first exercise my private judgment , and then choose for the director of my conscience some lawyer whose construction of the Constitution I know to be sound ? Such are some of the absurdities into which we are led by the principle that none but lawyers may interpret the Constitution for themselves . In opposition to that principle I assert the sacred and inalienable right of private judgment . The denial of that right in respect to the interpretation of the Bible establishes the priesthood as a spiritual aristocracy , and tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the denial of that right in respect to the interpretation of the Constitution sets up a political hierarchy of lawyers , and tends to subvert the Constitution itself . Let it be universally conceded that the people , when called to pronounce their verdict on the measures of the government , must not judge for themselves what their rights are , and their duties , but must exercise their political power under the dictation of " the gentlemen of the Bar "  --  and instead of the Constitution we have only the ever-accumulating tradition of hierarchical or professional interpretations . The men who in our Saviour 's time were wont to say , " This people , who knoweth not the law , are cursed , " denying to the laity the power of judging for themselves , were none other than the men who had made the word of God of none effect through their tradition . When the law of Moses had been given into the hands of a professional class to be interpreted by them exclusively and authoritatively , the result // was that n9t the sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gemara , became the rule from which there was no appeal . As firmly as I believe that the chief security , under God , for the continued life of the Christian religion revealed and recorded in the Bible , is in the people 's right of private judgment , ever subjecting the authority of dogmas and traditions to the higher and primitive authority of the scriptures ; so firmly do I believe that the chief security , under God , for the system of popular self-government established by the Constitution is in the people 's right of private judgment , bringing Dred Scott decisions , and everything else of that sort , to the review of that higher tribunal where the Constitution , in the last appeal , is interpreted by the people 's common sense and enforced by the people 's power of choosing their own public servants . You are at liberty to instruct the people if you can , and to enlighten and guide their common sense ; but your liberty in this respect is also mine . Intelligent theologians , of all Protestant names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any honest attempt of laymen to interpret for themselves the documents of our religion . We , of the clerical profession , have learned that religious and theological knowledge ( the specialty of our profession ) may be sometimes advanced by the studies and publications of men who have never been taught by theological professors , and on whom no ordaining hands were ever laid . We have learned to be thankful rather than angry , when intelligent and earnest men whose training and habits have not qualified them for the pulpit , and whose discourses , if they should attempt to preach , would have no special charm or power for popular assemblies , interest themselves in the discussion of religions and theological questions . Few professional theologians , within the last half century , have done more for the science of religion , by their writings , than has been done by those two great lay teachers , Coleridge and Isaac Taylor . And is it not possible that an intelligent and honest man who is not a professional lawyer may sometimes have sense enough to be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some great principle of jurisprudence , on which some lawyers , by // reason of their bondage to precedents , and their technical ways of thinking , have erred ? John Hampden was not a lawyer ; but he knew what English law was , on one point , better than a majority of the twelve judges of England . Granville Sharp was not a professional lawyer , but he had the sagacity which enabled him to deduce from the elements of English jurisprudence the great principle that slavery can not exist in England-a principle which the lawyers themselves had not discovered till he taught them . While I maintain that the Constitution of the United States is a document not for lawyers only but for the people , and is therefore to be interpreted , ultimately , by the people 's common sense , I freely admit that in some passages of that great instruinent there are words and phrases which belong rather to the technical dialect of English jurisprudence than to our common English tongue , and which require , therefore , some technical knowledge in the interpretation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law dictionary , or some such authority , to tell him what is meant by " the writ of habeas corpus , " and what is meant by " the privilege " of that writ ; but , having obtained a sufficient answer to those two questions , he can see for himself the meaning of the constitutional provision that " the privilege of the writ of habeas corpns shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . " So he may not know what a " bill of attainder " is , till he has obtained the information from somebody versed in legal technicalities ; and possibly he may not know what an " ex post facto law " is , till he has inquired of the schoolmaster or of some intelligent neighbor ; but , having learned the meaning of those phrases , he needs no lawyer to tell him what the Constitution means by saying that " no bill of attainder or e* post facto law shall be passed . " There is one sentence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law . " The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason ; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood , or forfeiture , except during the life of the person attainted . " What is aim " attainder of treason ? " What is " corruption of blood ? " // What is " forfeiture , " when used in such a connection ? What is the meaning of the verb " attaint " ? Both houses of Congress are full of lawyers , but , strangely enongh , on this one sentence which it is their business to interpret , the lawyers were at fault . I can not but suspect that the ablest men of your profession are among those who do not go to Congress . I-Tad you been there in 1862 , you surely could have told the conscript fathers that the limitation on the power of Congress to declare the punishment of treason had no other purpose than to exclude from our national legislation that principle of the English common law which punishes the convicted and sentenced traitor by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punislirn cut , and which not only punishes him personally by the forfeiture of his life and of all his actual possessions , but punishes them also by the forfeiture of whatever might afterwards have descended to them as his heirs . The statesmen who framed the Constitution understood right well the penalties of treason under the English law , for the time had been when they were deeply interested in that subject . For reasons which they had learned to appreciate , they determined that , under the Constitution which they were framing , there should be no place for that theory or fiction of the common law by which the tincture , taint , or attainder of treason works corruption of blood with all its incidents and consequences ; and that under no other pretense should the innocent heirs of a convicted and sentenced traitor be hindered from inheriting through him or from him . Therefore they provided not only that there should be no corruption of blood by attainder of treason , but also that no attainder of treason should work the forfeiture of any property other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life time . No attainder of tm*eason , under the Constitution and laws of the United States , an " extend to the disinheriting of any heir nor to the prejudice of any person other than the traitor himself . " Yet the lawyers in Congress seem not to have known distinctly the meaning of this proviso . Having enacted a new statute for the puni*hmeut of treason , they seem to have feared that it was not quite constitutional , and they supplemented it with *n expla*matory resolution . They took a distinction , unwar // LOU 0 . Reply to Profes8or Parker . 207 ranted by the text of the Constitution , between real estate and personal ; and though their statute requires an absolute forfeiture and sale of property in certain cases , their supplementary explanation provides that no punishment or proceedings under the statute shall be so construed as to " work forfeiture of the real estate of the offender beyond his natural life. *** The Constitution , then , is to be interpreted by common sense , and ultimately by the common sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a law phrase , we may ask lawyers to tell us what the meaning of those words is , or rather what it was when the Constitutiou was framed , but when we know what those few technical words mean , the meaning of the Constitution , in what it requires and in what it forbids , in what it cedes and in what it withholds , is as intelligible to one intelligent man as to another . The rules and principles of interpretation which you quote from Blackstone and from Story are rules and principles with which every clergyman well educated in his own profession is thoroughly familiar ; for they are essentially the same with those which in the language of theological seminaries are called the science of Hermeneutics . They are just what I mean when II say that the Constitution is to be interpreted by the people 's common sense , for the science of Hermeneutics , whether for lawyers or for divines , whether applied to the statute book or to the Bible or to any other composition in any human language-is nothing else than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought by which a reader of good common sense ascertains the meaning of what is written or printed on the pa*e before him . It is somewhat remarkable that one of the passages which you have cited from Story , announces the identical proposition on which I insist , to wit , that the Constitution is to be interpreted not by professional subtlety , but by common sense . Allow me to repeat the quotation : " Constitutions are not designed for metaphysical or logical subtleties , for niceties of expression , for critical propriety , for elaborate shades of meaning , or for the exercise of philosophical acuteness , or juridical research . They are instrnmeats of a practical nature , founded on the common business of human life , adapted to common wants , designed for common use , and fitted for common understandings . // The people make them ; the people adopt them ; the people must be supposed to read them , with the help of COMMON SENSE ; and can not be presumed to admit in them any recondite meaning , or any extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient in common sense , and for that reason fall into great mistakes in the interpretation not only of the Constitution but of the Bible , and of whatever else they happen to take in hand . The same thing is true of " some lawyers , " and of some men in every profession . If they blunder , it is not because they are lawyers , or clergymen , or of some other profession , but because they are deficient in common sense . But when a clergyman happens to be thus deficient , he is not thereby divested of his rights as a citizen any more than if he were a lawyer . He may still try to understand the Constitution with such sense as he has ; and his right to say what he thinks about it , is no less sacred than yours . In proportion to the greatness of his deficiency in common sense , his vagaries will be harmless ; for the people who have common sense are not easily imposed upon by individuals who have none . A lawyer with much professional learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely than any clergyman to mislead the people when he misinterprets the Constitution . Such a lawyer would naturally claim , the right to speak as one having authority , and to impose his opinion on the unlearned . The many who never take the trouble to think for themselves are likely to acknowledge his claim , for the reason that he is a lawyer and a learned one , and professes to speak by authority . Just here is a difference which you , perhaps , have not distinctly thought of , between your profession and mine . Lawyers , you know , are accustomed to express their opinions authoritatively , so far as the laity ( that is , the unlearned in the law ) are concerned , and to debate questions of law only among themselves . A client has no occasion to understand the grounds *r reasons of the opinion which his professional adviser gives him concerning a point of law ; he is under the necessity ot trusting his advisers and leaving his cause in their hands . A clergyman , on the contrary  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrines which he propounds . " Search the Scriptures , " is a leading maxim not for // him only , but for his hearers . He expects and exhorts them to try all his statements of doctrine and of duty by the standard of the Bible . We need not wonder then if some clergymen venture to inquire into the grounds and reasons of opinions concerning the meaning of the Constitution , instead of resting simply on the authority of this or that lawyer ; nor , if on the other hand " some lawyers " are impatient of the impertinence , as they deem it , with which many clergymen , in common with many other citizens , distrust and even contradict the interpretations of the Constitution authoritatively set forth by gentlemen of the bar in popular harangues , or in newspaper essays . The lawyer 's studies and his professional practice are continually training him in the intellectual habit of deference to authorities ,  --  by which I mean not only deference to the sovereignty whose will ordains the law , and is recorded in the written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him what the law is . His lucubrations , from the beginning of his studies through his whole course of service at the bar or on the bench , are not exclusively in codes and statute books . The learning of his profession , accumulated in countless volumes , is almost nothing else than a body of traditions , decisions and opinions , resting on the authority of great judges and great lawyers . In the profession of law , therefore , authority is everything . But in the science of theology and religion , as held by Protestants , authority , other than that of the Scriptures , is nothing . Do not understand me as mucaning or implying any disrespect to your profession . I have nothing to say against what Jeremy Bentham used to call " judge-made law . " On the contrary , it is the glory of jurisprudence , both English and American , that because it consists so largely in traditionary rules and principles , in the accumulation of judicial decisions , and in the opinions of great lawyers , it is capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The science of law is common sense ( including the sense of right and wrobg ) applied to the interpretation of statutes and the administration of justice . It must needs advance , therefore , with the progress of civilization . As the common sense of the // people ( including their moral sense ) becomes more intelligent , the law , not only in the form of statutes , but in the form of judicial decisions and precedents , nndergoes a corresponding change . The " judge-made law , " which the chimerical philosopher of Utilitarianism so abhorred , is an inevitable incident of the administration of justice by courts of law , as distinguished from an attempted administration of justice by arbitrary power . At the same time , it is as really a the statute-law , though in a different way , amenable to the moral influences which act upon society . If the course of judicial decisions is iu conflict with the moral sense of the people , and with their common sense , the anomaly can not continue long unless the people are thoroughly enslaved ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no " judge-made law . " Doubtless " some lawyers " are heedless enough to forget this , and to talk as if the interpretation of the Constitution on one point and another were irreversibly " settled " by judicial authority ; but you are not one of that sort . It would be uncourteous if I should suppose it possible for you to forget that a court has no more right or power to make new law in any case tried before it , than it has to make new facts . The duty of judges is not to ordain what the law shall be , but only to declare what the law is ; and if through fear or favor-if under the influence of a bribe , or of some personal or partisan interest-if by reason of their ignorance and intellectual obtuseness , or by reason of their moral perverseness , they declare that to be law which was not law till they declared it , the law remains unchanged . In the case of John Hampden nine of the twelve judges declared unequivocally , after a protracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might lay a certain tax without consent of parliament ; yet everybody knows that in giving such a decision those judges simply declared that to be law which was not law , and that the king 's attempt to levy a tax under the name of ship-money was just as unlawful after that decision as before . So in the case of Dred Scott , a majority of the judges attempted to change the Constitution of the United States by the legerdemain of their " law logic . " J3ut did they change the Constitution ? No , they only violated // the Constitution by turning a poor man out of their court , denying him the justice they were sworn to administer , and consigning him to slavery , under a false pretense . The fact that for that plaintiff spurned from their presence , there was no appeal but to the justice of God , so that the wrong he suffered was without a remne ( ly in this world , can not diminish by one hair-breadth the injustice or the falsehood of the decision . After that decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plain , intelligible document , without the faintest allusion to any distinction of race or complexion among the various classes of the population , ( save when the semi-independent " Indian tribes " are mentioned ) , and with out the remotest implication of the principle which the conspirators ( of whom the Chief Justice was on that occasion the organ ) intended to interpolate into the supreme law of the land . No dishonor , then , is imputed to lawyers for their professional deference to authority , when I insist that the interpretation of the Constitution is not the prerogative of any one class of citizens . All citizens , clergymen not excepted , are to read the Constitution for themselves ; and it is the right of every citizen to inquire what the Constitution means , to receive light on doubtful or disputed points from whatever quarter it may come , and to give out his opinion in conversation or in public discourse , orally or in print . No doubt a learned and experienced lawyer ought to be right . Yet , even so learned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , therefore , in a case in which you are of one opinion , while some clergyman , or some cobbler , ventures to be of a different opinion , it is not only conceivable but possible that your interpretation is wrong , and that of the clergyman or the cobbler right . I find that I have treated this preliminary question about the comparative rights of lawyers and clergymen to interpret the Constitution , more at length , and in a more rambling way , than I intended . Had you been so kind as to state more exactly the position which you hold and the question you desired me to discuss , you would have saved me this trouble . // The operation of " shelling ont the **oods " in which an adversary may , perhaps , be lurking with his masked batteries , is inevitably attended with some waste of ammunition . Proceeding now to the main question , I am relieved of the difficulty which has embarrassed the preliminary discussion . We know what the question is . You maintain , and I deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into effect the proclamation of September 22d , 1862 , has violated the Constitution of the United States . The issue involves these subordinate questions : First , What guarantees and pledges does the Constitution give , and what duties does it impose upon the Federal Government , in relation to slavery in the several states of the Union ? Secondly , What are the powers with which the President is invested , in time of war , against the enemies of the United States ? Thirdly , Is there anything in the Constitution , or in the law of nations , that forbids his using those powers for the suppression of the rebellion ? These three questions seem to comprehend all the points of your argument . I hope that in the discussion , guided as I am by your perspicacity and learning , I shall overlook nothing that is really important to a right conclusion . I. Relations of the Federal Government to Slavery in the several States . It is commonly assumed by a certain class of politicans who have had too much success in their endeavors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact between slaveholding states and free-labor states ; that some distinctive rights-not very well defined but commonly spoken of as " Southern rights " - are secured to the siaveholding states ; that the conservation of slavery is one chief end for which the Federal Govcrnment was instituted ; and that to speak or write against slaver , y is to violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution . You need not be told that all these assniuptions are unwarranted . But as what I am writing is likely to be read by many persons less accurately informed than you , I may be allowed to explain what the Constitution is in its bearings on slavery . 1 . The Constitution makes no mention of slaves or slavery . // It uses no words synonymous with these . It knows nothing of the relation in which one man is the property of another , and is liable in law to all the incidents of property . Nobody , not otherwise informed , would be able to obtain from the language of that charter the conception of a Helot race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , bought and sold like cattle in the market , legally incapable ( as brnte cattle are ) of domestic relations , liable to the infliction of torturing punishment at the caprice of irresponsible power , and compelled to labor without wages *nd with no share in the 1 ) proceeds of their labor . 2 . This omission is the more significant when we remember that , at the date of the Constitution , negro slavery , as above described , existed in a majority of the states ; that in other states it existed under certain modifications restraining its essential barbarism and seenrin * its early extinction ; and that in one state it had been absolutely abolished by the will of the people expressed in a declaration of rights . Of course the omission of the words slave and slavery , and of all synonymons words , from a national ConstitutiQn designed to form " a more perfect union ' * of such states , was not accidental . A critical reader with no information concerning the subsequent course of events , would say that the intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicity with the institution of slavery . The Constitution knows nothing about human beings held as property-men , women , and children , whose legal status is that of merchandise ; and the Government which it established ought to have been equally ignorant . In the iu'tendment of the Federal Constitution all human beings , whatever they may be in the intendinent of state legislation , are not.hing else than per*on* " endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights . " 3 . If there were any need of showing by testimony that not only the omission of the words slave and slavery , and of all synonymous words , from the Constitution , but the exclusion of the idea and definition of slavery wa* intentional on the part of the Convention that framed the Constitution , such testimony is not wanting . The debates in that Convention , as // written down at the time by the diligent hand of James Madison , show that the omission in question was not becanse the Convention was squeamish about the use of disagreeable words , but because the leading members of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , by some circumloention , seem to recognize slaves as property . In one instance , at least , the language of the instrument was modified , after discussion , expressly for the purpose of excluding the possibility of such a construction . ig then , the Constitution recognizes slaves as property ; or , if it recognizes slavery , in distinction from other forms of service , as an arrangement to be upheld at all hazards by the Federal Government , it has a meaning which the framers of it expressly intended it should not have . 4 . This view is confirmed by an examination of the particular clauses sometimes referred to by those who would have us believe that the Constitution recognizes slaves as property and guarantees slavery against all interference . In neither of those clauses are slaves spoken of under the specific denomination of slaves , or the specific description of human beings owned as property ; but in each instance they are included under a more generic description . If the Constitution has occasion to provide that a slave escaping from one state into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given upon the claim of his master , it does not describe the fugitive as a slave , but only as a " person held to service or labor "  --  a description which includes the apprentice , the redemptioner , and the peon , as well as the slave . Nor does it speak of the master as the owner of a stray chattel , but only as " the party to whom such service or labor may be due "  --  a description which makes the relation between the fugitive and the claimant the relation of a debt , to be paid not in money but in personal service . If the Constitution has occasion to arrange and define a compromise between the apportionment of representatives and direct taxes among the several States according to their pro88 population , and the apportionment according to theirfree population , it says nothing about slaves , but comprehends them under the general description of persons who // are neither free nor held to service for a term of years ,  --  a description which includes peonage and the condition of peasants adscripti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every application of it , is far from implying that the " persons " described are regarded as property . If the Constitution has occasion to define the date at which the Federal Government shall be invested with full power for the suppression of the African slavetrade , it speaks not of the slave-trade nor of Africa , but of " the migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing may think proper to admit ; " and every word which it employs is just as applicable to free emigrants from any European or Asiatic country as it is to slaves from Africa . 5 . There is no room then to misunderstand the anim*ns of the Constitution in regard to slavery . Not only does that * reat charter of our Government avoid all recognition of slavery as distinguished from service for wages under the obligation of a voluntary contract ; but it expressly stigmatizes all systems and methods of servitude in which the obli6 ation to service is not for a definite terur of years , by providing that such a population , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , shall be reckoned as worth to the commonwealth only three-fifths of what they would be if they were free or had a sure and definite expectation of freedom . Thus it holds forth to every state containing such a population a standing offer that whenever the state shall have abolished its system of servitude , or shall have limited by " a term of years " the personal servitude of all who , by its laws , are held to service , it shall be permitted to represent in Congress , and in the Electoral Colleges , not three-fifths only , but five-fifths of that heretofore degraded population . Instead of the theory so common among vulgar politicians  --  the theory incorporated into the Dred Scott decision-namely , that the Constitution abhors a free negro , and regards slavery as the normal condition of the African race-we have the palpable fact that in the estimate of the Constitution the conversion of a negro slave into a free negro adds forty per cent . to his value as related to the wealth and power of the State . 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution . // My position is , that neither the Constitution , nor the government created by it , has anything to do with npholding , perpetuating , or defending that particular institution . Slavery existed before the Constitution , not by the law of nature and of nations , nor by the inherited common K w of England , nor by any provision of the old Confederation , but simply by the local law of each several State which had not abolished the barbarism . So it has existed since the organization of our Federal Government , and exists to-day , not by virtue of the Constitution , nor by any authority derived from it , but only by the local law of certain States . Those States , in the exercise of powers not delegated to the Union , make one man the property of another ; and because he is property , they make him legally incapable , not only of political , but of civil and social rights . They deny him the right to the use of his own faculties as a human being . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse may be said to own the shoes that are nailed to his hoofs , and perhaps the blanket that coves him in his stall . They deny him the right of a husband in his wife , and of a father in his children , making the factitions right of his owner and theirs paramount to all that is sacred in those natural affections and duties which are the first ri* diinent of society . But of all this the Federal Constitution knows nothing . For all these wrongs it has no responsibility . Whatever the slave may be in the theory and inteudment of the local law , established and executed by the State , the Federal Constitution knows him not as a thing , but only as a man  --  a " person held to service . " The four millions of slaves , in the national census of 1860 , are not property , but population , inhabitants whose human nature contributes to the aggr*gate power of the nation , though the tenure by which they are held to service under state laws , makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be if their human nature , with all its capabilities of want and aspiration , of knowledge and progress , of hope and love , could have fair play . * . The Federal governmuent has no authority to execnte state laws . In each several state the local law is made by an authority distinct from that of the nation as a whole , and is administered // exclusively by magistrates whose power is derived from the same source with the law itself . The national government has nothing to do with the execution or enforcement of any laws but its own . It can not interfere to protect a wife against the cruelty of an unnatural husband ; nor can itrelease an injured husband from his legal obligation to a faithless wife . As little can it interfere in behalf of a master against his apprentice or his slave , or in behalf of the " person held to service " against " the party to whom such service or labor may be due . " The only exception , or pretended exception , to this is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State under the laws thereof , " has escaped into another State . In that case , and no other , it has been held by Congress and by the Courts , and generally admitted by the American people , that the Federal authority is to interfere by a law of its own for the capture and delivery of the fugitive , which it must execute by its own officers . I have not forgotten the opinion of the late Daniel Webster , that this exccption ought not to have been made ; but without raising that question it is enough to say that in this instance the exception proves the rule . INo functionary of the Federal government , whether civil or military , has anything to do with the administration or execution of the local laws peculiar to every State . Has it ever been claimed that the national authority is bound by the Constitution , or is invested with constitutional power , to interfere , within the jurisdiction of a State , to protect the slave against the severity of the master ? On what theory can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is authorized to protect the master against the indolence or the fugacity of the slave ? So much it has seemed necessary to say concerning the relations of the national Constitution and govern ruent to slavery in the several states . If these views are correct , the conclusion is unavoidable , that in refusing to recognize slaves as property and as liable to the incidents of property , or to assume at any place the administration of the local laws which establish and sustain the institution of slavery , the President and Congress , and the officers , civil and military , under their authority , abdicate no duty imposed upon them by the Constitution . Without // venturing to censure in any respect the course of the administration , I can not but think that if President Lincoln had taken this ground , distinctly and unequivocally , from the beginning , some serious difficulties which he has encountered in the conduct of the war , would have been obviated . For example , the answer which General Butler made to a Virginian slaveholder , and which has given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ingenious evasion by which a shrewd lawyer , holding the political heresy that slaves are property under the Constitution , succeeded in reconciling his theo ryas a lawyer with his obvious duty as a patriot soldier . And indeed if slaves are property , they are a kind of property which ought not to be left in possession or within reach of the enemy , for neither quinine , nor saltpetre , nor lead , nor fulminating powder for percussion-caps , is so important to the enemy in a military view , as slaves who understand that they have nothing to hope from the success of our arms . But suppose General Butler had said to that Virginian , " The man whom you propose to seize and carry off is indeed WitbiR my lines , and for aught I know he may be your slave under the law of Virginia ; but I am not here to decide any question between you and him , nor to administer your local law ; nor will I permit any unoffending man to be seized in my camp without process of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority under the Governor of Virginia ? " This would have raised the question , " Is theic any Governor of Virginia ? and if so , who is he ? " No man recognizing John Letcher as Governor , or the usurping body at IRiclunond as the legislative power in that state-no man refusing to recognize Governor Pierpont and the state legislature at Wheeling , should have been tolerated for a moment in claiming under the laws of a government not recognized by the United States the ownership of a human being . This position , which is the only position consistent with the genius of the Constitution , would have made it plain to all men from the outset , that where there is no state government , there is no power to legalize or sustain the law of slavery in any of its distinctive elements . It would have been an effectual proclamation to all the conservatives of // slavery , south and north , that there can be no recognition of the relation between master and slave by any Federal authority , save at the demand of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the administration was naturally embarrased by the traditions which it had inherited from predecessors who seem to have thought that the oath of loyalty to the Constitution was nothing else than an oath of loyalty to slavery . These elementary views illustrate only the normal relation of the Federal Government to slavery as an institution created and administered by the local laws of certain states in the Union . I now proceed to another topic . II . Powers ctnd Dutie8 of the Federal Government in relation to ene*nee of the United State8 . The men who formed the Constitution , and the people who adopted it , had just emerged from a seven years ' war , on their own soil , with one of the most powerful nations of the old world , a war which was at the same time a civil war . Expe-* rience had taught them the needfulness of such a government as would have ample power to prosecute Thy future war against the enemies of the United States . Experience had taught them , too , that , by the necessity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government with powers for the defense of liberty which can not be wielded in time of peace without implying the loss of liberty . The Continental Congress , with no formal grant of powers from the several states , had placed itself at the head of the nation in its conflict for existence had made the Declaration of Independence , had raised armies in the name of the Union , had issued bills of credit with no other basis than requisitions on the states for money which the states might pay or refuse to pay at their discretion , had invested their commander-in-chief with almost dictatorial powers , had sent forth embassies and negotiated treaties , had conducted the war to a successful termination , and haviub lost by that great success , the powers which every government that conducts a war must wield against the enemies of the nation , it had become too weak for the easier functions of government in time of peace . A new government was to be instituted for the na // tion ; and the experienced statesmen in the convention well knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions steadily and efficiently , and without danger to liberty , in times of peace , and which should be entrusted with the duty and the power of the national self-defense , war , whenever it might arise , would invest that government with all power against the enemies of the United States . The Constitution formed by their wisdom takes certain powers from the several states and gives them to the Union . It entrusts the exercise of those powers to a national government , distributing them according to their nature , some to Congress , some to the President , and some to the courts which Congress is required to institute . It carefully reserves certain rights to the several states and to the people ; it provides for justice to " foreign states , citizens or subjects ; " but it takes no care to protect the enemies of the United States against the government which it establishes . Enemies at war with the United States have no rights other than those which are theirs by the law of nations and the laws of war . The Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union anything else than a speedy and effectual destruction . The idea that declared enemies , waging war upon the Union , have rights under the Constitution , is too preposterous to be emitertained . We have only to inquire 110w the duty of destroying and subjugating the enemuies of the United States , and the powers necessary to that end , are divided between Congress and the President . 1 . Power8 and D'atie8 of ( ongre88 . Looking into the Constitution , I find that Congress , as the legislative power of the nation , is to prepare and supply , at its own discretion , all the means and machinery of war , and is , therefore , invested with an almost unlimited power of taxation " to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of time United States ; " that it is " to raise and support armies ; " that it is " to provide and umaintain a navy ; " that it is " to makes rules for time government and regulation of the land and naval forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortlm the militia to execute the laws of the Union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; " and that it is " to provide // for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States . " In addition to all this , C*ngressis invested with the power of declaring war and of legalizing other measures of hostility ; so that no war shall be lawful which is not recognized as such by the legislative power of the Union . 2 . Powers and Duties of tke President . The Constitution creates one office never known before in the Union , and designates it by a title unknown till then in history . A Congress of the United States had been in exist* ence for half a generation ; and the idea of governing the Union by a Congress was fitmiliar to the people . During the revolutionary conflict , all the powers of goverment ( so far as there was any government of the Union ) were exercised by Congress without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at war with a powerful enemy invading the country from abroad , and with enemies at houme who were often rising in arms and always ready to help the invaders . Experience had shown the inconveniences and the incurable weakness of such a government . Accordingly , the Congress tinder the Constitution is a very different thing from what the Con. tinental Congress had been . The difference is not merely that Congress , as now constituted , consists of two houses , the States being represented equally in one and proportionately in the other , and the members voting in both as individuals and not by States ; it is also , and chiefly , that the Constitutional Congress is invested with the legislative power of the Union and with hardly any other power . The power of inquiry in order to the ascertainment of fact is incidental to the power of legislation . The power of impeachment by the House of I ( epresentatives , and removal from office by the Senate* and the power of electing a President by a peculiar method in case of a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a power not strictly legislative yet properly entri sted to the legislative body . But with these exceptions , Congress , under the Constitution , has no power other than the power of making laws , and , as incident thereto , the power of inquiry . Instead // 222 Reply to Profes8or Parker . of governing the Union , as the old Congress attempted to do , our Congress is entrusted with a very different class of functions . By its power of making laws , of taxation , of granting or withholding supplies , of specific appropriation , of ' inquest , and of impeachment , as well as by its power of declaring war , it is a check upon the government , but it does not govern . The power of *overnin* ' the Union , as distinguished from the power of making laws on the one hand , and from the power of trying and deciding " cases in law and eqnity " on the other hand , is entrusted to an officer with a new title , the " President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive power " - not simply the power of executing the orders of Congress like a sergeant- at-arms , nor simply the power of carrying into effect like a marshal the sentences of the courts , but the power of executing the functions of what is properly government . The President is the prime minister of the national sovereignty , the responsible head of the entire administration . The present inqniry has nothing to do with his powers in time of peace . It relates only to his powers against the enemies of the United States in time of war . ( 1 . ) If Congress has performed its constitutional duty in the way of legislation , there is an army and a navy , and provision has been made for their support and efficiency ; regulations have been established for their government by proper officers and for the punishment of offenses against military discipline ; provision has been made for organizing , arming , and training by a uniform discipline , just that portion of the population which mu ay be required as a militia ; and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , may be called forth in an emergeucy " to execute the laws of the *Union , suppress insurrections , and repel invasions . " Of all that force  --  the army , the navy , and the militia called into the service of the Union-the President is " commander-in-chief " This is the trust which was committed to Washington in the war for independence . lie held the command over the continental army raised by Congress , and over all bodies of militia called into time service of the Union . Whatever powers were wielded by him in that command , against the enemies of the United States , under the // law of nations and the laws of war , are the powers which the Constitution requires the President to use for the destruction and subjugation of the enemies of the United States , whenever war has been legalized by Congress . But there is one very important difference . Washington was commander-in-chief by virtue of a commission from Congress delegating to him powers which they had assumed as belonging to them . The President is commander-in-chief by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact commander over Washington , who received his orders as well as his commission from that higher authority . The President has no superior but in the sovereignty by whose will the Constitution was ordained and established , and of whose will it is , till duly changed , the highest expression . Congress declares war ; the President makes war . ( 2 . ) If Congress has performed its duty of making provision for an organized and trained militia , and for calling forth that militia in an emergency , the President , in case of a combination to resist the laws of the Union , has power to " take care that the laws be faithfully executed , " and in case of an insurrection or invasion , he has power to act at once with warlike force against the enemies of the United States without waiting for Congress to be assembled . Against invaders from abroad or traitors in arms at home , lie has power to use immediately all measures of destruction or subjngation not contrary to the law of nations and the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the advice and consent of the Senate , given in a two-thirds vote , to negotiate and conclude a treaty with the enemies of the United States , imposing upon them such terms as victory shall have enabled him to dictate , or submitting to such terms as " the fortune of war ' * shall have compelled him to accept . The same treaty-making power which acquired , as the result of conquest , California and *ew Mexico , and which carried the western boundary of Texas to the Rio Grande , is competent to make peace with any hostile power recognized or unrecognized before , and to purchase that peace by any cession of territory , or any national humiliation , which disaster and defeat on our part shall have made inevitable . A treaty made " under time authority of the United // States " - though it cedes the political liberty of the states and the independence of the nation-is " the supreme law of the land , " and can be set aside only by renewing the war . While the Constitution has unequivocally ordained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the advice and consent of the Senate , shall be the depositary of the treatymaking power , it imposes no limitation on the exercise of that power . Nor is such a limitation really possible . The constitution of Mexico expressly denied to its government the power of ceding any portion of the national territory ; but what did that prohibition avail against necessity ? Was the treaty invalid by which Mexico purchased peace with the United States ? Is the title worthless by which we hold the vast and rich territory ceded to us in that treaty ? In the nature of the case every government that can wage war must have a power of making peace on such terms as a victorious enemy may dictate , and that power of making peace can have no limit . 3. ( *o&amp;peration of congress and the President . The state of war is legalized by act of Congress . Men , money , ships , fortresses , all the means of war , are placed at the disposal of the President by acts of Congress . " Rules concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . A President may be ambitious of conquest ; he may have a passion for wielding the powers with which a state of war invests him , but which pass from him when peace returns ; he may desire to enrich himself or his friends and dependents with property captured in war ; he may entertain designs against the*enik for which the Constitution was ordained . But he can do no1*hing without the cooperation of Congress , and he can not infringe the prerogatives of that body without exposing himself to impeachment and removal . Congress , on the other hand , is limited and checked by the powers vested in the Presddent . It may declare war ; but it can not make peace . It may impose taxes and make appropriations for warlike purposes ; it may authorize the raising of armies by voluntary enlistment or by drafting ; but it cann*t organize a regiment nor *set a squadron in the field . It may define the rank , duties , and emoluments of all officers subordinate to the commander // in-chief ; but every officer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice and consent of the Senate ) commissioned by the President . Congress depends on the President for an earnest and efficient prosecution of the war which it declares , as really as the President depends on Congress for men and the material means of war . To sum up this analysis of the powers and duties of the Federal Government in relation to the enemies of the United States , I may say that , in a state of war , recognized as such by Congress , the Government has power to employ the eiitire resources of the country against the enemies of the country , and its power in that respect is limited only by laws higher than the Constitution and independent of it . Congress having legalized the war , and having provided the men and means , it becomes the constitutional right and duty of the President to use every legitimate method and expedient of war for the purpose of distressing , weakening , destroying , and subduing the enemies of the United States . If there be any such expedient which he persistently refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view it is essential to the early and prosperous termination of the war , he is unfaithful to his office . If he can weaken and embarrass the enemy by inviting any portion of the population under their control to renounce all subjection to that hostile power , and by promising them protection and liberty , it is not only his right but his duty to do so . If those enemies of the United States , have under their control millions of slaves whose reluctant labor , though far less productive than the labor of freemen , is to them " the sinews of war , " he can not reasonably regard those slaves as anything else than a population oppressed by the power with which he is waging war for his country ; nor can he , without conspicuous unfaithfulness in hi* high office , ref to alienate them from the service of that hostile power by giving them every reasonable assurance needful to that end . But you seem to think that the powers of the President , in the prosecution of the present war , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do are traitors and rebels , and.are liable in law to the penalties of treason . You maintam , // if I understand you , that , in this conflict , the United States have not the rights which , by the law of nations and the laws of war , belong to a belligerent power ; and that we can not claim those rights without conceding them at the same time to the other party . The question , then , arises , whether there is anything in the *. constitution , or in that law of nations which it presupposes , that should restrain the President from using , for the conquest of this rebellion , the powers with which he is invested against the enemies of the United States . III . Powers and ditties of the President in a war with traitors . You have suggested ( unintentionally , I presume ) a distinction between the present conflict with a huge rebellion , and the process of suppressing a mere insurrection . To avoid admitting that the United States are really at war , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcible means , which means , from the magnitude of the rebellion , have assumed the proportions of war . " Let me ask your attention to the distinction which these words suggest , but which you seem to have overlooked . The dictionary says of " insurrection , " ( I quote from Webster 's quarto , first edition ) , " It differs from rebellion , for the latter expresses a revolt , or an attempt to overthrow the government , to establish a different one , or to place the country under another jurisdiction . " Under the word " rebellion , " it says , " Among the IRomans , rebellion was originally a revolt or open resistance to their government among nations that had been subdued in war ; and its first definition of the word is , " An open and avowed renunciation of the authority of the government to which one owes allegiance ; or the taking of arms traitorously to resist the authority of lawful government ; revolt . " The idea of rebelliofi includes the idea of insurrection , but there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which we have to do at present is more than a mere insurrection . It is in the strict sense  --  and I might even say in the old Roman sense  --  a rebellion on the largest scale . South Carolina , for instance , ' was conquered from the British by the United States in the war of independence ; and , instead of // being held as a conquered province , was permitted to become an equal State in the Union . That State , as represented and controlled by its municipal authorities , has now rebelled , or made war again . Louisiana and Arkansas were acquired by the equally legitimate method of purchase , and they , in like manner , have revolted and made war against the nation with which they were incorporated . So of all the States which are commonly spoken of as having seceded from the Union ,  --  each of them , as represented by its own local government , has revolted . It is not a strict use of language to speak of this great revolutionary attempt as a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shays insurrection in Massachusetts , or the whisky insurrection in Pennsylvania , or the Nat Turner insurrection in Virginia ; it is a rebellion of local governments , and of the provinces governed by ' them , against the established and legitimate government of the nation . The distinction is an important one . Where there is a niob that can not be dispersed by a constable or a squad of policemen , the magistrate may call for military aid ; but the quelling of a mob by military force , even thon*h it be necessary to fire upon the rioters , is not war . The tumult may become an insurrection ; disorderly hordes of men may undertake to obtain by force a change of laws or a change of government ; and a greater and bloodier demonstration of power may be necessary to the restoration of order , but the suppression of a mere insurrection is not war . When the insurrection becomes a revolt , when the local authorities lead and control the movement , when armies instead of mobs assail the imperial or national power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movemuent is more than an insurrection-it is a rebel lion , and rebellion is war . I say , then , that what * we , the people of the United States , " have on hand just now , is the conquest of a rebellion . We are not dealing with a riot , nor with a mere insurrection of a rabble . We are in the midst of a civil war , the greatest that the world has ever seen . Almost the entire territory of eleven States has been occupied , and the population subjugated by a great military force , and what we have to do is to regain by // conquest what we have temporarily lost , and to liberate those of our countrymen whose submission to the intrusive and usurping power is so far involuntary as to be excusable . Accordingly this conflict has been recognized as war by the supreme authority of the nation , as well as by the foreign powers that have proclaimed their neutrality . You quote , for another purpose , the manifesto in which Congress announced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle is to be maintained on our part . I mean the resolution of July , 1861 , which I take leave to transcribe as conclusive on the question whether we are really at war . " Resolved , That the present deplorable civia war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the Southern States , now in arms against the constitution al Government , and in arms around the capitol ; that in this national emergency , Congress , banishing all feelings of passion or resentment , will recollect only its duty to the whole country ; that this WAR is not waged on their part in any spirit of oppression , or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation , or purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve the Union , with all the dignity , equality and rights of the several States unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease . " Can anybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the conflict with the great rebellion is really , in the estimation of the government , war , or only something less than war ? Can anybody doubt whether our generals on the land , our admirals on the sea , and the constitutional commander-inchief of our army and navy are really invested with all belligerent rights against these belligerent enemies of the United States ? You are quite correct in imputing to me the opinion that in this war " the government has all the rights of a belligerent which would be recognized by the hw of nations in a foreign war . " You are equally correct in saying that " practically there can not be a war in which there is only one belligerent . " But I am compelled to pause over your opinion when you " think it may safely be asserted that there is no war , foreign or domestic , in which one of the parties is entitled to all the rights of a belligerent , as recognized by the law of nations , unless the other party is also entitled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your assertion in its most obvious sense , I am constrained to pause over it in the suspicion that there is something equivocal and misleading in your use of the word " right . " My suspicion grows when I find you proceeding to says " If we claim all these rights we must concede them to the Confederates , " and arguing that if we recognize the rebels as actually making war upon us , and if we deal with them according to the laws of war , we virtually acknowledge that they are no longer liable to punishment by the civil authorities for the crime of levying war against the United States . That I may be sure of doing you no injustice , I transcribe your language . " There may be an insurrection , and the Government may seek to assert its authority by force , in which neither party is entitled to the rights of a belligerent . The two parties might be , as they are in this case , belligerents so far as certain foreign nations are concerned , because of the recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as between themselves , however grave the proportions of the contest , their status is as to each other , that of the preceding lawful authority asserting itself , on the one hand , and rebels attempting to produce revolution on the other , and all acts of active hostility on the part of the rebels would be treason , and punishable accordingly . But wben the Government itself ; instead of pursuing its attempt to subdue the rebellion , assumes to itself the character of a belligerent , the rebels are the other belligerent , and there can be no new treason , subsequently , on the part of those who before were traitors . The acts of Congress for the punishment of treason by confiscation , &amp;c. , could no longer apply to subsequent acts , as between belligerents there can be no treason in acts of hostility . " If the United States may exercise all the rights of a belligerent in the territory of a State which has rejected the Constitution and made war upon the Union , they may conquer the State , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , and change its laws . And so , on the other hand , the State which has rejected the Constitution may , if it can , not only conquer the United States , ( which is undoubtedly true , even if the case were one of mere insurrection ) , but in the attempt so to do , such State would only be exercising the lawful rights of the other belligerent , and if the attempt should fail , those concerned in it would only be subject to the common laws of warfare . The late incursion into Maryland was , on your position , lawful war , and no laws of the United States were broken by the forces concerned in it , so as to subject them to penalties . There are authorities which tend to support these positions , unless they are rejected as law logic . " ' Before I proceed to the consideration of your authorities , allow me to say , with all respect , that if you are not amusing // yourself by practicing on me a little of that verbal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are imposing upon yourself by not observing with sufficient exactness the meaning of the words yon use . It is necessary for me to unravel , if I can , the network of sophisms in which your argument would ensnare me . A few simple statements may be sufficient for that purpose . 1 . Nothing is more obvious than that there are belligerents wherever there is war , and that wherever there is one belligerent there are two . 2 . The recognition of a war as a matter of fact , and the consequent recognition of the parties to that war as belligerents , and as having in relation to each other , and in relation to the world , all the rights which modern civilization concedes to the parties in a war , is a very different thing from recognizing those two parties as independent sovereignties . The European powers have recognized the present conflict in our country as a war , and have therefore recognized the parties as belligerent , but in so doing , they have not recognized the pretended Confederacy as a sovereign power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion against the sovereignty of the United States . 3 . Wherever there is a war , all the belligerent rights of the belligerent parties may be acknowledged without implying any concession or any assumption in regard to the rightfulness of the war itself or in regard to the conclusion and consequences of the war . In such an acknowledgment , whether by neutrals toward the parties , or by the parties toward each other , nothing is acknowledged but the fact that the conflict is war , to be conducted in conformity with the usages of the civilized world . The war may be on one side , or on both sides , flagitious in its origin-it may be an unprovoked invasion for purposes of conquest or an unprovoked rebellion against an established amid beneficent government , but be it ever so wicked in its origin , and be the question at issue what it may , the recognition of it as a war , and of the parties as belligerents , implies nothing more than that , while the war lasts , the accepted laws of war-including the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which define the rights of the parties belligerent-are to be respected on all sides . The laws of war relate to nothing but the manner of carrying on the war . 4 . Your statement that " the late iucnrsion into Maryland was , on my position , lawful war , " and that " no laws of the United States were broken by the forces concerned in it , so as to subject them to penalties , " may serve to illustrate the confusion of your argument . Judged by the laws of war , the late incursion of the rebels into Maryland was " lawful "  --  a lawful measure of hostility , as lawful as the operations of General McClellan in the Yirginian peninsula . The battle of Antietam was as lawfully fonght by the rebels as the battle of Bull iRun or any other battle of the war . But with the question whether the war itself is lawful on the part of those whom you call the Confederates , the laws of war have no concern . If the acts in which the war began  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizure of the national property , the protracted siege of Fort Sumter , ending in the bombardment and capture of that fortress-were in accordance with the Constitution of the United States , which is the supreme law of the land , or if they were in accordance with that higher law by which insurrection and revolutionary violence must be justified or condemned , then the whole war is lawful on their part , and the lawfulness of the whole includes the lawfulness of every portion , excepting only those atrocities which are contrary to the usages of civilized races and which are to be punished by inilitary retaliation . 5 . Not only has our National Government recogni2ed this conflict expressly as a war , but it has in almost every other way recognized the rebels as a belligerent party , and its own obligation to conduct the conflict in accordance with the laws of war . Has any privateer , captured on the high seas , under the rebel flag , been hanged for piracy ? Of the tens of thousands of rebels taken in arms against the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried , or even arraigned before any civil tribunal for an offense against the laws ? What one rule or principle is there in the system known as the laws of war , which our Government does not recognize as // binding on the parties in this civil war , and on itself as one of the parties ? 6 . The question to be determined by this war is just the question which you say is conceded by acknowledging that it is a war , and that the parties to it are belligerent parties . The question to be determined is whether the pretended ordinances of secession are lawful-whether the so-called seceding States are in fact an independent sovereignty . All civil process against the traitors as we call them-all arraignment of them before the tribunals of civil justice-must wait till that question shall have been determined l ) y the arbitrament of battle . If the war shall terminate in the conquest of the rebellion , then , as soon as the authority of the Constitution and laws shall have been completely established over those who have made war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of belligerents will have nothing to do with the sequel . When that result shall have been attained , the lawyers may sing ( edant anna togze , and may rejoice in the prospect of trials for treason and of infinite litigation . If the war shall terminate otherwise , the civil tribunals will have no opportunity of dispensing justice to any of the traitors ; for , the great treason having prospered , it will cease to be treason before the law . Let it not shock your love of justice or your patriotism , if I add that ever since this war was recognized as war by the Government and the people , and by neutral powers , I have not expected that in any event the traitors will suffer the penalty of death , simply for their treason , under the sentence of any civil tribunal . The time has been when kings were brought to the scaffold for treason against their subjects , and when the leaders of an unsuccessful but *eIl sustained revolt against a government were subjected to the indignity of dying under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of fashion at present ; and though John Brown was hanged because his insurrection , being preposterously ill-prepared , was a failure from the outset , Jefferson Davis may escape the halter for the very reason that his stnpendous crime has come so near* to a complete success . Of the rebel leaders who may survive the war , some will effect their escape to countries where the // saving clause for political offenders , in treaties of extradition , will be their protection ; others may be captured , tried , convicted , sentenced , and their sentence be commuted by executive clemency ; but none will be hanged save those who may be hanged by the well known summary process of southern indignation , and those who , in imitation of conspicuous examples from the Scriptures , may hang themselves . Yet nothing but a national act of amnesty will make it safe for any one of them to remain in the country for a day after the war shall have ended in a final victory for the Union . I come now to the consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as against the rebellion , the United States have not the rights of a belligerent . Your first citation is from Gen. Halleck 's chapter on the " different kinds of war . " That I may do you no injustice , I transcribe the entire passage as quoted by you , and that I may do no injustice to the author , I transcribe it with its context . " * 9 . Civil wars are those which result from hostile operations carried on between different parts of the same state , as the wars of the roses in England , of the league in France , of the Guelphs and Ghibelines in Italy , and of the factions in Mexico and South America . Wars of insurrection and revolution are in one sense civil wars , but this term is more usually applied to those contests which are waged between rival families or factions , for party ascendency in a state , rather than for its dismemberment , or for a radical change in its government . Each party , in such cases , is usually entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , with respect to neutrals . Mere rebellions , however , are considered as exceptions to this rule , as every government treats those who rebel against its authority according to its own municipal laws , and without regard to the general rules of war which international jurisprudence established between sovereign states . As is shown elsewhere , every neutral state , in such a contest , must determine when it will consider a party in a rebellion , insurrection , revolution , or civil war , entitled to the rights of a belligerent in its international relations . " Hallack , International Law and Laws of War . ( San Francisco , 1861 ) . pp. 332 , 333 . Your quotation omits the first of the foregoing sentences , and the last ; and you mark as specially significant the words , " illere rebellions , however , are considered as exceptions to this rule , as every governmerd treats those who rebel against its authority according to its own municipal laws . " You expect me to accept this clause as proof , that in Gen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entitled to the rights of war against the Confederates , so called . Let us see how your authority bears upon your position . The first question is , what does your author mean by " mere rebellion ' ? " In this section of his chapter on different kinds of wars , lie is defining " civil wars , " and distinguishing them from " wars of insurrection and revolution " which he has defined in a preceding section . He has already said : " * 5 * of insurrection , and of revolution , are generally those undertaken to gain , or to regain , the liberty or independence of the party or state which undertakes them , as was the case with the Americans in l7*l6 , against England . * * * A wnr of revolution is generally undertaken for the dismembermeat of a state , by a separation of one of its parts , or for the overthrow and radical change of the government ; while an insurrectionary war is sometimes waged for a very different purpose . Both , however , have respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its externnl relations . They are , therefore , in one sense civil wars , and are governed by the same general rules which are applied to that class of wars . " Helleclc , p. 331 . In the light of these definitions there is no doubt into what class Gen. Halleck puts the war in which he is at this moment acting so conspicuous a part . Congress , in its manifesto , calls this a civil war , and so it is in the popular use of words ; but his definition makes it a " war of revolution , " of which lie says that " each party in such cases is usually entitled to the rights of war as against each other , and also with respect to neutrals . " This war then has far outgrown the dimensions of what he means by a " mere rebellion . " Think you that he regards himself as holding his high command in a war which is conducted " without regard to the general rules of war which intern ational jurisprudence establishes between sovereign states ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H e and his followers were not allowed to surrender themselves as prisoners of war . As soon as they were caught by the military power of the United States , they were delivered over to the civil power of Yirginia to be tried without waiting for their wounds to heal , and to be hanged without mercy . That was what Geii . Halleck means by a " mere rebellion . " Perhaps his use of the word rebellion in this instance is not // perfectly accurate . I find however , in another passage to which I shall presently refer , a clear statement of the distinction which he makes between a mere rebellion , and a war of insurrection or revolution , or a civil war in the more limited sense . Every civil war , in the largest sense , is called a rebellion by the party which sustains the existing government . The chronic civil war in China is a rebellion . The war which the English nation as represented in parliament waged against their forsworn king , is commonly spoken of in English history as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirteen AngloAmerican colonies achieved their independence , was , in all British opinion , a mere rel ) ellion till its success had made it a completed revolution . So the United States to-day are struggling to vanquish a rebellion , but the conflict is nevertheless a " civil war , " a " war of insurrection and revolution , " as defined by your author , and , therefore a war to be coiiducted in conforniity with the recognized laws of war . Admitting , h ow-ever , for the sake of am-guinent , that we are dealing with a " mere rebellion , " iii Gen. Halleck 's meaning ; and that tKhis is therefore one of the wars in which the rule that " each party is entitled to the rights of war as against the other " may be disregarded ,  --  the next questiomi is whether your author means to say that , in a conflict with rebellion , neither party is entitled to the rights of war as against the other . Does the learned as well as gallant soldier , evidently writing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to extend , the right of an established government to defend itself against rebellion ? When lie says that " mere rebellions " are an exception to the rule which concedes belligerent rights to both parties in a war of insurrection and revolution , does he mean that an established government has no more right to wage war against a mere rebellion , than the mere rebellion has to make war against the Government ? Does lie mean what you would have me think he means , namely , that , in a conflict with a mere rebellion , there are some measures and methods of hostility , not inconsistent with the rules and usages of civilized war , which the Government may not employ , if necessary , to effect a speedy and complete // suppression the author 's argument . What Gen. ilalleck means is obviously that in such a conflict the Government has all the rights which military power and military necessity can give , while the rebels have none . Poor John Brown thought that if the Government of the United States should assume to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights against the Government . Was he not mistaken ? If you had carefully read the entire chapter on the " different kinds of wars , " you could not have overlooked another section in which your anthor makes a still more explicit statement of his opinion on the point in question . It is the section in which he incidentally explains what he means by a " mere rebellion ; " and for that reason , as well as for its conclusiveness on the topic of belligerent rights , I transcribe it . " 25 . A contest by force between different members of the same society or state , has sometimes been called a mixed war . Grotius regards such a war as public on the side of the established authorities , and private on the part of those who resist such authorities . Such a contest , on the part of individuals against the established Government , may be a mere insurrection or rebellion , and the acts of such individual insurgents , or rebels , in resisting or opposing the authority of the Government , may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law which they have violated ; but where the contest assumes the character of a public war , as defined and recognized by the law of nations , it is the general usage for other states to concede to both parties the rights of war so far as regards the law of blockades , of contraband , etc . It must be remembered , however , that every insurrection or rebellion is by no means a public war , and a state which recognizes it as such , does so under the responsibilities which are imposed by the laws of international comity . It should also be remarked that , in such cases , belligerent rights may be superadded to tisose of sovereignty , that is , the contending parties may exercise belligerent rights with regard to each other and to neutral powers , while , at the same time , the established government of the state may exercise its rights of sovereignty in punishing by its municipal laws , individuals of the revolting party as rebels and traitors . " pp. 344 , 345 . Your second citation of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of a belligerent against the so-called Confederates , without implying that we thereby release them from responsibility to the laws of the United // States ,  --  is from Wheaton . The entire paragraph which you quote in part , is as follows : " A contest by force between independent sovereign states is called a public war . If it is declared in form , or duly commenced , it entitles both the belligerent parties to all the rights of war against each other . The voluntary or positive law of nations makes no distinction , in this respect , between a just and an ur*just war . A war , in form , or duly commenced , is to be considered , as to its effects , as just on both sides . Whatever is permitted by the laws of war to one of the belligerent parties , is equally permitted to the other . " Wheaton . Elements of International Law , ( Philad. , 1846 ) . pp. 342 , 343 . If you had taken notice of the fact that the subject of Wheaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made , is the " International rights of states in their hostile relations , " and that in the dialect of international law , our country is one state and not many , surely you could not have thought of citing this passage as having any relation to the question whether citizens of the United States , having ulade war upon their country , and being responsible to the military power as recognized belligerents , are therefore exempted from all responsibility to the civil power as traitors and criminals . I can not see that in this passage , or in any other , Wheaton makes any allusion to that question . He does , indeed , refer , in the next paragraph , to the definition given by Grotius , of a civil war as " public on the side of the established government , and private on the part of the people resisting its authority ; " tile very definition by xvhicll the most uncompromising enemy of the pretended right of secession would naturally describe the nature of the civil war now raging in this country  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private war , like any filibustering expedition , on the part of the socalled Confederates . " But , " he adds , " the general usage of nations regards suell a war as entitling both the contending parties to all the rights of war as against each other , and even as respects neutral nations . " What else is this than the ideiltical position which I assumed , and which you have undertaken to controvert ? Your position that if the people of the United States have all the rights of a belligerent against the rebels and ill the region occupied by the rebellion , they can not at the same time have those rights of sovereignty over the // whole area of the Union which are the subject matter of the war ,  --  is a position which , so far as I can discover , Wheaton seems never to have thought of Let inc now illustrate , by a parallel case , my view of what oar rights are , as a belligerent power , in the territory now occupied by our enemies . What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebel states had been immediately followed by a similar act or ordinance of accession to the French empire ? What if the whole s3heme from the first , instead of being a conspiracy for the establishment of an independent and rival confederacy within the acknowledged area of the United States , had been a conspiracy to bring half of our country nuder the scepter of a foreign potentate ? What if the traitors who seized forts , arsenals , mint , and customhouses , in the name and for the use of the Confederate States of America , had done that thing in the name and for the use of Napoleon III. ? What if the French tricolor were now flying wherever the flag of the rebellion is displayed upon our soil ? What if Jefferson Davis , instead of styling himself " President of the Confederate States , " were ruling at Richinond as the representative of the imperial power at Paris ? In such a case the conflict would be , unquestionably , on both sides , a public war , " a contest by force between independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belligerent parties to all the rights of war against each other . " My position is , that whatever our belligerent rights would be in such a case , those are oar belligerent rights today . In such a case the necessities of war would compel us , as the necessities of war in the present case have compelled us , to recognize captured traitors , while the war lasts , as prisoners of war to be exchanged or paroled instead of being indicted in the civil courts and hanged for their treason . If , in such a case , the expulsion of the foreign flag and the foreign power , and the consequent termination of the war , would be followed by the reestablishment of the constituted civil authorities ; and if every citizen who has " levied war against the United States , " or has " adhered to their enemies , giving them aid or comfort , " would thereupon find himself liable to an indictment for // treason and to punishment by the civil power unless protected by an act of amnesty ; then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this war . And if ; in the case supposed , our Government , as a belligerent power , would have a right to use , within the territory occupied by the enemy , all measures of hostility , not excepting a proclamation of freedom to the slaves and the raising of an army of freedmen , if necessary to the speediest and most effectual termination of the war ,  --  then , in the present case , our Government , as a belligerent power , has the same right . What , now , is the bearing of your authorities on my position and on yours ? The quotations you make may serve to throw a little learned dust into the eyes of nnwary readers , and they may help the logical juggle by which one thing is adroitly shuffled into the place of another without awakening any suspicion in credulous souls ; they may be available for the purpose of making " them that are unlearned and nnstable " believe that black is white , and the wrong the better reason ; but , on a careful examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , and that concerning yours they say nothing . I do not reject your authorities as " law logic. * ' Sometimes it happens that the " law logic " is in the misapplication and misinterpretation of quotations from authorities . It occurs to me as not improbable that in the present instance you have been wronged by some clerk or pupil employed to make the needful citations . There is nothing disrespectful in such a supposition . Marshall , as I have heard , having determined what the law ought to be in a given case , was wont to depend on Story for the citations which were to prove what the law was . So Webster is said to have devolved upon his junior associates , in the trial of a case , the labor o hunting for authorities . One of your letters ( the fourth ) assails my statement that " the territory held by the rebels must be recognized as hostile territory to be conquered and reannexed ; " and that the work which we have now in hand is " the earnest reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regain by conquest a wide territory which has been wrested from the people of the // United States to whom it rightfully belongs  --  to establish the Constitution and the laws of the Union in regions over which , at present , they have no more sway or force than they have in Patagonia . " I will not dispute with you about the sense in which the territory in question " rightfully belongs " to the people of the United States ; for , on that point , I do not see that you have really raised any doubt , and my meaning , I am sure , was sufficiently intelligible from the first . In whatever sense the territory included within the boundaries of Massachusetts or of Iowa belongs to the people of the United States , in that sense the territory included within the boundaries of Virginia or of Arkansas belongs of right to the people of the United States ; and that is enough for the purpose of my argumerit . What you deny is , in your own words , " that any part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . " You say , " I maintain that there never has been a time since the rebellion cdmmenced when the territory has not belonged to the United States in as full and ample a manner at it did before that period ; that there has not been any time when the jurisdiction of the United States , political and legal , has not been as ample as it was before the first act of secession was passed , nor any time since when the laws of the United States have not been in force throughout the territory , precisely as they were prior to the insurrection ; although , by reason of a treasonable and forcible opposition to their execution , the actual enforcement of them has been obstructed and prevented . " Now in all this you strangely confound the very obvious difference between what is true in law and what is true in fact , or , in other words , the difference between what ought to be , and what is . Do you teach your pupils that if a client comes for legal advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm which rightfully belongs to him , but which is occupied and held by another claimant , he is 6nly to be advised that inasinuch as his title is perfect , he is already in possession of the farm ? In such a case , do you hold that because your client is of right the owner of the farm , he has no ground of action , and can not sue for an ejectment ? Is it worthy of your professional eminence to build an argumcnt upon such a quibble as that the Constitution and laws of the Union are still " in force " throughout the area of the rebellion , though there is // no " actual enforcement " of them ? They are in force , forsooth , but they are not put in force ! If it comes to quibbles like that , please observe more exactly what i really said . Did I say that there is any portion of our country where the Constitution and laws are not in force ? What I said was no more than what you yourself say when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laws of the Union ,  --  in other words , that " the Constitution and the laws of the Union " are to be established " in regions over which , at present , they have no more sway or force than they have in Patagonia . " In other passages you say , by way of inference from the fact that the sovereignty of the United States is limited by the reserved rights of the several States . " Of course there has not been ,  --  there can not have been , any wresting of the territory from the people of the United States , except that the rightful power which the United States might and ought to exercise under the Constitution , has been subverted , or rather suspended , for the time being , by force . And in that view , any reannexation-which by the way is a very inappropriate term-would be a restoration , so far as possible , of the state of things existing previous to the rebellion . But that would not he a conquest , ' and the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you mean something more than the mere restoration of the authority of the United States . It is apparent , from the whole tenor of your article , that you desire through conquest and reannexation , to accomplish something which could not be done by the mere suppression of the rebellion ,  --  that is to say , the emancipation of the slaves . * * " The fact that conventions of people , in the several seceding states , have adopted acts of secession , does not wrest the territory within those states from the United States . The acts of secession are void , and the sovereignty , jurisdic. tion , and authority of the United States remain as before . " * " Do you not know that in thus asserting that the territory has been wrested from the people of the United States , and must be regained by conquest , and that the war must be waged for emancipation , you not only virtually admit that the ordinances of secession had validity , but that you make war upon the resolve of Congress , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1851 , and commit a kind of petit treason against the great proclamation ? " ' I have made these extended quotations , partly for the sake of saying to you , peremptorily , some things which I would not say without putting before your eyes the evidence which will justif*y inc in saying them . 1 . The inference which you make from my use of the words // " conquest " and " reannexed , " namely , that I " mean something more than the mere restoration of the authority of the United States , " is without warrant . Not only do I repudiate that inference as one which was not in my thoughts , but I deny your right to make it . 2 . When you allege that I " desire through conquest and reannexation to accomplish something which could not be done by the mere suppression of the rebellion , that is to say , the emancipation of the slaves , "  --  and when you affirm that this " is apparent from the whole tenor of my Article , " you not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it with a violence , for which , I can discover no excuse . That I desire the emancipation of the slaves is most true . Wherever under God 's heaven a human being is enslaved for no crime or fault of his own , my sympathies are with him , and I pray for his emancipation . If I did not desire the emancipation of the millions of human beings in the United States who are held in the lowest condition of bondage , robbed of their labor , sold like cattle in the market , subject to every wrong which the interest , the caprice , the fear , the suspicions , or the lust of an owner can inflict , shut out by law and popular hate or fear from all means and opportunities of acquiring knowledge , and denied even the poor hope of something better for their children , I should be " a worm and no man . " If I could believe that you , born in New England , distinguished by gifts of nature , enlightened by education , and trusted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emancipation of the slaves , I should feel myself dishonored by any correspondence with you . There are those in New England and elsewhere in the North , who do not desire the emancipation of the slaves , but you will not acknowledge yourself one of them . You know who they are , and in your dispassionate moments you abhor them . They are the vilest and most unclean of knavish politicians , and the most unthinking of their dupes-creatures who wear the shape of men , but in whose gross and selfish hearts there is no pulse of genuine sympathy with wronged and suffering human nature-men , if we may call themn so , who would rather give up the Union to dissolution and betray // our grand trust of constitutional self-government , than see the slaves emancipated . But much as I , in common with yourself and all honest men , desire the emancipation of the slaves , you wrong me inexcusably when you charge me with desiring to accomplish that end by any method of violence distinct from and superadded to the suppression of the rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the territory held by the rebel power . The whole tenor of my Article demonstrates to any reader that in my view the proclamation can be justified not for one moment on the ground that the emaimcipation of the slaves , and the full abolition of slavery , are desirable in themselves , and devoutly longed for by all generous souls ; but only on the ground that the offer of freedom to the slaves held under the power of the pretended governments in the territory , occupied by rebels , is a rightful measure of hostility in this war , and necessary for the suppression of the rebellion , and for restoring the legitimate authority of the United States . 3 . When you allege that my views are at variance with the resolve of Congress , setting forth the causes and purposes of the war , and with the proclamation itself , you allege that for which you have no shadow of a warrant . If anything in my Article is intelligible , it is that the offer of freedom to the slaves now held in slavery by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regarded not as the object or purpose of the war , but only as a means to the object and purpose announced by Congress . Did I not expressly consider and refute " the complaint that the proclamation makes no profession of hostility to slavery , but emancipates the slaves only because emancipation is a necessary measure of hostility against the rebels " ? What was the argurn&amp;nt by which I answered that complaint ? " The President has no right to emancipate any slave on the ground that slavery is wrong , but he has a right as comumander-in-chief of the army and navy to proclaim the emancipation of slaves on the ground that their emancipation is necessary as a means of ending the rebellion . " // and must not be regarded as hostile territory to be conquered and reannexed , because if we so regard it we admit the validity of ' the pretended ordinances of secession , is of the same sort with your argument , already noticed , that because the laws of the United States ougkt to be respected and obeyed in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sway or force there . That a great extent of territory , wider than some of the greatest empires of the old world , has been wrested from the people of the United States to whom it righfully belongs , is a notorious matter of fact which you undertake to argue out of existence by the consideration that it is against the law . As if , when a man has been shot down in the street before my eyes , and I see him laid stark and stiff I must not believe the fact , because the assassin had no right to kill him . Could any murderer be convicted of his crime , if the fact of the homicide could not be asserted without implying an admission that the homicide was lawful ? The ordinances of secession were unconstitutional , invalid , null and void ab initio ; but the stubborn fact happens to be that the territory in question is held and occupied by the belligerent enemies of the Tnited States , and must be recovered by feats of arms , ( that is , by conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . All this remarkable argumentation of yours is employed to refute my position that the territory which the belligerent enemies of the United States hold by military strength , is to be regarded as hostile territory . But , as it happens , you cite no authority in confirmation of your argument . What does Gen. ilalleck say on this point ? " Any place , port , town , fortress , or section of country occupied by the enemy , is , for most purposes , regarded in law as , hostile territory so long as such occupation is continued . If the place so occupied were previously neutral , or a part of our own territory , it is no longer regarded as such , for it would be absurd to suppose that persons who are hostile themselves , or who are under a hostile authority , are to exercise the same civil rights as neutrals or citizens in time of peace . The relations of the government to a place or territory so occupied or situated , are of a military character , and consequently are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of peace . This change of relation , or rule of government , does not result from anything in the particular constitution or laws , but from the feet of the existence of war , and the hostile occupation of the place . " Holleek , pp. 371 , 372. // Considering your professional deference to authorities , and that C-en . Halleck is an authority referred to by yourself , I do not see that anything more need be said , just now , on this part of the subject . The conclusion seems to be that whatever the President , as wielding the military power of the United States , might do in Florida , if that State ( as we call it ) had never ceased to be a dependency of the Spanish crown , and if we were at war with Spain , just that is what he may do in Florida now , and just that is what he may do throughout the territory held by the rebels . Every State or portion of a State held by the enemies of the United States is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies by the use of every hostile measure and expedient , not contrary to the laws of war , that may be found needtd to the end in view . Do you hold that this particular expedient  --  a proclamation offering liberty to all persons held in slavery by the enemyis contrary to the recognized laws of war ? I will not affirm that you do , and yet I dare not say , on the other hand , that you frankly acknowledge the legitimacy of this measure in war . I can not deem it superfluous to touch upon the question whether , admitting that , in the present conflict , the United States are invested with full belligerent rights against the rebellion , and admitting that the territory held by the rebels is , for the time being , hostile territory ,  --  a proclaimed offer of freedom to all persons held in slavery by the rebel power within that territory , is contrary to the law of nations and the laws of war . The first thing to be remembered , in dealing with this ques* tion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership of real estate or of chattds , but a question about the rights and duties of persons . As in the view of the Constitution , so in the view of international law , slaves are persons and not things . Before the law of nature , the slave and his master are equal . The difference between them , in respect to rights , is a factitious difference created by arbitrary power , and not to be recognized save within the jurisdiction of the arbitrary power by which it was created . In the presence of war , the slave of an enemy has all the rights of an enemy if he takes his master 's side , // and you have the same rights against him that you have against his master . You have the same right to shoot him that you have to shoot his master in the same circumstances ; you have the same right to take him prisoner that you have to take his master ; and when he is your prisoner he has the same right with his master to honorable treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take your side , he is entitled to all the rights of a friend ; and if there is any offer or pledge , not inconsistent with humanity and natural justice , by which you can induce him to take your side , you have a right to employ that inducement . Had not so many of our politiciansand , I am sorry to add , so many of our lawyers-fallen into a perverse habit of assuming that slaves are always to be considered as property and not as persons , these propositions would seem too much like truisms to need anl proof from argument or from authority . The millions then of human beings who are now held in slavery under the pretended authority of the usurping governments within the area of the rebellion-what are they ? Not so many millions of property in the hands of private owners , but so many millions of a wronged and subject population who are the natural enemies of our enemies , and who therefore ougl3t to be our friends . The question is whether the President , wielding the military power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of * invite them to become our friends , and may strengthen the invitatiou with such offers of protection and of liberty as shall secure their confidence . If we were at war with the Austrian empire , and our armies were marching upon Yienna , might we rightfully call on the oppressed and discontented populations of that empire-Poles , Servians , Magyars  --  to become our friends , *iroclaiming ourselves their liberators , and pledging the honor of the United States for their protection ? I will not say that common sense can answer the question . Let me refer you to a most respectable authority . If you will turn to Gen. Halleck 's chapter on " Means and Instruments of War , " you will find him saying , " * 29 . It sometimes happens in war that intestine divisions prevail among the enemy 's forces , and that one party may favor the objects for which we are contending ; // in such cases we may , without scruple , hold correspondence with the one faction , and avail onrselves of its assistance to overthrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain the objects of the war , without seducing nay one to crime , or even becoming the partakers of treachery . The right to side with a faction in war is broadly different from the pretended right of forcible intervention in time of peace . A third party may side with the one or the other of the conflicting forces , just as he might in a war between separate and independent nations . If he have just cause of war against one of the parties , be may avail himself of the assistance of the other . " p. 410 . If we may thus take advantage of divisions " among the enemy 's forces , " and may even invite his discontented regiments to come over and fight on our side , pledging ourselves to make common cause with them against the common enemy ; how much more may we take a like advantage of divisions among the population under the power of that ememy , inviting the oppressed to receive us as their liberators , and guaranteeing to them whatever relief from their burdens may be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will not argue that in the case of our enslaved population there is a peculiarity which should restrain us from inviting them , by offers of freedom and protection , to become our friends in a war with the power that oppresses them . On this point the authority of Jefferson is quoted by Mr. Whiting . I take the liberty of repeating the quotation . Writing about the military operations of Lord Cornwallis in Virginia , Jeffemson said , " Having first taken what corn he wanted , he used , as was to be expected , all my stock of cattle , sheep and hens for the sustenance of his army , and carried off all the horses capable of service . He carried off also about thirty slaves . Had this been to give them freedom , he would have dane right . " I have happened to light on another , authority from the Virginia of the IRevolution , when the Old Dominion had great men . George Mason , the grandfather ( I believe ) of the rebel emissary now at London , said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having slaves was experienced during the late war . Had slaves been treated as they might have been by the enemy , they would have proved dangerous instruments in their bands . But their folly dealt by the slaves as it did by the Tories . " // But this citation of authorities is hardly necessary . The great testimony of Joim Quincy Adams concerning the belligerent right of proclaiming liberty to the slaves of an enemy is enough , and it is well known not only to those who remember the two several occasions on which it was uttered , and who have never forgotten what light it threw on the destiny of slavery in this country , but also to thousands of yonn6 men . It was my purpose to transcribe his testimony at large , but the necessary limits of this 1 etter , already too long ' forbid me to do what I intended . Large extracts from the two speechessix years apart-in which that most learned and accomplished statesman demonstrated , to the conviction of all thinking men in those days , what the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which an invasion and occupation of the slaveholding country by enemies of the United States must needs invest the national government ,  --  are given by Mr. Whiting , pp. 75-82 . The speeches are found entire in the Congressional Globe , 1 Sess . XXIV Cong . App. pp. 433-435 ; and 2 Sess . XXVII Cong . App. pp. 42 ( 3-429 . You can not forget , nor can you contradict , though you are careful not to quote , the terrible expression which the sagacious and eloquent old man thundered into the astonished ears of the house of Representatives in 1836 . " From the instant that your slaveholdin** states become the theater of a war , civil , servile , or foreign war , from that instant the war powers of Congress extend to interference with the institution of slavery in every way in which it can be interfered with , from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken or destroyed , to the cession of states burthened with slavery to a foreign power . " You have quoted  --  and let me assure you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reiterated declaration in 1842 , ( never contradicted till now ) , " that when a country is invaded , and two hostile armies are set in martial array , the commanders of both armies have power to emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory . " I need not recite the historic instances which he adduced i n confirmation of that statement . Let it suffice to write down here these emphatic words sanctioned by the most authoritative name in the history of our country ,  --  " I lay this down as the // law of nations . I say that military authority takes , for the time , the place of all municipal institutions , and slavery among the rest ; and that under that state of things , so far from its being true that the States where slavery exists have the exclusive management of the subject , not only the President of the United States , bat the commander of the army , has power to order the universal emancipation of slaves . " In strict conformity with the law of nations , considerately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " ordered the universal emancipation of slaves " in all the territory of the United States now held and occupied by a hostile military power . With a careful deference to state rights he has done far less than this authority assures us he might have done . Wherever there is any shadow or pretense of a state government acknowledging the Constitution as the supreme law of the land-wherever there is even a provisional government not at war with the United States , he ha* refused to interfere with the institution of slavery . But where there was , on the first of January , no government whatever , recognized by the United States , and therefore no government by which any portion of the population can be divested , in law , of any human right , there he has ordered the universal emancipation of slaves . ilad he a right to do so in the exercise of the powers with which he is constitutionally invested in time of war ? You have shown your discretion in argument by avoiding a direct conflict with the authority of John Quincy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assail the Proclamation with carping questions and criticisms about its effect now and after the war shall have ended . For example , you profess to be sorely puzzled " respecting what it proposes and is intended to accomplish . " You inquire whether the President intends merely to threaten the rebels , and you make a somewhat unfortunate attempt to ridicule the Proclamation in that view . After saying that your dog , if you had one , might bark at the moon , you proceed as follows : " The President may notify Queen Victoria that if she does not return Mason *nd Slidell within ninety days , he will proclaim in what part of her Indian doniinions the Sepoys shall be emancipated from the oppression to which they are // subjected . I doubt whether he would be liable to impeachment if , he should do such a foolish thing . But would her Majesty be very much alarmed by the notification except as it indicated hostility ? And if he should designate the limits , at the end of the ninety days , would the Sepoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it may relieve your sympathies to be informed that the Sepoys are neither slaves nor otherwise oppressed . They are nothing else than soldiers , of a dark complexion , voluntarily enlisted in her Majesty 's service for the support of her imperial government over their native country , wearing her uniform , and regularly paid with her money . Whoever else may be oppressed in her Majesty 's Indian empire , the Sepoys are not oppressed . Their wild and atrocious mutiny , a few years ago , was almost as inexcusable and insane as the secession of South Carolina . Allow me to suggest that a lawyer whose studies have been so exclusively professional that he does not know the meaning of the word Sepoy , may be justly eminent in his profession-ina*y be what Bartholine Saddletree wonld call " a claris8irnus 1ctu8 , " but he has little occasion to crow over the ignorance of clergymen in matters not pertaining directly to their profession . Let inc show you what your supposed case should have been , if you desired to make it in any degree analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a desperate war with Great Britain , if India were considered to be the most vulnerable portion of the British empire , if we had an immense armament in the Pacific ready to be precipitated upon the enemy at his weakest point , and if it were known that a blow at India would enlist the sympathies of all Europe on our side , then the President might proclaim that unless peace should be restored in ninety days he would carry the war . into India , and recognize the freedom and independence of the subjugated races there . Can you understand what would be the intent and bearing of such a proclamation ? You affect to inquire whether the Proclamation is to be regarded " as a measure of punishment ; - as a confiscation of slaves for the crime of rebellion or treason ? " Certainly you are at liberty to call it " a measure of punishment , " if you please , though it is not punishment in the sense of the courts // of law . It is punishment of the rebellion in the same sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the turning of the Mississippi from its channel , and the deluging of a territory larger and richer than many an oldworld principality , are a punishment . It is a measure of hostility against the implacable enemies of the United States ,  - -  who have established themselves upon onr soil by military violence , and who are at this moment ocenpying a large portion of our territory ,  --  a measure designed to weaken them , to distress them , to subdue them , and to expel them forever from our conntry . The immediate effect and bearing of the proclamation as a measure of hostility seem to me quite intelligible . ( i ) Wherever our military power shall be established within the area of the rebellion as it was defined on the first of January last , the freedom of every inhabitant , without distinction , is to be immediately recognized by all military and naval officers and by all persons under their command or control . ( 2 . ) Wherever the rebel power which now holds the slaves in subjection shall be expelled by victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its place will recognize no man as the owner of another , and will admit into its administration of justice no violation of the principle that the laborer is worthy of his hire . ( 3 . ) In all capitulations for the surrender of towns and districts heretofore held by the enemy , whatever the stipulations may be in behalf of private property , there will be no stipulation by which any man will be recognized as the property of another , or which shall compromise the liberty of those whom the proclamation pronounces free . ( 4 . ) Through all the waning fortunes of the rebellion , the holders of slaves and the non-slaveholding whites , thr*ughout the rebel states , will understand that the military power of the Union has recognized their slaves as men , whose wrongs are to be considered and whose inalienable ri*lit to liberty is to be secured in the final adjustment of the conflict . ( u . ) What is of more com sequence than all the rest is that the Maves and the free black people who heretofore have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the greatest possible interest in our success . For example , at the commencement of the war , there // was , in the State of South Carolina , an aggregate population of *03,70S , of whom only 291,388 were white in law . The remaining 412,320 ( including 9,914 free blacks or people of color ) had indeed a contingent and conjectural interest in the coniflict , for their instincts taught them that God might have sent in that awful whirlwind the angel of their deliverance . They had , therefore , an interest in the conflict , but they had no interest in the restoration of the Union . Nay , their interest was really adverse to such victories on our part as would have crushed the rebellion in its earlier stages . They could understand ( what you recognize as an inevitable incident of the war ) that , during the continuance of hostilities , as many of them as might come within our lines , though liable to indignity and cruelty from a certain class of soldiers and officers , would probably not be returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their freedom . But to them our early and complete success would be ( as you think that constitutionally and legally it ought still to be ) the closing of that door of hope . Here then is the force and bearing of the proclamation as a measure of hostility against the rebellion . It gives to the more than four hundred thousand slaves and free people of color , in South Carolina , a far greater interest in the suppression of the rebellion and the restoration of the national authority , than the less than three hundred thousand white people can possibly have in any other result . Its bearing is the same in other States . It seems to me that this very simple view of what the proclamation is in its present effect and bearing , as a measure for the conquest of the rebellion and the restoration of the Union , refutes the entire argument in yo*ir sixth letter , which has had the honor of being circulated as a tract under the patronage , as I suppose , of the Pelmonico Society for the diffusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious and most important relation to the progress and the early termination of the war-if it has an effect not only within our military lines but far in advance of our armies-if it facilitates all our hostile operations by giving us some millions of most interested friends in the territory held by our enemies  --  the entire argmuent which you build on the assump // tion that the proclamation is to take effect only after the close of the war , must fall to the ground . As to what will be after the war is ended , and particularly how the legal status of those who have been slaves is to be adjusted without infringing the reserved rights of the States nuder the Constitution , allow me to say that I think yon need not be troubled . The end is not yet ; and this is eminently one of the cases in which it is wise to " take no thought for the morrow , " and in which " the morrow will take thought for the things of itself . " Many things will have come to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the territory it has ravaged be restored to the Union and subjected to the normal and peaceful administration of government . You see what has happened in West Virginia , where the people , finding themselves emancipated by war from the domination of the slaveholding interest , have freely decreed , in their recovered sovereignty , the abolition of slavery . Just that thing you may be sure will happen elsewhere in the process of restablishing the Union . For example , when the rebellion shall have been extinguished in Virginia , and a loyal convention of delegates from the people shall sit in the capitol at IRichmond to reorganize the State after so long an interregnum , think you that Letcher , and Wise , and Mason , and others like them , will have seats in that convention ? Not at all ! Before such a convention can be elected , the loyal people in Virginia will have accepted the emancipation of the slaves and the final abolition of slavery as inevitable facts ; and the whole race of aristocratic conspirators against liberty , who have brought such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become forever infamous there . Please to recollect that there is already a Governor of Virginia who is not Letcher , and who is recognized in that character not only by the President , but also by the Senate and the House of Representatives . When the Government de jare , now represented by Governor Pierpont at Alexandria , or some more obscure locality , shall have become the government defacto at IRichmnond , there will be no quarreling with the stubborn fact that the emancipation of the slaves has been an incidental yet // inevitable and irreversible result of the war . In that regenerated Virginia , baptized and purified with lire , the reserved right of the State to determine the legal condition and relations of its inhabitants will not be employed in the insane attempt to obtain a perpetual entailment of poverty and barbari*m by re*nslaving an emancipated peasantry . Think what must be the process of restoring the Constitution , and re&amp;*stablishing the constitutionally guaranteed form of government , and the constitutionally limited sovereignty of the State , in South Carolina . First , there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be raised whether the military emancipation of the slaves , as proclaimed on the first of January , 1863 , was valid . iRegiments of freedmen , under a rigid military discipline , will garrison the forts , will guard the cnstom-houses , will protect the cities against insurrection , and will ensure public order . A new population , with new capital , new ideas and habits , will begin to take the place of rebels , banished or emigrating in disgust . Slowly and quietly , thought , speech , industry , enterprise , domestic arrangements , and all the relations of society , will begin to be adjusted to the new basis . Instead of the relation of owner and slave there will spring " p the relations of landlord and peasant , of employer and employed , of master and free servant . If some of the freedmen become disorderly and fall into habits of idleness and vagrancy , the provisional government will deal with them and make them know that their subsistence is to be earned by their labor . While these processes of adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish the possibility of even an attempt to reestablish slavery . And whenever the time shall have come for a convention to reconstitute the state government , the liberty of those who were once slaves will have become an immovable fact to which the policy of the restored and re*3stablished State will be freely adjusted , even though the adjustment be attended with regrets for the system that has perished . The process of re*nslaving , after the return of pcace , a population that has been emancipated by war , has not often been attempted ; nor am I aware that its success in any instance has been such as to encourage a new experiment in that direction . The prospect of that " good time coming " which you seem to anticipate so cheerfully , when // the rebel states , restored to their places in the Union , shall enter on the enterprise of redncing to slavery again the millions emancipated by the military power of the nation , does not impress me as particularly brilliant . I do not forget the possibility that another President may repudiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget the possibility that a future Congress may depart from the policy sanctioned by the one which has just expired . Nor do I forget the possibility that the question whether the people to whom the proclamation offers freedom are legally free , may be brought to an issue in the Courts of law . Doubtless an unpreceden ted crop of law snits will be among the consequences of this war , and y on may reasonably expect that some litigated case may turn upon that question . If such a case were to be decided by the same judges who falsified law and history for the sake of denying justice to Dred Scott , it would probably be decided to your satisfaction . But the Supreme Court of the United States is not now , and will never again be , what it was when Judge Curtis threw off his judicial robe and resigned his seat in disgust . Certain preliminaries too must be transacted , before time question of dooming to slavery the millions to whom the proclamation offers liberty can be judicially decided . The war must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution must be established in the States whose government under the Constitution has been abolished for the time by the enemy . These preliminaries will not be completed without taking time . After that lapse of time , the Supreme Court will be , yet more than now , unlike what it was when , to mark the inauguration of President Buchanan as an epoch in our history , the Dred Scott decision , having been prepared for the occasion , startled the country like an earthquake . I can not think that you are really expecting to see the legal invalidity of the proclamation established by any such method . Does not your argm'nent assume rather that the war is to be ended by negotiation and compromise , and that the re*nslaving of the emancipated millions is to be part of the bargain ? I have never intimated-nor do I now imply-that you are one of those traitors at heart who are laboring to save the rebellion // from its fate by compelling the Government to negotiate for a peace . But , as T have already said more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me who they are ? They are the men who in their conventions resolve that the Constitution has been violated by the admission of West Virginia as a State , because , forsooth , though the loyal legislature of Virginia which the Government has recognized in every way , and which has sent two senators into Congress , gave consent to the division of their State , John Letcher and the parliament of traitors over whom he presides at Richmond have not consented . I do not charge that you are one of them , for you seem to hold that the loyal citizens within the boundaries of a rebel State are the State , and that though they be no more than two or three in number , their rights and powers , as a State nuder the Constitution , are never in abeyance . Yet your argument seems to expect that the war is to terminate in some other way than by the conquest and complete subjugation of the rebels . If we are to have a Congress which will stop the supplies , which Will compel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels can take breath , which will permit the rebel power to be represented by delegates in a convention called for the purpose of revising the Constitution and reconstructing the Un ion , I can suppose that the proclamation will pass for nothing , and that your questions about its effect on the legal 8talUS of the slaves now actually held by the so-called Confederates will be considered unanswerable . You take it as a personal wrong to yourself when I say , of the men who are thus endeavoring to obtain peace by negotiation and compromise between the United States and " the Confederates , " that they " expect nothing else , and intend nothing else , than some . concession to the rebels which shall either divide the Union or subvert the Constitution . " I have disavowed , more than once , any intention of putting that ituputation upon you . But let me , in closing this letter , cornmend to your serious attention the dire alternative to which you and I , and all our fellow-citizens of the United States , are brought . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally , by war ; or we must make a compromise with it , and take such terms of peace as we can // get . The question comes to every citizen  --  and let me say , respectfully , it comes to you , Which side of this alternative do you take ? To end the war by negotiation and compromise is to despair of the republic . It is to concede the principle that a party , or a combination of interests , which can not achieve its wishes by votes , may resort to arms . It is to abandon the primary idea of our national self-government . Peace by such a method is the ruin of the republic founded by our fathers . Are you for such a peace ? If you are the man I suppose you to be , you abhor the thought . The other side , then , of the alternative , is your position . You are for crushing this rebellion , completely and forever , by prosecuting to the end the war which it has inaugurated . But let inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical sense , to understand that this war can not be prosecuted to a successful result by any half-measures of hostility . Halfmeasures in war are cruelty as well as imbecility . They are treacherous to the cause in which they are employed . I have lately heard a story of a good old woman in the revolutionary war , whose son was drafted for a soldier , and who charged him , as she buckled on his knapsack , " Now , Johnny , do you take care that you do n't exasperate the enemy . " Let us be thankful that our old women in these days , with the exception , perhaps , of some whose garments are made by tailors and not by mantua-makers , have better sense than that . Within the last two years ; we have learned-all of us-tliat if we would bring this war to an early and prosperous close , if we would save and perpetuate our republic , with all those interests of universal humanity and of the kingdom of God among men which are involved in. the well-being of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must use every instrument and method of hostility not forbidden by the rules of civilized warfare . It is too late in the day for Johnny , whoever he may be , to come from his mother with the sage counsel that this or that expedient of lawful war must not be employed for fear of exasperating the enemy . You have been kind enough to bestow upon me much of the wisdom and learning acquired in your profession . Though I can make , from my poverty , no adequate return of professional // lore , II may say that my studies , which are in kind the studies proper to every Christian , have accustomed me to think of this national agony as related to interests that transcend the sphere of jurisprudence . That the hideous injustice which has been heretofore the basis of society in so many of our States , should stand forever , was impossible ; becanse there is a God whose providence governs the world in the interest of righteousness . Had a peaceful reformation been permitted-had the free thought and speech , the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to grapple with the local wrong-that wrong might have yielded to the gradual and peaceful force of moral influences . But no such reformation was permitted . Year by year the stupendous iniquity , defying the moral sense of the world , and reeking to heaven , has grown more insolent , more rapacious , more atheistic . Meanwhile the mysterions forces which God has incorporated with the being of human society , and of which in their action and reaction all human history is the record , have been slowly working ; and now we see the beginning of the end . The great day of God 's wrath against that wickedness has come . In his righteous providence the system of organized wrong which those States have permitted to rule over them , has wrought out a natural vengeance on them and on itself . It has involved them in the miseries of a war which never can end till the iniquity itself has perished . In that war we are simply defendmng ourselves , our laws , our national unity , our Constitution , our glorious heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave this goodly heritage to our children , without doing God 's work of vengeance . The veng*ance is not ours but his . We have assumed no right of interyention in the long-pending issue between the oppressors and the oppressed , but God has shut us up to the necessity of doing his work . If we quit ourselves like men in the great agony of this crisis-if we do , in all fidelity and fearlessness , our own work of self defense-if we do not basely betray our country to its enemies  --  the slaves can not but be emancipated .
