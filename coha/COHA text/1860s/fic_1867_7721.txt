Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : O God ! in thy autumnal skies from " O God ! in thy autumnal skies " ( 1867 ) O God ! in thy autumnal skies The dying woodlands glow and flame ; And , wheresoe'er we turn our eyes , All-conquering Life ! we trace thy name . Bright emblem of that tranquil faith Whose evening beams " Good-morrow " give , Each leaf , transfigured , mutely saith , " As dying , and , behold ! we live . " God of the living ,  --  not the dead ! Like autumn leaves we fade and flee ; Yet reigns eternal spring o'erhead , Where souls for ever live to Thee . From that pure upper world to-day A hallowed memory meets us here ,  --  A presence lighting all our way With heavenly thoughts and lofty cheer ; A mind whose luminous vision woke Man 's better soul with kindling might , When that calm voice , inspiring , spoke For Truth and Liberty and Right ; A power that still uplifts the age , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from many a glowing page , That lives in many a godly life . Blest spirit ! with the kindred band Of saints and seers , the sons of light , Still cheer us through this earthly land With tidings from the heavenly height . Oh , help us meekly , bravely tread The path of righteousness and love , Till , joined to all the immortal dead , We walk in cloudless light above !
