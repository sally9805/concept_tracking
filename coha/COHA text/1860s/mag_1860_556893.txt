ART . II . - The Ways and Means of Payment : a full Analysis of the Credit System , with its various Modes of Adlustment . By STEPHEN COLWELL . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. 1859. 8vo. pp. xii . and 644 . NOTWITHSTANDING the vast labor and ingenuity expended by men of all classes - of a practical as well as philosophical turn of mind - upon the " Currency Question , " the principles which are involved in it , whatever they may be , are still to be considered , according to one of the latest writers upon the subject , as " desiderata , " and as matters about which inquiry has not by any means been exhausted . It is indeed natural to suppose , that a series of phenomena , the formuhe of which are handled by almost every one in his daily transactions , and recognized as bases for the most extensive and important operations , would be understood as things of course , about which elucidation must be entirely wasted ; but that the essential elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with its use , is sufficiently apparent from a survey of the peculiarly empirical views promulgated of late in various quarters . Nor are these views confined to those among whom we should not be at all surprised to find them . After exhausting all the very extensive means of inquiry in the possession of her Majesty 's government , Sir Robert Peel procured the passage of the famous Currency Act of 1844 ( embracing the Bank of England ) , which has been denounced in the most unequivocal terms by those to whom we now look as correct expounders of the system ; and one of the most remarkable disputes upon record , in which were engaged , without bringing the point to a settlement , such men as Francis Homer and William lluskisson , to say nothing of many others of the highest eminence as men of business in the great commercial centre of London , was the celebrated controversy whether , during the twenty-five years ' suspension of the Bank of England , a depreciation had taken place in gold , or in the bank 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar ha- // 323 bility to error in the discussion of this class of questions , and while the principles on which they depend are still open to debate , we may welcome every new contribution , which we are certain has been , like the book before us , the result of careful and unwearied investigation . " It is taken for granted , " says our author in his Introduction , " that whilst there are so many conflicting opinions on the subject of money , currency , banking , and credit , - that whilst both theory and practice remain in doubt and dispute , and no authority high enough to settle those differences has yet appeared , - there is room for the labors of those who may wish to furnish materials for the final adjustment of many vexed questions. ** The first broad principle to be understood in any theory of the currency , is the entire separation of Money from Credit , whatever form credit may bear , whether that of bank-notes , promissory notes , bills of exchange , or any other kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the use of money causes no change in the relative exchange value of commodities inter Se . There has been adopted in all civilized nations what we may term a nomenclature in respect of money , in which accounts are kept and prices stated . In the United States this nomenclature is dollars and cents ; in England , pounds , shillings , and pence ; and in France , francs and centimes . This is the money of account . When we write or say that the price of a commodity is fifty dollars , we convey a perfectly intelligible idea ; and if this commodity can be exchanged for fifty dollars in the market , its price and its value are synonymous . But it may be asked , How have we arrived at the knowledge that fifty dollars is the value of this thing ? In saying that it is worth fifty dollars , we have not taken into consideration the weight or quantity of coined gold that is contained in fifty dollars . If the commodity is a manufactured product , its value is calculated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for the labor , so many for the use of the machinery , and so many for the market rate of profit ; which sums together make up the fifty dollars . Now , as we have said , the quantity or weight of gold has not entered into the calculation at all ; we make use merely of the nomenclature , - the money of account . How , then , do we // April , MONEY AND CREDIT . know that the dollars which we have paid for the raw material and the labor , and have calculated for the other factors of the value , are in reality equivalents for them , so that their aggregate is the equivalent for the finished commodity ? There is no way to determine this question on just grounds , but by a return to first principles . Let us suppose a community in which there is no medium to effect exchanges , no generally recognized nomenclature like a money of account to express prices and values . Under this condition of things , a man can arrive at no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparison of the relative amounts of labor it has taken to produce any number of different commodities . But as this process would be found very tedious , and would need to be renewed on different data with every new exchange , it would be manifestly of advantage if some commodity could be introduced , of a value as nearly as possible permanent , with which all other commodities could be compared , and therefore compared with one another . Then , if a certain portion of this commodity cost ten days ' labor , all other commodities which cost ten days ' labor would be exchanged for it , all commodities which cost one day 's labor would be exchanged for one tenth of it , and so on ; and as this commodity might be assumed to be generally acceptable , by taking it in exchange for commodities in hand , other articles of desire could readily be procured by means of it . But suppose that , instead of speaking of definite quantities of this commodity , and continually comparing other articles with those quantities , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should divide this commodity into convenient parts , and invest each of those parts with a name ; it would then be necessary , in case an article were worth the quantity contained in one of those parts , to say that it was worth the name of that part ; and where there was a general consent to express values in the same nomenclature , it would become a general habit to refer value to those names , without any mental reference to the quantities or intrinsic value of the things for which they stood . We have thus arrived at a distinction between the nomenclature of money - the money of account - and the material // 325 1860. of money . When this nomenclature has come into general use , relative values may be expressed in it to any amount whatsoever , by means of the numerals 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. , as we express in algebra relative values by 1 x , 2 x , 3 x , etc. , without any reference to the intrinsic value of x . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still exist the same necessity for a nomenclature to keep accounts and express prices . In this case the nomenclature might be , as well as in the other , dollars and cents , provided it were generally understood that the dollar of account was the representative of 23-h grains of fine gold . But it would then be necessary to weigh or assay whatever coins might be in circulation , to ascertain what portion of them , or how many of them , contained 23 ! grains of fine gold . A money of account would be as efficient under these conditions as under a fixed and certain process of coinage ; for whatever coins were in circulation would soon come themselves to be expressed in the money of account , as so many dollars or parts of a dollar , and relative values of commodities would be equally well understood , even though there were , in point of fact , no such coin in existence as the dollar , containing 23-h- grains of fine gold . Such , we apprehend , is the idea which our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elucidation of which he has devoted about seventy pages of his book ; but while considering this point , we have been perplexed with the inquiry whether it is , in point of fact , worthy of so much attention , - whether the theory of the currency is at all illumined thereby , excepting so far as it was merely necessary to state the fact , - and whether the laborious reasoning of this treatise is anything more than a mere logomachy expended upon a subject intrinsically trivial ; and we have been compelled to conclude that the writer has followed the idea to conclusions which it does not justify , and has given it altogether too prominent a place . He says : " The credit system could not exist for a day , but by the aid of a money of account . It can dispense with the use of the precious metals to a very great extent ; but it can not operate at all but through the agency of a money of account . " This is undoubtedly true , - as true as 28* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day without a language in which to express them . They are both truisms , and need no more than a simple statement in order to be understood . But when our author says , in the very next sentence to the above extract , " During the suspension of specie payments in Great Britain , between 1797 and 1822 , the entire payments of the country , in all transactions above the merest retail trade , were made under the operation and by the devices of the credit system , " - this is not an argument ad rem at all , nor does it follow from any previous reasoning with regard to a money of account ; it is merely the statement of the phenomenon of business being carried on by an inconvertible currency , which currency was expressed in the commercial nomenclature , - the money of account . We shall have occasion to refer to this historical fact more fully hereafter . But it is proper to remark in this place , that in the passage quoted the fundamental distinction between a convertible and an inconvertible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of account , when in fact there is no such dependence whatever in any tangible form ; money of account being merely an expression of money , and the distinction between it and money being as well marked as that between language and ideas . Our author next occupies himself with a consideration of the use of gold and silver as money , apart from the use of credit substitutes . Gold and silver are the equivalents of the commodities for which they may be exchanged ; and they are so because of their intrinsic value , and not because they are made into coins . Coinage is the mere agency introduced , to obviate the trouble of weighing the gold and silver at each transaction . It does not invest those commodities with any additional value ; it is simply the means by which they are made to pass the more readily from hand to hand , and to conduct the greater number of transactions . In this connection we can not avoid calling attention to a manifest desideratum which in the progress of political improvement will perhaps be accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some such measure seems to be the necessary complement of the idea of coinage . The relations of the commercial world // seem at this time to favor in a peculiarly fortunate degree such a step ; commerce binds the nations together in an almost indissoluble union , and the rapidity of communication brings them as near to one another as the different provinces of the same country . A congress for the universal regulation of currency would be an act only in perfect keeping with the singular progression in utilitarian enterprises of the nineteenth century . The extraordinary confusion which may be produced by a multiplicity of mints is happily depicted in the volume before us . " Germany alone had sixty-eight mints , each with its separate coinage and regulations . When all the gold and silver coins , with their subdivisions from sixty-eight mints , were circulating over a territory no larger than Germany , it can readily be conceived what a nuisance this variety became in business . But when this nuisance was enhanced by a due proportion of counterfeits , by the abrasion , clipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imagined how intolerable the burden became . The complaint was loud and bitter , and projects for reform abounded ; a system to be uniform not only throughout Germany , but Europe , was earnestly demanded . The same evil induced the establishment of banks of deposit in Holland . " In urging upon the public his proposal of a convention of delegates from the various governments of Europe , to devise a uniform mode and system of coinage , Scaruffi placed before his readers the whole mischief in bold relief . The director of the mint in Reggio , however , could not move the authorities of that day by his logic , nor by his position ; and he lacked the power which INapoleon applied to the subject more than two centuries after , when he introduced a uniform coinage into Italy . No sooner had the power of the French Emperor ceased to be felt in Italy , however , than the Pope , and other princes , commenced the old system of multifarious coinage , the evils of which are now seriously felt : Do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dtrangers et les voyageurs mais m*me les banquiers et marchands Italiens. " ' - p. 106 , note . There has been a great deal of unnecessary contention among economists with regard to the attributes of money as a measure and standard of value , and many objections have been forcibly urged against the ascribing of such properties to money . Gold and silver , like all other commodities , vary in their value according to the abundance or scarcity with which // they are produced ; it is therefore represented as absurd to consider them as measures or standards of value , the idea of which terms must necessarily be connected with something invariable . Moreover , in commercial transactions money is bought with commodities , in the same way in which commodities are bought with money ; money therefore is not a measure of other commodities any more than they are a measure of money . Such arguments as these against the employment of the expressions alluded to are strongly dwelt upon by our author . He says - " The precious metals are in no proper sense a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being of very great value in small compass , susceptible of being brought to uniform quality , and of being subdivided into pieces or coins of any required weight . " - p. 124 . Again - " Another attribute frequently given to the precious metals is , that they are a standard of value . This is equally inaccurate . There may be a common equivalent , - an article that is commonly given in exchange for other articles ; but there can be no standard of the value of all articles of merchandise . Every commodity may have its standard of quality , - a certain grade being assumed , with which all other specimens are to be compared ; but no article can be assumed or regarded as a standard for other things of a totally different kind . Gold can not , in the mint , be made the standard for silver ; nor can silver be made the standard for gold . Much less , taking the whole range of articles of human consumption , can there be any standard of value or price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be compared . " - p. 125 . Let us examine for a moment the assertion that " the precious metals are in no proper sense a measure of value . " In connection with this matter there are two points which we believe were first enunciated in a distinct form by John Stuart Mill ; namely , that money , or the precious metals , must be a measure of commodities at the same time and place ; and that they must be a measure at different times and places , if we are provided with the necessary data . That the precious metals are a mc*asnre of commodities at the same time and place , may very easily be shown ; for they must at any one time possess the same value relatively to one commodity that they do to all , // as they do not fluctuate in value from day to day , like other commodities , but their fluctuations are extended over long periods of time , and are not visible at one given moment . In this sense , therefore , money is not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be attained , however , with regard to the precious metals , is not to provide a positive measure , but data by which comparisons may be instituted between commodities ; and in this relative sense they are a measure , not only at the same time and place , but at different times and places . To illustrate this principle Mr. Mill introduces the following example - " If wheat is now fifty shillings the quarter , and a fat sheep the same , and if in the time of Henry the Second wheat was twenty shillings and a sheep ten , we know that a quarter of wheat was then worth two sheep , and is now only worth one , and that the value therefore of a sheep , estimated in wheat , is twice as great as it was then ; quite independently of the value of money at the two periods , either in relation to those two articles ( in respect of which we suppose it to have fallen ) , or to other commodities , in respect to which we need not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we apprehend , applies to the term standard of value . If the value of a horse , for instance , is a hundred dollars , and of a cow fifty dollars , by the standard of the United States , the fact that the horse has twice the value of the cow is not altered by any change that may take place in the standard . For if we suppose the standard to be depreciated one half , then by the same standard the horse will be of the value of two hundred dollars , and the cow of the value of one hundred dollars ; their relative value being the same as before . We may further illustrate this principle as follows . Suppose that the length of one field is a hundred feet , and of another field fifty feet . If by some unaccountable means the foot , the unit of the measure of length , should become twice its former length , and if both fields were lengthened in the same proportion , the essentials of the case would remain the same . Now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with every expansion and contraction in their value , all other commodities expand and contract in a like proportion , and therefore preserve their relative value . // While , however , we contend for the principle , we do not affirm that the terms measure and standard , used in a positive sense , are the most appropriate terms that could be found to express the essential qualities involved in the principle . If the essentially relative character of the terms could be always kept before the mind , no harm would grow out of their use ; but as it can not be hoped that disputants will always preserve this qualification , some modification of terms may perhaps be desirable . Yet we can not perceive that this desideratum would be obtained by calling the precious metals a " standard of payment , " as our author suggests . The essentials of the case are not altered in our view , either in fact or in meaning , by this modification . Standard of payment is a totally different idea from standard of value . A standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of the science , conclude to call it , must be a valuable material ; a standard of payment may not be a material at all , it may be merely an inconvertible currency . *Te are aware that all the arguments we have cited would be referred by our author to " the want of attention to the functions of a money of account . " But we have seen that the money of account is not a thing , but a nomenclature ; or rather a formula which conforms to the conditions of things , and not the things to it ; and if the money of account is merely a formula to facilitate , or to exhibit in a universally understood form , the relations of commodities , it has no bearing whatever upon those relations themselves . Money is also spoken of as a medium of exchange . But if we survey the actual course of commercial operations , we shall find that there are perhaps ninety-five exchanges which take place without money in esse being used at all , to five in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - or , as it has been expressed in a scientific formula , the expenditure of incomes , - that gold and silver are used as a medium . In all wholesale business the balances of many series of transactions are paid in gold and silver ; for the separate transactions no money passes , but merely securities in the shape of checks or the larger denominations of banknotes , which , being drawn on or from one bank , immediately // 331 form the materiel of deposits in some other . Under the Clearing-House system , transactions amounting to many millions daily are cancelled by the final payment of not more than five per cent of gold . The theory of our author with regard to the use of the precious metals as a medium is , that where they are not absolutely employed in exchange they are of no utility . " Whatever indefinite ideas some may entertain upon this subject , " he says , " the real use of coins gold and silver is merely that in which we see them employed . Though every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , yet this is almost never done . When not so exacted , the payment is made in some other satisfactory way . " He believes that , in all those transactions into which money does not enter , commodity directly pays for commodity , not through the medium of money , but of the expedients of the credit system ; that the measure , or whatever it may be called , which serves to make the extent of these transactions apparent , is the money of account , without any reference to gold and silver ; that , inasmuch as the whole of the vast business of England , including the payment and receipt of the revenue , was carried on for twenty-five years with an inconvertible currency , this is prima facie evidence that a currency may be so regulated as to dispense entirely in large transactions with the use of gold and silver as a centre of oscillation , and that by the proper adjustment of the credit system this end may be in effect accomplished . But without taking any prospective view of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of transactions under consideration - that is , exchanges where gold and silver do not pass at every step - take place without money is esse , they do not take place without money to which each of the exchanging parties has a right , if he should choose to assert it ; and if there were any detriment of the parties from the use of the economical expedients , as they are called , that is , if the expedients did not transact the business as satisfactorily as it could be transacted by money , the money would be demanded and used . But if any one can buy the same amount of commodities , and on the same terms , with a banknote // or a check , that he could buy with the same amount of metallic money , he will not take the trouble of drawing the metallic money . Therefore , where confidence is so exerted as to invest these expedients with the full force and effect of gold and silver , their use , as being more convenient , and more conducive to commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not , in the strict sense of the term , the medium of exchange in wholesale transactions , it is undoubtedly the basis upon which all those transactions are conducted , and without which , or some generally acknowledged security equivalent to it , the economical substitutes might be multiplied to an extent utterly subversive of the healthy condition of the commercial community , as was witnessed in the Continental money of the United Colonies of North America , and in the assignats of France . With regard to the idea that commodity is exchanged for commodity more directly under the system which obtains in the wholesale trade than in the retail trade , we have only to say , that commodity virtually pays for commodity , even where the medium is entirely gold and silver , and certainly where the medium in the retail trade is bank-notes . The difference between the two classes of transactions is only one of form . In the process of clearing , we see a series of receipts ranged on one hand , and of payments on the other , and instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt and payment , it passes only once , when an ultimate balance between these receipts and payments is struck . The ownership of the gold and silver is continually transferred by a written instrument , until it finally rests with the merchant or the banker , who has no corresponding debt to cancel with it . Now if we could imagine the gold and silver absolutely passing from one to another at each of the transfers , although the process would be infinitely more cumbrous , it would be the same in principle : it is the knowledge that the gold and silver can be eventually procured , that gives to these transactions their whole efficacy ; and if at any stage any instrument should be found among the rest which had no claim to the gold and silver , it would not be able to make a transfer ; and if any banking institution should not be able to pay the ultimate balance in gold and silvor , this // 333 would be equivalent to bankruptcy . These principles are sufficient to show that , under the present system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides that in which we see them immediately employed . They are like the fortifications of a city , which in a time of peace seem utterly useless , yet in a state of siege may be the only means of safety . But leaving out of view all other and minor considerations , a monetary system in which gold and silver are not the base of transactions amounts in point of fact to an inconvertible currency . Now an inconvertible currency may be as effective as a convertible one , provided it is kept under the same restraint . In any community where bank-notes and gold and silver circulate alongside of each other , the bank-notes are as effectual for all exchanges as gold and silver ; and would be as effectual even in a state of inconvertibility , provided they were a substitution for a part , and not an addition to the whole of the currency . Thus suppose the circulation of a country were ordinarily a hundred million dollars , half of which was in bank-notes , and half metallic ; if one half of the metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as the metallic currency would do , - that is , were never in excess , - such issues would be as effectual , and as little liable to fluctuation , as the metallic money . But without the check of convertibility , here lies the peril . The temptation to issue such a currency is too strong to be resisted . The value of every commodity depends temporarily upon the quantity offered for sale . If more is offered than can find buyers , it must inevitably fall in salable value . Now , inasmuch as money in every transaction is as truly bought with the thing for which it is exchanged , as that thing is bought with the money , an order of events may come about by which there may be too much money offered for sale , or for exchange , as well as too much of anything else . But when money is gold and silver , if too much is offered , so as to reduce its exchange value , the surplus will very quickly retire from the market ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a greater power of purchase . What is true of gold and silver is true also of an inconvertible // MONEY AND CREDIT . currency , where it is the sole currency , and is possessed at its first issue of a factitious or a conventional value . Its actual value will depend on the quantity of the inconvertible paper in the market seeking to be sold , or , what is the same thing , seeking to buy commodities , - with this difference , that in the case of gold and silver , if the quantity is in excess , the surplus quickly retires from circulation by well-known processes , while with the inconvertible currency there is no such provision to restore an equilibrium ; what is once issued must stay there , and the excessive quantity will cause a depreciation of the whole . In the commonly used formula an inconvertible currency has no regulator of its value but its quantity ; and where there is not the continual convertible check , such a currency is always liable to be depreciated by excess . If it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1797 to 1822 are a striking refutation of this argument , we can perhaps best reply in the language of one who was a witness of the actual operation of that financial measure , and was possessed of a knowledge and judgment capable of seeing through its evils in the midst of all its apparent success . We allude to Mr. Fullarton , from whose work on the Regulation of Currencies , called forth by the agitation in relation to the Currency Act of 1844 , the following extract is taken . " There is not , I believe , a single example on record , of the power of creating money out of cheap materials having been exercised by a sovereign state for any length of time , or through any season of public difficulty , without having been abused . So long as the whole supplies of the year are raised by means of taxes and loans , no great mischief can befall ; for the paper which the state issues in its payments will , in that case , all flow back again regularly in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus left to accumulate in the hands of the public . But say , that the nation is once embarked in a destructive and expensive war , with little prospect of bringing it soon to a termination , - that the revenues are failing , the government at its wits ' end to discover some new tax that will supply the deficiency , and the impatience of such exactions on the part of the people already at its height , - the temptation to substitute issues for taxation , to relieve the wants of the treasury , by intercepting , through the depreciation of the currency , a portion of every payment in its // transit from the pocket , of the debtor to that of his creditor , becomes too strong to be resisted , and the iniquity is , probably , perpetrated with the general acquiescence of a community , who are scarcely aware of its tendency . The career of debasement once entered upon , it has no pause till there is scarcely any value left to be destroyed . And if , in this country , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the same disastrous consequences which attended the issues of the Mississippi notes and the assigna ts in France , and of the several paper currencies put forth by the principal states of Northern Europe , it was because the inconvertible notes were disbursed , not in the payments of a government , but in the loans of a bank ; because the vast resources of the nation enabled the government , to the last , to raise all its supplies either by taxes or by loan ; and because , whether the Bank of England advanced its funds to government or to individuals , no impediment ever arose to the punctual return of those funds into its coffers . Much credit has been claimed for the moderation and self-denial with which the directors of the bank exercised the very extraordinary powers intrusted to them , and to which are attributed the very different results of their administration of a currency of inconvertible paper from those which have attended all similar enterprises , - nor have I any wish to detract from that credit ; but the truth is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarities of its own constitution , and by the whole financial system of the state , - a fortuitous and fortunate combination of precautions , which nearly precluded the possibility of its committing any great error , however it might have been inclined , and without which all the moderation and self-denial of its directors might have been exerted in vain . " Under the most favorable aspect of the case , we must conelude , therefore , that , without a basis of gold and silver , the safety of commercial operations is placed in imminent peril , and that the speculative views which Mr. Colwell has advanced with regard to commercial transactions as capable of being carried on as effectually without as with a metallic basis , through the medium of credit , are applicable ( and are no doubt so intended by him ) to an order of events and a perfection of exchanges which has not as yet been reached . When a principle of limitation shall have been discovered equivalent in its operation to the check provided by a metallic basis , such speculations may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far our author 's reasoning with regard to a money of account , a measure and standard of value , and some phenomena arising from the use of the precious metals in commercial transactions ; but we have not yet inquired into the nature of the economical expedients to which the credit system has given rise . Metallic money is an expensive agent , which is used only when some economical expedient can not be used as well , and exchanges are effected and operations carried on as effectually by the use of those expedients as by the money itself . But it is important , before advancing any further , that we should mark the radical distinction between money and these credit substitutes for money . Money is either gold and silver , or inconvertible paper possessed of a conventional value . Neither bank-notes , promissory notes , bills of exchange , nor any other circulating medium , come up to the designation of money . They are merely substitutes , some of them very effectual ones , it is true , but still mere tickets for the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theorists , " as they were called in the great controversies to which their peculiar views gave rise , and who in 1844 , with Colonel Torrens , Mr. Jones Loyd ( now Lord Overstone ) , and Mr. Norman at their head , were instrumental in procuring the passage of the act of 1844 , selected the banknote from the mass of circulating obligations of the credit system as money par excellence , to the exclusion of all other credit instruments , and were led by that assumption into some extravagant theories respecting prices , which were most luminously refuted by Mr. Tooke and Mr. Fullarton . " You can not , " says Mr. Fullarton , in the work already quoted , " include the bank-note under the generic designation of money , without finding yourself immediately embarrassed by the claims of bills of exchange , bankers ' checks , and a variety of other typifications of the same principle of credit , all of which being more or less competent to perform , and in point of fact performing , the functions of money , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facie just the same pretensions to be rated as money which bank-notes have . " This principle , however , leads more directly to theories concerning prices than to a consideration of the matter now before us , - the expedients made use of in the credit system . // 33T It is obvious that a Comprehensive view of the Currency must embrace the distinction which exists between that used in the retail and that used in the wholesale trade . In the former , gold and silver , and the permanent circulation of banks , serve to carry on the operations , while in the latter the principal part of the exchanges is effected by checks against deposits , or the transient circulation ; that is , the larger denomination of bills , which return through other banks almost as soon as they are issued . According to Mr. Tooke , in his Inquiry into the Currency Principle , the former is merely the currency by which individual incomes , including wages , are distributed ; and the latter , the currency by which actual capital is passed from hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of gold and silver and small bank-notes in circulation all the time , because there is each day a portion of income to be expended ; while the transfers of capital are made from the hands of one merchant to another . The profit arising from this transfer , or the portion of the profit that the merchant reserves for expenditure , forms income ; but the transfer of the merchandise , which is capital , by wholesale , is merely changing it from one warehouse to another , and the checks and the large bank-notes which serve to make these transfers are the currency of this description of trade . When notes are drawn from a bank , it depends upon the use to which they are put whether they remain in circulation , or immediately return . If they are drawn to be expended as income , that is , for personal expenditure , or to be paid away as wages , they will remain in circulation ; that is to say , although they return , after having permeated the retail trade , they will be immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pays away a thousand dollars in banknotes , in one week , for wages , although these notes will in the course of the next week find their way back to the bank , they will be replaced by others to pay another week 's wages . The same remark holds good as to the expenditure of incomes . It is only in these classes of transactions that a bank can obtain a permanent circulation . For if we suppose a sum to be drawn from a bank , or a check passed in payment of a trans-29* // April , MONEY AND CREDIT . action between merchants , it will immediately form part of the materiel of the deposit of the person to whom it was paid , and will return to the bank from which it was drawn in the next day 's clearing operations . The circulation , or the means of payment in the wholesale trade , is therefore made up of the bank balances or the deposits of individual merchants ; and the banks are the channels by which , when these balances become mobilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thence again distributed to their respective and final destinations . It is plain , therefore , that unless the bank use forced or illegitimate means to get its circulation out , that circulation must be limited to the extent of the individual incomes of the community . An increase of individual incomes thus implies an increase of circulation , and vice versd , the circulation being in all cases the effect , and not the cause . A rise of prices , from any course of events whatsoever , is an efficient case of an increase of the expenditure of incomes , and thence of an increase of bank circulation . And because an increase of bank circulation has generally been seen to accompany any longsustained general rise of prices , it has been held , by a certain class of reasoners , to be a cause of such a rise , whereas it is only an effect ; the rise of prices being generally occasioned by elements of an entirely different character , such as the state of credit in commercial circles , and the existing relations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund used for carrying on the wholesale operations of trade consists mainly of the balances in bank to the credit of individual merchants . On any given day the currency of the wholesale trade will be that part of these aggregate balances which is set in motion . If on any morning the banks hold deposits amounting to fifty millions , and checks are drawn during the day for twenty-five millions , the currency of the wholesale trade for that day 's operations will be twenty-five millions , while the whole fifty millions possess the property of mobilization . Without confining ourselves , however , to any specified time , we may extend this principle , and say that the currency of the wholesale trade consists of the whole of the circulating capital of individuals ; // for the whole of that circulating capital becomes in time resolved into bank deposits , whether it consist of bills receivable , bills of exchange , drafts , or merchandise ; and the nature of the case demands that these deposits shall not remain idle , but shall become transformed again into bills receivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the medium of deposits . If the circulating capital of a merchant consists of fifty thousand dollars , by the time that the whole of it circulates once , and returns to him again , his aggregate deposits will have been equal ( excepting of course all usual allowances ) during that time to fifty thousand dollars ; but as he lays it out again as fast as it returns to him , by drawing checks against his deposits , either to pay directly for merchandise or to cancel his bills payable drawn for merchandise , the whole of this sum resolves itself in time into the currency of the wholesale trade ; and what is true of one individual must be true of the mercantile community . We have been thus particular in illustrating the nature of wholesale operations , in order to exhibit in a clear light our author 's exposition of the credit system . " Credit , in no one of its meanings , " he writes , " is the same thing as the credit system ; the latter implies the former , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the confidence which dealers repose in each other , and to the consequent postponement of payment upon transactions of sale . When one sells and delivers goods to another , agreeing to receive payment at a future day , that is giving credit upon one side , and taking it upon the other ; but this transaction may not fall within the credit system , which imports something more than personal confidence and deferred payment . The credit system is that by which not only personal confidence exists between the parties , inducing them to sell and deliver goods , and defer the payment , but by which the payment is eventually effected without resort to coin , bullion , or any similar equivalent : it is that by which commodities or services are made to pay for commodities or services : it is a system by which men apply their credits to the extinguishment of their debts . It embraces all the devices by which payments are properly made , without the use of the precious metals , except cases of strict barter . " Under the credit system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the payment being postponed for a time definite or indefinite ; the payments for commodities are separated from the actual transactions of // April , MONEY AND CREDIT . sale and purchase ; the articles of trade are bought and sold , and distributed for consumption at home and abroad , - the payments accruing being reserved for a separate and a distinct department of commerce . " This is in direct contrast with the cash or money system , in which every article is either paid for in the precious metals at the time of delivery , or at some time afterwards . These two systems work side by side ; and though frequently much blended in operation , the distinction between them is plain enough to be always kept in view . It must , indeed , be strictly regarded by those who would understand the subject of money and credit . " - pp. 188 , 189 . Under a strict and general view of the subject , it does seem in fact that there is some such distinction of functions as is here stated between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former process is conducted by the merchants , while the latter - payment , or rather we should say the process of set-off , to distinguish it from the mere act of payment - is carried on immediately by the banks or bankers , and ultimately by the Clearing-House . A merchant will pass away a considerable number of checks in one day , and he will perhaps receive as many , - the bank-notes used in this class of transactions being , mutatis mutandis , equivalent to checks , as they do not remain permanently in circulation . Those that he receives he deposits to his credit in bank ; those that he gives are deposited by the parties receiving them . In the clearing-house , the next day , one class is confronted wmth the other ; those cheeks which he has given away appear against his deposit , and those which have formed his own deposit appear against others who have drawn them . But this process is a matter carried on entirely by the clerks of the different banks ; the merchant has nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nevertheless positively certain that it is done , and that such checks as he has given have actually been debited to his account in the bank in which he deposits . A process so regular and efficient as this , and yet so simple that all the 6xtensive transactions of the day previous may be set off against one another in one or two hours ' time at the Clearing-House the next morning , and without the use generally of more than about five per cent of gold , can not fail to // strike us as a beautiful example of the precision with which the elements of the credit system coincide ; and we are moreover , from a comprehensive view of the matter , irresistibly led to the conclusion , that the circulating capital of the community is made to cancel debits and credits without the use of money , excepting in a prospective sense , for the payment of balances ; that , in the language of our author , the credit system is " that by which commodities or services are made to pay for commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their credits to the extinguishment of their debts . " Our views thus far have been confined to a statement of the action of principles in an undisturbed condition ; but there is a very wide and extensive class of phenomena which transpire at periodical intervals , and which not only disturb the action of these principles , but for the time suspend them . Economists seem generally disposed to admit that , while the present system of currency is sufficient for the exchanges which are made , and highly beneficial in the ordinary course of events , it is powerless to prevent , nay , even heightens the intensity of what is called a commercial crisis . We shall exhibit in the words of our author the fearful effects of one of these convulsions . " In the fatal panic of a hundred days , which occurred in the last quarter of 1857 , vast numbers of men in husiness failed in the United States , and hundreds of millions were lost in the wreck of credit , in the depreciation of securities and of property , real and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , the stoppage of business , and the cessation of labor . Millions of idle laborers lost millions of dollars daily . The loss in a panic of a hundred days is a fearful thing to contemplate in figures ! How much more so the reality , if it could be brought at one glance under the eye ! The grave of many vast fortunes , the gulf which has swallowed the competency of thousands , the comforts , the homes , the food and raiment of millions who toil with their own hands for their daily bread " Our banks are so constituted , that when the ignorant and alarmed multitude commence a run for coins , they have no resource but to withdraw the usual facilities of banking from the very men of business to whose custom they owe every day 's existence . When this race begins , the banks , whilst they are daily receiving , in their own notes and credits ( checks on deposits ) , the sums payable to them , withhold the // customary facilities or discounts from their customers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credits for payment of debts , as checks their presentation for the specie- The stream of bank-notes and deposits sets steadily and strongly towards the banks , and returns to the public in a constantly decreasing volume . The demand of the banks upon the public may continue nuabated for some sixty days , in which time , in a commercial community , the stringency may become such that few , if any , can have bank-notes or credits upon which to make demand for specie ; and those who have will be tempted by the debtors to the banks to accept at the rate of twelve , eighteen , twenty , or thirty per cent per annum ; and thus these bank-notes and bank credits will be returned to the banks in payment of debts , instead of being presented for payment in specie . The contraction in New York , in the panic of 1857 , is a specimen of what the banks are constrained to do to save themselves . They can only protect their coffers by refusing to issue the usual supply of currency . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York stood thus in August and October , 1857 : - Loans . Deposits . 15th of August , $ 121,241,472 $ 92,356,328 19th of September , 108,777,421 75,772,774 17th of October , 97,245,826 52,894,623 " This exhibits a reduction of discounts in one month of $ 13,000,000 , and in the succeeding month of $ 11,000,000 ; that is , $24,000,000 in sixty days : in one month deposits ran down , under this operation , $ 17,000,000 ; in the succeeding month , $23,000,000 ; making in the two months a reduction in the chief medium of payment of $40,000,000 . The deposits were thus reduced nearly one half . It can not be surprising that , under such a process of contraction , interest went up to between fifteen and thirty-six per cent , and exchange down to nine or ten per cent below par " The late panic has inflicted , in all its bearings and ramifications , a loss upon the country , which may be variously estimated from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 . INo doubt the ill effects of the panic were much enhanced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this devastation should be set down to that account . With every allowance in that respect , we shall have a vast sum of loss to charge to the panic ; and whether this sum be $ 400,600,000 or $800,000,000 matters not to our view . The loss was to a great extent unnecessary , cruel , terrible , - a loss which has carried privation , distress , and ruin to a million of homes . For a time , at least , not yet passed , it reduced hundreds of thousands of the best people to a state of entire dependence , if not beggary. " - pp. 483 - 486. // 343 " What was the cause of these dire calamities ? " pertinently asks our author . They were incurred , as he says , to save the specie in the banks from passing into the hands of the public , or from being remitted to foreign countries . If this be true , can not a remedy be applied ? Must we quietly sit down with folded hands , and await the advent of another panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no arm be put forth to save us , or is the intelligence of this whole people so hard to be moved , that it will not exert itself for good in a tai*gible , visible form ? In our view the remedy is simple and obvious , although we have faint hope of seeing it speedily applied . We have said that the currency of the country divides itself into two well-marked and distinct portions ; - that which is employed in the retail trade , in the expenditure of incomes and wages , without the use of credit ; and that used in the wholesale trade , involving the transfer of circulating capital between merchants , which is conducted almost entirely upon credit . We would make each of these two descriptions of currency homogeneous . In the first class , no credit substitutes should be used , because the operations are mainly for cash ; and in the second class , nothing but credit substitutes should be used , because the operations are mainly on credit . To prevent the use of credit substitutes , tbat is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issued under the denomination of twentyfive dollars . The banks would then be almost entirely deprived of their permanent circulation in the retail trade ; for no notes would be drawn to pay wages , or for personal expenditure ; but their use would be entirely confined to the wholesale trade . The channel of circulation for all sums under twenty-five dollars would be filled by metallic money , a state of things which would effectually prevent any popular panic , or run upon the banks by the ignorant masses . The circulation of the city banks forms but a very small part of their means of profit , but it forms almost the whole of that of the country banks ; the distinction between the city and country banks being , that the discounts of one are made upon the strength of deposits , and those of the other , upon circulation . If no notes under twenty-five dollars were issued , while such a course would affect the city banks very slightly , it would take // away from the country banks almost their whole power . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dealings between the country and city merchants ; no notes would be held by the people ; and as this circumstance would cut off from the country banks a chief source of their profit , it would leave no inducement for their multiplication . It would , on the other hand , have a tendency to close some of those now existing , and to transfer the business of domestic exchanges into the hands of private bankers , with no power of issue . With regard to the foreign exchanges , it may be said , that they form a peculiar class of operations , and should be treated on peculiar grounds . We imagine that the difficulties connected with this class of transactions are directly due to the ad valorem system of revenue . The substitution of specific for ad valorern duties , as suggested by President Buchanan in his message to the last Congress , would have gone far to remove the evils of the periodical effiux of bullion . It is extraordinary that our legislators should remain so blind to the pernicious effects of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importing cities who could not name numerous instances of fraudulent invoices ; and there can be no doubt that , under the existing system and rate of duties , the government is actually cheated of at least one third of its just dues . But even without the supposition of fraudulent invoices , the general establishment of foreign agencies is an evil of equal , if not greater moment . " The foreign manufacturer now sends here a clerk , or agent , or partner , who becomes forthwith an importing merchant . The goods to be imported are invoiced to him at cost , without any perjury , or other evasion of law . The goods are sold in our market for the highest price which can be obtained ; and the whole proceeds , profits and all , less only the expenses of the agent , are remitted to the foreign concern in specie , or by bill , according to the state of the exchange . " The amount of these profits , which would otherwise remain with ourselves , is the whole amount necessary to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So long as we are producers of gold , it must be expected that we shall be exporters of it to // 845 some extent , and so long as that exportation is confined to gold as an article of merchandise , no harm will grow out of it ; but when it extends itself to currency , when the importer withdraws coin or bullion from the banks to send over his own profits as well as the original value of the goods , the transaction is extra-mercantile and ruinous . In conclusion , we would say a word concerning the moral lessons which commercial revulsions inculcate . There is no doubt that greediness of gain and wealth is an extensive source of evil in commercial circles . Men can not be content with a trade proportioned to their capital , but extend their credit to a limit which it can not under any circumstances bear . That merchants are in a state of absolute dependence upon banks , so that a suspension of their usual line of discounts produces ruin , is the strongest argument against banking institutions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as men will persist in trading beyond their own means through bank accommodations , no reform of the currency can be of any avail . In this view of the case , the preventive or remedy lies with each individual ; and it consists in making the laws which regulate our moral relations paramount and supreme in our economical transactions .
