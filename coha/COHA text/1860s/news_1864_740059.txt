txt Some four months ago , we published a speech , delivered to the Bahama Legislature by Mr. C. J. BAYLEY , who happens to be Governor of the islands for the time being . Possibly ? many of our readers have forgotten that in that speech Mr. BAYLEY dwelt almost to the exclusion of other topics  --  upon the satisfactory condition of the trade in blockade-running . His congratulations of the islanders were uttered with as much cordiality as if they had been preparing to furnish a supply of raw cotton for the whole of Europe . And the speech , with all its felicitations , was transmitted to the Colonial Office in London , for the approval of the Secretary of State . The Duke of NEWCASTLE , then at the head of the Colonial Bureau , made a prompt acknowledgment to his agent 's dispatch , the substance of which acknowledgment has already been given , in , our columns .. As the . Governor 's conduct , however , ' led to a subsequent  --  correspondence , which now appears for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke 's dispatches entire in another part of to-day 's issue , that our readers may see precisely the style of man they have fora Governor at Nassau , and how much official castigation he can take from his chief without finding it essential , to his dignity to resign . An upper house-servant in Kew-York would &sent; such imputations as the-Duke casts upon /he Governor 's discretion , common sense , honesty and loyalty . He tells him the United States Government have ust reason to complain of a British official Who talks as Mr. BAYLEY is In the habit of talking . He reminds him " that he is impairing le position of the Government ; " and in a second dispatch , the Colonial Secretary-says bat any one of " ordinary forethought " would have foreseen that the missing word addressed be Mr. BAYLEY to the Bahama Legislature must provoke angry comments in the American press . Probably since the time of Sir FRANCIS BOND ' HEAD , there has been no English Colonial agent of the type of BAYLEY . Usually , it is an understood thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who applies for them shall have one or more financial screws loose ; that his uncle or his aunt has one or more parliamentary votes that can be thrown to the First Minister in regular party divisions in the House of Commons , and that the applicant himself shall be sufficiently afraid of losing the situation , when he gets it , not to make a downright ass of himself , at least for a year or two . These , we believe , are something like the standing conditions of Colonial appointments . There are exceptions , however  --  exceptions in the shape of appointments far above the standard of the Office , such as in the case of Lord Symarnam  --  and exceptions in the way of appointments far below the standard , as in the case of the poor lunatic , Sir FRANCIS BOND HEAD , who brought on the last rebellion in Canada . BAYLEY ranks so clearly with the latter ? class that we find it difficult , looking to the more liberal character of the Colonial policy for the last few years , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . accident . It is true , there are few men of any standing , socially or politically , who would care for the post  --  not that it carries with it insufficient remuneration . But there is something rather degrading in the business of regulating the affairs of a wrecker community . A big share of the business of the Bahama Islands is that of legalized ' wrecking . Every ship disaster within their section of the tropics is a godsend . Every hurricane that sweeps the coast of their group is a special providence alike for Government and people . Their percentages on every stranded . ship make so much common plunder ; and their Legislature would have little to do were it not for the varying chapter of marine accidents which demands a constant revision of the system on which the spoils have to be allocated between the wreckers and the public officials . That this high-toned community should find much account in the blockade  --  running business , and that Gov . BAYLEY should employ his notive talents and his official influence to foster that business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensations as anything we are accustomed to . Whether such a representative of Imperial power is likely to promote British interests abroad is another. , matter , and it is one that we need not seriously concern ourselves about .
