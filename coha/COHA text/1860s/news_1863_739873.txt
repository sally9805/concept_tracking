txt If it be true , as is now positively declared , that a loyal bullet has sent this traitor to eternity , every loyal heart will feel satisfaction and will not scruple to express it . Ordinarily , enmity is disarmed before death ; reproach is silenced , and even the sternest justice makes way for pity . The form that is shrouded is a sacred thing , and the grave itself is an altar m which every bitter feeling should be sacrificed forever . Human censorship does tot presume to follow the spirit that has gone o its Eternal Judge ; and even the most rigid eels constrained to remember his own frail , ies , and forgive . But where Death strikes , uch a public enemy as this , it exacts no such ' Bent obeisance . Personal feeling has no part in the matter . It is to be regarded purely as a public event ; and if it really has he shape of a public deliverance , it is ust as right to welcome it as any other public blessing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of such a criminal when lead as when living . Humanity has a just reckoning with guilt of this peculiar dye that : : an never be satisfied without posthumous infamy . If ever there was a public man pledged to a career of fidelity and honor , it was Joi , / C. BRECKINRIDGE . He belonged to a family that had always been noted , for patriotism , as well as for every other exalted quality ; as a young man he was personally associated with such great-souled patriots as CLAY and CRITTENDEN ; the people of his own State , in his early youth , took him to their confidence with a readiness seldom exhibited , and the people of the United States elevated him to the second office in their gift , at an age without precedent in American history . Every inherited sentiment , every implanted principle , every obligation of gratitude , forbade him to be unfaithful to his country ; but an unholy ambition ruined him . By nature frank , ardent , manly and eloquent , he fell a prey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plotters against the peace of the country . They named him for the Presidency at Charleston , and he accepted the nomination , though it was given in violation of every principle which had ruled Democratic conventions , and was sure to divide and destroy his party . How far he was actually cognizant , at that time , of the secession plot , is not yet known . It may be that he was let into the full confidence of the prime conspirators , and fully understood that he should help them ruin if they could not help him rule . It may be that he was at first merely a pliant dupe in the hands of crafty knaves . In measuring his guilt this matters little . The time came when the treason of his supporters was no longer disguised ; and it was then his duty to have renounced them and denounced them . Had he been a true man , his indignation at the use the traitors had made of him . would have filled him with all the intenser bate of the treason itself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwittingly to further it , would have stimulated him to redoubled efforts afterward to thwart and foil it . Instead of this , he showed all sympathy with it just as long as he could do so in safety within the Public councils , and then he betook himself bodily to the camp of the rebels . It might have been in weakness that he was firstmade a dupe ; but his subsequent career marked him one of the basest and wickedest of traitors . We know that it is not easy to draw distinctions between the shades of this black treason against the Union . Yet we can recognize that some sort of charity may be given to such a man as Stonewall JACKSON , who bred to the doctrine of paramount State sovereignty , and conscientiously believed that it was his duty to obey the decision of his State expressed through constitutional forms . But no such extenuating plea can be advanced for JOHN C. BRECKENRIDGE . In one of his last speeches in the Senate , he declared that he was a son of Kentucky , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Kentucky , within a week afterward declared , by a majority of sixty thousand votes at the polls , that she would not go out of the Union , he went home and issued a manifesto , declaring that " there is no longer a Senate of the United States within the meaning and spirit of the Constitution ; the United States no longer exist ; the Union is dissolved ; " and that he was now about to " exchange , with proud satisfaction , a term of six years in the Senate of the United States for the musket of a soldier . " This declared intention he made good by soon afterward rallying his friends at Russellville , where a resolution was passed , in so many words , bidding " defiance both to the Federal and State Governments , " and delegates were appointed to the Provisional Congress of the Confederacy . BRECKINRIDGR was soon afterward as thoroughly identified with the rebels as JEFF . Davis himself ; though in doing it he had to turn his back , not only upon the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had solemnly protestedthat he would follow . Of all the accursed traitors of the land there has been none more heinously false than he  --  none whose memory will live in darker ignominy . God grant the country a speedy deliverance of all such parricides.
