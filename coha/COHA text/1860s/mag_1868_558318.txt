ART . VIII . - THE CHICAGO CONVENTION . THERE was nothing picturesque or imposing in the appearance of the Opera House of Chicago on the 20th of last May . The sombre effect of the blue upholstery was unrelieved by gay colors anywhere . The gentlemen in the body of the house , and upon the stage , wore full suits of black , only one or two velvet coats , or white cravats , varying the monotony . Even in the costume of the few ladies in the galleries there was scarcely a hint of the beautiful spring day that brooded over the lake a few rods distant . The light from the circle of gas-jets over the stage was too feeble to bring out the red , white , and blue of the heavy drapery , festooned above , or to give lustre to the stars on the national flag at the rear . A gleam had come from the gilded back of a stage throne , near the line of the foot-lights , but a modest , republican arm-chair was put in its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of the several States in black letters upon a white ground , divided without enlivening the parquette and the front rows of the dress-circle , where were seated six hundred and fifty gentlemen , convened to transact the business of a great political organization . But for these guide-boards , it would have been impossible to distinguish the representatives of Connecticut from those of Texas or of Idaho . The superior cultivation which the East claims for itself , as compared with the West , was not discernible in its delegates . The superior manners which the South used to boast of were nowhere apparent . No comparison , indeed , could be instituted between the North and the South , for the reason that the latter had feW genuine representatives upon the floor . Most of the delegates from Kentucky , Tennessee , and West Virginia were probably , natives of the State they hailed from ; but none of them looked as if they had at any time belonged to the class which crowned the edifice whereof slavery was the corner-stone , or as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old civilization . Of the delegates from other parts of the South , almost all were born north of the Potomac . The com // July , plexion , dialect , and bearing of Joseph E. Brown , formerly Governor of Georgia , attested his Southern origin . The same could be said of Mr. ID . C. llumphreys of Alabama , and of Mr. Pinchback of New Orleans , in whose features an expert could find traces of African descent . With these and several other exceptions , the delegates from the South were Northerners , of whom only a few had purchased plantations , with intent to cast in their lot with their neighbors . Most were interested in the welfare of the district sending them to Chicago as a traveller is interested in the condition of the road by which he hopes to arrive at fortune or position , and had acquired a domicile there as a New-Yorker , who seeks a divorce under the laws of Indiana , acquires a domicile in that State , while the action is pending . Such men will contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Northern birth and liberal ideas , who have no time yet for politics ; or than the teachers of the young ; or than men , like Mr. Brown of Georgia , whose past careers emphasize their arguments in favor of accepting the inevitable . For the time being , politics , which used to absorb an undue share of attention from ta'lent that might more profitably have been turned into other channels , is not a primary concern with the Southern people . They can not now afford to send their best men into the political arena , nor can these afford to enter it . Order must first be established ; equal rights must be guaranteed by public opinion as well as by just laws ; agriculture , commerce , and manufactures must adapt themselves to new conditions ; social and industrial problems of every description require to be solved . The Southerner , who accepts in good faith the decisions of the war ; the Northerner , who in good faith makes his home in the South ; the intelligent freedman , who desires to prove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old school , who is still wedded to the idols of slavery , - each has sufficient reasons for abstaining from politics for the present . Hence no inference unfavorable to the policy by which the IRepublican party is attempting to reconstitute the Southern States can be drawn from the character of the men whom Mississippi or Arkansas sent to Chicago , for only those could or would go whose stake in the material prosperity of the district they represented was // a small one , and who had no tender associations with the institutions and ideas of the past . The speech with which Mr. Carl Schurz of Missouri , the temporary chairman of the Convention , prefaced business was compact and in excellent taste . His appeal to the delegates not to be depressed by disappointment , nor hurried by passion beyond the bounds of wisdom , was not imheeded . His demand , in the name of the Republican party , for justice to all , - to the soldier who fought our battles , the Southern Union man who , for the national cause , imperilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we have promised true liberty forever , and the national creditor who staked his fortune upon the good faith of the American people , - struck the key-note of the campaign . All the business of the Convention , except that of making the nominations , was , as usual , put into the hands of four committees , - on Permanent Organization , on Credentials , on Order of Business , and on Resolutions , - for each of which the name of a member , selected on the previous evening by each State delegation , was announced by its chairman . The principle of allowing each State a representation in the Convention corresponding with its representation in Congress does not rule in the formation of committees . The vote of Delaware in the Committee on Credentials , which determines who shall take part in the Convention , or in the Committee on Resolutions , which declares the principles of the party , counts for as much as the vote of New York . This year a still more questionable precedent was established by the grant of similar privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colorado , that she would have been admitted to the Union months ago but for the veto of the President ( and , it might have been added , the opposition of enough Republicans in both branches of Congress to defeat her admission in spite of the veto ) ; it was urged , on behalf of those political divisions of the country which , whether properly to be considered Territories or not to-day , are demanding , or are about to demand , recognition as States , that they would probably take part in the next Presidential election , and were therefore entitled to a voice in the selection of the candidates and construction of the platform : but no attempt was made to apply this or any other test to each case . Texas , which had // taken no steps toward reorganization , was put upon the same footing with Arkansas , to which one house of Congress had already opened the door . Doubts were expressed as to the propriety of the course adopted , but no discussion took place , the Convention being evidently of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomalous proceeding . Then , too , there was every reason to believe that the Democratic National Convention would admit delegations from the Southern States , since , in the judgment of the Democratic party , those States have never ceased to be in the Union ; and the friends of each of the candidates for the Vice-Presidency hoped to increase his strength by votes from this quarter . At five o'clock the Convention reassembled . A permanent organization was at once effected under the presidency of General Joseph R. Hawley of Connecticut , whose good sense , good nature , and effective voice carried him smoothly over the obstacles raised by his imperfect knowledge of parliamentary law . The Committee on Credentials not being ready to report , there was necessarily an interval in the proceedings , which some eager individuals vainly attempted to fill by the nomination of General Grant , as in mass meeting . Others called for speeches ; and Mr. Brown of Georgia , who seemed to be looked upon in the light of a political curiosity , was persuaded to mount the platform . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the doctrine of States Rights until Lee 's surrender , but now accepted the interpretation put upon the Constitution by the sword , and the terms offered to Rebels by the victorious North , having too much faith in the superiority of his race to dread " negro domination " even in the States where the freedmen are in the majority . There were murmurs of dissent from some of his expressions ; but it is difficult to see how a man , with such a history behind him , could with sincerity go further than he did in the right direction ; and it is doubtful whether any speech made at Chicago more ruthlessly tore off the sophisms used to disguise a bad cause . The Committee on Credentials had had but two contests to settle , - one over a seat in the California delegation and the other between two sets of delegates from Maryland .. Their report in both cases was adopted without opposition . One of the rules reported by the // Committee on the Order of Business , of which all were adopted without debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be disposed of before the nominations were made . That report not being ready , no further business could be transacted , and an adjournment was carried . A theatrical incident of the afternoon was the presentation by a committee representing the " Soldiers and Sailors ' Convention , " held on the previous day , of a resolution in favor of General Grant 's nomination to the Presidency , - theatrical , because without real significance . Most of the veterans of the war will , no doubt , vote for General Grant ; for a majority of them were Republicans before they enlisted , others were guided to Republican principles by the lamp of experience , and others still will support the General-in-Chief because they know his great qualities . But the wishes of the citizen-soldier found no more distinct and far less sensible expression in this assemblage of officers - scarcely any privates were present - than in the National Convention to which it was a tender . An eagle , a brass band , and the good old father of General Grant took prominent parts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flapped his wings at opportune moments ; the musicians greeted Grant with " Hail to the Chief , " and " the seven traitors , " " the seven vile scamps , " - as Mr. John Cochrane dared to call Senators Fessenden , Fowler , Grimes , Henderson , Ross , Trumbull , and Van Winkle , - with " The Rogues ' March " ; and most of the speakers imitated with indifferent success the eagle and the musicians . Wounds received in the service of the country can not fail to awake sentiments of respect and of gratitude in the breast of a patriot ; but it was impossible not to perceive a theatrical element in the entrance , after the proceedings had commenced , of General Sickles , leaning on crutches and supported from behind , and in the selection of a one-armed officer , Governor Fairchild of Wisconsin , to preside over the Convention : - though it should be added , that both these gentlemen evinced exceptional discretion in what they said and in what they omitted to say to the meeting . At ten o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to order , but business could not be resumed , // July , for the report of the Committee on Resolutions was not yet ready . The interruption occurred at an awkward moment . It was conjectured , and truly , that the committee was discussing a resolution concerning the impeachment of the President of the United States . It was conjectured , and truly , that upon the propriety of expressing an opinion with regard to the action of the court before which he was upon trial the committee was almost equally divided . The Convention had adopted the usual rule , requiring all resolutions introduced to be referred to this committee without debate ; and therefore no legitimate way of anticipating its action existed . But the pulse of the Convention might be felt , and this Mr. Charles S. Spencer of New York undertook to do . Before the meeting was alive to the design of his motion , one of the secretaries began to read a series of resolutions , purporting to represent the views of " the National Council of the Union Leagues of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passed by a minority of the members after their rejection by the majority . These resolutions had been informally referred to the committee , but were now recalled at Mr. Spencer 's instance . One of them assailed the seven Republican Senators who had pronounced Andrew Johnson not guilty , as charged in the eleventh article of impeachment , in terms worthy of the New York Tribune or of Mr. John A. Logan . But the pulse of the Convention was healthy . A motion to lay upon the table the proposition that these resolutions be spread upon the records was carried with slight opposition , and Mr. Spencer sat down discomfited. ilenceforward the Convention was on the alert , and determined to occupy the time in a harmless manner , at least . So it called Mr. Hassaurek of Ohio , a German of considerable reputation as a public speaker , to the platform . This gentleman undertook , at eleven o'clock in the morning , to read to an impatient assembly , eager to get to business , a dissertation of portentous length , as was evidenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceal . He was not listened to long , and the chairman found it difficult to preserve a decent silence in the assembly until the lecture was finished . Mr. John L. Palmer , the Republican candidate for // Governor of Illinois , though not a member of the Convention , next addressed it . His speech was skilfully adapted to the temper of the Convention , and showed strength of character and unusual prudence . The Convention , after having failed to induce more popular speakers to mount the rostrum , was about to listen to Mr. John Cochrane ; but just as he was opening his lips a murmur announced the opportune arrival of the chairman of the Committee on Resolutions . The declaration of principles unanimously adopted by the Convention , without discussion , is as follows : - " 1 . We congratulate the country on the assured success of the reconstruction policy of Congress , as evidenced by the adoption in a majority of the States lately in rebellion of constitutions securing equal civil and political rights to all , and . we regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and prevent the people of such States from being remitted to a state of anarchy or military rule . " 2 . The guaranty by Congress of equal suffrage to all loyal men in the South was demanded by every consideration of public safety , of gratitude , and of justice , and must be maintained , while the question of suffrage in all the loyal States properly belongs to the people of those States . We highly commend the spirit of magnanimity and forgiveness with which the men who have served the Rebellion , and who are now frankly and honestly co-operating with us in restoring the peace of the country , and in reconstructing the Southern State governments upon the basis of impartial justice and equal rights , are received back into the communion of the loyal people ; and we are in favor of the removal of the disqualifications and restrictions imposed upon the late Rebels in the same measure as the spirit of disloyalty dies out , and as may be consistent with the safety of the loyal people . " 3 . We denounce all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor requires the payment of the public indebtedness in the utmost good faith to all creditors at home and abroad , not only according to the letter , but the spirit of the laws under which it was contracted . " 4 . It is due to the labor of the nation that taxation should be equalized and reduced as rapidly as the national faith will permit . " 5 . The national debt , contracted as it has been for the preservation of the Union for all time to come , should be extended over a fair period for redemption ; and it is the duty of Congress to reduce the rate of interest thereon whenever it can honestly be done . " 6 . The best policy to diminish our burden of debt is so to improve // our credit that capitalists will seek to lend us money at lower rates of interest than we now pay , and must continue to pay so long as repudiation , partial or total , open or covert , is threatened or suspected . " 7 . The government of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruptions which have been so shamefully nursed and fostered by Andrew Johnson call loudly for radical reform . " 8 . We profoundly deplore the untimely and tragic death of Abraham Lincoln , and regret the accession to the Presidency of Andrew Johnson , who has acted treacherously to the people who elected him and the cause he was pledged to support ; has usurped high legislative and judicial functions ; has refused to execute the laws ; has used his high office to induce other *fficers to violate the laws ; has employed his executive power to render insecure the lives , property , peace , liberty , and life of the citizen ; has abused the pardoning power ; has denounced the national legislature as unconstitutional ; has persistently and habitually resisted , by every means in his power , every proper attempt at the reconstruction of the States lately in rebellion ; has perverted the public patronage into an engine of wholesale corruption , and has been justly impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors , and properly pronounced guilty thereof by the votes of thirty-five Senators . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , that because a man was once a subject he is always so , must be resisted at every hazard by the United States as a relic of the feudal times , not authorized by the law of nations , and at war with our national honor and independence . Naturalized citizens are entitled to be protected in all their rights of citizenship , as though they were native born . No citizen of the United States , native or naturalized , must be liable to arrest or imprisonment by any foreign power , for acts done or words spoken in this country ; and if so arrested and imprisoned , it is the duty of the government to interfere in his behalf . " 10 . Of all who were faithful in the trials of the late war , there were none entitled to more especial honor than the brave soldiers and seamen who endured the hardships of the camp and cruise , and imperilled their lives in the service of their country . The bounties and pensions appropriated by law for these brave defenders of the Union are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gallant dead are the wards of the people , - a sacred legacy bequeathed to the United States ' protecting care . " 11 . Foreign emigration , which in the past has added so much to the wealth and increased the resources of this nation , - the asylum of the oppressed of all nations , - should be fostered by a wise and just policy . // " 12 . This Convention declares its sympathy with all oppressed people who are struggling for their rights . " 13 . We recognize the great principles laid down in the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of democratic government , and we hail with gladness every effort toward making these principles a living reality on every inch of American soil . " The paragraphs numbered 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 commend themselves to patriots of every shade of opinion . The hearty indorsement in the opening paragraphs of the platform of the policy adopted by Congress for the reconstitution of the States recently in rebellion was a matter of course . The Congressional plan may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of events , and it is to-day the only practicable method of re-establishing the Union upon stable foundations . The second paragraph suggests the principle upon which to distinguish the treatment of the question of suffrage in the South from its treatment in the loyal States , - a principle which would govern , even were the constitutional powers of Congress the same in both cases . In the North , the man of African descent is as secure as his white neighbor in the possession of the rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness guaranteed to every citizen by the Constitution of the United States ; and , however unjust may be the prejudice of race , which causes his disfranchisement here and there , he has slight cause to complain , so long as the blessings and privileges of a good government are his . But in the South the ballot is necessary to protect the colored man 's life , liberty , and property from assault by men in whom the feelings and opinions engendered by slavery are not yet extinct . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South they are a vast population , who can not safely or justly be exposed to oppression from a class long accustomed to domineer over them . The only way to insure the passage and faithful execution of just laws there is to give every loyal man a voice in the selection of those who are to frame or to administer them . Many of the freedmen may be , as not a few white men in every State are , incapable of exercising The right of suffrage intelligently ; but they will learn to swim by going into the water , and will find white teachers enough , Democratic // as well as Republican . And while thus at school they will be protected from injustice by those who desire their votes . The second clause of the second paragraph - added in the Convention , upon motion of Carl Schurz - is a fitting counterpart of the first clause , for it assures Rebels , who do the works meet for repentance , of a free pardon . So also is the thirteenth paragraph , also added upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when distinctions of race or of class shall no longer be recognized in the laws governing any portion of American soil . Illinois should be credited with the financial part of the platform , with the exception of the plank numbered six , which was inserted by Mr. Rowland G. Hazard of Rhode Island , the well-known writer upon questions of political economy . The others were taken from the platform framed by the State Convention held on the 5th of May at Peoria , - an assembly which deserves more than a passing allusion . No man , born and bred east of the Alleghanies , can visit Chicago without being impressed by its wonderful prosperity , arid drawn to the conclusion that it will soon rank as the second city on the continent . Nor can he traverse Illinois without astonishment at the vast extent of its territory , the unsurpassed fertility of its soil , and its immense resources . But he will still be far from understanding the remarkable phenomenon before his eyes , unless he studies the character of the men who are building a metropolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making the railroads that come from every point of the compass pay them tribute . A political convention is a place little likely to divulge the secret of their success . Yet the proceedings of that held at Peoria seemed to one spectator , at least , to show the presence of that clearness of understanding , promptness of action , acquaintance with men , integrity of purpose , and independence of character which achieve success in every walk of life , and which were vouchsafed in such abundant measure to Lincoln , Grant , and Trumbull . One peculiarity of the Peoria Convention was its abstinence from speaking for the sake of speaking . The talkers had showered their rhetoric upon a crowd of idlers on the previous evening ; but the Convention would listen to nobody // long , and greeted those who persisted with cries of " Short speeches , " " Short speeches , " or of " Question , " " Question . " Other notable circumstances were , that the attempts of self constituted committees to control the nominations miscarried ; that the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions , were so far from seeking the offices for which they were selected , that it was not even known whether they would accept the honors tendered them ; that business was conducted with good temper and decorum throughout ; that the presiding officer , the speaker of the lower branch of the Illinois Legislature last winter , though a man of singularly gentle manners , preserved order with ease ; and that few of the delegates resembled the traditional Western politician . The truth is , that the boundary line of civilization no longer runs east of the Mississippi . The people of States which constituted the West twenty years ago no longer lead an uncertain existence in tents and log-cabins , but reside in comfortable homes , resting upon the rock of law , and beginning to be adorned by the arts . The habits of the people are becoming refined , their manners and speech are almost urbane , and their interests take a wide range . It may be doubted whether Northern Illinois , though still deficient in important elements of culture , be not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives in Congress , or in political conventions , at least , need not shrink from the comparison . The nation is indebted for the first authoritative declaration that it intends honestly to pay its debts primarily to three members of the Committee on Resolutions appointed by the Illinois Convention , - Mr. Stephen A. Hurlbut of Belvidere , a distinguished soldier and an effective speaker ; Mr. Horace White , editor of the " Chicago Tribune " ; and Mr. C. H. Ray , editor of the " Chicago Post " ; and , secondarily , to the good sense of the committee and of the Convention , which adopted with enthusiastic unanimity the resolutions framed by these gentlemen . The first of the series ( numbered three in the Chicago platform ) denounces as a national crime all attempts to evade , partially or altogether , the payment of the public indebtedness in good faith to the creditors of the nation , in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the laws // July , under which it was contracted ; the second and third urge the propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by implication no more rapidly than ) the national faith will permit , and of extending the period of redemption and lowering the rate of interest , whenever it can honestly be done ; and the fourth ( that drawn by Mr. Hazard ) maintains that the adoption of an honorable financial policy will diminish the burden of the national debt by improving the national credit . The substantial averment in these propositions is that national dishonesty is at once criminal and impolitic . It is not declared that the public securities , or that certain classes of the public securities , shall be paid in coin , for the sufficient reasons that it will be early enough to consider this question when the bonds of each issue shall have matured , and that at any time it is a judicial rather than a political question ; but it is affirmed that no considerations , other than those which should govern the conduct of an honest man toward his creditors , ought to affect the action of the government , and that doctrines such as have been promulgated by Messrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a few weeks by many Republicans as well as Democrats in several of the Western States , are unsound , whether regarded from a moral or from a business stand-point . It was gratifying to perceive the unanimity with which the National Republican Convention applauded to the echo , as the Illinois State Convention had done a fortnight previously , the announcement that the United States would , in case the party should triumph next fall , put its heel upon the reptile of repudiation . It remains to be seen whether men that , while calling themselves Republicans , have urged a great and prosperous nation to act like a merchant , who goes into bankruptcy to save his property from just demands , will receive further marks of confidence from those who believe in the principles declared at Chicago . Had the National Convention followed the example of the Convention held at Peoria in one other respect , the last two clauses in the paragraph numbered eight would have been omitted . At the time the Illinois Convention met the Court of hnpeachment was still listening to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the belief // that the President would not be convicted of the high crimes and misdemeanors charged in the articles of impeachment , and it was not considered the province of a political assembly to attempt , by promises or by threats , to influence the action of members of the court , in a matter in which they had sworn to do impartial justice according to the laws and the evidence . The Committee on Resolutions unanimously determined not to allude to the subject , and no effort to introduce it was made in the Convention . Yet , as matter of policy , then was the time to speak , rather than after a judgment of acquittal upon one article had been entered , for then , if ever , it was possible to affect the result by coercing the court ; whereas , after the trial had virtually come to an end , an expression of belief that the conclusion was a wrong one would be simply a cry of disappointed rage , a public confession of failure , - not the most favorable augury of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week later , it would probably have passed over the whole matter of Mr. Johnson 's impeachment in silence . The trial would then have been over ; the issues involved would have been consigned to their last resting-place ; the failure to convict would have appeared to every sensible man a failure past remedy ; and the conduct of those Senators , whose sense of duty closed their ears to personal and partisan appeals , and who dared to stand against the storm of popular invective , would have been better understood . Impeachmemmt might have been passed by in silence , moreover , if Mr. John A. Logan , and other loud-voiced declaimers , whose political fortunes were staked upon the result of the trial , had remained in the more congenial atmosphere of Washington ; if the Committee on Resolutions had been composed of none but delegates from the States actually represented in Congress , and sure to vote at the Presidential election ; or if one man in the Convention had been bold enough to take the bull by the horns , after the committee had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they had hoped to see the seal of party condemnation set upon the foreheads of " the seven tr*aitors " ; but the general dissent from Mr. John Coehrane 's proposition to insert the words , " and improperly acquitted by the votes of nineteen Senators , " - which // no State would second , and which his own State compelled him to withdraw , - showed the weakness of the faction of which Logan was the soul , and Spencer and Cochrane the claws . The declaration that Andrew Johnson had been " properly pronounced guilty by the votes of thirty-five Senators " was opposed , in the committee , by most of the Northern States , and supported by most of the Southern ones , by the Territories , by the infant States of Nevada and Nebraska , and by Missouri , California , Illinois , and Massachusetts . It was finally carried by only one majority . Had either Illinois or Massachusetts voted the other way , as both would have done if the wishes of their people had been correctly represented , the clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed upon the committee was drawn from the apprehension that , in its absence , something more objectionable might be adopted . And no doubt this would have been attempted ; no doubt the noisy politicians already referred to would have tried to wreak their vengeance upon the seven men who refused to be the tools of a faction ; no doubt hot words would have been uttered in haste , to be repented of at leisure ; but he who believes that the Convention would , under any circumstances , have gone a step further than it did go has not studied its temper . There are stronger reasons for the opinion that a full discussion of the question would have convinced sensible men of the absurdity of strapping a dead body upon the back of a living political organism , if not also of the immorality of subjecting officers exercising judicial functions to the pains and penalties of party discipline . Several of the largest and most influential delegations had already , in their private consultations , pronounced against action upon this subject . But the expressions contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , the seven Republican Senators , who pronounced Johnson not guilty of the charges preferred by the House of Representatives , and who supported their positions by arguments which have not been answered , had been formally read out of the party , one of two consequences would have ensued . Either t ? me attempt would have succeeded , and the defeat of the Republican ticket been assured , or , as is more probable , it would have failed , and the // 1868 . The Chicago Convention . Republican party , as well as the Convention representing it , would have afforded ground for ridicule to its enemies . But , however absurd the pretension of a body which has not heard the evidence or the arguments in a trial to review the decisions of the court before which it took place , and however impertinent the implication contained in the assertion that the accused was " properly pronounced guilty by the votes of thirty-five Senators , " these words are only heat-lightning , which hurts nobody and frightens nobody , but is merely an indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will have been forgotten long before living Republicans contending for living principles under living leaders , with banners bearing the watchword , " Justice to all men , " and weapons that have never known defeat , move upon the enemy 's works in November . In the matter of the Presidency , it was the simple duty of the Convention to record , officially , the unanimous choice of the Republican party , by putting in nomination the man under whose command the armies of the United States had been victorious over a mighty insurrection , - the man whose indomitable persistence , whose serenity in the presence of danger , whose modesty in triumph , whose equanimity in defeat , whose wisdom in the selection of subordinates and in the combination of forces , whose reticence amidst talkers , whose unquestioning obedience to the laws and to his lawful superiors , whose deference to the national will , whose simplicity of character , steadfastness in the discharge of duty , comprehensiveness of view , and strong good sense , whose unwillingness to accept an honor for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable declarations of adherence to Republican principles , whose hearty co-operation in the policy pursued by Congress toward the people he had conquered , - all seemed to point him out as a not unworthy successor to Abraham Lincoln . The ceremony of putting such a man , so selected , in nomination should have been simple , in order to be impressive . The chairman of each delegation should have arisen in his place , as the name of his State or Territory was called , and announced that the delegation cast so many votes - all its // votes - for Ulysses S. Grant . But a majority of the chairmen were unable to resist the temptation to accompany this declaration with a jest , a bit of poetry , or a piece of bombast . At the announcement of the result a dove wearing the national colors was let loose , a portrait of Grant was displayed from one of the proscenium-boxes , and the flag at the rear of the stage gave place to a view of the White House , with General Grant seated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing at his side , apparently inviting him to enter her favorite residence . The usual cheers upon cheers , the usual waving of hats and of handkerchiefs , and the usual airs from a brass-band upon the stage greeted the nomination , and were followed by a song from three gentlemen , who were evidently unaccustomed to sing together . For three days a brisk canvass for the nomination to the Vice-Presidency had been going on in the lobbies of the hotels and at the head-quarters of the several delegations . So many States had bound their representatives by instructions , that the result of the first ballot could be foreseen , but a wide field was opened for speculation and influence upon the second choice of those whose favorites could not hope to succeed . Messrs . Curtin of Pennsylvania , Cresswell of Maryland , Speed of Kentucky , and Pomeroy of Kansas were each sure to have little support outside of his own State . Governor Reuben E. Fenton would receive , in addition to the sixty-six votes of New York , a large number from the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promise the pecuniary assistance necessary in the conduct of a campaign in sparsely settled and impoverished districts . The strength of Henry Wilson of Massachusetts was largely recruited from the same quarter , and he might have been nominated if New England had given him her united support , so ready was the West to yield to geographical considerations , if insisted upon . But Maine urged the superior claims of Hannibal Hamhin , and the other States east of the Hudson showed no marked partiality for either him or his rival . The real contest lay between Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio and Schuyler Colfax of Indiana ; and it was apparent , from the first , that in such a contest the latter would be successful . If , // indeed , the President had been convicted by the Court of Impeachment , if Mr. Wade had already been installed in the White House , with his hands full of offices , with a majority of the Senate disposed to confirm his nominations , and , as the Tenure of Office Act would have enabled them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inauguration of a new President , the result might have been different ; for human nature is weak , and every man who voted for Mr. Wade would have had hopes , if not promises , of reward . But the acquittal of Mr. Johnson reacted upon the prospects of him who would have profited by conviction , and whose prominence as a candidate was mainly due to the fact that he had for months been heir-presumptive to the Presidency . The trial , however , not being entirely over , the effect of failure to convict was not fully apparent . It was urged by the strenuous advocates of conviction that the nomination of Mr. Wade would be a fitting rebuke to " the seven traitors , " and would partially atone for the absence from the platform of a plank for them to walk out of the party upon . With some hot-heads this argument may have had weight , but those who employed it in private did not venture to urge it upon the Convention , being well aware that it would not commend their candidate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made good use of that part of a politician* s capital which bears the largest interest , - the epithets attached to his name , as " rough and bluff Ben Wade , " " sturdy Ben Wade ' ' honest old Wade . ' ' They were well organized , and they had active allies and frequent despatches from Washington . But Mr. Wade had determined opponents also . His recent declaration in favor of an increase of the duties upon imports , under the plea of protecting domestic manufactures , alarmed not only the advocates of free trade , but also men who believe that the manufacturers are likely to lose more than they will gain by a further increase in duties , already enormous . Mr. Wade had , moreover , furnished weapons to the enemy , in his admission , in a speech made before the war , of the possible right of a State to secede from the Union ; in his loose talk , more recently , about the rights of property , and about the intelligence of naturalized citizens , as compared with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Lincoln in // 18G4 ; and in his sneering reference to General Grant 's indisposition to talk politics . It could not be denied that his adhesion to the principles of freedom and equal rights had been early , courageous , and steadfast ; or that he would act with an energy and decision wortl*y of President Jackson , whom he resembles in other respects : but little confidence was felt in his discretion , his knowledge of men , or his ability to distinguish the right from the wrong , the wise from the unwise course in a doubtful case . It had been feared by many Republicans , heartily opposed to Mr. Johnson 's policy , and desirous of his removal from office , upon sufficient grounds , that the accession of Mr. Wade to the Presidency might expose the country to perils quite as serious as those involved in the continuance of the present administration eight months longer . The friends of Mr. Colfax were imperfectly organized , but they were to be found in every delegation , and he had no enemies . Even Mr. Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they disparaged his popular qualities , and praised their favorite as an elder if not a better soldier . The friends of Curtin or of Fenton raised no ob , jections to Colfax , but professed to believe that the former would poll more votes than any one but Fenton in New York , the latter more than any one but Curtin in Pennsylvania , - an argument counterbalanced by the unanimous support tendered Colfax from New Jersey and Indiana , no less doubtful States . Colfax was known to be the second choice of Maine and of Massachusetts , as he was the first choice of Vermont . Several Western States , that withheld their support from him at first , did so only in order to give no color to a charge that the West claimed both candidates , and waited for the East to lead off in the movement that should insure his nomination . And though it was the change of several Ohio votes from Wade to Colfax , which showed the set of the current , it was the support given by Pennsylvania to the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Hampshire from Wilson to Wade , partially counterbalanced as it was by the unanimous support of Colfax by Rhode Island , was hardly noticed . The nomination was made upon the fifth ballot , Wade having had a slight plurality over his antagonist on each of the preceding ones . // The distinguishing characteristic of Schuyler Colfax is that saving common sense which in practical affairs is a very good substitute for genius , and is far preferable to unbalanced genius . Though we may admire men who are hurried by feeling , or by an active intellect , into injudicious actsor words , we do not willingly intrust our interests , and should not intrust those of the Republic , to them . Brilliancy of imagination , originality of conception , and even breadth of understanding , are less valuable in the ruler of a free people , than sureness of judgment and a living faith in the truth embodied in the French saying , that mankind is wiser than any man . Should Schuyler Colfax succeed to the Chief Magistracy , confidence could be placed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his discretion , and in his deference to an enlightened public opinion ; of the suavity of his manners , and the purity of his life and conversation , no doubt exists . As Vice-President , he will be called to preside over the deliberations of the Senate ; and his success in the more difficult task devolved upon him by the House of Representatives leads to the assurance that he will bring to his new position rare knowledge of parliamentary law , skill in its application and devotion to business . The choice of the Convention was a wise one , and was made without unnecessary delay after the ballotings had commenced . But the speeches accompanying the several nominations were , with one or two exceptions , unworthy of the occasion . The rules limited their length in the case of him who presented a name to ten minutes , and in that of those who supported it to five minutes . each . But , even under these restrictions , almost every speaker continued long after he had finished what he had to say . Not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or related a telling anecdote , or in any other way flashed a light upon the character or the career of his candidate . The Convention was a failure or a success , according as it is judged by its appearance and its words , or by the work it accomplished . There were no great men , and few notable men , upon the floor . Washington was poorly represented , in or out of the delegations , and its influence counted for // naught . The South was virtually absent . No great speeches were made , and only one or two good ones , and no member showed himself competent to grapple with either of the two serious questions that arose . Awkward pauses in the business occurred , and numerous faults in point of taste were committed . Enthusiasm for men or for principles at no time passed beyond control . But no Republican convention , cornpos3d of however capable members , and conducted with however great skill and dignity , could have nominated men stronger with the party than Ulysses S. Grant and Schuyler Colfax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by writing unwise letters as Henry Clay did , or by making foolish speeches as Winfield Scott did . Nor could any convention have framed a more satisfactory declaration of the principles which should govern the Administration to be inaugurated on the 4th of March next .
