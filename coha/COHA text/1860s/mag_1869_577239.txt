in behalf of their sufferings . In reply to the declaration of the Turkish ambassador , Fuad Effendi , that the insurrection was not the result of Cretan discontent , but of foreign intrigues , the Emperor of France urged that the question of remaining with Turkey or union with Greece should be submitted to a popular vote . Fuad Effendi promptly responded , that nothing but another Navarino would force Turkey to cede Crete to Greece . Thus the matter now stands . A dreadful , merciless war ravages the Islaild of Crete . Christendom is appalled in view of its horrors . England and France could terminate the conflict at once , by a declaration of their intention to support the insurgent Cretans . But from this intervention they shrink , mainly probably , because , by thus intervening , they weaken that power , to sustain which , but a few years ago , they sacrificed at Sebastopol thousands of lives and countless treasure . Russia could not openly intervene , without so palpably expressing her designs as again to arouse Europe in arms against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaided . Such are the complications with which the Eastern Question is involved . It is now agitating all the courts of Europe , and ever threatens to embroil the Continent in a general war . At the time of writing this article , the results of the recent Conference in Paris are not fully known . But it is scarcely possible that those results can accomplish any thing more than a brief retardation of the march of Russia towards Constantinople . WONDERS OF THE DEEP . II . ODD FISH . And four great boasts came up from the sea , diverse one from another. - DANIEL vii . 3 . I* the whole range of fabulous monsters , there is not one that has met with greater incredulity , and yet maintained its hold on the wonder of man with more constant tenacity , than the.kraken . From time immemorial it has appeared again and again on the pages of travellers , and from the oldest philosopher to the days of Lac6p*de and Buckstone , these faint traces of its true character and gigantic proportions have been carefully examined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree with the actual dimensions of a genuine and formidable monster . Aristotle , whose history has so often been the laughing-stock of the half-informed , and whom the sceptics of all ages have been delighted to use as a type of unreliable naturalists , has of late recovered , step by step , the venera tion which he enjoyed in the Middle Ages . It would be an interesting task to gather the great facts constantly represented , in sidentiflc works , even , as new discoveries , of which a correct sketch is already contained in the works of the ancient savant . Thus he seems to have known , better than any naturalist down to our own day , the nature of the polypus , who , in all probability , has filled the imagination of men for so many centuries , under the name of the kraken . Trebius tells us a story , on the other hand , in which undoubted facts are already half-hidden under a mass of exaggerations , of which Aristotle never became guilty , however common they were in the writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came every night from the great deep on shore at Carteja , // in order to feed upon salt meat . These robberies incensed the people , who in vain tried to discover the intruder , although they surrounded their drying-places with high palisades . The polypus took advantage of a large tree which stood near them , and , by means of an overhanging branch that could support his weight , he slipped in night after night . At last , however , his hour came ; the dogs discovered him one morning , as he tried to make his way back to the sea , and soon hosts of men surrounded the monster ,  --  at a distance only , for the novelty of the sight , the hideousness of the monster all covered with brine , his enormous size and the horrible odor which he diffused on all sides , nearly petrified the poor fishermen . In the meantime , he was fighting the dogs bravely , now striking them to the ground with his two larger arms , and now beating them painfully with his whiplike tentacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tridents they overcame and despatched the monster . We must add , for the honor of Pliny , who quotes the account of Trebins , that he looks upon it as a prodigy , and in his quiet , quaint way , gives the reader to understand his reluctance to vouch for the statement . The head and the arms of the giant were , however , brought to Lucullus and carefully measured . The former was of the size of a cask , capable of holding fifteen ampbor*e , with a beak in proportion ; the arms were thirty feet long , and so large that a man could hardly span them ; what remained of the flesh , weighed still over seven hundred pounds . Whether Lucullus had it dressed for his tables , is not stated ; we know , however , that the Romans were as fond of the flesh of these hideous creatures , as the fishermen of the coasts of Normandy are in our day ; it is firm , but savory ,  --  and assumes , when cooked , a white and pink color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with such slight variations only , that it appears essentially the same account . Ashan , however , furnishes new evidence ; for he states , upon good authority , that a huge monster of the kind , aslarge* the biggest of whales , was killed with axes by Spanish merchants , whose magazines it was in the habit of robbing . Pliny adds the crowning-piece of wonder : A polypus , he says , exists in the great ocean , called Arbas , whose feet are of such enormous size , that they prevent it from coming into the Mediterranean , as the Straits of Gibraltar are too shallow for such a giant ! Very different are the accounts which take up the thread where antiquity left it suddenly , at the time when Rome fell , heathen gods were dethroned , and the darkness of the Dark Ages fell like a pall upon all mankind . The Scandinavian seamen , bold like no other sailors on earth , regular vikings , dwellers on the great deep , colored all their relations with the dark and dismal tinges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even , admired only what was beautiful and graceful in nature , and thus , although they knew the kraken , they loved not to dwell on his monstrous proportions and hideous appearance . Their poetry never alludes to them , and their art disdained to stoop to such repulsive forms . Not so the sombre children of northern twilight ; they also know the kraken , and describe it with remarkable correctness in their soberer moments ; but they love to dwell upon its repulsive features ; they exaggerate its dimensions and its ugliness ; they change it into a terrible being , full of dread power and malign purposes ; and then they believe in their own dreams and enjoy like children the strange delight with which they are filled by their very fears . They go on increasing its size , till it becomes , to their excited imagination , the Mountain Fish , and they see it soon everywhere , in their land-locked bays and out on the stormy sea ; when the thick stormclouds lower till tl4ey touch the crest of the waves , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon an unknown shallow , it is again the kraken . The Norwegians , especially , loved to // tell wondrous tales ; how their bold seamen landed on a deserted island which showed no trace of life , not a shrub nor a blade of grass , and while they still wandered about , marvelling at the utter desolation , the island began to heave and to move , and behold ! they found themselves on the back of the monster ! Great authorities came to confirm the stories ; saints and bishops lent the weight of their sacred character to the accounts given by laymen and heretics . Erick Falkendorf , a bishop of Nidros , wrote , in 1520 , a long letter on the subject to Pope Leo X. He was sailing , on a Sunday , in a Norwegian vessel along the distant coast , and bewailed his inability to celebrate holy mass on firm land . As he mourned and prayed , suddenly an unknown islet arose , not far from the vessel ; the crew land , the sacred vessels are carried on shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After mass they return on board ship , and immediately the island begins to tremble , and gradually to sink back into the sea , from which it had risen . The island had been a kraken ! Olaus Wormius , also , who is generally truthful enough , relates having seen , about the year 1643 , one of these enormous monsters , and states that they resemble an island far more than an animal . He expresses his belief that there are but few krakens in existence , and curiously enough adds , that while they are themselves immortal , the Medustu are nothing more than the eggs and the spawn of these monsters . Other writers , of the same century , confirm his statement , and believe in the immortality of the kraken  --  a faith which was not even shaken when , in 1680 , the carcass of one of these monsters was for the first time discovered in the Gulf of Newangen , in the parish of Astabough . His arms had become entangled in the countless cliffs and rocks which characterize the dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , unable to extricate itself . When putrefaction commenced in the enormous mass , the odor became so offensive for miles and miles , that serious fears of a pestlience were entertained . Fortunately , the waves came to the aid of the frightened people , tearing off piece after piece , and carrying it into the ocean ; and when the last remnant had been washed away , an official report of the whole event was drawn up by a clerical dignitary , and is still to be found in the government archives at Drontheim . A similar case occurred on the Newfoundland banks , where polypi abound in such numbers , that the fishermen of all nations , who congregate there in the season , use , every summer , nearly two millions as bait , with which to catch codfish . Towards the end of the last century , a monstrous specimen of this class died on these banks , beyond Pine Light , and here , also , the mass of putrifying matter was so enormous and the odor so intolerable for a great distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the neighborhood , till the currents had carried off every trace of the terrible animal . Of all the authors , however , who have given us more or less detailed accounts of their experience with the soetrolden , or sea-scourge , as the Swedes call it , Pontoppidan is by far the most precise in his statements . The northern people , he tells us , assert , and without the slightest contradiction in all their accounts , that when they go out into the open sea , during the great heat of the summer , they find the water suddenly less deep , and upon sounding , the lead frequently marks only thirty fathoms . The fishermen know then that a kraken floats between the lead and the bottom of the sea , and they immediately get ready their lines , for they know that where the monster is , fish always abound . If , on the other hand , the depth diminishes , if this accidental bottom moves and rises , then it is time for them to make their escape ; for the kraken is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe and to stretch out its huge arms towards the sun . The fishermen hasten away with all // their might , and when they can at last rest on their oars at a safe distance , they then see the enormous creature , whose back covers a mile and a half of sea . The fish , taken by surprise by his sudden rising , leap frantically about in the small pools formed in the rugged irregularities of his back , and then a number of points or shining horns appear gradually , rising till they look like masts with their yards ; these are the arms of the kraken , which are so powerful that they can seize the ropes of a large ship , and sink it in a few moments . After having remained a short time above water , the kraken sinks down again , and this is scarcely less dangerous to vessels near by , as he displaces , in sinking , such an enormous volume of water , that whirlpools and currents are formed , scarcely inferior to those of the dread maelstrom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned bishop , who , no doubt , wrote what he conscientiously believed to be true , although he can not quite disguise his own scepticism in regard to some of the facts mentioned . It is very different with Augustus , of Bergen , a man of critical mind , who , not having seen a kraken himself , collected all the Scandinavian accounts of which he heard , and after examining them carefully , came to the conclusion that there does exist a gigantic polypus-though far from boasting of the dimensions usually attributed to the monster-that it is provided with arms , that it emits a strong odor , that it shows at times long ventacles , and only appears in summer time , and during calm weather . It is remarkable how fully the conclusions of this learned naturalist have been confirmed by modern discoveries . The great Linn6 , a Swede in heart as in race , seems to have been troubled with strange doubt concerning this pet monster of his countrymen ; for , after having solemnly introduced the kraken into his Swedish fauna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work , " The System of Nature , " he suddenly drops him in the seventh April , edition , and never more says a word of the gigantic polypus . This did not have much effect , however , on the sailors of his and of other lands , as they were not much given to reading Latin works ; and in Sweden , as well as in France , the faith in the kraken remained as general and as firm as before . Countless votive offerings adorn , to this day , the little chapels that rise high above the iron-bound coast , with their tiny turrets and tinkling bells ; but none more weighty in precious metals , none more thankfully offered to the Lord of the Sea , than those which speak of the delivery from the dread kraken . One of these-in the church of " Our Lady of the Watch at Marseille " - is accompanied by a touching recital of a fearful combat with the monster on the coast of South Carolina , and another , hung up in the chapel of St. Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave-ship from the arms of a gigantic polypus , at the very moment when it was leaving the port of Angola . In 1783 , a whaler assured Dr. Swediaur that he had found in the mouth of a whale a tentacle of twenty-seven feet length . The report was inserted in a scientific journal of the day , and there read by Deny Montfort , who at once determined to obtain more ample information on the subject . It so happened that , just then , the French Government had sent for a number of American whalers , in order to consult with them as to the best means by which the French fisheries could be revived . These men were staying at Dunkirk ; and here Montfort questioned them , and upon inquiry it appeared that two of them had found feelers , or horns , of such monstrous animals . Ben Johnson saw one in the mouth of a whale , from which it hung to the length of thirtyfive feet ; and Reynolds another , floating on the surface of the sea , forty-five feet ud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the reports which he heard , the following was the most minute and yet also the most extraordinary : Captain John 3Vlagnus Dens , a Danish sailor of high character and established PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . // uprightness , deposed that , after having made several voyages to China in the service of the Gottenburg Company , he had once found himself becalmed in the fifteenth degree S. L. , at some distance from the coast of Africa , abreast of St. Helena and Cape Nigra . Taking advantage of his forced inactivity , he had determined to have his ship cleaned and scrubbed thoroughly , and , for that purpose , a few planks were suspended on the side of the vessel , on which the sailors could stand while scraping and caulking the ship . They were busy with their work , when suddenly an anchertroll-so the Danes call the animal-rose from the sea , threw one of its arms around two of the men , tore them with a jerk from the scaffolding , and sank out of sight in a moment . Another feeler appeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the act of ascending the mast ; fortunately , the man could hold on to the rigging , and as the long feeler became entangled in the ropes , he was enabled to escape , though not without uttering most fearful cries . These brought the whole crew to his assistance ; they quickly snatched up harpoons , cutlasses , and whatever they could lay hands on , and threw them at the body of the animal , while others set to work cutting the gigantic feeler to pieces , and carrying the poor man to his berth , who had swooned from intense fright . The monster , with five harpoons thrust deep into its quivering flesh , and holding the two men still in its huge arms , endeavored to sink ; but the crew , encouraged by their captain , did their utmost to hold on to the lines to which the harpoons were fastened . Their strength was , however , not sufficient to struggle with the marine giant , and all they could do was to make fast the lines to the ship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted . Four of the ropes snapped , one after the other , like mere threads , and then the harpoon of the fifth tore out of the body of the monster with such violence that the ship was shaken from end to end ; thus the animal escaped , with its two victims . The whole crew remained overcome with amazement ; they had heard of these monsters , but never believed in their existence ; and here , before their eyes , two of their comrades had been torn from their side , and the third , overcome with fright , died the same night in delirium . The feeler which had been separated from the body , remained on board as an evidence that the whole had not been a frightful dream ; it measured at the base as many inches as their mizzen-mast , was still twenty-five feet long , and at the pointed end provided with a number of suckers , each as large as a spoon . Its full size must have been far greater , however , as only part of it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the surface . The captain , who had witnessed the whole scene and himself thrown one of the harpoons , ever afterwards considered this encounter the most remarkable event of his checkered life , and calmly asserted the existence of the kraken . All these ancient accounts , the Norwegian legends , the reports of sailors of many nations , and the minute descriptions of Sicilian divers , who spoke of polypi as large as themselves , and with feelers at least ten feet long , could not fail to make an impression upon men of science , and the most discreet among them came to the conclusion that there must be some truth amid all those fables . It was , however , reserved to our century to strip the facts of all exaggeration , and to establish the existence of such monsters beyond all controversy . A kind of mollusk , called cephalopodes , were found in various seas , whose peculiar formation and strange appearance sufficiently explained the marvels told of the kraken . An elongated sack in the form of an egg , or a cylinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round head , with a pair of enormous fiat eyes ; on this head , at the summit , a kind of hard , brown beak , after the manner of a parrot 's bill , and around the beak a crown of eight or ten powerful , long arms-this is the // polypus , which passed of old for a kraken . On the inner side , each one of these gigantic arms or feelers is covered with a double row of suckers , which resemble a small cup with a movable bottom . By means of these cups , which the animal can exhaust of the air they contain , it can affix itself to any surface ; and as it possesses several hundred of them , its power is naturally enormous . Nevertheless , they use these feelers only for the purpose of seizing their prey and handing it up to the beak , which then goes to work and tears it to pieces . Nor is their manner of swimming less curious . Their gills require a large quantity of water to furnish them with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are covered with an elastic mantle , which the animal contracts when it is full , so as to drive the water it contains through a tube placed between the eyes . Every time that the mantle is thus contracted and the water expelled , the latter forms a kind of jet , which , striking upon the inert matter around , gives to the animal an impetus in the opposite direction . At each pulsation , therefore , it advances , and thus it travels quite rapidly through the water . The , cephalopodes on European and American coasts are generally only of small size , although in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic seas some have been found of larger dimensions , and others still greater are kept in museums . In the open sea , however , vessels have encountered genuine giants of the kind , and these are , no doubt , the true representatives of the kraken . Rang met one of the size of a ton , and of reddish color , while Pennant saw in the Indian Seas an eight-armed cuttle-fish , with arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breadth ; thus making it extend , from point to point , one hundred and twenty feet . A naturalist of Copenhagen , who has made the study of these animals his specialty -Steenstrup -- had occasion to examine one of these monsters in 1855 , on the coast of Gothland , where it had been April , caught by fishermen . It required several carts to carry the body off ; and the hind part of the mouth , which he saved from destruction , still had the size of an infant 's head . The museum at Utrecht contains a specimen of a colossal cephalopode ; and our own Mr. Barnum was , of course , not without at least one of the feelers of such a giant , as thick as a man 's body , and over ten feet long . Win . Buckland , the great naturalist 's son , and an excellent observer himself ; took pains to examine the varieties known to the British coast , and allowed one small specimen to grasp his hand and arm . He describes the feeling to be such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , and little red marks were left on the skin where the suckers had been at work . " The sensation , " he says , " of being held fast by a ( literally ) cold-blooded , soulless , pitiless and voraciou* sea-monster , almost makes one 's blood run cold . I can now easily understand why they are called man-suckers ; only the natives of the Chinese and Indian seas have such a horror of them ; for in those climates they are seen large and formidable enough to be dangerous to any human being who may be so unfortunate as to be clutched by them . " Victor Hugo 's description of his monster in the " Travailleurs de la Mer , " is , of course , far more graphic and poetical , though hardly less to the point . On the logs of many a vessel , encounters with colossal mollusks of this kind have since been entered , and although the largest ever accurately measuredby a French man-of-war 's men-was only twelve feet long in body , with feelers of fifty feet length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify the conviction that the wonders of the deep are not yet all known , and that animals like the kraken may be still in existence . The twin-brother of the kraken , both in its marvellous size and in the incredulity which all descriptions have excited , is the famous sea-serpent . Its history is as old as the oldest record ; no age and no seafaring nation has been PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . // 471 without some account concerning its appearance , and yet to this day serious doubts are entertained as to its existence . It is clearly referred to in the Old Testament , where the prophet Isaiah sings In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword Shall punish leviathan , the piercing serpent , Even leviathan , that crooked serpent , And he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea . Again , when Job plead his uprightness , and the Lord answered unto Job out of the whirlwind , he mentions behemoth and leviathan , and says concerning that monster : Canet thou draw out leviathan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou lettest down ? C*st thou put a hook into his nose , or here his jaw through with a thorn ? Shall thy companions make a hanquet of him l shall they part him among the merchants I Caust thou fill his skin with barbed irons I or his head with fish spears I Who can open the doors of his face I Ills teeth are terrible round about . His scales are his pride , shut up together as with a close seal . One is so near to another , that no air can come between them . 3y his neesings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . Out of his nostrils goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot . His breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth . When he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid : The sword of him that layeth at him can not hold : Ijie spear , the dart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil like a pot : he maketh the sea like a pot of oiutment . He maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be hoary . Upon earth there is not his like . It is well known that the monster , so graphically described by the voice that spoke to Job in the whirlwind , has been sometimes believed to be the elephant , and then again the crocodile . But in the Psalms , Leviathan is distinctly mentioned as living in the great and wide sea , and God is said to have formed him to play therein . The Jews , therefore , evidently looked upon him as a sea-serpent of colossal size and most formidable appearance , identical with the instrument of the Lord , of which He says : " And though they be hid VOL . IIL-30 from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will I command the serpent and he shall bite them . " These imposing descriptions are , moreover , by no means limited to the excited imagination of Hebrew writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a gigantic wonder of the deep . Palladius , for instance , speaks of a serpent of the Ganges , which he calls grandly an odontotyrannus , who could swallow an elephant without straining . Solin has heard of him frequently , and knows that he lives in India and Ethiopia , crosses the Indian Ocean by swimming , and travels from island to island ; while Pliny quotes Solam , who found these colossal serpents in the Ganges ; " They were blue , " he says , " and so large that they could easily seize and drag under water an elephant . " It is , however , in the Middle Ages , that we find the fullest accounts of the monster . Pontoppidan , one of the most learned Scandinavians , who was long bishop of Bergen , in Norway , and died as chancellor of Denmark , in Copenhagen , in 1764 , states , in his interesting contributions to Natural History , that in his country every body believed firmly in the great sea-serpent , and if he or any of his guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , as if he had been uncertain whether eels or herrings really existed . The good people of those northern regions were so familiar with these wonderful creatures , that they spoke of two distinct kinds of sea-serpents , one living in the sea only , the other amphibious , which preferred the land generally , but retired periodically to the great deep . Nicolaus Gramius , minister of the gospel at London , tells us , that during a destructive inundation , am immense serpent was seen to make its way towards the ocean , overthrowing every thing in its path , animals , trees , and houses , and uttering fearful roarings . The fishermen of Odal were so frightened by the terrible sight , that they did not dare go out in their boats kb* several days . // The famous Archbishop of Upsala , Olaus Magnus , who bears testimony to the kraken , also speaks more than once of the amphibious serpent . He states that they leave the shelter of the cliffs near Bergen at night ; they have a mane , their bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright light ; out at sea they rear themselves against the ship they encounter , and seize whatever they can obtain on deck . An animal of this kind , he continues , was actually seen in 1522 , near the island of Moos , which measured over fifty feet in length , and was continually turning round . Several works on Natural History , down to the celebrated compilation of H. Ruysch , published in 1718 , contained pictures of these Norwegian serpents . Paul Egede , finally , a most trustworthy man , and well known by his connection with Greenland missions , which he helped his father to establish and fostered as bishop , not only bears witness to the frequent appearance of such sea-serpents on the Scandinavian coasts , but describes minutely one which he met himself on his second voyage to Greenland . If we believe , therefore , the testimony of the Hebrews and of the Northern nations , there exists a serpent , living in the sea , of gigantic proportions , swimming by vertical movements , in which it is aided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the case in fossil reptiles like the plesiosaurus , and covered with a thick skin , which was frequently found cast off on desert islands . On the back it has a shaggy mane , its eyes are large and brilliant , and the head is shaped somewhat like that of a horse . It is only seen in midsummer and during fine weather , for the want of stability in its long , flexible body disables it from resisting the effect of high winds . Like all rare animals of gigantic proportions , the sea-serpent naturally excited terror in the few persons who ever encountered it ; and this led , as a matter of course , to marvellous stories about its size and ferocity . Sailors loved to tell how the great monster would throw itself bodily over their vessel to make it sink , and then to feed at leisure on the bodies . of drowned seamen . Others told frightful tales of beloved comrades , who were suddenly snatched from their side by such animals , which appeared unexpectedly at the ship 's side , raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their victims . Fortunately , a very simple means of defence is at hand , according to the belief of Norwegian sailors ; these monsters have , it seems , a most delicate sense of smell , and can not endure the odor of musk ; nothing is needed , therefore , but to scatter some musk on deck , and the terrible animal no sooner smells it from afar , than it makes off and dives to the very bottom of the sea . It was , however , by no means in remote times only , that the sea-serpent has been seen by travellers and sailors . Reports , on the contrary , abound in our day also of such encounters , and scarcely a season passes , but the monster has been seen in our own seas , or in more distant parts of the northern ocean . Officers of the navy , ministers of the gospel , American whalers and English navigators , all agree , without essential differences in their statements , on the existence and general forms of such monsters . The first reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship captain , Laurent de Ferry , of Bergen , in the form of a letter , from which we extract the following facts : Towards the end of the month of May , in 1746 , he was returning from a voyage to Trundhin , when the weather being calm and warm , he suddenly heard the eight men , who formed the crew of his boat , whisper to each other . He laid aside the book which he was reading , and then noticed that the man at the helm was keeping off from the land . Upon questioning the latter , he was told that there was a sea-serpent right before them . He ordered the man immediately to turn , and to steer strafght upon the strange animal , of which he had heard much during all his life . // The sailors at first showed great reluctance to obey , but as the monster was right before them , and moving in the * same direction , they became excited , and after a while engaged heartily in the novel , stern chase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired his gun at it , and immediately it plunged , evidently wounded , for the water all around was stained red , and remained so for two or three minutes . The head , which rose over two feet above the surface , resembled a horse 's head ; it was gray , with a dark-brown mouth , black eyes , and apparently a long mane floating over the neck . Beyond the head they could see seven or eight coils of the huge serpent , each of enormous size , and at considerable distance from the next . The animal did not reappear ; but the time during which it was clearly in sight was ample to enable the captain and his crew to examine it closely . The only other report which is perfectly clear and precise , has a Rev. Mr. McLean for its author , who wrote from the Hebrides , and very naively exhibited his terror . His statement amounts to this : lie saw the sea-serpent in June , 1808 , on the coast of Coll . He was sailing about in a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile , an object which excited his surprise more and more . At first he took it for a small rock among the breakers ; but knowing the sea very well , and being sure that there was no rock there , he examined it carefully . He then saw that it rose considerably above the surface , and after a slow , undulating movement , he discovered one of the eyes . Alarmed at the extraordinary appearance and the enormous size of the aniinal , he cautiously coasted along near the land , when he suddenly saw the creature plunge in his direction . He as well as his men were thoroughly frightened , and pulled with all their might to escape . At the very moment at which they reached the shore , and when they had barely had time to climb up to the top of a large rock , they saw the monster glide slowly up to their boat . Finding the water quite shallow there , it raised its horrible head , and turning again and again , seemed to be troubled how to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile , slowly making its way out to the open sea . The head was large , of oval shape , and rested on a rather slender neck . The shoulders , as the good pastor calls them , were without gills , and the body tapered off toward the tail , which was never distinctly seen , as it was generally under water . The animal seemed to move by progressive undulations , up and down ; its length they estimated at from seventy to eighty feet ; it moved more slowly when the head was out of water , and yet it raised it frequently for the evident purpose of discerning distant objects . At the same time when Mr. Mc Lean saw the serpent , it was also seen in the waters near the Island of Carma . The crews of thirteen fishing-boats were so frightened by its terrible appearance , that they sought refuge in the nearest creek . Nor were they only seen out at sea when mistakes would be natural , and fright or intense curiosity might lead to unconscious exaggeration , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . Thus , to mention but one instance , in 1808 , the body of a gigantic serpent was washed on shore at Stronsa* , one of the Orkneys . A Dr. Barclay was summoned at once , and , in the presence of several justices of the peace and some men of learning , an affidavit was drawn up , which stated that the monster measured over fifty feet in length and nine feet in circumference that it had a kind of mane running from behind the head nearly to the tail , which was brilliantly phosphorescent at night ; and that its gills , nearly five feet long , were not unlike the plucked wings of a goose . Sir Everard Home , it is true , believed it to be a basking shark of uncommon size . But Gloucester fishermen repeatedly saw similar animals , and the Linn*an Society of the United States examined carefully a number of witnesses ; the same has been done in Holland and in the Dutch cobnies // of Java , and everywhere evidence has been obtained , which showed remarkable unanimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does the sea-serpent belong only to the realm of fancy , or is it really one of the great wonders of the deep ? The question has never yet been finally decided . That there must be in existence animals of serpent-like form and of gigantic proportions , seems to be well established by the concurrent testimony of American , English , and Norwegian eye-witnesses ; and the mere fact that no specimen exists in the museums , and that no such monster has been encountered of late years , does not by any means disprove the experience of so many ages . On the other hand , great allowance must no doubt be made for the effect of fear which enlarges all objects , the desire to excite wonder which leads men to embellish their accounts , and the natural tendency to add to original accounts , which results often unconsciously in exaggeration , and has in all probability furnished us with such wonderful creatures as the kraken , the roe , and the phoenix . Nothing in these descriptions is , besides , actually incompatible with the laws%f nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , that in former ages gigantic reptiles have peopled the sea , which were far more surprising in size and shape than the much-doubted sea-serpent . There is no necessity , therefore , to ascribe all such encounters to simple mistakes ; now and then , perhaps , a long string of algae , moving slowly under the impulse received by gentle winds or unknown currents , or masses of phosphorescent infusoria , floating for miles and miles on the calm surface of the sea , may have led superstitious sailors to fancy they saw giant serpents . But it is , on the other hand , by no means improbable that the vast deep , of which so little is as yet known to man , may still hold some of the giants of olden days , and that , of the many well-trained , intelligent people who nowadays " go down to the sea in ships , and do busi ness in great waters , " some may yet see these " works of the Lord , and His wonders in the deep . " Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seas  --  the whale-and yet , he is of truly monstrous proportions . It is a perplexed chapter , to be sure , in natural history , to say how many species of whales there are ; for Jack Tar comes home with confused accounts of Sulphur Bottoms , Broad Noses , Razor Backs , and Tall Spouts , and a host of other names by which he learns to distinguish unprofitable whales , not worth the toils and perils of capture . But after all , this only shows that the family is very fully known ; and well might this be so , if we remember that already in the ninth century a * Norwegian Ohthere , whose wonderful adventures were taken down by no less a man than King Alfred himself speaks of having slain sixty such monsters in two days . This is , of course , impossible ; but we must bear in mind that there is nothing in nature so wonderful that the human mind does not love to add a finishing touch of its own , and make it yet a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moving things , by whose side even elephants are but dwarfs , has been exaggerated ; and great authorities , of recent times even , have gravely described it as two or three hundred feet long . Nor must we forget , that since the Biscayans and Basques first dared attack the whale on the high seas , in 15Th , all seafaring nations have joined in the pursuit , and naturally tried to outstrip their rivals in startling accounts of the prey which they hunt on the hungry waves , with toppling icebergs around them . In early times the Esquimaux killed the true whale of the North with harpoons , to which large bladders of air were fastened , which prevented the poor animal from sinking and plunging ; and in our own day , good-sized steamers go out on the whale fishery and dispatch them by the aid of galvanic batteries . Their homes , also , have changed with the times ; the Floridians , who were once reported to kill them by driving // 475 pegs into their blowlioles , no longer see them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of their activity and energy in self-defence , are now eagerly sought after in distant seas . In olden times , however , strange stories were current about the peculiarities of whales , and among them the accounts of men swallowed by them hold a prominent place . They arose , no doubt , from the biblical account of Jonah , who " was three days in the whale 's belly ; " but as , unfortunately , the animal is so made that the mouth will easily hold a boat and its crew in its vast space , but the throat is too narrow to allow even a mackerel to pass , the " great fish " must have been either another variety , or , as some think , a vessel called by its name . Nevertheless a great author , Fournier , recites gravely in his Hydrography , the following story : During the reign of Philip H. , King of Spain , there appeared in the great ocean a whale , very different from all others in this , that he floated partly above the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could move like a vessel . A ship encountered him , and broke one of these wings by a cannonshot , whereupon the whale entered , very stiffly , through the Straits of Gibraltar , mid uttering horrible bellowings , went ashore near Yalencia , where he was found dead . The skull was so enormous that seven men . could stand in it , while the palate would hold a man on horseback ; two dead men were found in the stomach , and the jawbone , seventeen feet long , is still to be seen in the Escurial . Nor is this the only fable that has been from of old connected with these true giants of the sea ; their size especially has given rise to amusing exaggerations ; and the love of the marvellous , which tempts us all , has caused the most extraordinary stories to be spread far and wide , while the more exact , but less attractive descriptions , have been culpably neglected . Thus Pliny already gravely informs us , that there were in his times whales found in the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , have easily filled a whole village . Not only romance-writers , but even naturalists of renown , like Gesner , in his work on Fishes ( 1551 ) , have taken pleasure in representing whales as animals resembling islands ; and in speaking of sailors who had landed unawares on their back , covered , as it was , with a mass of green alg*e . Saint Ambrosins , and other saints , came near being lost by such an error , if we believe the legends of the Church . The same amusing idea occurs in that delightful book , the " Arabian Nights , " which , it is well known , was compiled from very ancient Arabic legends and manuscripts . " One day , " says Sinbad the sailor , " as we were sailing along , a calm befel us near a little island . The captain ordered the sails to be furled , and allowed all who chose to go on land ; I was among those who landed . But whilst we were amusing ourselves , eating and drinking , the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a whale . " The fable spread rapidly , especially among nations who lived far from the sea and had no means to verify the truth of such accounts by their own experience . They were all the more readily believed , as for generations no other books were accessible to the masses but the Bible and Pliny ; and both of these authorities spoke confidently of these monsters ; the latter by name , the former , as was then universally believed , under the thin disguise of the leviathan . In the Orient , of course , gre4er exaggerations still were added , age after age , such as the utter ignorance of the seas prevailing among Eastern nations , and their high-wrought imagination , loved to invent and to hear . An ancient Jewish work , the Bara-Bathra , already speaks of a vessel which sailed three days over a whale , before it accomplished the distance between head and tail ; and Arab authors loved to assert , that the earth was actually resting upon a gigantic whale whose occasional tremors were the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evil // One approached the animal , and , laughing at the patience with which it had so long borne an useless burden , persuaded it to shake its backbone , and thus to rid itself of the load . The globe was just about to be shaken ofl when , fortunately , some one informed Allah of the impending calamity , who hastened to the spot , and , after a long discussion , succeeded in exacting a promise that the whale would continue to uphold the earth a few thousand years longer . The Chinese are , as usually , not behind other nations in early and magnificent accounts of their own giants . In an ancient work of authority , called Tsi-hiai , they speak of a whale Pheg , which beats four hundred miles of ocean into foam whenever it moves . At a very advanced age , this monster of the deep is changed ; it becomes then the famous monster of the air , the bird roc . Now , as we have stated before , the natural history of the whale is perfectly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one feature connected with the giant which is not as familiar to all . This is the fact that the flesh of the whale is excellent food , and was formerly esteemed most highly . It was for a long time a royal dish in England , and , in 1243 , Henry III . summoned the sheriffs of London to furnish him , for his table , with a hundred whales ! In the thirteenth century it reappears in the housekeeping-book of the Countess of Leicester , and for several generations afterwards all the whales caught in the Thames belonged by right to the Lord Mayor of London , who had them served up in state at great municipal dinners . Marteus , in his northern voyages , ate whale flesh frequently ; but he considered it coarse and tough , inferior to beef ; the tail only furnished , when well cooked , really palatable dishes . The Normans used to be , in former times , the caterers of the English ; they possessed the secret of several recipes by which to cook the rare delicacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peas . The main use to which the whale is put , remains , however , the oil , the sperm , and the whalebone , and these are rich sources of income to many nations . American sperm whaling , especially in the Pacific , has , in a commercial point of view , grown to immense proportions . When New England was yet a colony , gray-headed men would point to the sea , saying , " Those are the fields where our children will reap their harvests ; ' * and a fleet of over six hundred sail yearly employed in hunting the sperm whale , now realizes the prediction . Among the near kindred of the whale is the famous unicorn-not the companion of the lion on the British coat-ofarms , but its counterpart among the wonders of the deep . Inferior in size to the right whale , it has the advantage of a most formidable weapon , with which Nature has provided it for as yet unknown purposes . This is the monstrous tooth which projects from the upper jaw of the animal ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , turned in a spiral , and sharply pointed at the end ; hollow within , it shows externally the finest and whitest ivory known to the trade . The Narwhal , or nose-whale , was so called because the Dutch , who seem to have had the christening of most quaint things in northern regions , at first took this horn , projecting straight ahead , ten or even fifteen feet , for a grotesque long nose . Some say the animal uses this odd appendage to pierce holes through the ice when he comes up to blow or breathe ; others , that he mows off seaweed with it , on which he grazes . There is no doubt that , at times , he transfixes fish with his gigantic stiletto , so that he may be able to devour them at leisure . The legend has it , that a king of Denmark , wishing to make somebody a present of a piece of the horn of the unicorn - for such it was long considered-ordered one of his high officials to cut off a piece at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The officer did so , and , to his astonishment found that what he had looked upon as a solid horn , was hollow , and in the concavity he discovered a smaller horn of the same // shape and the same substance . The latter was about a foot long , and this resemblance to the teeth of men first led , it is thought , to the idea , that the unicorn might after all be nothing more than a gigant.ic tooth . In those days , however , the superstitious people attached marvelloua powers to the wonderful horn , and a brisk trade was carried on in fine specimens , and even in broken fragments . The male alone possesses this formidable weapon ; the female having , instead , two small teeth , of little use for purposes of attack or defence . In the male , however , one of these two is disproportionately developed , while the other remains either of diminutive size , or disappears gradually altogether ; very much as is the case with the claws of certain crustac&amp;e . At first sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas , with his terrible sword , would be the terror of the seas , killing and devouring all that came near him . In reality , however , the narwhal is a very harmless animal , and generally his own enemy more than that of others . His mouth has no teeth , and immovable lips , and is so small that he can swallow little else but mollusks and little fish ; and Scoresby , who found in the stomach of one of these strange beings a ray of two feet length , came to the conclusion that the fish must have been first transfixed by the tooth , and killed before it was devoured . Otherwise it would have been di*cult to understand how an active fish should have allowed itself to be caught by an animal unable to seize it with the lips or retain it with the tongue , and in a mouth which had not even teeth to tear it to pieces . Their swiftness , when they are alone , is marvellous ; and their capture would be almost impossible , if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense troops , and of taking refuge in little bays , from which they can not easily escape . Small boats approach them , in such cases , with precaution ; the poor animals begin to crowd upon each other , they press their ranks so closely that soon their movements are impeded , and their enormous weapons become interlaced , as each one tries to raise the head high into the air . They can neither escape nor defend themselves , and thus fall an easy prey to the lances of the whalemen . Scoresby thus once encountered , on his voyage to Greenland , a troop of narwhals , divided into smaller bands of fifteen or twenty . The males were far more numerous than the females . They seemed to be full of sportive gayety , raising their huge weapons high above the water , crossing them with each other , and uttering a sound as if they were gurgling water in their throats , while they seemed to amuse themselves with the play of the rudder in the water . At other times , however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then they attack and sometimes pierce large whales . It is doubtful whether their efforts against vessels arise from ill-humor and pugnacity only , or from an idea that the ships are large whales . Like the bees , the poor narwhals also generally seal their own doom when they make such attacks ; for the enormous tooth , driven with prodigious force into the timber , remains fast there , and , breaking off causes the death of the ferocious animal . At times , when he has driven it in right at the stern , the poor creature itself is fastened to the ship and towed along , until it dies and decomposes , to the great disgust of the sailors , who see their course impeded and their senses insulted without any profit . In the Paris Museum there is a complete skeleton of a magnificent narwhal , with a tooth of amazing size . The marime monster here shows its exquisite adaptedness to the clement for which the hand of the Creator had fashioned it , and no one , on seeing the slender , flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Greenlanders eat the flesh , and obtain from the fat an oil second only to the best sperm oil . But it is the tooth , after all , i ' 7hich has made the narwhal , at all times , one of the wonders of the deep . Long before the aniinal itself was known , the tooth was // familiar to traders as the horn of the unicorn . The monastery of St. Deny 's possessed a pair of these remarkable weapons , famous for their size and the beauty of the ivory ; they are now in the Medical Museum of Paris . A larger one , nearly nine feet long , exists in the treasury of the Danish monarch , at Fredericksborg . When they were not kept thus , as most rare curiosities  --  the unicorn itself having , of course , never been seen-they were manufactured into weapons of every kind , swords and daggers . But they were also endowed , in popular belief , with a wondrous power of counteracting all poisons ; and their mere presence , it was thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down to the days of the French king , Charles IX. , a piece of the precious substance was regularly dipped into the cup of the monarch before he drank ; and when the great founder of modern surgery , Ambroise Par6 , was requested to raise his voice against the superstition , he replied that the belief was universal ; and if he ventured to contradict it , he would be treated like an owl appearing in bright daylight , which the other birds fall upon and kill , and then think no more of the murdered victim . Nevertheless , he subsequently wrote openly against the custom , and with so much skill and power , that after that time no one dared avow his secret faith in the virtue of the unicorn 's horn as an antidote . Wormius , whom we have mentioned before , was the first to establish the true character of the strange curiosity . " Finding myself , " he writes , " a few years ago , at the house of Mr. Fris , Grand Chancellor of Denmark , I complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should never have inquired after the animal from whom these horns were obtained , or brought home a part of their skin at least . They are more curious than you think , replied the C*iancellor , and let me see a skull of immense size , to which a portion of a so-called horn was attached . I was delighted to see so rare and so precious a thing . I saw at a glance that the skull resembled that of a whale , and had , like the latter , two blowholes on top , which opened into the mouth . I also noticed that what was called a horn , was inserted in the left side of the upper jawbone . Having learned that a similar animal had been captured and carried to Iceland , I wrote at once to the Bishop of Holl , who had been my pupil , and requested him to send me a drawing of the same . He did this promptly , adding that the Icelanders called it narwhal , which means , a whale that feeds on corpses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was , however , a fact , that the Greenland Company purposely defeated all efforts to obtain an animal of this kind ; as the fictitious value of a horn of the unicorn was far more profitable to their treasury than the tooth of a narwhal . In 1636 , two of their vessels had bought some fine horns from the natives in Davis ' Straits , where they had been compelled to winter . Some time afterwards one of their agents went to Russia , and offered to sell the Czar Alexis , the father of Peter the Great , two of these precious curiosities , as veritable horns of that unicorn which is mentioned in Holy Writ , and spoken of by Aristotle and Pliny . Alexis admired them very much , and actually offered the enormous sum of six thousand dollars for the finest ; but before concluding the bargain , he proposed to consult his physician . This man was learned and experienced enougI* to examine them properly , and he soon discovered , from their structure , that they were teeth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned crestfallen to Copenhagen , and received for his consolation the sneering question , why he had not first offered two or three hundred ducats to the physician , who would then have seen as many horns of the unicorn as he could have wished ?
