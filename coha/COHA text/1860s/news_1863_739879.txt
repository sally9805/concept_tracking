txt JEFFERSON DeviS , in his recent tour of inspection to the rebel Army of Tennessee , is said to have expressed the opinion that the position of that army was impregnable . In this belief he was sustained by the decision of his ablest engineers , while the rebel press was not slow to imbue the minds of their people with the same confidence in the security of BSAGG 'S line . Indeed , the position of the Confederate army fronting us at Chattanooga , its right resting on Missionary Ridge bristling with artillery , and its left towering high in air , lifted upon the craggy crest of Lookout. from which was thundered daily salutes of defiance to our forces under Gen. Hooses in the valley , seemed to a vast majority of military men to be impregnable , and that an attempt to dislodge them by a movement from the front would be but to rush to certain destruction . A settled belief in the futility of attacking the heights had grown in the minds of the men . The great mountain rested like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like an evil genius it darkened with an ever-present shadow all prospective glory , leaving the craving desire for victory without the hope of success . Bearing its artillery among the clouds this " Gibraltar of the West " frownea ominously upon the camps of Gen. Truosefe army , on the plain 2,000 feet below . Closing as with a wall of rock the river , which swept its base , it had for months successfully prevented communication with our base of supplies , save by a tortuous and difficult road , over which lengthy trains , laden with provisions , labored for weeks in ineffectual attempts to reach their needy customers  --  the half famished soldiers of the Army of the Cumberland . Although most men were satisfied to rest quiet under the conclusion that Lookout was impregnable , the hero of Vicksburgh thought otherwise ; for in the great military drama which he had been planning since his advent in this department , the capture of the rebel stronghold was the first act which , successfully executed , rendered the remainder of the task one of comparative certainty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOOKER 'S line extended up the Lookout Valley for several miles , having for its picket margin the moat-like creek which skirts the mountain base . Gen. HOOKER had repeatedly asked permission to assault.the enemy 's position in Ms front , but the time had not arrived when all the advantages of victory could be reaped . For several days preceding the 24th of November Gen. SHERMAN 'S columns had been silently pouring into Chattanooga , and assuming such positions as they were ordered to take preparatory to the grand ' movement , which was only delayed to await their cooperation . At last , on the 24th , Gen. JOSEPH Meese received the welcome order to " take Lookout . " Quickly arranging his plans , already conceived in anticipation of his former requests being granted , he issued necessary orders , so that before morning the troops were under way , The General selected for the immediate command in the execution of this perilous undertaking was GEARY , who , on the night of the 28th of October , with 1,200 men , made a successful fight against Hoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mountain to capture Gen , HOOKER 'S trains and rear as they moved in the valley . It was evident that the assault , to be a successful one , would have to be executed with the greatest rapidity . At 5 A. M. , on the morning of the 24th Nov. , Gen. GERRY 'S division , the famous " white star " of the Army of the Potomac , crossed Lookout Creek at an undefended and almost unknown ford , one and onehalf miles up the valley . Small detachments had been sent to Nicojack Trace , several miles further in the interior , where the attack , if any were expected , would be well guarded against . This force served to deceive the enemy as to the real point of danger . . - . ruggedThe nature of the ground , and the steep ness of the ascent , rendered it impracticable for us to take our horses with us , so that the General and his mounted officers marched , or rather climbed , at the head of their respective columns on foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front . around which it was necessary to pass to the east side , where there was a practicable road to the summit . Fortunately a dense fog rested upon the side of the hill , screening our important movement from the enemy on top . At one mile from the crossing-place we came suddenly upon the rebel picket , at Lookout Bridge . Unapprehensive of a fire from their rear , they were completely surprised . and surrendered without firing a shot . Under cover of the mist , the line was quickly formed , extending from the bridge up the rugged slope to the ease of the precipitous wall of rock which crowns the huge elevation . The formation was as follows : In front line Col. COBHAM 'S ( Second ) brigade on the right , Col. IRELAND 'S ( Third ) brigade on the left . When COBHAM reached the rock precipice at the summit , he changed direction by the left , and Col. IRELAND doing the same , they both advanced in a continuous line and charged along the mountain side . WHITAKER 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and C01 . CANDY 'S ( First ) brigade of Gmear 's division next . These two moved similarly to the front and formed the second line about 300 yards in rear of the first . The Sixty-sixth Ohio and three companies of the Fifth Ohio regiments were placed in echelon on the left of CANDY , forming a reserve . In this order the troops advanced with wonderful rapidity . considering the nature of the ground . which was full of ravines. and obstructions of huge boulders detached from the overhanging rocks . As the mist Partially cleared overhead . and revealed us to the astonished vision of the rebels upon the cliff , a musketry fire was commenced , with some loss to us . The enemy brought three pieces of artillery to the edge of the cliff , and attempted to enfilade us , but , owing to the great depression , their shots crashed through the tree-tops , doing us no injury . IRELAND and COBHAM were sweeping around the brow of the hill , driving everything before them , when they came pell-mell upon the fortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advance , and so impulsive the charge of the men , who were rendered furious by the loss of several brave officers , picked off by rebel sharpshooters , that almost every man of this brigade was either killed or captured . It was in the advance upon this camp that GILBERT M. Ettiorr , Major of the One Hundred and Second New-York Volunteers , was killed , and Lieut. - Col . AVERY , of the same regiment , was wounded . As the Second and Third brigades were pushing around the point , the head of GROvE 's column was visible at the foot of the hill . where they had crossed the creek end were corning to our support . Our advance swept around the brow of Lookout , driving a strong reinforcement of the enemy from a series of strong works , capturing two pieces of cannon and impetuously advancing to assault a new line of works three hundred yards further on , betstnd the white house which Gen. LONOSTREZT had for some time used as his headquarters . At this juncture the scene became one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested in dense folds upon the sides of the mountain , concealing the combatants from view , suddenly lifted to the summit of the lofty ridge , revealing to the anxious gaze of thousands in the values and on the plains below a scene such as is witnessed but once in a century . Gen. GEARY 'S columns , flushed with victory , grappled with the foe upon the rocky ledges and drove him back witn slaughter from his works . While the result was uncertain the attention was breathless and painful , but when victory perched upon our standards shout upon shout rent the air . The whole army with one accord broke out into joyous acclamations . The enthusiasm of the scene beggars description . Men were frantic with joy , and even Gen. THOMAS himself , who seldom exhibits his emotions , said involunarily . " I did not think it possible for m en to ac complish so much . " An order now came to halt the pursuing line and strengthen the position . Two strong lines were formed , one from the cliffs toward Chattanooga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cliffs downward on the face of the mountain overlooking Lookout Valley . Gen. Gzear 's division , which so far had stood the brunt of the contest , losing 160 of their number in killed and wounded , were now relieved by CANDY 'S brigade , of GEARY 'S , and CARLINE 'S brigade from Chattanooga. while Gen. OSTEREIAIIS ' division took up the second line , which was sent to the front . The troops thus relieved were some of them placed In the second line to act as a reserve and rear guard , while others were massed between the two lines ready to act as a support to either line . The enemy . which had been massed in our front against COBHAM and IRELAND , beyond the white house , made several indecisive dashes during the evening , but were promptly silenced every time . Sharpshooters were employed with effect on both sides . The enemy used their cannon on the cliff . but could not depress them sufficiently to fire them with much effect . The night was passed in replenishing the exhausted supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prisoners . Scaling ladders were i prepared and every precaution use a to insure success in the task allotted for early dawn , when the face of the cliff was to be assaulted and the summit reached . At daylight , without opposition , the precipice was scaled and it was ascertained that the enemy had evacuated during the night . The Rags of the Eighth Kentucky , Thirty-eighth Indiana and the White Star " banner of Gen. GEARY 'S division were soon floating to the breeze from the loftiest peak of the rebel stronghold . A reconnoitering force sent back upon the mountain , found the abandoned camps of three brigades , with all their stores of camp and garrison equipages and supplies . The trophies of victory may be summed up as follows , viz. : Two thousan d one hundred prisoners . three battleflags , two pieces of artillery , 3,000 stand of arms , a vast quantity of tents and camp furniture , and 10,000 rations . Thus gloriously ended one of the most brilliant victories of the war  --  one which paved the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediaiely followed at Missionary Ridge and Ringgold  --  battles which have driven the enemy to seek a fortified position in the interior of Georgia , where he can reorganize his now shattered columns . Of the choice spirits who sacrificed their lives to their country in the late battle , none were more beloved for virtues and the promise of future greatness than Maj. ELLIOTT , of the One Hundred and Second New-York . A graduate of the New-York Free Academy , with the highest honors in the gift of that institution fresh upon him , he forsook the pursuits of civil 1 ife , in which distinction awaited him , to defend with his life-blood his country 's cause . He began hies military career as a Lieutenant , and served as'alich at Antietam . Afterward appointed Ordnance officer on Gen. GEARY 'S Staff , he served through Chancellorsville and Gettvsburgh , distinguishing himself at the former battle , where he served ammunition to the troops of almost the entire army under the hottest fire of the day .
