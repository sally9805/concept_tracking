txt City Point , Gen. GRANT 'S new base of Supplies in his operations against Richmond from the south bank of the James River , is at this moment a seenb of extraordinary bustle and activity . The high bluff on which le situated the few ramshackle and battered houses which constitute the town , is oovered for miles with troops . white and black , with tents , trains , ambulances , home , supplies of all kinds . In every direction , every street , road and avenue , is crowded with the moving masses . The aver in front is filled with steamboats , big and little , and with transports , from which troops are debarking , and around which thousands of negroee are at work , unloading the material and reloading it on trains , which at once push forward . The houses are all filled with wounded men , who have been brought in from the battles of Wednesday and Thursday . Long lines of soldiers may continually be seen passing from the steamers to the wharf , from thence moving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front . The fighting which has been going on for the past three days at Petersburgh , is still in progress , as we can tell by the sound of the artillery which reaches es . and it is in the direction from which the sounds come that these troops are gaily marching . The extraordinary bustle and activity in all directions to-day is owing to the fact , that though a portion of our troops has held the place for some days , this is the first day since GRANT 'S army reached this side of the James that boats have had free access here from below ; for it was not until last night that the pontoon bridge was taken up , and the great accumulation of boats below it bad en opportunity to pass hitherward . It is ' only to-day that City Point has really been established as the base of operations . It certainly is a most exoellent base . We have easy communication with Petersburgh , either by land or up the Appomattox River ; but the land line is so far superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the field of battle seems to produce no very lively impression of its horrors . Here we are but seven miles from the field on which mutual slaughter has been going on upon a great scale for four days . Here we are within easy hearing of the artillery which all day has been belching forth destruction , and yet here all around are groups of men sitting , lying or standing , and talking over or discussIng the ordinary topics of life , reading the newspapers , etc . All day and ceaselessly men have been carrying in the wounded upon stretchers and in ambulances  --  soldiers from the front who have had legs or arms carried away , who have bullets in vai ions parts of their head , trunk or limbs  --  men who have fought their last fight , men whose sight is growing dim and their pulse weak ; but such sights seem now to be but part of the commonplace aline Not only in the houses are the wounded , but under the shade of the trees , and on low little cots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming hobbling in by the aid of a stint , with their legs or feet torn or pierced by bullets . Others , who have been wounded in the hand or arm , or even had their arms broken , will tie the ends of their handkerchiefs together , support in it the lacerated member , stanch the blood as best they may , and may be seen walking into town here to have it dressed . Others , with slighter wounds , such as a finger or two shot off , the flesh of their faoe or body torn , may be seen wandering about the streets in great numbers , pouring from their canteens cooling water upon their wounds , or rather upon the rage that cover them . The surgeons have done as well as was la their power , but there ought to have been at least five to one that there is . Some of them have been at the operating table for forty or fifty successive hours , performing capital operations , dressing wounds of secondary consequence , administering medicines , &c.; When I mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful a frame as Dr. CARNOORAN , almost entirely exhausted after performing a single capital operation which occupied him an hour , you will see how these surgeons must be worn who have been operating day and night , and how many important things , as well as how many minor but painful cases , must have been neglected in the necessary haste of the last four days . All these wounded men whom I see under the trees , in the tents , and in the houses , bear their wounds with a degree of manliness , patience and cheerfulness to which I have seen no parallel among sufferers from maims in civil hospital practice . The negroes , in particular , of whom there are a large number here Wounded , seem to be actually proud of their wounds  --  proud that in this sacred cause they have been accounted worthy to shed their blood , or lose a limb , or be pierced by a bullet or torn by a shell  --  proud that they have been enabled to demonstrate their manhood by showing that they have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here let me diverge for a moment , to this to ? pie , as the present is the first occasion in the course of the present war in which negro soldiers have taken part in actual fighting on the soil of Virginia , or alongside of the veteran Army of the Potomac . Of the actual character of their fighting , and of their behavior under fire in the severe action near Petersburgh on Wednesday last , I can not speak from personal observation , for I did not reach here till yesterday . But I have seen and conversed with many of the black troops who have reached here from the front od various duty , with a large number of the wounded , and with many of the white officers and soldiers who were present with them on the Geld ; and the wounds as well as the witnesses , glee strong find uniform testimony teethe immense heroism and high military Qualities of the negro soldiers Bs exhibited on this occasion . There are iinnumerabletales of individual deeds of bravery of as high Charaeter as any that songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general admirable conWet in what they achieved and in what they suffered . Of the latter quality  --  that of suffering ? I can speak from what I have here seen . Shortly after reaching this place , I heard over among the trees the musical , yet mournful sound , of a body of negro men and women singing religious hymns . Thitherward I wended my way through the darkness , and soon came upon a little house , which was surrounded by young and middle-aged wounded black ssoldiers.Inside the house were others lying on the leer more severely wounded , and in the centre of them stood a venerable old negro grandfather , whose tremulous voice led the song of praise to Christ , that sounded shrilly beneath the evening sky , and in which he was joined by some women as well as by the wounded who were able to join The old African 's body swung to and fro , and his arms were raised passionately toward Heaven , as he save out the lines , two by two , for the benefit of the Aber &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ecstacy of prayer ; but although I could unierstand little of his broken dialect , I doubt not that 1 was all listened to anti understood by Him to whom it was addressed . Presently he sprang again to his feet and broke forth into a mournful solo , in which his voice was soon joined by that of a young fro icgro girl , and I walked m the immediate vicinity to my quarters ; but praises and prayer I heard , continued until far into the night . In the course of the eveeine I walked . ID company with a surgeon , around some of the hospitals . He told me that thus far but five hundred wounded had been brought in from the front , and of these four Mildred and fifty were wounded negro soldiers . Little cots bad been constructed for them , and they were in nearly every house of the town . I saw and conversed with many of these men  --  rael whose roadies were wounded in every MeelfIlble way . Here is one with both his lower limbs shattered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ira . possible for the surgeon to save . Here Is one whose filet has just been taken off . Here Is one with proud still in his neck ; but he actually seems prond of the mark of honor , and his eye lights up as we ap , preach him . Here is a poor young fellow , whose thigh is terribly torn , and who must wn intsa be yond the present world . No potent medicine can de aught for him , and be knows it . So we pus Ismael from cot to cot , and among some who , also 1 have as cots on which to rest their fevered frames , and whc crouch around the porches of the houses efiti aeons the trees , Everywhere there is heroic fortitude , P* tient endurance , uncomplaining suffering . Many 01 the less severely wounded are anxious and happy to tell you how they faced the repels , how they Carried the breastworks , how they got their wounds . May thoughts passed through my head as I wrapped my blanket around me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not help honoring and blessing these heroic black soldiers of the Union , who were willing to suffer death and wounds in upholding the glorious banner of our auntie misterrs.
