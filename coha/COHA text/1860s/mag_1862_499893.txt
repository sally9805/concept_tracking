THE TRUE INTEREST OF NATIONS . Fon a litigious , quarrelsome , fighting animal , man is very fond of peace . He began to shed blood almost as soon as he began to go alone in company with his nearest relatives ; and when Abel asked of Cain , Am I not a man and a brother ? ' the latter , instead of giving him the hug fraternal , did beat him to death . Cain 's only object , it should seem , was a quiet life , and Abel had disturbed his repose by setting up a higher standard of excellence than the elder brother could afford to maintain . It was only to conquer a peace ' that Cain thus acted . He desired indemnity for the past and security for the future , ' and so be took up arms against his brother and ended him . He loved peace , but he did not fear war , because he was the stronger party of the two , his weapons being as ready for action as the British navy is ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a twelvemonth ago Cain is the type of all mankind , who know that peace is better than war , but who rush into war under the pressure of envy and pride . Ancient as violence is , it is not so old as peace ; and it is for peace that all wars are made , at least by organized communities . All peoples have in their minds the idea of a golden age , not unlike to that time so vividly described by Ilesiod , when men were absolutely good , and therefore happy ; living in perfect accord on what the earth abundantly gave them , suffering neither illness nor old age , and dying as calmly as they had lived . Historical inquiry has so far shaken belief in the existence of any such time as that painted by the poet , that men have agreed to place it in the future . It has never been , but it is to be It will come with that coming man , ' who travels so slowly , and will be by him inaugurated , a boundless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war 's unequal game ' is played with transcendent vigor , and at a cost that wbuld frighten the whole human race into madness were it incurred for any other purpose . But , while fighting , men have kept their eyes steadily fixed upon peace , which is to be the reward of their valor and their pecuniary sacrifices . Every warlike time has been followed by a period in which strenuous exertions have been made to make peace perpetual . Never was there a more profound desire felt for peace than that which prevailed among the Romans of the Augustan age , after a series of civil and foreign wars yet unparalleled in the history of human struggles . One poet could denounce the first forger of the iron sword as being truly brutal and ironhearted ; and another could declare it to be the mission ' of the Romans only to impose terms of peace upon barbarians , who should be compelled to accept quiet as a boon , or endure it as a burden . Strange sentiments were these to proceed from the land of the legions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred even dishonor to war . So was it after the settlement of Europe in 1815 . A generation that had grown up in the course of the greatest of modern contests produced the most determined and persistent advocates of the peace-at-any-price ' policy ; and for forty years peace was preserved between the principal Christian nations , through . the exertions of statesmen , kings , philMlthropists , and economists , who , if they could agree in nothing else , were almost unanimous in the opinion that war was an expensive folly , and that the first duty of a government was to prevent its subjects from becoming military-mad . Perhaps there never was a happier time in Christendom than it knew between the autumn of 1815 and the spring of 1854 , after Naixileon had gone down and before Nicholas had set himself up to dictate law to the world . It was the modern age of the Antonines , into which 428 // was crowded more true enjoyment than mankind had known for centuries ; and they are beginning to learn its excellence from its loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe lives in hourly expectation of its occurrence . There were wars , and cruel wars , too , in those years , but they faintly affected Europe and the United States , and prob .. ably added something to men 's happiness , for the same reason that a storm to which we are not exposed increases our sense of comfort . Their thunders were remote , and they furnished materials for the journals . So we saw a Providence in them , and thanked heaven , some of us , that we no longer furnished examples of the folly of contention . The friends of peace were actuated by various motives . With statesmen and politicians peace was preferred because it was cheaper than war , and all countries were burdened with debt . England has sometimes been praised because she so uniformly threw her influence on the side of peace , after she had accomplished her purpose in the war against imperial France . Time and again , she might have waged popular wars , and in which she would have probably been successful ; but she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor the Turks against the Russians , nor the Poles against the Czar , nor the Hungarians against the Austrians , nor the Italians against the Kaiser , nor the Greeks against the Turks . She settled all her disputes with the United States by negotiation , and showed no disposition to fight with France , except when she had all the rest of Europe on her side . But this praise has not been deserved . England did not quarrel with powerful countries , because she could not afford to enter upon costly warfare . She had gone to the extent of her means when her debt had reached to four thousand million dollars , and she could not increase that debt largely until she should also have increased her wealth . Time was required to add to her means , and to lessen her debt ; and to such a state had 429 her finances been reduced , that it is now twenty years since she began to derive* a portion of her revenue from an income tax , which , imposed in the time of peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given to keep the peace were too great to admit of her breaking it . She did not fight , because she doubted her ability to fi , ht successfully . She had no wish to behold another suspension of cash payments by her national bank ; and a general war would be hire to bring suspeffsion . But she was as ready as she had ever been to contend with the weak . The Chinese and the Afghans did not find her very forbearing , though with neither of those peoples had she any just cause for war . With the disunited States she has been as prompt to quarrel as she was slow to contend with the United States and now she is one of the high contracting parties to the crusade against Mexico . We say nothing of the Sepoy war , for that was a contest for empire , ' as Ear Russell would say . She could not , in the days of Clyde , give up what she had acquired in the days of Clive ; and no one ought to blame her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied that the mutiny was the consequence of hex own bad conduct in the East . With Russia , Austria , and Prussia to back her , in 1840 , she went to the verge of a war with France ; but , in so doing , the government did that which the English nation by no means warmly approved ; and the fall of the whig ministry , in 1841 , was in no small part due to Lord Palmerston 's policy in the preceding year . The RusskLn war was brought about by the action of the English people , who were angry with the Czar because his empire had the first place in Europe . The government would have prevented that war from breaking out if it could , but popular pressure was too strong for it , and it had to give way . The event has proved that the English government was wiser than were the English people , France alone having gained anything from the departure from what had become the policy of // Europe ; and for France to gain is not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philanthropists , we have little to say . They are always respectable , and it is a pity that the world should be too wicked to appreciate them . But those of the economists are open to remark , and the more so because there has been so much claimed for them . They reduced everything to a matter of interest . Peace , they reasoned , is fo'r the welfare of all men ; and , if an enlightened self-interest could be made to prevail the world over , war would be rendered an impossibility Wars between civilized countries have mostly grown out of mistaken views of interest on the part of governments and peoples . Once enlighten both rulers and ruled , and make them understand that war can not pay , and selfishness will accomplish what religion , and morality , and benevolence , and common sense have failed to accomplish . Cutting throats may be a very a , reeable pastime ; but no man ever yet paid for anything more than it was worth , with his eyes wide open to the fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations would be as wise as individuals , unless it be true that the sum of intelligence is not so great as the items that compose it ; and when it should have been made indisputably clear that to make war was to make losses , while peace should be as indisputably profitable , there would be no further occasion to expend , annuafly , immense sums upon the support of great armaments , such as were not kept up , even in times of war , by the potentates of erlier days . The reason of mankind was to be appealed to , and they were to be made saints through the use of practical logic . Neighborhood , instead of being regarded as cause fo* enmity , was to be held as ground for good feeling and liberal intercourse . Under the old system it had been the custom to call France and l3*ngland natural enemies , ' words that attributed to the Creator the origin of discord . Under the new system , those great countries were to become the best of friends , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to do away with the effects of five centuries of disputes and warfare . England was to forget the part which France took in the first American war , and France was to cease to recollect that there had been such days as Cricy and Agincourt , *fittoria and Waterloo ; and also that England had overthrown her rule in North America , and driven her people from India . But it was not France and England only that were to enter within the charmed circle ; all nations were to be admitted into it , and the whole world was to fraternize . It was to be Arcadia in a ring-fence , an Arcadia solidly based upon heavy profits , with consols , rentes , and other public securities - which in other times had a bad fashion of becoming very insecure - always at a good premium . Quarter-day was to be the day for which all other days were made , and it would never be darkened by the imposition of new taxes , by repudiation , or by any other of those things that so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Temple of Peace might be enabled to rise in proper proportions , it became necessary to destroy some old edifices , and to remove what was considered to be very rubbishy rubbish . Protection , tariffs , and so forth , once worshiped as evidences of ancestral wisdom , were to be got rid of with all possible speed , and free trade was to be substituted , that is , trade as free as was compatible with the raising of enormous revenues , made necessary by the foolish Whrs of the past . In due time , perfect freedom of trade would be had ; but a blessing of that magnitude could not be expected to come at once to the relief of a suffering world . England , which had taken the lead in supporting protection , and whose commerical system had been of the most illiberal and sordict character , became the leader in the grand reform , pushing the work vigorously forward , and , with her usual consideration for the feelings and rights of others , ordering the nations of Europe // and America to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bcen all in the wrong since the day when Oliver St. John 's wounded pride led him to the conclusion that it was the duty of every patriotic Englishman to do his best to destroy the commerce of Holland . She was very impatient of those peoples who were shy of imitating her , forgetting that her conduct through six generations had made a strong impression on the world 's mind , and that her sudden conversion could not immediately avail against her long persistence in sinning aga*iust political economy , if indeed she had so sinned ; and the question was one that admitted of some dispute , free trade being but an experiment . Gradually , however , men came round to the British view , in theory at least ; and among the intelligent classes it was admitted that commerce without restriction was the true policy of nations , which must be gradually adopted as the basis of all future action , due regard to be paid to those potent disturbing forces , vested interests . France was slow to yield in practice , though she had produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as little given to change in matters of business as she is ready to rush into political revolutions . But even France at last gave sinus of her intention to abandon her ancient practice in deference to modern theories ; and Napoleon III . and Mr. Cobden laid their wise heads together to form plans for the completion of the cordial understanding , ' on the basis of free trade . Less than forty years had sufficed to effect a gradual change of human opinion , and protection seemed about to be sent to that limbo in which witchcraft , alchemy , and judicial astrology have been so long undisturbedly reposing . Death , we are told , found his way into Arcadia ; and disappointment was not long in coming to disturb the modern Arcadians , who had as much to do with cotton as their predecessors with wool . The dream of universal peace , a peace that was to endure because based on enIinhtened selfishness , - that is to say on buying in cheap markets and selling in dear ones , - was as rudely dispelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interest , it was found , could no more make men live lovingly together than principle could cause them to do so in by*gone times . If there were two nations that might have been insured not to fight each other , because interest was sufficient to prevent men from having resort to war , those nations were Russia and England . They were in no sense rivals , according to the . definition of rivalry in the circles of commerce . Between them there was much buying and selling , to the great profit of both . *ngland is an old nation , with the arts of industry developed among her people to an extent that is elsewhere unknown . The division of labor that prevails among her working people is so extensive and 50 minute , that in that respect she defies comparison . Other countries may have as skillful laborers as she possesses , hut their industry is of a far less various character . Russia is a new country , and she requires what England has to dispose of ; and England finds her account in purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Commercially speaking , therefore , these two nations could not fall out , could not quarrel , could not fight , if they would . In all other respocts , too , they could be counted upon to set a good example to all other communities . They had more than once been aliies , each had done the other good services at critical times , and they had had th' foremost places in that grand alliance which had twice dethroned Napoleon I. The exceptions to their general good understanding belong to those cxceptions which are supposed to be useful in proving a given rule . When the tory rulers of England became alarmed because of the success of Catharine II . in her second Turkish war , and prdposed doing what was done more than sixty years later , - to assist the Osmanlis , - the opposition to their policy became so powerful that even the strong ministry // of William Pitt had to listen to its voice ; which shows that the tendency of English opinion was then favorable to Russia . The hostility of Czar Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the failure of his mind ; and the immediate resumption of good relations between the two countries after his death , establishes the fact that the English and the Russians were not sharers in the Czar 's feelings . During the five years that fob lowed Tilsit , Russia appeared to be the enemy of England , and war existed for some time between the two empires ; but this was owing to the ascendency of the French , Alexander having to choose between England and France . The nominal enemies did each other as little iA jury as possible ; and , in 1812 , they became greater friends than ever . Most Englishmen were probably of Lord Holland 's opinion , that England 's interest dictated a Russian connection ; and in the eighteenth century England was , in some sense , the nursing mother of the new empire , though once or twice she was inclined to do as other nurses have done , - administer some punishment to the rude and healthy child she was fostering , and not without reason . So harmonious had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent Russian author , Dr. Hamel , writing in 1846 , could say : Nearly three hundred years have now elapsed since England greeted Muscovy at the mouth of the Dwina . So great have been the benefits to trade , the arts , and industry in general , arising from the friendly relations between England and Russia , which , in 1853 , will have completed the third century of their continuance , that one might expect to see this period closed , in both countries , with a jubilee to commemorate so remarkable an example of uninterrupted amicable intercourse between nations . ' The year 1853 came ; but , instead of being a jubilee to the old friends of three centuries ' standing , it brought the beginning of that contest which is known as the Russian war . That was a proper way , indeed , to notice the happy return of the three-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of ' uninterrupted amicable intercourse ' between the nations , whose soldiers were soon slaughtering each other with as much energy as if they had been natural enemies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside the storm of war . The English people were angry with Russia because the iron-willed Czar had carried matters in Europe with a very high hand , and was , in fact , virtually master of the Old World , and suspected of being on uncommonly good terms with the masters of the New World . Nicholas had succeeded to the place of Napoleon in their ill graces . They liked the Cossackry of the one as little as they had liked the cannonarehy of the other . It was a case of pure jealousy . Russia was too powerful to suit the English idea of the fitness of things , and therefore it was necessary that she should be chastised and humbled . Fear of Russia there could have been none in the English mind . It has been thought that En0land contended for the safety of her Eastern dominions ; but then the Czar offered her Egypt and Candia , possession of which would not only have much str ? ngthened her Indian empire , but have been the means of making her more powerful at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if valuable territories would have satisfied her feelings ; and much praise has been bestowed upon her because she did not close with the Czar 's proposition to share and share alike ' the lands of the House of Othman ; but that praise is not quite deserved , the desire not to *e Russia aggrandized being a stronger sentiment with her than was the desire to aggrandize herself . Had the question been left for British statesmen alone to settle , - had the British premier been as free to act for England as the Czar was for Russia , - poor , sick Turkey would have been cut and carved most expeditiously and artistically ; she would have been partitioned as perfectly as Poland , and Abdul Medjid would have experienced the fate of Stanislaus Poniatowski . But English ministers hold 432 // power only on condition of doing the will of the English nation , and that nation had contracted an aversion to Russia that was uncontrollable , and before its hostility its ministers had to give way , slowly and reluctantly ; and the half-measures they adopted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; explain the disasters of the war . ' The English people were determined that there should he an end , for the time at least , to the Russian he*cmony , and threw themselves into the arms of France with a vivacity that would have astonished any other French ruler hut Napoleon III. , who had lived among them , and who knew them well . The war was waged , and , when over , what had England gained ? Nothing solid , it must he admitted . The territory of Russia remained unimpaired , and there is not the slightest evidence that her influence in the East was lessened by the partial destruction of Sebastopol . The Russian navy of the Euxine had ceased to exist ; but as it consisted principally of vessels that were not adapted to the purposes of modern warfare , the loss of the Russians in that respect was not of a very serious character . Russia 's European leadership was suspended ; but her power and her resources , which , if properly employed , must soon reinstate her , were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had fon*ht in vain . Fra ce had as little interest in the Russian *ar as England , and the French people had no wish to fight the Czar . They would have preferred fi*hting the English , in connection with the Czar , - an arrangement that would have been more profitable to their country . But the emperor had a quarrel with his arrogant brother at St. Petersburgh , and he availed himself of the opportunity afforded by that brother 's obstinacy to teach him a lesson from which he did not live to profit . Nicholas had cut the new emperor , and had caused him to be taboo 'd by most of the sovereigns of Europe ; and the Frenchman determined to cut his way to consideration . This he was enabled to do , with the aid of the English ; and ever since the war 's close he has held the place which became iacant on the death of Nicholas - that of Europe 's arbiter . The French fought well , as they always do , but their heart was not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself . Exactly the opposite state of things existed in France to that which existed in En* land . In the former country , the government was for war , and the people were for peace ; in the latter , the government was for peace , and the people were for war . In each country power was in the hands of the war party , and so war was made , in spite of the wishes of the French people and of English statesmen . When Napoleon III . had accomplished his purpose , he ordered the English to make peace , and peace was made . In this way he satisfied his subjects , showing them that he had no intention of making England more powerful than she had been , or Russia weaker . He had prevented Russia from extending her dominion , but he had also prevented England from lessening that dominion . The Italian war was waged in opposition to the sentiments of the French people , which was one of the leading causes of its sudden termination , with its object only half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reputation for statesmanship and courage . Whether , in a comprehensive sense , that war was entered upon for purposes adverse to the interests of France , may well be doubted ; but it is certain that it was an unpopiAar measure in that country . The French had no objection to the humiliation of Austria ; but it would be a grave error to suppose that they have any wish to behold Italy united and powerful . The kingdom of Italy , should it become all that is desired for it by its friends in this country , would be to France a source of annoyance , and probably of danger . The emperor 's power was shaken by his Italian policy , and hence it was that he played the confederature game so long , to the astonishment of foreinners , and got 433 // possession of Savoy and Nice , to the astonishment and anger of England ; and hence it is that he is seeking Sardinia and other portions of Italy . Thus , the Italian war was begun against the interests of the French people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though this is the age in which there is to be peace , because that is not to be broken except when popular interests require that it shall no longer be preserved . But the most remarkable instance of the fallacy of the idea that regard for the true interests of nations must banish hostilities from the world , is afforded by the course of France and England toward this country since the beginning of the secession war . Both those countries have great interest not only in the preservation of peace with the United States , but in the preservation of peace in the United States ; and yet they have done all that it lies in their power to do to encourage our rebels , and have been on the verge of war with us : and war with them , and with Spain , is expected by many Americans , who judge of the future by the present and the past . England had a vast trade with the American Union , buying at the South , and selling to the North , and hence any disturbances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no sooner had it become apparent that our troubles were to be of a serious character , than her weight was thrown on to the side of the rebels , who never would have been able to do much but for the enconragemcut they have received from abroad . The trade of France was not so great with America as that of England ; yet it was valuable , and the French have suffered much from its suspension , perhaps we should say its loss . The North has purchased but little from Europe for a year , and the South has sold less to Europe in that tiWe . There has been a trade in food between the North and some European countries , in which grain has been exchanged for gold , though it would have been better for both parties could anything else than gold have been brought to America , true commerce consisting in the interchange of commodities . For all the sufferin*s that have been experienced by Englishmen and Frenchmen , they have none but themselves and their governments to censure . That pence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war that has been blown into so fierce a flan*se has been fed from Europe ; it has been fanned by breezes from France and England . When it was first seen that there was danger of civil war , the governments of those countries , if they had really had any regard for the true interests of their countries , would have discouraged the rebels in the most public and pointed manner imaginable , not because they cared for us , but for the simple reason that they were bound so to act as should best promote the welfare of their own peoples . War in America meant suffering to the artisans and laborers of Europe , who , thus far , have suffered more from the war than have any portion of the American pcopie , except the residents of Southern cities . Napoleon HI . and Lord Palmerston should have said to the a*ents of the Confed racy , and have taken care to publish their words , We can afford you neither aid in deeds nor encouragement in words . Our relations with both sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer immensely from the course which ' you are about to pursue , not because you have been oppressed , or fear oppression , but because you have been beaten in an election , and power , for the time , has been taken from your hands . You *sk us to act hostilely against the established government of the United States , that government having given us no cause of offense , - to become the patrons of a revolution that has no cause , but the consequences of which may be boundless . To revolutions we are averse ; and one of our governments exists in virtue of opposition to the party of disorder in Europe . You ask us to do that which would lessen the means of livelihood to millions of our people ; for , granting The True Interest of Nations . // that you should suceed , still there would necessarily be so great a change produced by your action , and by our intervention in American affairs , that for years America would not be the good customer to France and England that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cause we can have nothing to do , our true interests pointing to the maintenance of the strictest neutrality in the contest between you and the federal government ; and the dictates of interest are fortified by the suggestions of principle . Your movement is essentially disorderly in its character , and it is undertaken avowedly in the interest of slavery ; and not only are we the supporters of the existing order of things the world over , but we are hostile to slavery , having abolished it in all parts of our dominions . Our advice to you b , to submit to the federal government , and to seek for the redress of your grievances , if such you have , by means recognized in the constitution and laws of your country . From us you can receive no aid , and you should dismiss all expectation of it from your minds at once and forever . We are indifferent to the form of the American government , and its internal policy can not concern us ; but the interests of our peoples require that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be of the South or of the North , slave-holders or abolitionists ; and we shall not quarrel with any portion of them for the sake of facilitating the erection of a republic to be founded on the basis of the divine nature of slavery , the first time that so preposterous a pretension was ever put forward by the audacity or the impudence of men . ' Had something like this been said to the agents of the rehels , and had the English press supported the same views , the rebellion would have been at an end ere this , and the commercial relations of America and Europe would have experienced no sensible interruption . English interests , in an especial sense , demanded that the rebels should be discouraged , and discouragement from London would have rendered rebellion hopeless , and have promoted peace in Savannah and New Orleans . But it was not in England 's nature to pursue a course that would have been as much in harmony with her material interests as with that high moral charac-. ter which she claims as being peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to effect the destruction of the American Republic , and England could not resist the temptation to strike us hard ; and , for almost a year , she has been to the Union a - more deadly foe than we have found in the South . We do not allude to the , Trent question , for in that we were clearly in the wrong , and Mason and Slidell should have been released on the 16th of November , and not have been detained in captivity six weeks . Secretary Seward has placed the point so emphatically beyond all doubt , that we must all be of one mind thereon , whether in England or America . England might have been moderate in her action , in view of her repeated outra0es on the rights of neutrals , but no intelligent American can condemn her position . It is to other things that we must look for evidence of her determination to effect our extinction as a nation . She has , while dripping with Ilindoo blood , and while yet men 's ears are filled with accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her military executioners , absolutely demanded of us an acknowledgment of the Southern Confederacy 's independence , on the ground that it is inhuman to wage war for the maintenance of our national life . She ha* compared our mild and forbearing government with the savage proconsulate of Alva in the Netherlands ! She has charted us with waging war against civilization , because we have employed stone fleets to close entrances to the harbor of Charleston , though her own history is full of instances of their employment for similar purposes ! She has encouraged her traders and seamen to furnish the rebels with arms of all kinds , and stores of every description ! She has excluded our ships-of-war from *her 435 // ports , refusing to allow them to coal at places at which the had granted us the privilege , in time of peace , of establishing stations for fuel ! She has given shelter and protection to the privateers of the rebels , vessels that had violated her own laws almost within sight of her own shores , and certainly within the narrow *eas ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is virtually an acknowledgment of its independence , for none but nations can lawfully wage war . She has , through her Minister for Foreign Affairs , declared that our war with the secessionists is of the same character as the war which tbe Spaniards carried on with their American colonists , and that there is no difference between it and tbe attempt of the Turks to subdue the Greeks ! Monstrous perversions of history for even Earl Russell to b6 guilty of ! Her leading periodicals and journals , with few exceptions , have denounced our country , our course , and our government in the bitterest language , and to the manifest encouragement of the rebels , who see in their language the rapid growth and prompt exhibition of a sentiment of hostility to this country , and which must , sooner or later , end in war ; and war between England and *merica would be sure to lead to the success of the Confederates , even if we should come out of it victoriously . Thus we see that the attempt to establish peace on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , but that it has failed signally and deplorably . The solid Done Temple of Mainmon has no more been able to stand against the storms of war than has the Crystal Palace of Sentiment . The fair fabric which was the type of materialism has fallen , and it would be most unwise to seek its reconstruction . That which was to have stood as long and as firmly as the Pyramids has fallen before the first moss could gather upon it . Nor is the reason of this fall far to seek , as it lies upon the surface , and ought to have been anticipated - would have been , only that men are so ready to believe in what they wish to believe . England , as a nation , has two interests to consult , and which do not always accord . She has her commercial interest and her imperial interest ; and , when the two conflict , the last is sure to become first . Her position as a nation was threatened only by the United States and Russia . The dynastic disputes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the generally unsettled character of Fiunch politics , must long prevent that country from becoming the permanent rival of England . France is great to-day , and England acts wisely in preparing to meet her in war ; but to-morrow France may become weak , and her voice be feeble and her weight light in Europe and the world . Three houses claim her throne , and the Republicans may start up into active life again , as we saw they did in 1848 . Neither Austria nor Prussia can ever furnish England cause of alarm . With Russia the ease is very different , as her government is solidly established ; her resources are vast , and in the course of steady development , and her desire to establish her supremacy in the East is a fixed idea with both rulers and ruled . Unchecked , she would have thrown England into the background , and supposing that she had resolved not to allow that country a share of the spoil of Turkey . The hard character and harsh policy of NichQlas ended in furnishing to England an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and that opportunity she made use of , but not to the extent that she had determined upon , owing to her dependence upon France , which became the shield of Russia after having been the sword of England . The United States were a formidable rival of England ; and , but for the breaking out of our troubles , we should have been far ahead of her by 1870 , and perhaps have stripped her of all her American possessions . When those troubles began , she proceeded to take the same advantage of them that she had taken of the Czar 's blunder . To sever the American nation in twain is 436 // her object , as some of her public men have frankly avowed ; and she believes that the disintegrating process , once commenced , would not stop with the division of the country into the Northern Union and the Sonthern Confederacy . She expects , should the South succeed , to see half a dozen republics here established , and is not without hope that not evcn two States would remain together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The American nation destroyed , England would become as great in the West as she is in the East , and would hold , with far greater means at her command , the same position that was hers in the last days of George II. , when the French had been expelled from America and India . She would have no commercial rival , and there would no longer be an American navy susceptible of gigantic increase . She would be truly the seats sovereign ; and whoso rules the sea has power to dictate to the land . Whosoever comgiands the sea , ' says Sir Walter Raleigh , commands the trade of the world ; whosoever commands the trade of the world , commands the riches of the world , and consequently the world itself . ' England never would have gone to war with the United States to prevent their growth ; but ; now that they have instituted civil war , it is certain that she will do all that lies in her power to prevent the reconstruction of the Union . The war of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war of swords . The savage music of the British press is the overture to the opera . The morality of England may be neither higher nor lower than that of all other countries , - may be no worse than our own , - but there is so much that is offensive in her modes of exhibiting her destitution of principle , that she is more hated than all other powerful countries that ever have existed . She not only sins as badly as other nations , but mann* , es to *iake herself as odious for her manner of sinning as for the sins themselves . There is no crime that she is not capable of , if its perpetration be necessary to promote her own power . When Sir William Reid was governor of Malta , he said to Mr. Lushington , I would let them ( i. e. the heathen ) set up Juggernaut in St. George 's Square ( in Edinburgh ) , if it were conducive to England 's holding Malta . ' And as this true-blue Presbyterian was ready to allow the solemnization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the Christiar* city of Edinburgh , if that kind of tolerance would be conducive to England 's retention of Malta , - of which she holds possession , by the way , in consequence of one of the grossest breaches of faith mentioned even in her history , - so do we find the Christian people , peers , and priests of England ready to become the allies of slave-holders and the supporters of slavery , if thereby the American Republic can be destroyed , as they believe that its existence may become the source of danger to the aseendency of their country . The last intelligence from England allows us to believe that that country has adopted a more liberal policy , and that her government will do nothing to aid the rebels . Some of the language of Ministers is friendly , and altogether the change is one of a character that can not be otherwise than agreeable to us . France , too , has declared her neutrality as strongly , as England . ' These declarations were made before intelligence of ou* military and naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more weighty . Peace between America and Europe may , therefore , be counted upon , unless some very great reverses should befall our arms .
