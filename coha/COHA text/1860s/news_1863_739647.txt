txt OUR ARMY OFF V ICKSDURGH . From all sources  --  from our own correspondence . from private letters of soldiers , and from the Western Press ? we hear the most shocking and shameful accounts of the lack of hospital accommodations , and the bad treatment of sick soldiers in the army of Gen. GRANT , opposite Vicksburgh . The region itself is about as unhealthy all the year round as it well could be , and the sick and mortality lists of GRANT 'S army are excessive  --  being three or four times as great as in the army of Gen. ROSSCRANS , in Middle Tennessee . No proper hospital buildings have been raised , for the reason that it was hoped the army would not remain there any length of time , but would speedily move over to the high and wholesome region on the opposite side of the river . But instead of doing the best that was possible under bad circumstances  --  instead of removing the sick away , or placing them on hospital steamboats , or using the best houses in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy negro shanties , dank hovels located in the swamp , and pens that are not fit for swine ; while the few dry and roomy houses thereabouts are assigned to the officers for their use . The surgeons , apparently hopeless ? of contending successfully with adverse circumstances , seem to almost completely neglect their patients , and invite malaria and death to do their worst . On this latter point complaints are unfortunately too well founded to admit a doubt of their truth . As a consequence of all this , our veteran Army of the Mississippi is being depleted at a fearful rate ; and a letter from " Off Vicksburgh , " which we publish this morning , asserts that " since our army has been there , over one hundred men have every day failed to respond to roll-call , and been carried out , never to return . " To a certain extent , this condition of affairs is unavoidable , and in any event must be temporary . But we can not look upon the Medical Director of GRANT 'S army as free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate attention of the Surgeon-General.
