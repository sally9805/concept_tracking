txt The question of permanent confiscation which is now engaging the attention of the House , is one of very great moment . It will be remembered that the original measure concerning confiscation , which passed Congress eighteen months ago , made a general sweep of the property of rebels , both real and personal , and for all time . The President returned the bill with objections against that clause making confiscation of real estate extend beyond the lifetime of the traitor , because of its doubtful constitutionality . The clause was modified , so as to confine the confiscation to the life interest ; and in that shape became a law . A strong effort is now being made to restore the clause to its original shape , so as to make the congscation permanent . The matter has become one of immediate practical . importance . A large amount of real estate , belonging to rebels , is now in the hands of the Government , and In justice to the National Treasury , as well as to the neglected property itself , some disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a life interest is to be transferred , newiegialation is necessary before the sale . The constitutional bearings of the question , turning upon the legal signification and effect of the term " attainder oft treason , " we do not care ' to discuss . It seems to us that undue attention has been given to it in Congress  --  many seeming to think that if the right of wholesale confiscation could be established , there could be no further question . But there is a further question , and one of vast consequence . It is that of equity and good policy . Is it wise to exercise the right ? It will not do to gauge these great State measures , as many are disposed to do , by the stern standards of abstract justice . If the old Pagan Romans could say , the highest justice the highest injury  --  summum jus , summa injuria ? it certainly behooves a Christian nation , to be mindful of it . Abstract principles are good in their place , but political problems involve so many and often so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical expediency and liberal equity should have play as well as abstract right . Extreme measures against the rebels , which shall involve not only themselves , but women and children , in an indiscriminate ruin , may , perhaps , satisfy a certain grim craving for terrible retribution , but they will not be sanctioned by the public opinion of Christendom , and will , sooner or later , induce a reaction of sympathy which will deprive them of all beneficial effect . We must not forget that our enemies are men , whatever their wrongdoing . Any present injury we can do them , in order to bring them to terms , consistent with the laws of modern warfare , is admissible and becoming . We have , ourselves , continually urged that the blows should fall heavily and rapidly . But when measures are proposed , like the Confiscation Bill now before the House , that inflict misery for the ' . future rather than the present , . that are retributive rather than restorative , we can no longer urge . It is a subject that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not searched history particularly upon the subject , but we can recall no instance of such sweeping wholesale confiscations as this bill conten plates . The old Roman Empire has the name of being about as hard a conqueror as the world has seen , and yet its usage was not to confiscate the property of its enemy entirely , but to reserve for the original proprietor one-third , for the subsistence *of himself and family . CROMWELL 'S confiscations in Ireland , which have always figured as particularly severe , were yet attended with allotments ie Connaught , such as the Protector deernAd sufficient for family itupport . Russia 's regime over Poland after the insurrection of 1830 has been considered almost merciless . Fifty thousand Poles were sent to Siberia , and about ten thousand estates were confiscated . But these estates were only a small proportion of the old soil . of Poland . In the State of Virginia alone there are over a hundred thousand freeholds ; within the limits of the Confederacy. " at least three-fourths of a million . Nearly all of this vast amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietors if this confiscation measure were carried out according to its terms ; for there ? is hardly a real estate owner in the South who has not participated in The rebellion in one way or another . Such sweeping work , were it practicable , would throw into the shads everything of the kind known to history . The object of the Polish and the Irish confiscations was to make quiet subjects . Their success may be read in the chronic discontent and repeated insurrections of the , two nunIrieedown to the present day . The object of our confiscations must be to make willing citizens , for our republican system admits of no such condition as tpt oci subjects . We may strip these rebels of their possessions , if we please , but we have got hereafter to share political power with them , and ? o have our children with their children . We would like to have some of these wholesale confiscators answer us this question : If qualified or limited confiscations in Ireland . or Poland failed to make good subjects , how will unqualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great objects , each of supreme consequence . The first is to bring this ' war to the speediest close consistent with the preservation of the Union . The second , to bury the bitter feelings of the war as soon afterward as possible , in order that the Union may be ever afterward at peace with itself . Permanent confiscation does not help the first object one whit more than would the confiscation of the life interests . It directly defeats the second olliect , for it would entail inextinguishable heart-hurninga upon the posterity of the present rebels for generations to come . The one sort of confiscation , succeeded by a restoration of property to the , family , might in a few years be forgotten . The other , so long as human nature remains what it is , would never cease to rankle . We trust that Congress will study not simply the constitutionality of this measure , but its expediency . It is a subject which passion should not be allowed to approach . The coolest judgment alone should settle it . So far as depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely too .
