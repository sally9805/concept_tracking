Scene I.  --  The Mill of Sans-Souci  --  on the right the house of Jean Fisch , the miller  --  a flight of steps , under which is a trap-door  --  Back a Landscape , with a rustic bridge  --  Tables , chairs , bags of flour , and other things appertaining to a Mill Christine and the Miller 's Boy discovered . Chris . Christine On the steps . Are you sure that what you tell me is true ? Boy . Fritz On the platform . Yes , ma'am . Chris . Christine Uncle William can not come , eh ? Boy . Fritz No , ma'am . Chris . Christine Nor Cousin Martha either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Flickman is so very sick that she finds herself quite indisposed , and Father William and his daughter have gone to see her . When I arrived there early this morning , to bring them in the wagon , I found no one . Chris . Christine Well , that is nice  --  we shall have neither godfather nor godmother at the christening , and there is my husband now , down in the cellar , actually tapping the beer to drink long life to the little Peter ! Boy . Fritz Filling a sack . Oh , as for the beer , do n't let that trouble you . It sha n't spoil while I am about . Chris . Christine Calling down trap . Jean ! Jean ! Jean . Jean Appearing at trap . Here I am ; do n't get into a fidget . I have only eleven kegs more to tap . Such beer as the king never drank . Chris . Christine Ah , my poor Jean , you have tapped already more than we shall want . Jean . Jean How 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the christening ca n't go on . Jean . Jean Chris  --  Christine  --  eh ? what ? Ca n't go on ? What do you mean ? Comes up trap . Boy . Fritz Oh , it 's so distressing ! Chris . Christine To Boy . Go about your business , you croaker . Boy . Fritz All right ! Goes about his work with the sacks . Jean . Jean Agitated . The christening ca n't go on ? Chris . Christine Alas , no ! Our uncle and cousin are obliged to remain with Aunt Flickman , who is sick . Jean . Jean A nice time to be sick . She ought to be ashamed of herself to fall sick just as my magnificent christening is to come off , and I have invited everybody at Sans-Souci  --  when I have killed five buck rabbits and my two pet roosters , and when I have tapped twenty kegs of Hoekerland beer ! Rubbing his hands . Chris . Christine It is shockingly provoking ! Boy . Fritz Ma'am , ma'am ! here come your boarders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boat on the river  --  then enter in boat , L. U. E. Jean and Christine retire up . Eliz . Elizabeth Stepping on shore . Take care , dear uncle . Assisting the Count to step on shore . Go slowly . You are not used to boating , you know . Count . Count Saxendorf That is very true , my child , and shows how good-natured I am , to run the risk of breaking my neck to gratify all your little caprices on land and water . Eliz . Elizabeth Ah , you are so good ! Count . Count Saxendorf Well , I hope you will recompense my goodness by making our stay in this mill as short as possible . It may be very agreeable , and all that , to you , but I must confess , that it does not exactly accord with my ideas either of dignity or comfort . Eliz . Elizabeth Do n't you enjoy the picturesqueness of the view ? Count . Count Saxendorf To be sure ; all very fine  --  the finest in all Prussia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world I find at a comfortable fire-side . Eliz . Elizabeth Come , come , do n't be cross and ill-natured now , I only ask you to stop two days longer . Count . Count Saxendorf We have been here already four days , living in this uncomfortable mill . If it were a hotel , I would not mind . Eliz . Elizabeth Decidedly . Our carriage , perhaps , is not yet completely repaired , and then I have not yet seen all I wish to see at Sans-Souci . Aside . Or as yet accomplished all that I wish . Count . Count Saxendorf Smiling . The uncle obeys the niece ! The world is topsyturvy . Eliz . Elizabeth Seeing Jean and Christine Ah , here are our good host and hostess ; what is the matter with them ? they seem quite disappointed . Chris . Christine Sighing . We are indeed , and with good reason , my lady . Eliz . Elizabeth What is the matter ? Jean . Jean Imagine our disappointment . The christening was fixed for this morning  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guests were invited , the beer tapped , five rabbits and two roosters slaughtered , when , all of a sudden , our arrangements are upset , just on account of old Aunt Flickman . Chris . Christine Here we are without a godfather or godmother for the poor baby . Eliz . Elizabeth Is that all ? Oh , if a godmother and godfather are all you want to make you happy , and you will accept of me , stranger to you as I am , I shall be happy to  --  Jean . Jean What ! you ? you , madam ? Boy . Fritz What ! you ? Chris . Christine Curtseying . Oh , madam , you are too kind  --  Eliz . Elizabeth No thanks . When is the ceremony to take place ? Chris . Christine Immediately . Music at distance . Here come our friends and neighbors now . Aside to Jean . Go and put on your best coat . Jean . Jean Here 's a lucky chance ! The Queen of the Fairies must have had a hand in bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different entrances , some in small boats on the river , and others over the bridge . Jean and Christine receive them joyfully , shaking hands , &c.; Count . Count Saxendorf Aside to Elizabeth . Another freak added to the account of your follies . Eliz . Elizabeth If your journey here has not afforded us any enjoyment , think how happy it will have made these good people . Chris . Christine To Jean . Go and put on your coat , do . Jean . Jean I 'm going . Shaking hands and talking to the Peasants . Enter the Baron De Koppen Nicken , in undress uniform . R. U. E. Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken What are all these idlers , fools and jackasses doing here ? She do n't seem to be at all overcome when the great Baron Koppen Nicken honors them by deigning to come into such a hole . Do they not know I am the king 's chamberlain ? All the Peasants retire out of his way , and show signs of fear , but not of respect . The Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside . What a queer figure ! To the Baron , ironically . Please excuse these poor peasants , Monsieur le Baron . They did not expect the honor of such a visit , and in their ignorance they took you for a mere ordinary man , Aside to Count . Very ordinary , indeed ! Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Stupid fools ! To Peasants . Stand back rascals ! Get along with you ! I am here on business of the state , and your vulgar ears must be shut . Out of the way ! Hem ! Struts about . Chris . Christine To Jean . Now , do go and put on your other coat ! Pushing Jean . Jean . Jean Well , well , I 'll go . That wonderful baby will have a godmother , after all . Exit in house . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Taking Christine aside . Are you the mistress of this mill ? Chris . Christine Yes , if you please , Baron ! Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Confidentially . Who are these strangers ? Chris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who are these travellers ? Chris . Christine They seem to be strangers  --  Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Well  --  Chris . Christine Who come from Vienna . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Do you know anything else about them ? Chris . Christine Yes . Their carriage broke down near here , and they have done us the honor to accept our hospitality , as there is no hotel in the neighborhood . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken And they have seen no one but you and your husband , during their stay here ? Chris . Christine No one  --  not a soul ! Eliz . Elizabeth Aside to the Count . He is making inquiries about us . Going to the Baron . We consider ourselves very fortunate , in this out of the way place , in finding at least one person who is civilized . My uncle and myself are travelling for pleasure and information , and we could not find one better qualified to guide us , than so courtly and distinguished a gentleman as yourself . Aside . That will smooth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koppen Nicken Bowing . I am entirely at your service , madam . Excuse me , but you must know , that , by the august direction of the king , my gracious master , it is necessary that I should be cognizant of everything which transpires in Sans-Souci . Eliz . Elizabeth Gaily . Your gracious master , did you say ? You only  --  between ourselves  --  you speak of him as gracious master , from courtesy . The old King , Frederick William , is not considered the best-natured or most gracious personage in the world . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Smiling . You are right . His majesty is a little strict . especially in his military discipline  --  and sometimes he proceeds to extremities . Motioning with his cane , as if going to strike some one . Eliz . Elizabeth And does his young son , Frederick , inherit his father 's sweet disposition ? Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Not exactly . He is a philosopher , poet , and very fine musician . Chris . Christine Oh , madam ! although we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a gay , lively , handsome young man ! Just the reverse of his cross old  --  of  --  of  --  the other ! Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Holloa ! my good woman ! You had better keep your tongue quiet . You must not make such high comparisons . Eliz . Elizabeth I have been told that the young prince has a great predilection for a small estate in the neighborhood of this mill , which his mother , the Queen Sophia , lately gave him . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken The young Prince retires to this estate for the purpose of devoting himself to the study of the fine arts and philosophy . Count . Count Saxendorf With a side look at Elizabeth . Such an existence must be very seductive . Enter Jean from the mill , dressed in his best clothes , and very much agitated . Jean . Jean Oh , my ! Oh , Lord ! What have we all been about , not to have thought of it before ? Chris . Christine Thought of what ? Jean . Jean We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrious persons . We are apes ! We have a godmother , but no godfather ! Oh my  --  oh Lord ! Chris . Christine Surprised . What shall we do ? The christening can not go on without a godfather ! Eliz . Elizabeth I am sure that the distinguished Baron Koppen Nicken will not refuse to stand with me as sponsor for the child ! Jean . Jean Oh , Monsieur Le Baron ! A superb child  --  named Peter . He is just seven months and a half old . and is the image of me ! Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken I am very sorry not to be able to comply with your request , my lady  --  but I , the chamberlain of his majesty , can not be godfather to a peasant 's child . The king would be offended , and I might lose my golden key . Goes up . Eliz . Elizabeth To the Count . Dear Uncle , you must gratify another little whim of mine . Count . Count Saxendorf Impossible ! Turns away . Chris . Christine Only think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Fritz , the mill-boy , for godfather to the dear child ; and  --  Jean . Jean In despair . Oh , Lord ! I do n't believe there is a single godfather in all the kingdom of Prussia : Oh , for a godfather ! Anything like a godfather ! A piece of a godfather , only !  --  if he was not bigger than my thumb ! Prince Frederick , in the costume of a Sergeant of the King 's guard , appears upon the bridge . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick What 's the matter ? Who wants a godfather ? This way  --  look here for one . Present ! Making military salute . Jean . Jean Excited . Ha ! ha ! A godfather has fallen from heaven ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Who has come down from the bridge . Does not every good thing come from there ? Omnes Peasants . Peasants Oh ! what a handsome little fellow ! Chris . Christine What a perfect love of a sergeant ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick To Jean . Are you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Give me your hand , I 'll be a godfather for your child ! I have heard of you ; you are an honest fellow , and that is enough for me . Jean . Jean Ah , sir , you do me great honor ! Eliz . Elizabeth Aside to the Count . This little soldier has a frank and noble look . Count . Count Saxendorf Are you going to stand as godmother with a common sergeant ? Eliz . Elizabeth And why not ? Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Aside to Frederick . Mind what you are about ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Hush ! I must not be recognized ! Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken I am dumb ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick And listen . Go and bring me twenty ducats ' worth of Berlin bon-bons . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken I go with enthusiasm to serve you . If I am found out I shall lose my golden key . Exit Baron over bridge . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Going to Elizabeth . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I shall always thank my lucky stars for directing me to this spot ! Eliz . Elizabeth You quite confuse me . It really seems as if the gallantry of the old times had found a home among the sub-officers of the Prussian army . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Madam , you  --  Eliz . Elizabeth May I ask your name ? Fred . Prince Charles Frederick I am called Frederick , madam ! Eliz . Elizabeth Only Frederick ? Aside . I am sure he is more than he seems . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick May I be as curious as you ? May I know the name of the amiable lady who deigns to accept for her companion , in the ceremony , a simple sergeant of the Guards ? Eliz . Elizabeth My name is Elizabeth ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Only Elizabeth ? Eliz . Elizabeth Only Elizabeth , at present ; but allow me to introduce to you my uncle , the Count of Saxendorf . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Bowing . The name of the Count is not unfamiliar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this christening going to take place to-day ? Jean . Jean Everything is ready , Sergeant ! Chris . Christine And here comes our friend Carl , to tell us so ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Forward  --  march ! ring the bells  --  fire the guns ; this christening must receive all the honors ! Omnes Peasants . Peasants Long life to the godfather and godmother ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Going among the Peasant Girls , and patting their cheeks . The girls are pretty , here ! Goes to Christine. well , my floury beauty ! Jean ! is this pretty-looking lady-bird your wife ? I congratulate you . Aside . Confound the strictness of my father 's discipline  --  I have been missing lots of fun ! Enter Count Gustave , in the uniform of a Lieutenant , on the bridge . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Offering his arm to Elizabeth . Come  --  will you honor me ? Let us go . Music behind  --  The Peasants form in procession to go out . Enter Gustave , from bridge , showing surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustave What is this ?  --  a wedding going on ? Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Better than that , good Lieutenant . It is a christening  --  I am the godfather , and I invite you ; so give your arm to the miller 's pretty wife , and  --  vive la joie ! Gus . Count Gustave Aside to Frederick . I have something serious to say to you . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Pshaw ! I do not wish to hear anything serious to-day . Gus . Count Gustave But it is of great importance , and very pressing . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick I do not know of anything more important than a christening . Gus . Count Gustave I assure you that I must speak with you privately this moment . Nay , if necessary , I must command you , as your officer , to obey me ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick I will merely remark , Lieutenant , that I am just released from eight days ' arrest , and am , at present , not on duty . Taking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good fellow  --  I am very busy with the part of godfather , and falling in love as fast as I can . Gus . Count Gustave The more reason why I should interrupt you , for it is my duty to tell you that  --  Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Go to the deuce ! I wo n't listen to anything . Aloud . Friend Carl , head the procession , and make me a godfather as fast as possible . The procession forms , Carl at the head . Jean suddenly rushes to mill , and brings out baby . Jean . Jean What were we all about ? Going to a christening without the baby ! Christine and Jean , next to Carl , followed by Fred . and Elizabeth , the Peasants All forming , two and two , singing as they go off . CHORUS . Happy day  --  let 's away  --  While the bells shall be ringing ; Come away  --  haste away  --  Joyously singing . Count . Count Saxendorf Well , I suppose I shall have to follow them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This it is to be a slave to the caprices of a woman ! Exit Count , with procession . Gus . Count Gustave ( L. ) He calls himself a philospher , and allows his folly to carry him away thus . I came to warn him , and he tells me to go to the deuce . Enter Baron , L. U. E. , out of breath , and carrying a number of bon-bon boxes . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Oh , oh ! What ? Gone ? What am I going to do with all these boxes ? Gus . Count Gustave Laughing . Ah ! my dear Baron ! You carry about with you all the sweetness of the kingdom ! Did you rob all the confectioners of Berlin ? Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Could I refuse to obey the orders of the Prince Royal ? Do you understand that ? But I am tired , out of breath , and exhausted . You have no idea , my dear Lieutenant , how extremely heavy bon-bons are ! Gus . Count Gustave Heavy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arms ; and besides , if the king knew that I had taken ever so small a part in such a silly ceremony , I should lose my golden key ! Gus . Count Gustave Oh , pshaw ! Where the deuce , do you think , our well-beloved sovereign can ever find another chamberlain so zealous and so efficient as you are ? You execute his most disgrecable orders , submit to his ill humor and his whims . Oh , no , he can never replace the Baron Koppen Nicken ! Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Seriously . Nothing could interfere with my passive obedience to my master . Gus . Count Gustave I suppose his Majesty has told you the great secret about the Prince Frederick ? Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Astonished . No ! He has told me nothing ! Gus . Count Gustave Well , as he has told you nothing , I must not be indiscreet . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Oh , for the Lord 's sake , help me to get rid of this load of sweets . Gus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Exactly so . Gustave helps him to put the boxes down . Gus . Count Gustave This is enough to sweeten a whole village . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Now , my dear Lieutenant , I wish you a good morning . I do not wish to compromise myself any further . Brushing his arms , one after the other . I must take care not to have even the smell of those cursed candies about me , for if his Majesty should even suspect me , I should be in danger of losing my golden key ! Exit . L. U. E , and then over bridge . Gus . Count Gustave Excellent Baron ! He may lose his key , because he has it , but I defy him to lose his brains ! Music . Shouts and noise of guns outside , and enter procession from over bridge , singing chorus as before . Omnes Peasants . Peasants Long life to the godfather and godmother ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick And the little baby , which you forget  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its father . Shout , long life to the little Peter ! Omnes Peasants . Peasants Hurrah for little Peter ! Jean . Jean Do n't forget the cause of all this joy  --  the baby is only a consequence  --  so , give a cheer for the father and mother ! Chris . Christine You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Seeing the boxes of bon-bons . Ah , here are the bon-bons . The baron has fulfilled my commission to the very letter . Opens box of bon-bons , and filling his hands scatters them among the Peasants , who scramble for them : then , selecting two boxes , presents one to Christine and the other to Elizabeth . To Elizabeth . Ah , my dear little godwife , I am afraid that at the bottom of this box you will discover what I have lost  --  a heart . Eliz . Elizabeth Why , Mr. Frederick , this looks like a declaration ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick And what if it is ? You know , coming from a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Aside . Sergeants are not all alike , though . Chris . Christine While the feast is preparing , let us have a dance in honor of this auspicious day . Jean . Jean A glorious feast  --  five rabbits and two roosters , besides twenty kegs of beer ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick A dance ! certainly  --  a good idea . To Elizabeth . My dear godwife , you can not refuse me the honor . To Gustave , aside . Come , old fellow , do n't look so glum , but go and dance with the miller 's pretty wife . Gus . Count Gustave Aside . But , Prince , I must say that  --  Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Hush ! There is no prince here ! You will spoil sport . The sergeant has already received half a dozen languishing looks , and such a delicious squeeze of the hand . Chris . Christine Come , take your places . All form for a dance ; the Miller 's Boy mounts a barrel and plays the file . Frederick puts his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible noise is this ? Come down there , you earsplitter . Thank fortune I happen to have my flute with me . Takes flute from pocket , and jumping on barrel commences to play . Chris . Christine What ! do you play on the flute ? Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Yes ; pretty well  --  for a sergeant , you know . A Dance  --  Frederick plays flute  --  Towards the close of the dance , the King , the Baron , a Guard , and some Officers enter  --  The King is unobserved by the Peasants , and , as he walks among them , the dancers form a circle and begin to dance round him ; suddenly they recognize the King , and the dance ceases . Omnes . Omnes The King ! King . King Frederick William What are you doing here , idlers ? Is this a holiday ? And you , sir . To Fred . Have you turned minstrel , or mountebank ? The Prince Royal ! Omnes . Omnes In astonishment . The Prince Royal ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant of the Guards , who amuses himself like a sergeant . King . King Frederick William You forget your dignity . Playing the flute upon a barrel ! For shame ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick It is only my way of raising myself above your other subjects ! You would not have me on their level ? The King looks at Elizabeth suspiciously . Eliz . Elizabeth To the Count . I think we had better retire . It would not be exactly apropos to be presented to his Majesty just now . Goes to King , leaning on the Count 's arm ; both make a deep reverence to the King , and exit into house , L. King . King Frederick William Who is this lady ? Chris . Christine With your Majesty 's permission , she is the godmother of our child . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Yes , she is the godmother of the little miller that is to be  --  the heir presumptive to this mill ! King . King Frederick William Pish ! Some adventuress ! The Peasants retire , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Charles Frederick Aside . She is alarmed ! Alas ! I shall never see her again ! King . King Frederick William To Officers of Guard . Gentlemen , you may return to Berlin . The guard is sufficient to accompany my carriage . Let everything be prepared for the grand review , to-morrow ! The review will take place at day-break . Let every one be present . Discipline is becoming too slack ! Officers absent themselves at night , in spite of my positive orders to the contrary . Absence from the ranks will be regarded and punished as desertion . Even if he were an officer  --  a general  --  a prince  --  my own son  --  he should not escape punishment . Go , gentlemen ! To the Baron . Remain in the vicinity . I may require your services . Baron . Baron Koppen Nicken Yes , sire , I go with enthusiasm . Bows , and exit . Officers go off , L. 2 E. King . King Frederick William To Peasants . Well , what are you all doing here ? You lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you , women , to your pots , pans , and kitchens ! Away with you ! Go at once ! Flourishes cane . Away with you , every one , about your business . All go off , except King and Fred . King . King Frederick William Sitting down . Now sir , what do you mean ? I have made you a sergeant , and you behave yourself like a corporal ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Enjoyment does n't depend on the grade , sire . King . King Frederick William And when I look for you , at your estate at Sans-Souci , to speak with you on state affairs , I find you acting like a fool , with a lot of boorish rustics in a mill . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Speak of state affairs to me , sire ? King . King Frederick William Yes , sir , and it seems they must be discussed in a mill . Be it so ! You are now twenty years old . Kings have reigned ere that age . Fred . Prince Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sire ! King . King Frederick William Nor would I have you so , faith , just yet ! But to the point . I have thought of an alliance for you , which will not only add to your happiness , but conduce to the national prosperity . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick What ? my father ! Would you have me marry ? King . King Frederick William Rising . You are married to all intents and purposes , already , by proxy  --  my ambassador at Bremen having contracted an alliance for you with a niece of the Emperor Charles the Sixth  --  a beautiful girl ! young , thoroughly accomplished , and a member of one of the noblest houses in Austria ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Surprised . What , sire !  --  I ? Married , without ever having seen my wife , even in paint ? King . King Frederick William It is a splendid match !  --  An opportunity not to be neglected . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Then you marry me for the good of the state ? King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to the war with Poland , and secures me half of Silesia . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Aside . And I am the price of this bargain ? King . King Frederick William Under these circumstances , I raise you to the rank of Lieutenant , although you have not yet served out your time as sergeant . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Bowing . Thank you for the promotion . It is a very delicate attention on your part  --  but as for the princess , my wife by proxy , she may go to the devil ; for I refuse her , most decidedly and positively . Crosses . King . King Frederick William In a rage . What , sir  --  refuse ? Do you know what you are saying ? Would you dare to rebel against my wishes ? Fred . Prince Charles Frederick My life , sire , as your soldier , belongs to you  --  command it when you please  --  but my heart is my own . You can not dispose of that . This marriage , based upon political ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sacrifice the best feelings of my nature , by swearing to love and cherish one whom I should detest and abhor . The poorest laborer in Prussia can marry where he loves , and be happy with the object of his love , but I  --  I must prove traitor to my own heart , be without soul , because I am a royal prince . Father , if you want Silesia , fight for it . Do not purchase it with my happiness . No arm shall strike for it harder or oftener than mine  --  and as for Austria , do not marry her , but beat her like a general  --  like a king . King . King Frederick William Aside . He has more energy than I thought . I am glad I have touched this cord . Think , sir  --  reflect , Lieutenant Frederick , on your duties . The Princess is expected here every moment . Remember , that within eight days , you will be married . Exit King and Guards , R. 1 E. Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Married within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Chris . Christine He is gone !

Elizabeth Ay , but it may break out again . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Your lovely eyes will disperse it . Jean . Jean Looks off after King . Bon voyage to your majesty . Ha ! ha ! The carriage of his majesty looks like a watch-box ! Military music outside . A detachment of soldiers , headed by Gustave , cross the bridge and come down  --  the Peasants rush to look at them , and make way when they come on . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Well , here is my company from Potsdam . Goes to meet Soldiers  --  takes command of company , forms them in line and drills them . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick To Gustave . I usurp your place , dear Lieutenant ; but I am now your equal in grade . Gust .

Come , friend Jean , let us have the best in your cellar ! Omnes . Omnes Hurrah for the Prince Royal ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Never mind the Prince , that will spoil all . Soldiers mix with the Peasants  --  Jean and Christine bring on wine and cups , and distribute them to the Soldiers . Eliz . Elizabeth To the Count . Is he not charming ? Fred .

ACT II . Scene I.  --  The summer residence of General Sturner , ten miles from Berlin  --  A park , very thickly wooded  --  A wall at back  --  A small pavilion , L. General Sturner and Louise , ( his wife , ) discovered . The General is seated on a rustic bench , and is watching Louise , who stands upon the steps of the pavilion . Time , sunset : During the scene , the moon rises . Sturner . General Sturner Aside . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus I find her . To Louise . Countess ! Louise . Louise General ! Sturner . General Sturner What is the matter with you ? Louise . Louise The matter with me ? Sturner . General Sturner Come and sit by me . I would speak with you . Why are you not as frank with me as I am with you ? Tell me plainly your thoughts , as I tell you mine . There should be no secrets between us . Louise . Louise What secret have I from you ? Sturner . General Sturner None , I am sure , that you would not confide to me ; but , upon what are you so continually brooding ? Why do I find you thus , as I left you three weeks ago , when I went to Vienna , to demand the hand of the young princess for our future sovereign . To see you wear a sorrowful face at my departure , was natural , but to see the same look on my return  --  this is what causes my anxiety . Come , repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it the mystery with which I have surrounded our marriage ? Rising . That mystery is as necessary now as ever  --  nay , more so . When I sought your hand , Louise , I knew the world well enough to be aware , that the union of a man sixty years of age with a young wife of but twenty-two summers , would be a subject for the ridicule of my friends . Still I looked forward to much happiness . But you are not happy . Does your melancholy spring from the solitude in which you live ? Do you long to visit Berlin ? or regret its pleasures and its gaiety ? Louise . Louise Have I ever asked to visit it ? or  --  Sturner . General Sturner Excitedly . Visit Berlin ?  --  I will not disguise from you the fact , that I am jealous of the admiration of others . Stolbach appears at back , but seeing the General and Louise , stops and watches them . Louise . Louise Then we will never go ,  --  never go near that gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures when I have never known them ? No , rather I should regret , were I there , this lovely sky , this gorgeous landscape , these old ancestral trees , beneath whose shadows I can sit and dream away the hours . Sturner . General Sturner Observing her . ' T is to the past , then , that I must look to solve the mystery . It may be that in your union with me , you severed other ties that were more dear  --  more  --  Louise . Louise Embarrassed . Sir ! sir ! Sturner . General Sturner Seizes her hand . Ah ! you hesitate  --  you  --  Stolbach takes a step forward  --  the General hears the footstep . Ah ! who is that ? Seeing Stolbach.  --  Aside . He here ! What do you here ? Stol . Stolbach I was merely passing , and  --  Sturner . General Sturner Pass , and begone ! Stol . Stolbach I am going , General . Aside . I have arrived in time . She was on the verge of betraying herself . Sturner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aside . I must question him . To Louise . I will detain you no longer . Louise . Louise Aside to General . I hope , General , that a conversation so painful  --  so exciting to both of us , will never be renewed . General takes her to pavillion.  --  Exit Louise into pavillion . Sturner . General Sturner Approach ! What has happened here during my absence ? Stol . Stolbach Nothing , General . Sturner . General Sturner Have there been no visitors at the chateau ? Stol . Stolbach None , sir . Sturner . General Sturner You do not deceive me ? Stol . Stolbach I ? I deceive you ? Listen to me , General . Six years ago , a soldier on guard saw his bride pass his post , leaning upon the arm of one who he knew would have betrayed her . Stung by jealousy and rage , the soldier leveled his carbine and sprang towards him . To his surprise and dismay he found himself face to face with an officer , whose approach he had not observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence , slight as it was , pronounced a capital one . He was condemned to die . The king signed his death-warrant . He had no friends to plead for him  --  no one but his mother and his General . To him that mother pleaded , and not in vain . The general interceded with the king , and  --  he was pardoned ! You were that general  --  I was that soldier . From that hour I have been your slave  --  your dog . Deceive you ? The friend might betray  --  the dog is faithful even until death . Sturner . General Sturner I believe you . Yes , Stolbach , you are devotion itself ,  --  I know it  --  I am assured of it . General gives his hand to Stolbach , which he kisses .  --  Exit General .  --  The stage grows gradually dark . Stol . Stolbach Yes , yes master , saviour  --  I know the secret which the countess in her confusion nearly allowed to pass her lips . I know that Gustave whom I once surprised here ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dare again approach , he shall die  --  not by the sword of the General , but by the dagger of his slave . Retires up . Louise appears at pavilion . Hah ! the countess ! and still more confused than before . What seeks she here ? I will not slacken my vigilance . The honor of the General shall be protected even at the cost of my life . Exit Stolbach . R. Louise . Louise Coming down the steps cautiously . No one here , yet ? Then he will not come . He will keep his word : he promised that he would come no more . Takes note from bosom . Yet this note , which I have recieved , and which I have read with fear and trembling , this note announces to me  --  Gustave appears upon the wall . Gus . Count Gustave To Frederick , outside . Yes , under the wall , by that group of trees . Louise . Louise ' T is he ! Gus . Count Gustave To Frederick . The watch will likely pass soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Springs from wall , and approaches Louise . Louise . Louise You here ? Gus . Count Gustave Louise ! Taking her hand . Louise . Louise Endeavoring to break from him . Is it thus you keep your word ? you promised never to see me more . Gus . Count Gustave For one whole month , which seemed to me an age , have I not kept my word ? but , could I leave you for years , perhaps for ever  --  Louise . Louise Leave  --  Gus . Count Gustave Without coming to bid you farewell . Louise . Louise Go away , did you say ?  --  where ? Gus . Count Gustave I know not ; to France  --  anywhere , wherever he may go , whom I have accompanied here . Louise . Louise With anxiety . You are not alone , then ? Gus . Count Gustave Do not fear  --  he knows nothing . I have not spoken one word of my intentions , even to him , from whom I have no secrets . Louise . Louise But who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise . Louise The Prince ? Gus . Count Gustave He is there ; he waits for me ; and this night , if our horses do not fail us , we shall cross the frontier . Louise . Louise The Prince leave Berlin  --  Prussia ! ' t is not possible ! Why this strange flight ? Gus . Count Gustave A sudden impulse ; he would fly from a hateful marriage . Gustave , said he to me , will you follow me ? And as , after you , dear Louise , I love the young Prince more than all the world beside , I did not hesitate  --  I gave him my hand  --  we fled together ! Louise . Louise You  --  Gus . Count Gustave And then , if I may tell you all , I could endure to live no longer in Berlin . That love , which was so long my joy , is now my despair . In the name of duty and of honor , you have blighted my happines and crushed that hope . You have exacted an oath not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near you  --  but a few miles between me and her , who is my life  --  I felt I could not resist the temptation to see her  --  to speak to her  --  to brave every peril  --  every danger  --  even the greatest of all , the compromise of her honor . I doubted my own strength to resist all this ; and when the Prince asked me to go with him , it seemed as if he knew my danger , and had come to rescue me . Louise . Louise But do you not fear the anger of the King ? the terrible consequences of such a step ? It is  --  Gus . Count Gustave I know it ; Frederick knows it also . But it is not desertion that throws away the sword and leaves the field of battle . In France , I may yet win back all that I may lose here . Louise . Louise Farewell , then  --  go , and forget me . Gus . Count Gustave Forget thee  --  never ! ' t is impossible ! Louise sinks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick appears on wall , disguised in mantle , not seeing Gustave and Louise , owing to the intervention of a group of trees . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick The lieutenant keeps his ex-sergeant too long . He should remember I am a lieutenant , now , as well as he , and that I am a prince at least , till we cross the frontier . What would my royal ancestors say now , to see me playing the groom in this way ? They would not feel flattered at the position of their descendant , I 'm sure . But what the deuce has become of him ? I neither see nor hear him . Gus . Count Gustave To Louise . Nay , I swear it . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Helloa ! I heard somebody swearing . Louise . Louise Gustave ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Ah , a woman 's voice ! oh , the rogue ! no wonder he keeps me dangling here so long . Louise . Louise And you will not forget me ? Gus . Count Gustave Never  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . But where the deuce are they concealed ? Have the turtle doves made a nest in the branches of the tree ? Let us see .

Kisses hand . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Ha ! what was that ? it sounded very like a kiss . Faith . it makes me feel very queer , myself . This sweet echo of love produces a kind of a sort of a  --  an alloverness . Gustave kisses Louise 's hand again . What , again ? Am I to remain quietly here , to listen to sounds like that ? Where the devil can they be ? Seeing Gustave and Louise . Ah ! there they are . Retires cautiously . Oh , you selfish wretch ! Louise . Louise Leave me , Gustave  --  leave me !  --  go ! Fred . Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . By my father 's cane , this is hardly fair . Three spoils company !

Gus . Count Gustave Louise ! Louise ! Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Oh , Elizabeth ! Oh , Lizzie ! Oh ! Embracing the air , and getting up . Imagination does something , after all . I feel better already . Louise . Louise Hush ! Listen ! I hear footsteps approaching ! Goes up stage , leading Gustave , passing by Fred . Fred . Prince Charles Frederick Jumping behind tree .

Baron Koppen Nicken Rather than undertake such a dreadful , such an ungracious task , I prefer to resign my office and give up my golden key to your august father . Nay .

Elizabeth And is it true , that in order that you might remain faithful to an unknown love , to vows plighted to a stranger , one whose love could promise you only happiness , you were about to reject a princely marriage , which insures you the alliance of a great nation ? What an anomaly among men ! But we will try to obliterate your love for your godwife of the mill . You shall love the Princess and forget the stranger yet . Fred .

King Frederick William After another look at Baron , who nods and points more meaningly than before . Bah ! this is too much . Aside . The rascal !

Jean It is a good long walk , but never mind , I 'll go , lieutenant . Oh ! but I have not told you yet the funniest part of the affair . You must know that when your messenger came for me , a servant all covered with gold and silver lace , came to tell my wife , Christine , that she was wanted immediately at the court .

You sacrifice yourself for me  --  we are taken in a trap  --  I see you on the point of falling under the blows of three assassins  --  I have no power to save you but in one way  --  I have no alternative  --  desperate cases require desperate remedies , so I have you arrested as a deserter .

Count Gustave It is on his account that I am here , your Majesty .
