ARTICLE IV. - HANNAII THURSTON . Hannah J'hurston . A Story of American Life . By BAYARD TAYLOR . New York : G. P. Putnam. 1864. l2rno. pp. 464 . BAYARD TAYLOR has acquired a world-wide reputation , as an enterprising traveler , and a writer of sprightly narratives , all the more acceptable to many , because he is never profound , and exacts no thought from his reader , but only requires him to be a good listener to one who is fond of talking , and wants hearers . The books of travels which he has published , possessing this merit-no more-have been eagerly read by thousands , and brought wealth and fame to their author . They have been far more successful with the public than ' they could have been , if their author had been a profound observer of men , and of social institutions . But in the work , the title of which stands at the head of this Article , he has attempted a department of literature , which requires very different and far higher mental endowments* It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has such men as Thackeray and Dickens and Bulwer for competitors , but because a " story of American life " can not be successfully done , without such habits of analysis and philosophical insight , as we find few traces of in his previous writings . He tells us himself , in his prefatory letter , that he does not " rest the interest of the book on its slender plot , but on the fidelity with which it epresents certain types of character and phases of society . " That is to say , this book is to be approved or condemned b*i the critic and by the public , according as it depicts truly or not such peculiarities of American society , as Women 's rights , Total abstinence , IRevivals , Spirit-rappings , and Socialism ; for these are the leading peculiarities of development in " American life , " of which the author treats , and for the faithful portraiture of which hs* thus acknowledges himself responsible . No superficial observer , no man who is // not in thorough sympathy with that profound religious earnestness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing of the Pilgrims to the present time , can do justice to the themes thus indicated . He must appreciate such religious earnestness as a moral force acting , not upon a single isolated individual , but upon seven successive generations of men , enjoying to an extent never before permitted to any people , freedom of thought , speech , and action . It is surely quite obvious that , to succeed in such an undertaking , the author needs far other intellectual and moral endowments , than those which fitted him to write a sprightly and highly entertaining narrative of the scenes and incidents of his world-wide travels in foreign lands . We must also confess to our fears , that there is much in our author 's life , spent to so great an extent in foreign countries , to disqualify him for a true insight of the social condition of this his native land . With that religious earnestness which forms so prominent a feature in Anierican character , we suspect Bayard Taylor never had much sympathy , and we are not sure that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not a true American . And in that old world , in Which so large a portion of his mature life has been spent , and with which he has united himself by the strong ties of family alliance , he everywhere finds the names , and forms , and language of the Christian religion , but the religious zeal and fervor of his own country , nowhere . A man with truly American ideas of religion finds the religious aspects of his own country wanting , quite as much as the peculiarities of its climate , and natural scenery . Instead , he finds a religion , called Christian indeed , but which Dr. Paley has most truly characterized by saying , " a Christian 's chief care being to pass quietly through this world to a better . " This is very munch the impression which the religion of the old world makes on the mind of a devout Aruerican traveler . It is a religion which is quite satisfied with such frames of mind , and such religious e*notions as may be naturally enough excited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are so liberally employed in the IRomnan Catholic Church , and the English Establish // ment , but which makes no earnest and imperative claim to an entire control of the life of the individual man , and to subjugate to its laws all civil and political institutions , and all the rules and usages of social and practical life . It is just such a religion as the English Establishment will nurture wherever it thrives ; and it and all its offshoots will thrive , just as long as they continue to be surrounded only by this easy , quiet , uiipractical religion of the emotions and of poetic sentiment . When an American . who is without sympathy with the intenser religious development of his own country , falls in with the religious aspects of the old world , he readily accepts them , and comes to estimate the more practical religion of his own country , just as it is estimated by a large class of foreign travelers in the United States , who find nothing so much amiss in America , as its religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the pursuit of pleasure , while yet in their youth , to Europe , and after many years spent in foreign lands return quite divested of the most striking characteristic of an American . They are just such men as Mr. Woodbury of the story before us . With r*eligion , as it manifests itself here for the most part , they have no sympathy . Our author says in his prefatory letter , that he is neither " Mr. Woodbury , nor Mr. Waldo , nor Seth Wattles " And yet in respect to religion , we are forced to believe he is Mr. Woodbury . His whole life is exactfy suited to make him just such a man ; and we are coinpelled to accept the portrait as genuine , though he denies that he sat for it . We must add that no Mr. Woodbury can fairly represent these " certain types of character and phases of society . " Precisely to this extent we believe Bayard Taylor is disqualified for the task he has undertaken . In the execution of his work , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book " total abstinence from intoxicating drinks , " from conscientious motives , is treated as an absurd and contemptible fanaticism , the offspring and the characteristic mark of narrow and illiberal minds . We can not call to *iind a single instance , in which it is treated as worthy of the smallest respect . Its advocates are made the moat intolerant of bigots* and sourest of fanatics . It is assumed // that a liberal mind will of course be emancipated from so vulgar a prejudice . This is the light in which Bayard Taylor chooses to exhibit this great movement of the American mind in behalf of universal temperance . Whether the doctrines of the American Temperance Socicties are true or false , we can feel no hesitation in pronouncing this exhibition of this great national phenomenon quite contemptible . It would be contemptihle in a Dickens or a Thackeray ; in an American author , who ought to understand the subject , it is almost beneath contempt . Does not Mr. Bayard Taylor know , that the great American Temperance IReform was not originated in the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grindle ? And that such men have never been its leading representatives and advocates before the people ? Does he not know , that it has been cordially accepted , and very earnestly and powerfully advocated by a host of men , occupying the foremost positions in church and in state , as well as in professional and social life ? Men , the liberality of whose minds , and the generosity of whose culture would render them ornaments to any nation on earth , and with whom our author can not presume to compare himself without being chargeable with a very obvious lack of modesty . The American Temperance Reform may possibly be argued down , but it can not be sneered down and laughed down , after the method of this booj . It is a sincere and earnest effort of enlarged , enlightened , and religious minds , to stay the progress of a great national vice , by influences addressed to the understandings and the consciences of the people . It may be that in their zeal against a national evil so grievous and so alarming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended on sound philosophical principles : it may be that the reform will never achieve all the good which its friends and advocates have hoped ; but whatever its future history may be , sober and enlightened men will see in this part of our moral development much to respect and honor , and nothing to despise and ridicule ; and if our author chooses to hold it up to contempt and derision , he betrays , most manifestly , his ignorance // of what an intelligent man will be sure to understand-his own country . He may , we think lie will , meet applause from thousands on the other side of the Atlantic , whose religious characters are as devoid of earnestness , and whose views of our country are as snperficial as his own ; but in his own country , the wise and good , if they read his book at all , will read it with sorrow , and lay it aside with a lowered estimate of its author . There are reasons why such a reform as this should be attempted , and gain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other lands . The doctrine of the equal rights of man is not confined to our political system : it pervades our religion also , and exerts a controlling influence over all our modes of religious action . It is not difficult for the higher classes in Britain to regard the besotting vices xvh ich prevail in the lower strata of society , with regret and sorrow indeed , and yet with the feeling that they are inevitable , and a thing to be expected . The drunkenness which occurs in the higher ranks is veiled over with decencies and elegant concealments , and occasions very little shock to the moral sense of the nation . The different ranks are so far removed from each other in all their social relations and modes of life , that the thought would not be entertained for a moment , of practising total abstinence in the dwellings of the rich , the great , and the noble born , for the sake of setting an example of temperance to the poor and the lowly . To this there are indeed exceptions : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most affluent circumstances , who practice the strictest total abstinence . But they are rare exceptions . But in our country we admit , we earnestly contend , that all the forces of culture are to be applied to men as men , with no question about rank or class . Neither as republicans nor as Christians , do we admit that there is any class in society , that is to be given over to the degradation of vice . We acknowledge that we are our brother 's keeper , and that every man of every class is our brother . Hence we easily admit that the rule of moral action by which we are bound is one which is not only safe in the palaces of wealth , but safe also in dwellings of poverty and toil . And it is not a reproach but an // honor to the religion of our country , that tens of thousands of the wealthy have been found willing to banish intoxicating drinks from their tables and their sideboards , not only as a security to the virtue of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of their example in the dwellino*s of b b the poor . This is practical democracy . In dealing with American " sects " and " revivals , " our " story of American Life " is , if possible , still more unfortunate . We are entir&amp;ly unable to give our readers any adequate idea of his mode of handling this subject , except by extracting the following paragraphs into our pages . We grudge the space they will occupy , but were we to attempt to represent the author 's view of this subject in our own language , we should be suspected by many of our readers of having done him injustice . lie must be permitted to speak for himself as follows : " The churches in the village undertook their periodical revivals ' which absorbed the interest of the community while they lasted . It was not the usual season in Ptolemy for such agitations of the religious atmosphere , but the Methodist clergyman , a very zealous and impassioned speaker , having initiated the movement with great success , the other sects became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place into his own fold . As soon as they could obtain help from Tiberius , the Baptists followed , and the Rev. Lemuel Styles was constrained to do likewise . For a few days the latter regained the ground he had lost , and seemed about to distance his competitors . Luckily for him , the Rev. Jehiel Preeks accompanied his wife on her farewell visit , and was immediately impressed into the service . His account of his sufferings at Tristan d'Acunha , embracing a description of the sickness and triumphant death of his first wife , melted the auditorst tears , and the exhortation which followed was like seed planted in well-ploughed ground . The material for conversion , drawn upon from so many different quarters , was soon exhausted , but the rival churches stoutly held out , until convinced that neither had any further advantage to gain over the other . " Mr. Waldo , of course , was not exempt from the general necessity , although conscious of the disadvantage under which he labored in representing so unimportafit a sect . Its founder had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar intellect , combined with his earnestness of heart , wrought powerfully upon those with whom he came in personal contact , but his views were not broad enough to meet the wants of a large class . After his death , many of his disciples , released from the influence of his personality , saw how slight a difference separated them from their brethren , and yearned to be included in a more extensive fold . Among these was Mr. Waldo , whose native good sense taught him that minor differences in interpretation and observances do not justify Christians in dividing their *trength by a multitude of separate organizations . // His congregation , however , was very slowly brought to view the matter in the same light , and he was too sincerely attached to its members to give up his charge of them while any prospect of success remained . " On this occasion , nevertheless-thanks to the zeal of some of his flock , rather than his own power of wielding the thunder-bolts of Terror-Mr . Waldo gained three or four solitary fish out of the threescore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various nets . The Cimmerian rite of baptism had this advantage , that it was not performed in public , and its solemnity was not therefore disturbed by the presence of a crowd of curious spectators , such as are especially wont to be on hand when the water is cold . Mr. Waldo even disregarded the peculiar form of initiation which characterized his sect , affirming that it added no sanctity to the rite . " During the period of the revivals , there was a temporary suspension of the social life of Ptolemy . Even kindred families rarely assembled at tea except to discuss the absorbing topic and compare the results obtained by the various churches . There was a great demand for Baxter 's Saint 's Rcst , ' Alleine 's Alarm , ' Young 's Night Thoughts , ' and Pollok 's Course of Time , ' at the little bookstore . Two feathers disappeared from the Sunday bonnet of Mrs. Hamilton Bue , and the Misses Smith exchanged their red ribbons for slate-colored . Still , it was not the habit of the little place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence its serious moods never assumed a penitential character , and soon wore off . In this respect it presented a strong contrast to Mulligansville and Anacreon , both of which communities retained a severe and mournful expression for a long time after their revivals had closed . " pp. 169-lfl . This is familiar ground to the readers of the New Englander , and they can judge of the truth and fidelity of this representation of the case as well as we , and what chance " American sects " and " revivals " have of being appreciated , wherever Bayard Taylor is likely to be accepted as a witness . That his testimony will be taken by vast multitudes we are well aware . He is just such a witness as will find a most ready and delighted credence , wherever the governing aristocracy and church establishment of England cast their shadow . And under that dark eclipse a large portion of the English speaking population of the world , outside our own country , are at this time living . Nor is the influence of such representations confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . In matters pertaining to our country , England , or to speak more accurately , the London Times , forms the public opinion of Europe and of Christendom . Even in our own country such views are most eagerly embraced by thousands . The notion // of these matters entertained by our author is not original , it is even vulgar ; it is the notion which is zealously propagated by the whole American branch of Episcopacy , with a few choice exceptions , and which is embraced by multitudes of the worldly , unthinking , and undevout . Yet let no man that holds it make any pretension to any real insight of religion in our country . Any man who sees in American revivals , and in the efforts which are made to promote them , nothing deeper , nothing more respectable , than an annual scramble of the sects to make as many proselytes as possible ; each for itself , may be assured that his own view of the subject is so superficial as to be quite unworthy the serious consideration of any thoughtful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that multiplication of sects , which is American , only because in America alone has the human mind ever had freedom of development in respect to religion . We feel far more than on this occasion we shall attempt to express , the weakness , the scandal , and the shame which are brought on the Christian cause , by the unnatural relations to each other , into which devout men are thrown by these sad divisions . It is a subject we can never approach without being ready to exclaim , " 0 , that mine head were waters , and mine eyes a fountain of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people . " But we know , too , that when with a worldly mind and an undevout heart , an au4hor stands at a cold and unsympathizing distance from this scene , and forms and utters such opinions respecting it , as those qudted above , lie does but uncover the superficial shallowness of his own thought ; so far as this subject is concerned he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , a friend , whose attention we have called to the passage we have quoted above , says of it , that it is simply the utterance of half-truths . This is just what we think of it , and only add , that , as often happens in such cases , it is such an utterance of half-truths , as constitutes the most mischievous of falsehoods . To ascribe these phenomena to mere sectarian zeal is to give no adequate account of them . If , underlying all , there were not an earnest faith in the great // verities of the Christian religion , as involving the everlasting destinies of the soid , there would be nothing to keep these fires burning , or to rekindle them when they had become temporarily inactive . Zeal for sect would die out . Such men as Bayard Taylor do not become proselyting sectarians , not because they are incapable of party spirit , or at all slow to manifest it when some question arises in which they think their own interests are at stake , but because they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men were as indifferent to it as they are , they , too , would become incapable of sympathy with sectarian zeal . Men do not become zealous for religion , for the sake of their sects , but they are zealous for their sects , because they think them necessary to the prosperity of religion . Three considerations are needful to be taken into the account in order to explain , and the three taken together do fully explain that development of sect which is in some sort peculiar to our country . These considerations are-first , that a very large portion of the people with us , are in serious practical earnest about religion-second , that here the human mind has opportunity for entire freedom of development ,  --  and third , that very few of the sects of the United Sfates are of American origin . They are the products of the controversies of all Christendom , through all the ages of Christian history , transplanted to American soil by the process of colonization , and here brought into collision with each other in a manner which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected by the State in their efforts to realize their own systems of religious organization , and yet no one of them favored or supported by any partiality of the government ; - each left to its own resources , its own logic , its own inherent power of swaying the beliefs of the people . It is the order of God 's providence , that systems shall originate in the Eastern Hemisphere , and be tested in the Western . The errors , , the follies , the wrongs which have for ages been fostered under the religious despotisms of Europe are here brought into open collision with each other , and with free mind and a free Bible . And that man who , in circumstances such as these , only stands at a // distance , and gives utterance to his ignorant disgust at these sectarian conflicts , need make no farther pretensions to any understanding of the religion of this country . We , at least , are not prepared to treat any such pretensions with respect . As well uncage all the wild beasts of a menagerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring , to express our disgust at the scene of conflict and confusion which xVould ensue . This consideration also suggests the thought that the present condition of religious sects in our country can by no means be accepted as the ultimate condition of religion under absolute religious freedom . It is not the result simply of such freedom , but of the mingling together of many rival and opposing systems , which were the products not of religions freedom , but of the various forms of spiritual despotism , each enjoying the unrestrained use of all its moral and intellectual forces in the struggle for existence and ascendancy . It may be affirmed without any hesitation , that several of the most prevalent religious denominations of this country could never have existed , had not either the Church wielded the power of physical coercion , or the State controlled the Church . Religions freedom never would have produced them ; and whether they can maintain a permanent existence nuder religions freedom is one of the great problems of our future . We can not then regard our present sectarian conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of transition to a future of which no one can perhaps form any *dequate conception . The reader will of course have noticed the aspect in which , iii the passage quoted , the author chooses to present Christian missions to the heathen . To those who have not read the book it may be necessary to remark that Rev. Jehiel Preeks is a returned missionary from India , who , having lost his wife . Other allusions to the same subject are made in other parts of the work , but always in the same spirit , always with the evident intention of exciting and expressing contempt both for the missionary and those who support him . If any man were to take his notions of American missionary efforts from this book , // he would suppose them to be the offspring of the narrowest and Tnost contemptible fanaticism . This , from a man whose only claim to be regarded with honor rests on his enterprise as a world-wide traveler , is certainly contemptible . It is well to remind such a man that it is time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , and informs himself on this matter , we shall be happy to hear from him again . We shall then hear him acknowledging that one of the last things to be expected from a returned missionary is to hear him whine over his sufferings in heathen lands , or to make any effort to excite other people 's sympathy for his self-denials and sacrifices . He will find them narrating their experiences in those pagan lands in quite as cheerful a spirit as Mr. Bayard Taylor narrates his adventures in Egypt or Lapland . And if he is a candid man , he will acknowledge that among the missionaries who have gone out from the American churches , are found many men , who , in every ( juality of the accomplished traveler , especially in the analysis of national character , of institutions , of society , are at least the equals of the author of Hannah Thurston . There is , we are happy to admit , one phase of American character which our author has exhibited with much more truth and fidelity ; and it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derives all its interest from that one topic . We refer to that dissatisfaction which has existed for many years with the social and even the political relations of women . The characters under which our author has chose* to represent total abstinence , zeal for the abolition of slavery , sects and revivals , and Christian missions , are almost without exception revolting and disgusting , either stiff , formal and Pharisaical , like Rev. Lemuel Styles , or intensely narrow-minded , bigoted , and fanatical , like Seth Wattles and Mr. Grindle , to say nothing of several female specimens . Mrs. Waldo may be taken as an exception , perhaps , but not really so ; for though the wife of the pastor of a very small and narrow sect , she has really no sympathy with her sect , and figures in the story in the midst of all these disgusting developments as a noble and true woman , whose social tact and womanly power over the hearts of those in the midst of whom she lived , a queen or a duchess // might well envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reading the book , that it is a gross violation of the proprieties of the plot to represent so fair a flower , implying so generous a culture , as growing in such a soil and under such a climate . If American society matures such women as Mrs. Waldo , then ought the author to show something of the social forces by which results so beautiful are produced ; and it is a just and most damaging criticism that he utterly fails to do this . Mr. Waldo is also to a certain extent another exception , and yet only apparently , for he is greatly too good to be in sympathy with his sect ; and the author , in delineating his character , invests him with certain disagreeable peculiarities , which are not at all demanded by the proprieties of the plot , and have no other effect than to render the reader 's conception of the sects of Ptolemy more revolting and disgusting . But the doctrine of " Woman 's Rights " is represented by Hannah Thurston , the heroine of the story . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we are constantly wondering how such a character should have been produced amid such surroundings . The author enlists the reader 's sympathy in her in every part of the story , and that however much he may dissent from her opinions . We think in her character the author has truly represented the best specimens of the class which he intended to describe . He is likely perhaps to make on the foreign reader the impression that this class is much more numerous among us than it is . It is a very small class , and yet in our whole country a considerable number of specimens may be found , and we heartily thank the author for this truthful portrait . The philanthropy of these women , their love of universal humanity , 1is sincere and very earnest . They are ready to endure any sufferings and self-sacrifices in vindicating the rights of all who are suffering wrong , and in taking the side of the oppressed against the oppressor , however powerful . But they are in rebellion against the divinely constituted relations of the sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native right wields , they are not satisfied . We have never indeed known one who was willing to resign it , but they aspir* // to add to this natural and inalienable dominion an equal participation in man 's royal prerogatives also . They scorn and repudiate the natural , and , as we think , the inevitable dependence of woman on man , as humiliating and degrading . It is worthy of our serious consideration what has caused this peculiar mental development in our country . We repeat it , that the American people are religiously in earnest , and in nothing more in earnest , than in their purpose to apply the great foundation doctrine of our republic to all classes and conditions of our common humanity . Previous to the outbreak of the great American conflict , men of other lands might have been excused for doubting the truth of this assertion . But the sanguinary conflict of the last three years affords , we should think , an overwhelming and certainly a terrible attestation of it . What wonder then if in our zeal for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiefly from such exaggeration and distortion this agitation ( if indeed it is extensive enough to be called an agitation ) has resulted . There are exaggerations of the doctrine of equal rights , which are widely prevalent and exert a mighty influence over * very large portion of the English speaking population of the globe , which to admit is to lay ourselves under a logical necessity of admitting that many of our laws and social usages in respect to women are unjust and in flagrant violation of natural right . For example , millions , not only in this country , but even in England , believe that the right of voting at all elections is a natural , inherent , and therefore inalienable right , and that to deny it to any portion of the population of a country is a violation of natural justice . So also of the right to be eligible to all offices and places of trust and einolument under the Government . If this assumption is true , it is utterly vain to argue against the right of a woman to vote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift4 of the people . If the right to vote and to be eligible to office exists in virtue of one 's belonging to the human race , why should not women enjoy it as well as men ? And why should we wonder that men and women are found clamorously crying out against the disfranchisement of woman ? Why this cruel injustice to our mothers , wives , sis // ters , and daughters ? And then if wonian is to vote , and to hold office , and to sit in the legislature , why not bear her full equal part in efforts to sway public opinion ? Why not mount the rostrum and engage in all the conflicts of the political canvas ? And if she is to do these things , why not be educated and trained to do them as men are ? Why not be subjected to the same discipline and the same culture ? Not one of us can answer why not . We do not so understand the doctrine of equal rights , and we are satisfied that such an understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sure in this country it never will be , ) can result in nothing but anarchy . Mv birth as a member of the human race gives me no right to be a voter . The voter is more properly an office-holder , than a simple citizen exercising a natural right of humanity . The elective franchise should be extended or contracted from considerations of public expediency alone . If our country is likely to be governed better by the votes of imigrant foreigners than without them , then let them have the right of suffrage ; if not , then for the sake of themselves and their children after them let it be withheld And in like manner , if the prosperity , the freedom , the virtue of this nation will be increased by enlarging the arena of political strife so as to embrace the whole female sex , then let it be done . But if on the other hand it would be destructive of the peace , the order , the harmony , and the virtue of society , then let no theory ab9ut equal rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of equal rights to be . the right of every man to be a man , and every woman to be a woman , and let woman be content with her natural and peaceful dominion over domestic and social life , and leave to the stronger sex these sterner and less amiable conflicts . We have no fear at all that in American or in any free society this controversy will not be adjusted on precisely the principles just indicated . On such a question as the relation of the sexes to each other , the voices of nature will be heard and regarded ; the yearnings of the heart will be more powerful than any logic or any theory . In this respect we think our author quite true to nature iu restoring his heroine // to the position of true womanhood by the promptings of her heart and not of her head ; and by that process we think a true woman will generally find her right place in the social system , whatever theoretical opinions she may have adopted . We might indeed be disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes in this book . Perhaps we are not good judges of such a matter , but the author reminded us of the words of the wise man- " There be three things which are too wonderful for me , yea four which I know not : the way of an eagle in the air , the way of a serpent upon a rock , the way of a ship in the midst of the sea , and the way of a nian with a maid . " The first three of these wonders science has explained , Bayard Taylor has tried his hand at the fourth , but we think without much success . He would have done as well to leave it where the wise man did . At least we would advise any one who wishes to have a good opinion of the book to leave off at the marriage . True , Hannah 's conversion was not then completed , but we can feel assured that the work was at that point well begun , and would in due time be quite accomnplished . But though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be to any considerable extent changed , we are still of the opinion that the agitation of this question has done a good deal of injury to American society . It has prodnced and is producing morbid developments which imperatively require our earnest attention . We have no fears that the occupations aimd the ordinary routine of female life will undergo any considerable change , or at least any undesirable change , for to changes we are not opposed , provided they are for the better . But we think erroneous , though very crude and indefinite views of this subject are exerting a disastrous influence on our whole system of female education . There are thousands who could never be made to believe that a life-career which is appropriate for a man , is therefore equally appropriate for a woman , who would yet receive without hesitation the proposition that an education which is good for a man is equally good for a woman , and could easily be made to feel that woman is injured in the fact that a similar education is // not provided for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of minds of both sexes . For the last quarter of a century , enterprises have been greatly multiplied , which have had for their central idea the necessity of providing a collegiate education for our daughters as well as for our sons . Several colleges have been founded , which open their classes to the youth of both sexes indiscriminately . A large number of female seminaries have been established , and have come into a high degree of public favor , which have a four years curriculm , intended to be in some degree equivalent to that of our colleges , and that curriculum terminates in a regular graduation . And into the system of most of these seminaries , female colleges* publicity enters largely , public examinations , public exhibitions before large promiscuous assemblies , and the public conferring of diplomas . You shall often witness a boarding school miss of eighteen standing before a vast promiscuous assembly , to read or speak her essa*y , and playing the orator to the best advantage that her feminine voice will permit . Let no reader question the accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and testify what we have seen . Meanwhile the young misses of every Female College in the land , are stimulated to the highest zeal for these oratorical per . formances , by the splendid reception given to Miss Anna E. Dickinson , in the Capital at Washington , the President of the United States and his Cabinet , and the gravest Senators and Representatives sitting spell-bound by her eloquence . These vast changes in our system of female education have grown up within a quarter of a century , and have been accepted by the nation as good almost without any questioning ; at least without public questioning ; for thousands have questioned them , who have given no public expression to their doubts . For our own part , we have always doubted , and on all favorable opportunities have given utterance to our doubts . We are doubters still . Does any one in his senses believe that our conceptions of the highest perfection in male and in female life are identical ? Are they not quite as different as our conception of beauty in // male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the system of education which is best fitted to qualify man for his stern life-task , is also best fitted to qualify woman for her softer and gentler mission ? Does it follow that the machinery which is good for manufacturing steam engines , is also good for manufacturing lace ? Does it follow as a matter of course , because our colleges are good for preparing men for professional and public life , that , therefore , it will be a kindness to our daughters to provide for them all the virile discipline we can ? There is not a female seminary in the country , which has been constructed for the purpose of furnishing a collegiate education for girls , which does not contain in its very structure ample confession of the impracticability of the attempt , and of the soundness of the views we have just intimated . Why do they not take the curriculum of Yale or Cambridge , and rigidly adhere to it , requiring three years of prep*ratory discipline in the Latin and Greek languages , and then four years more of rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural sciences , classical literature and general philosophy ? The answer is obvious enough . There is no man or woman who has not sober sense enough left to know , that such a curriculum for a female seminary is absurd and impracticable , though we have seen one statement of a course of study for a female seminary , in which the Septuagint was embraced as a text-book . Why then all this talk about a collegiate education for girls , when every man of us knows that it is not a collegiate education which is intended ? Why deceive ourselves and the public with this parade of female colleges and universities , when we are all the time compelled to carry before us the admission , that they are institutions of entirely a different grade and character . We have no fears that all our efforts can transform American women into men ; but it does not hence follow that no harm is done by the attempt . It is unnecessary perhaps to say , that most American parents feel , whether wisely or not , the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than that of their sons . We can not set the limit higher than from eighteen to twenty years . Before the girl reaches that limit , she must have completed her whole curriculum , // and be in readiness for what is , and in spite of all our logic always must be , the great event of woman 's life . Hence , the al ) solute necessity in all those seminaries , which make a show of a collegiate education , of an exceedingly crowded course . To look over the course of study of many of our female seminaries , and see what tasks they propose to lay upon girls between the years of fourteen and eighteen , is quite astounding . The consequence often is , we fear , that the girl is harrassed by a variety arid multiplicity of studies , incompatible with the healthful action of either mind or body . Bodily health is impaired . Irritability and excitability , rather than the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , are cultivated , and the whole system tends more to female pedantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . To all of which add those morbid outlooks so often occurring towards public exhibition and public life , and you have an outline view of the mischief of which we complain . We are after all chiefly concerned for the bearing of this state of thiri*s on health . Much has been said of the feeble health of American women , as compared with those of other lands , *iuchi more we are inclined to think than is true . But that a state of things exists in many of our larger seminaries which is incompatible with health we certainly fear . We believe that the voice of nature suggests , that some leisure should enter into the daily life of every woman . There is no man who does not feel that , any woman who has no leisure is overtaxed . When we see a man called to exert strength to the utmost , we ncver think of pitying him ; he glories in it . But when we see a woman put to the same necessity , the voice of nature within us bids us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ought to allow some daily leisure to his f* male domestics . And we never see this law violated in the case of any woman , whatever her condition , without feeling that the teachings of nature are disregarded . We fear that in our great female seminaries this law is by no means properly regarded . And in no period of the life of a woman is its violation so sure to be followed with disastrous consequences , as between the years of fourteen and eighteen . We think this // subject requires the serious consideration of American paients and educators . We can not altogether like the public education which is now offered to our daughters . We fear American society will receive damage from it . We were attracted to this book ( we do not spend much time upon books of this class ) by its title , and the name of its author . " A story of American Life , by Bayard Taylor . " There is not at this moment a more interesting question engaging the attention of the civilized world , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the formation of character . It is the question of our whole future . On its de . cision will depend the estimate which the world and future ages will set on our political system . It will be of no avail for us to talk of our freedom , and our equal rights , unless it is found , as the result of our experiment , that our institutions tend to elevate , and purify individual character , and make man a stronger , purer , nobler being than he has ever been under the monarchies , aristocracies , and theocracies of the old world . If it shall appear in the ultimate result , that the influ. ence of our institutions is to degrade , materialize , and sensualize man , then shall we demand in vain that our political system shall bear sway over the destinies of the world . It may still be true that the systems of Europe are a sad failure , and the philanthropist may be forced to sit down and weep for humanity ; but in that case he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future still lies in combining , as favorably as possible , the elements of monarchy , aristocracy , and theocracy. it is very difficult for an American at home to conceive of the intense interest with which this question is regarded in other lands . Anything which seems to affbrd evidence that American character is degraded and depraved , is seized on with more avidity by the London Timnes and the Saturday IReview , than a story of a " Confederate " victory , or a Federal defeat . No time is lost in giving it the most effective utterance , and sowing it broadcast , not only over Britain but over Europe . In this state of the case , we deeply regret that Bayard Tay // br has given such a testimony of " American Life " as this . This reget springs not only from the infelicities of the picture which we have pointed out , but from others of minor magnitude to which we have not alluded , There is a disposition to depreciate and represent in unfavorable lights , which really indicates , that iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American . We will furnish an example or two . Arhutus Wilson , or Bute , as he is familiarly called , is the head farmer of Mr. Woodbury , who , after Hannah Thurston , is the leading character of the story . Bute is a man of robust and vigorous frame , strong common sense and kindly feeling , but in respect to education , refinement , and especially moral and religious culture , far below that class in American society to which he would naturally belong . But our author says , " lie was a very good specimen of the American countryman . " This we affirm is not true . The noblest characteristics of an American countryman are wanting . To have made him such , he should have received a good English education , he should have been immeasurably higher in the scale of intelligence , and lie should have been united to his age , and to all ages , by an earnest faith in the Christian religion , sanctifying his home and his private life , and making him an earnest patriot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with the object of his affection , the author introduces the following very significant comuient on his character : " for the latter ( Bute ) had such a strong sense of propriety about matters of this kind , ( speaking freely of the affairs of his employer ) , as might have inspired doubts of his being a native-born American . " A man has lost much of a just feelimig of nationality , when he will speak thus of his own country . There are other instances in the book where the author manifests a similar spirit . It excites no surprise that Russell , forinerly of the London Times , should speak thus ; we expect it ; it is his nature , and his occupation ; but such a remark from a " native-born " American astonishes us . It is but a stroke of the pen , but it reveals much of the author 's taste and spirit . Bayard Taylor has produced a book which in many of its fbatures will be quite acceptable to all persocs ahroad who de . // precate ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all minds , who know us only through books , a false and erroneous impression , an impression in which certain vices and follies of American society , with which few only are infected , stand out prominently in the foreground , while its substantial advantages and real excellencies find no place in the picture . We can not accept this portrait of " American Life " as in any sense true or faithful . It is such a picture as his American readers will generally reject as false and slanderous , while the enemies of democratic freedom will eagerly accept it , and earnestly wish to believe it true .
