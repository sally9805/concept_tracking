CATHERINE II. , OF RUSSIA . A FAIR-HAIRED , well-formed , and goodhumored girl , remarkable for her cheerfulness and gay spirits , her intelligence , and her native dignity , Catherine II. , of Russia , then Princess Sophia of Zerbst , passed her happy youth chiefly at the little town of Stettin . Neither pride nor ambition disturbed the modest hours of her girlhood . She played with the children of the quiet citizens , and was scarcely distinguished in any thing from her young companions , except that she was always the leader of their games . Her dress was plain , her education strict and careful , and she was early instructed in the Lutheran religion by an excellent pastor , who strove to form her mind to virtue and self-restraint . Sometimes she was allowed to vary her quiet life by a visit to an aunt at Hamburg , where she read the works of eminent living authors , and formed a lasting taste for letters . Still oftener she was at Brunswick , with her relative the dowager-duchess ; and now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank , generous , kind , she seems to have been generally beloved by her companions ; in her later , grandeur she called herself to their memory by various tokens of affection and esteem ; she sent her picture set in jewels to a playmate , and a sum of money to her schoolmaster ; and the mighty and guilty empress would sometimes speak of her school-days at Stettin with a pleasure that no doubt concealed a deep , unspoken pain . But great plans were being concerted by several crowned heads for the handsome Stettin princess ; she was to be made Empress of all the Russias . Elizabeth , the reigning empress at this time ( 1744 ) , was now growing old , and her nephew , the Grand-duke Peter , was her heir . She wished to provide him with a wife , and a romance-like circumstance led her to fix her choice upon the Princess Sophia . Long ere she mounted the throne of the Czars , it is said , Elizabeth had loved and had been betrothed to the young Prince of Holstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage was about to be celebrated , the prince fell sick and died . In the anguish of her bereavement and of her disappointed hope of happiness Elizabeth made a vow never to marry another . She kept her vow , at least in name , and the memory of her early love seems to have lingered deep in her heart through all the irregularities of her later career . It is charitable to believe that those who have erred might , under more happy circumstances , have been purer and better ; and we may readily conceive that had Elizabeth been united to one whom she so tenderly loved , her life would have been far different , and her fame unclouded hy those dark stains that must now forever rest upon it . The Czaress had heard of the attractive appearance and amiable disposition of the young Sophia , and she sent for her to come with her mother to St .. Petersburg , hoping that her nephew , Peter , would consent to make her his wife . Frederick of Prussia , too , was anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to concur in fulfilling the hopes of the empress and the king . Sophia alone was led by an instinctive dread to shrink from the alliance . When the project was mentioned to her she burst into tears , refused to leave the peaceful and innocent home at Stettin for the splendors of St. Petersburg , and declared that she would rather marry a simple count in Holstein than share the throne of the future Emperor of all the Russias . She was induced , however , by the solicitation of her mother , and , perhaps , by her own native ambition , to stifle her prophetic terror and appear at the imperial court . She was now in the first bloom of maiden grace and dignity . Her figure was fine and commanding , her complexion fair , her eyes blue , her hair light and flowing ; and her intelligent countenance and pleasant disposition won the hearts of the Russians . Peter , too , possessed many of the attractions of youth . His face and figure were not unpleasing . He was still innocent and pure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young couple met than they seemed to have formed a mutual affection and esteem . Peter became Sophias avowed lover ; and her mother , overjoyed by the success of her ambitious plans , threw herself at the Empress 's feet and asked her consent to their union ; she called to her mind the love she had borne to the prince , her brother , and urged the strong affection that bound the grand-duke and her niece together . Elizabeth , who could never hear the prince of Holstein 's name mentioned without weeping , burst into tmars and gave her consent with joy . The approaching marriage was announced to the foreign embassadors , and a day was appointed for the celebration of the nuptials . The Princess Sophia , meantime , had changed her Lutheran faith for that of the Greek ch.urch , and was baptized anew under the name of Catherine Alexievun . A fatal change ! The fair Stettin girl seems almost to have assumed a new character with her new name . She was never m6re Sophia of Zerbst ; she was ever after to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All things had thus far passed prosperously , even beyond their hopes , for the royal promoters of this fatal match . But now the first of a long series of misfortunes occurred . The grandduke was suddenly seized with the small-pox of a most malignant character-his life was despaired of ; and Catherine seemed threatened , like Elizabeth , with the loss of her royal lover . Unhappily for both he at length recovered . But his youthful vigor and graceful form were gone , he was shrunken and withered ; and his once handsome face was now disfigured in a manner that made him for a time , at least , hideous to look upon . Catherine , prepared by her mother for the k f // shocking sight , 7entered his apartment , fell upon his neck , and kissed him . But the effcct upon her nervous system was terrible . She returned to her owa room , and sauk into a swoon which Insted for three hours . Ambition , howev*er , which had now been aroused in her once peaceful breast , joined to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led her to consent to the solemnization of the marriage . The unhappy pair were united , and from that moment* a bitter hatred seems to have sprung up between them . Catherine looked with contempt upon her ill - fated husband , who was coarse , ill - educated , and ignorant , and who gradually sank deep into dissipation and drunkenness ; while the grand-duke , enraged at her infidelities or her levity , sometimes drove her , weeping and torn with mortification , from the midst of his courtiers by his rude and blunt reproaches . The Empress Elizabeth died in 1762 , and Peter III . ascended the throne . Catherine had looked forward to the time when her husband should obtain absolute power with terror , lest he might consign her to a prison or the tomb . But Peter , who seems to have possessed a generous heart , began now to treat her with apparent kindness . She appeared with him on all state occasions ; and their son , PauJ Petrovitch , was looked upon as the heir to the throne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair . Cathei-ine was amiable but resolute , ambitious and determined to rule . Peter sometimes yielded to her imperious control , and at others treated her with a coarseness and a violence that a woman never forgives . The interference of pretended friends and secret foes , as is often the case with the matrimonial quarrels of persons in less exalted stations , widened the difference between them ; until at length Peter resolved , it is said , to depose the empress and marry the Countess Yorontzoff , who had long held a complete mastery over his feeble mind . He had even prepared a prison for his unfaithful wife , where she would pass the rest of her life in solitude and despair . Catherine , meanwhile , acquainted with his design , had not been idle . In connection with Count Panin , the Princess Dashkoft and her own favorite , Gregory Orloff , she formed a conspiracy to dethrone the Czar and seize upon the vacant throne . That eager desire to rule which had made her the leader of her young companions in their childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume an equal control over the intriguers and plotters of an immoral court . She won the affections , or the respect , of the Russians by her condescending manners and her active mind . A portion of the army was gained over to her side by promises and bribes . She deceived the priests and monks by her pretended zeal for religion . The courtiers were charmed by her liberality and her magnificence ; and all St. Petersburg had learned to look upon her as its actual sovereign . Voa . XXXVIII. - No. 227-40 The Czar , on the other hand , olThnded all orders of his subjects . His admiration for Frederick of Prussia , his effort to introduce German manners into the imperial court , his fondness for German favorites , his plain preference for the Lutheran over the national faith , his vices and his drunkenness , blinded the people to the few excellent qualities which he really possessed . At this time Catherine lived in a fierce excitement , which she concealed under smiles and gayety . A sudden discovery of her designs would hurl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a perpetual imprisonment . Even death might be near ; for in Russia no one would venture to defend her from the rage of the absolute Czar . The fatal moment at length came . One night , when she had retired to sleep in a summer-house at some distance from the palace , she was aroused by the sudden entrance of a soldier whom she had never seen . " Your Majesty , " he said , " has not a moment to lose ; get ready to follow me . " It was now two o'clock in the morning . Catherine sprang up , called her confidant , Ivanovna , and having disguised themselves to escape notice , the two women , trembling and terrified , entered a carriage which waited for them at the garden-gate . Alexey Orloff , brother of Gregory , took the reins and drove rapidly toward St. Petersburg . The horses soon gave out , having been overdriven , and the conspirators were forced to alight and proceed on foot . They had not gone far when they overtook a light country cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this manner reached the capital . Worn with fatigue and anxiety , Catherine concealed her terror under an appearance of calmness and dignity . She presented herself to the soldiers of the garrison . She told them that the Czar had intended that night to put her to death , together with her son , the grandduke , and she appealed to them for protection . The Ismailoff guards at once cried out , " Long live the Empress I " The rest of the soldiers followed their example ; the priests assembled around her ; the people received her with acclamations ; and that very morning she was proclaimed Empress of all the Russias , in the midst of a splendid assemblage , in the Holy Church of Kazan . She then returned to the palace ; the gates were thrown open to all the people , and a vast throng poured in to take the oath of allegiance . So rapid and so unlooked for was this strange revolution , by which a foreigner and a woman , with no hereditary title , became the successor of Peter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of what had occurred . He was it his favorite palace of Oranienbaum , plunged in dissipation . When the news came he sank into helpless desondency . He thought at one moment of escaping into Poland ; the next he composed a letter to Catherine , imploring her mercy , and , offering to resign the crown . But the relentless conspirators had resolved to // show him no pity ; he was stripped of his orders and his royal robes by a band of plunderers ; even his pockets were searched , and several diamonds and pieces of jewelry which he had hidden were discovered . He stood for a time barefoot and nearly naked on the steps of his palace , exposed to the jeers and insults of the coarse soldiery . An old morning-gown was then thrown over him , and he was confined , under a guard , in his own room . Here he was forced to sign a renunciation of the throne , and a confession of his own unfitness to wear the crown . A dark mystery hangs over the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is said that he was poisoned while in confinement , and that when the poison seemed too slow in its effect , Alexey Orloff , Prince Baratinsky , and Teploff another of the conspirators , threw themselves upon him and strangled him . Whether Catherine was accessory to the horrible deed seems undecided . Coxe and other writers are inclined to believe that she was not . We may hope at least that their opinion is well-founded , and that she , who was so uniformly merciful to her enemies , was not stained with her husband 's blood . Yet it is sufficiently horrible to remember that she took no pains to punish his murderers , and that they were covered with honors and emoluments , and formed the fearful ornaments of her splendid court . In the year 1762 Catherine became empress . Around her were gathered the chief conspirators , men coarse , ill-educated , and risen from the lowest ranks of the people , in whose society she complained that she could find no pleasure , yet to whose aid she was indebted for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She visited Moscow , the ancient seat of the Czars ; but her life was threatened , and she hastily returned to St. Petersburg . Even there she found herself surrounded by conspiracies against her power and her person . The European monarchs looked coldly upon the parvenu empress who now wielded the uncertain sceptre , which she was believed to have won by a barbarous and dreadful crime ; and , from her dangerous eminence , Catherine beheld herself every where surrounded by a thousand terrors which might have appalled any nature less resolute than her own . Danger , however , seemed only to draw out her wonderful genius for command , and her fierce , unhallowed ambition guided her to a course of policy that made her the most potent monarch of her time . She crushed discontent at home with unparalleled vigor . The ancient nobility of Russia , who hated and despised the German usurper and her low-born courtiers , at length became her willing slaves . The countless legions of bishops and monks , whom she had offended and treated with ignominy when they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overawed and helpless , in their cells . Her splendid victories and conquests won for her a popularity among her subjects such as none of her predecessors but Peter the Great had possessed . Abroad , the monarchs of Europe were soon overmastered by her imperious will . Frederick the Great courted her favpr . Joseph II. , of Austria , became a willing instrument in accomplishing her most unscrupulous designs . George III. , of England , sank into her ally . And dissolute Louis XV . vainly strove by feeble diplomacy to check the stately progress of the new Semiramis . Catherine became the master intellect of Europe . Of all her vast designs , that upon which her chief energies were expended was to make Russia acknowledged as one of the civilized nations of the time . As Philip of Macedon had labored with fierce , untiring zeal to make his native kingdom Greek , so Catherine lived to make Russia European . She was resolved to be received as a peer into that assemblage of crowned heads whose haughty caste was still inclined to look down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into notice ; and she prepared to take an equal place among the Hapsburgs , the Bourbons , and the Guelphs . Russia until now had been Asiatic rather than European . Its manners and its history had continued Oriental ; and in all the traits of modern civilization it had lingered far behind the Western powers of Europe . Yet there had been a time when this difference was by no means so remarkable . Russia commenced its career of progress almost as early , and had given the promise ' of as rapid an advance , as almost any one of those nations which now looked down upon it with contempt . When the empire of Charlemagne had broken into a thousand feudal fragments , and France and Germany were once more become half barbarous ; when Spain was a Moorish province ; when Alfred , the inspired Anglo-Saxon , was laboring to convert the English from brutes into men ; when Prussia was a wilderness , and Sarmatia a den of savagesRurik , the founder of the Russian monarchy , had descended from the North and formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new nation flourished with singular vigor . It is said that Kief and Novgorod were granddukedoms as early as the ninth century . And it seems certain that about this time the Russians had formed a close connection with the Greeks at Constantinople , and had imbibed Christianity and civilization from the most cultivated city of the age . The Norman dukes and the Northern conquerors , instructed by the priests and monks of the South , soon became as well educated and as humane as were the nobles of Germany and France . An alphabet , borrowed from the Greek , was introduced , and literature and learning flourished in the populous cities of Russia . The Bible was translated into the Sclavonic dialect as early as the ninth century . The Grandduke Vladimir , an intelligent prince , encouraged letters , music was already cultivated , and a poetical paraphrase of the Psalms was sung in 77 // all the churches . Schools were founded in various parts of the empire . Painting flourished in Russia a century before it was introduced into Italy . The convents abounded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed the annals of the Russian rulers in a simple and not ungraceful manner . He was followed by several other annalists , who gave their countrymen a taste for history . Already , in 1036 , Novgorod was a great city , and the court of the Russian duke was renowned for its splendor and cultivation . Novgorod , now a scene of ruin , was then the centre of a vast trade , and was famous for the independent spirit of its people . The Russian government , in the twelfth century , was almost a republic ' absolute power was unknown ; and the proud citizens of the capital boldly repelled every attempt to impair their liberties . An enormous bell hung suspended in the market-place of INovgorod , called by the inhabitants the " Eternal ; " it was only sounded in'moments when their freedom was endangered , and its sacred note assembled in arms the well-trained legions of the city , always terrible to their foes , and confident of victory . The grandeur and power of the Russian capital was expressed in the popular saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great Novgo-rod ? " Thus Russia bade fair to eclipse all the other nations of Europe in freedom and civilization , when suddenly the invasion of the Tartars swept over it in a torrent of desolation . The Eastern savages once more reduced it to barbarism . For several centuries it was a Tartar province , or was constantly exposed to their ravages . The government fell into anarchy ; its neighbors , the Poles , took advantage of its weakness and plundered it at will ; freedom died out ; yet the line of Rurik continued to rule until 1584 , when it ended with the feeble Theodore , the last of his race . In 1613 Michael Romanoft the first of the present dynasty , was chosen grand-duke , and his excellent rule laid the foundations of the modern greatness of Russia . Alexey and Peter the Great aided in reviving the slumbering intellect of the nation ; but it was under the rule of the gifted Catherine that Russia made its most important advance in general refinement and intelligence . If she had not been an empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an author . Her love for letters was intense and lasting . She sought the correspondence and the friendship of almost every eminent literary man of the day ; she wrote to Voltaire in terms of sincere admiration , and strove in vain to allure him to St. Petersburg . With Diderot she was more successful , and the philosopher condescended to give a portion of his time to a visit to the faithful empress . Their conversations were long and philosophical ; and Diderot seems to have found a far more agreeable friend in Catherine than the sarcastic Voltaire in his admirer and persecutor , Frederick . Catherine was always profuse in her liberality to literary men . She purchased Diderot 's library for a considerable sum , in order to provide a dowry for his daughter , allowed him to retain the use of it for life , and settled upon him a pension as her librarian . She wished to induce the historian Robertson , by munificent offers , to write an account of her reign . Her court was filled with men of intelligence and learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in her a friend ; she established academies or societies of learning and science , and lavished her revenues in seeking to awaken the intellect of her people . Poets , musicians , philosophers , actors , and artists sprang up under her careful patronage ; and she succeeded , at last , in making St. Petersburg illustrious as one of the intellectual centres of Europe . Her own pen , in the midst of her laborious cares of office , was never idle . One of rue first acts of her reign was to write out instructions for a code of laws for Russia , fall of wisdom , benevolence , and learning ; a work , indeed , sufficient in itself to give her a lasting fame . She was afterward employed in a series of philological researches which have merited the praise of Professor Max Muller . For her son , the grand - duke , she composed several beautiful tales , full of tenderness and ' pure morality ; and she also compiled a brief history of Russia ; while her extensive correspondence , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understnnding quite unparalleled in the history of female sovereigns . Elizabeth of England was a better scholar , but had less genius ; and no other empress or queen can rival as an authoress the imperial legislatrix , philologist , and novelist of Russia . Genuine and undoubting in her faith in literature , Catherine entered the proud republic of letters with a humility that proves her greatness . With her literary friends she was no longer the absolute empress , but the humble disciple and the faithful follower . Haughty and tenacious of her dignity among monarchs and statesmen , to Voltaire , D'Alembert , or Diderot she admitted herself an inferior . Frederick the Great , who was only a literary pretender in his intercourse with Voltaire and the lesser men of letters whom he had collected around him , could never be more than a modern Dionysius ; he would send poets to the mines or sell philosophers into slavery as his ignoble impulses prompted . But it was not so'with Catherine . The great empress threw herself at the feet of the eminent author with sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world ofliteraturewith an assiduous patience which contrasts strongly with that iron vigor by which she crushed the pride of European kings . Meanwhile St. Petersburg shone with material splendor . Catherine has been called its second founder . She found it a collection of wooden hovels ; she left it a city of granite and marble . Palaces sprang up under her magic // touch ; public works of rare value and excellence abounded ; her galleries were filled with rare pictures and graceful statues ; an equestrian statue of Peter the Great , unrivaled for grandeur and power , adorned the banks of the Neva ; and the crystal waters of that beautiful river were chained by a series of granite quays and embankments that put to shame the ports of the capitals of older origin . The rapid growth of St. Petersburg is wonderful in history . In the year 1700 , when New York and Boston were already flourishing commercial towns , the rapid Neva flowed through a desolate morass and a perfect solitude . In 1703 Peter the Great built a small fort on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low hut upon an adjacent island , to which he gave the name of St. Petersburg . The hut is still preserved , with religious care , like the house of Romulus by the Romans , and was the germ of that magnificent city which has become the capital of an empire more extensive than that of Rome . Peter , who had resolved to make Russia a commercial power and the mistress of the Baltic trade , hastened the growth of his new city with despotic vigor . Yet even he found it no easy.task to convert the swampy islands and naked shores of the Neva into a tolerable habitation for man . When the west wind blew the waters of the river were swelled by the tide , and a general inundation swept over the infant settlement . The climate was harsh and fickle ; the winters terribly severe . Food and fuel must be brought from a great distance in the interior , for the barren neighborhood produced only a few fir-trees . No stone for building existed in the swamps of the Neva ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large one , to bring him thirty stones ; if small , ten ; and every peasant 's wagon three , to aid him in building his bridges and his public works . The first brick house was built in 1710 . Every noble was commanded to have a palace at St. Petersburg . But the growth of the city was still slow , and when Peter died he left behind him only the gigantic plan of a metropolis whose completion nature and the inconveniences of its situation seemed resolved to defeat . By the close of Catherine 's reign a wonderful transformation was effected . " The crystal waters of the Neva , deep , rapid , and transparent , " exclaimed an English traveler of . the time , " exhibit the most grand and lively scenes I have ever beheld . " On the north side , a mighty fortress , the Academy of Sciences , and the Acad* emy of Arts ; on the south , the imperial palace , the Admiralty , and a range of palatial houses , belonging to the nobility or the wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The immense church of St. Isaac , a wihierness of granite and marble columns , the superb marble palace which the empress had built for Prince OrloW and a vast number of hospitals , churches , and public buildings had sprung up , like Aladdin 's palace , on the most desolate site in Europe . Within eightyyears the hovel which Peter the Great planted in the wilderness had expanded into a magnificent capital , glittering with gems and gold . The splendor and gayety of St. Petersburg surpassed that of every other court in Europe . The lavish expenditure of Versailles , the home of luxury and taste , was faint and feeble when compared with the Oriental magnificence of the f&amp;es on the banks of the *jeva . Catherine led the revels of her subjects . She was an empress , and she supposed that an empress must necessarily shine in balls and masquerades . In her court and her entertainments she sought to blend European taste with Oriental splendor . A court-day at St. Petersburg , in luxury and show , is said to have surpassed description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boundless expense . An immense retinue of courtiers always preceded and followed Catherine as she entered the apartments devoted to the guests ; and the costliness and dazzling richness of their dresses , and the *5rofusion of precious stones with which they were adorned , created an impression.of magnificence of which the splendor of other courts could convey but a faint idea . Men as well as women glittered with diamonds . Coats were embroidered with flowers of diamonds ; buttons were formed of huge diamonds valued at immense sum* swordhilts and plumes were covered with them ; and Russian princes and nobles , when they visited foreign courts , were known by the glitter of their countless diamonds and the barbaric lustre of their gorgeous attire . Tsarsko - selo , the summer palace of the Czars , was situated on a pleasant plain , amidst woods and hills , about eighteen miles from St. Petersburg . Begun by Catherine I. , it was completed by the second Catherine , and its vast size and costly magnificence more than equaled the wildest dreams of the Arabian romancers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment in honor of Prince Henry of Prussia , the most splendid the world has ever seen . At night the empress , the grand-duke , Prince Henry , and other members of the court set out from St. Petersburg in a sledge drawn by sixteen horses , and inclosed on all sides by double glasses , which allowed them a clear view of the striking scenes outside . They were followed by two thousand other sledges , all filled with the invited guests , who were masked , and either in domino or dressed in fancy costume . The road was illuminated by long rows of colored lamps . At every verst , or three-quarters of a mile , a triumphal arch of glittering lights , a pyramid of lamps , or a brilliant display of fire-works arrested the attention ; and by its side , at similar intervals , elegant temporary villas had been erected , in which the country people , dressed as she.pherds and shepherdesses , or in some gay costume , were seen dancing and feasting as if the whole world was in a revel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the woods , appeared a huge artificial mountain , representing . Vesuvius in eruption , whose f // torrents of flame lighted up the way until the gay company had passed within the enchanted groves and gardens that surrounded Tsarskoselo . Eight thousand guests ascended the marble staircase of the palace , and scarcely filled its vast range of apartments . Ten thousand waxlights flashed down upon the magnificent furniture and the jeweled dresses of the assembled throng . It was a scene of wild and barbaric splendor . The maskers represented every nation and every age . Cossacks , Chinese , Turks , Persians , and Armenians performed their national dances and preserved their borrowed characters . The long rows of masked visages , the bushy beards , the grotesque dresses , and the animation of the maskers formed a spectacle that recalled the descriptions of old romances of fairy festivals and magic realms . The dance continued for two hours . Suddenly a discharge of cannon was heard . Every light was at once extinguished , and the company crowded to the windows of the palace* . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole front of the palace was illuminated by a grand display of fire-works , where all the tints of the rainbow were emulated by a quick succession of various devices . There were great battles and victories related in lines of fire ; pictures of vanquished Turks and flying Tartars ; the glory of Catherine embodied in striking emblems ; sieges and naval contests written in green , red , and gold ; and a rain of rockets that eclipsed the stars and moon . The cannon sounded again , the candles were as suddenly relighted , and a banquet was . found laid out for the guests where the wines of the South and the fruits of the tropics were profusely mingled with the products of the Northern clime . At these entertainments Catherine usually wore a robe of green silk or velvet , the Russian national color . Her hair was slightly powdered . She wore a crown of the rarest diamonds . The stars of the orders of St. George and St. Andrew appeared upon her shoulder . She passed around the rooms leaning upon the arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those around her . Her countenance was calm , her manner self-possessed , and not the most acute observer could detect in her wellordered looks the terrible secrets , the fierce ambition , the boundless regret that now lurked in the hidden places of that seared and blighted heart . Her passions were her tyrants . She was the slave of demons that would never suffer her to escape . Neither philosophy nor religion came to her rescue . The peace of self-approbation she could never have known ; and she lived and died in the fierce excitement of wild and hopeless desire . Ambition for herself and for her country was no doubt her ruling motive . For herself she longed to shine in the eyes of her contemporaries ; to be spoken of with terror and admiration in the civilized courts of the West ; to be flattered by philosophers and courted by kings ; and she evidently hoped that her name might go down to posterity as the most magnificent of empresses , and one who deserved to be looked upon as the chief founder of Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like every Russian monarch , she labored to extend the limits of her empire by force or fraud . Two grand projects she meditated upon incessantly ; they were the moving springs of all her public policy . One was to appropriate a large part of unhappy roland ; the other to seize upon Constantinople . Catherine was the author of the plan for the dismemberment of Poland . In the early part of her reign she had forced the Poles to accept Stanislaus Augustus as their king , intending to govern Poland as a subject province , under the nominal rule of her favorite . But when she found that even Stanislaus refused to submit implicitly to her will , she formed the plan of dividing the Polish territory between herself and her two fellow-vultures , the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria . For this purpose she had invited Prince Henry to her court , and amidst a splendid round of balls and masks , of outward gayety and careless revelry , she confided to the prince the outlines of her project . This grave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of balls and entertainments as solemn and almost as silent as a ghost , had been charged by Frederick the Great with a special mission to Catherine . Henry was the second best gcneral of the age . He had shared in all the terrible campaigns of Frederick , and was inferior in renown only to his imperious brother . But he was his brother 's slave , and performed with abject fidelity his most i*ifamous commands . It was agreed that Poland was to be dismembered and almost blotted from the list of nations . Prussia was to have Dantzic and its neighborhood ; Russia was to engross a still larger share ; and the Emperor of Austria , Joseph II. , was induced to join the unscrupulous confederacy . Catherine had not entered upon this ungenerous design without some appearance of justice . The folly or madness of the Poles hastened their own destruction . Poland had long been divided into a great number of religious sects . The Catholics , the Greek Church , Protestantism , Socinianism , and various other forms of belief disturbed the peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of the government , when , unhappily , the Roman Catholics gained the ascendency , and commenced a general persecution of all who differed from them . The result was violent internal disputes and a fearful scene of anarchy . Catherine fomented the civil war . Her armies entered the country under pretext of protecting the " Dissidents , " as the Protestant dissenters were called ; the Catholics imprudently persisted in their violence , and the religious war raged with unabated fury . Poland , too , had for many ages been the enemy // and sometimes the scourge of Russia . The Russians asserted that the territory they DOW proposed to seize had been ravished from their ancestors ; while the Poles contended that the ancient Russian princes had been the subjects of Poland. * Prussia made a similar claim with the Russians . The Poles had no doubt overrun and conquered Prussia , as well as Russia , in early ages ; and Frederick now professed only to demand what was his by right of inheritance . It is not my design to narrate the Polish wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three great empires and the madness of its Catholic prelates , who called in the aid of the Turks . Its gallant struggle for freedom was in vain . Kosciusko , its last hero , was defeated under the walls of Warsaw , and in October , 1795 , Poland ceased to exist . Catherine saw with singular exultation the progress of her empire toward the heart of Europe . She had baffled the intrigues of France , the hatred of England . Russia was moving westward . Who could say where its proud course should cease ? Was Europe to become Cossack ? Had she not made Russia the peer of France , England , Austria ? Was not her empire , which had once been so despised , now not only European , but almost the master of European politics ? But dear as had ever been her ambitions project of placing her barbarous Russia among the first-class powers of Europe , there was one other design upon which she dwelt with even greater enthusiasm . The Russians , from the time of Rurik , have fixed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his follower and scholar Karamsin , relate that one of the first expeditious of the Varangian masters of Kief was against the Byzantine empire . Constantinople , however , conquered the Russians by a gift of Christianity and knowledge . The descendants of Rurik intermarried with the Byzantine emperors . " The Russians are our friends , " exclaimed the historian Photius . Greek intelligence spread among the Sciavonic tribes . Russia became almost a Greek province ; and the Russians came to consider as a part of themselves and of their own possessions the faded magnificence of Constantinople * its holy fane of St. Sophia ; its churches hallowed by the splendid ritual of their common faith and the presence of the patriarch of the East ; its emperors , who in their low estate still looked upon the barbarous kings of France and Germany as their inferiors , and shrank from their alliance as a degradation , while they were thenear connections of the Russian dukes ; and in this unity- of faith and feeling the Russians had become insensibly linked to the destinies of Constantinople . That city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their countless priests , monks , and nobles taught their subject people to look to the Byzantine capital with a superstitious love and veneration . In a moment this natural sentiment was fearfully shocked and outraged . The home of their religious masters was overwhelmed in a horrible fate . The wild , irresistible Ottomans , slaves of the hated crescent , intruded themselves between Russia and its religious centre , struck down the Greek , the Sclave , the European , and captured Constantinople . The holy city was profaned and defiled by the Tartar horde . St. Sophia 's venerable shrine became a mosque . The Greek Church was pillaged of its possessions ; its priests , monks , and nuns sold into slavery ; its ancient splendors forever torn away ; and when the Greek population returned to their native city they found themselves fallen to the condition of slaves , and objects of insult and contempt to the coarse and hostile Turk . Every day they were subject to the vilest injuries , and every hour they were made to feel the horrors of their doom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menaced Russia in the moment of its feebleness , and terrified Europe . A succession of vigorous sultans and viziers made the Ottoman Empire , in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , irresistible . The Greek population through all the isles and shores of Grebce wept in chains , and felt that for them there was no hope . The Greek Church , still the faith of the larger part of the people of European Turkey , mourned by the rivers its captivity , and believed that its day of glory was forever gone . For where could it turn for aid ? The Turk abhorred and persecuted it ; the Pope looked coldly on its woes ; the most Christian King of France was an ally of the sultan , Soliman the Great ; and the grand-dukes of Russia , its only faithful friends , were the semi-barbarous rulers of a divided people . The hope of the Greek Church came from the decline of the Turkish vigor and the rapid rise of Russia under the Romanoff dynasty . After the death of Soliman the Great the Ottoman Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of a vast subject population , began necessarily to decay ; it had no internal resources to recruit its powers , and it never assimilated the Greek population to itself . Russia meanwhile grew in strepgth , and began to venture to lift its arm against Turkey . Peter the Great came , and the contest was not unequal . Yet when , in the opening of her reign , Catherine ventured to dream of the conquest of Constantinople , the Turks were still a mighty people , covered by the renown of a hundred victories , while the Russians had yet to win a name among the conquering nations of Europe . Catherine 's design was singularly popular with the Russians . No nation is more religious than they . Even in the present day , strangers who ride in omnibuses in St. Petersburg are surprised , every now and then , to see their companions bowing and crossing themselves , and even muttering a short prayer , as * See Chev* , fist . de Ia Pologne , I. p. 53 et 8eq . Schuitaler , Inst. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // they pass by a church or a holy painting ; and no house in the capital , not even those of the foreign residents , is thought complete or safe to live in without a picture of a saint before which burns the ever-lighted lamp . Throughout the provinces superstition is still stronger ; the priests , the monks , the smoky picture , the patron saint , are reverenced in every cottage and every palace ; and the religious sentiment governs Russia , notwithstanding its numerous sects , with unrivaled power . Hatred to the Turks has ever been a part of the Russian faith . They have sympathized with their Greek brethren in their bondage , and have lamented the fall of the metropolis of their Church . Constantinople , to them , is not only a splendid city , or a favorable port for Russian commerce , but it is the ancient seat of Christianity enslaved by a band of infidels ; the natural centre of a great Greek population ravished from them by the spoiler . It is not ambition , but justice and duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks . It is a holy war , which can never end until the hated race shall have been driven back to its deserts , and St. Sophia once more resounds with the musical liturgy of the Greeks . Catherine seized upon this prevailing sentiment , and used it to confirm her unstable throne . Yet she began the contest with considerable distrust . The Turks , indeed , first declared war against Russia , incited by the intrigues of France , and by the solicitation of the Polish Catholics ; and immense hosts of infidels appeared on the borders of Russia , and seemed to defy the efforts of the best Russian commanders . But very soon the internal weakness of Turkey began to appear . Romauzoff ? , the hero of the war , defeated , in 1770 , an army of 80,000 Turks . An army of 150,000 men , led by the grand vizier , threw themselves upon the victorious Russians ; Romanzofl with only 18,000 , charged them with bayonets , and drove them , broken and routed , from the field . The Turks now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one , before the active Russians . A still more fatal blow , meantime , had fallen upon the Ottoman power . Catherine , with her usual foresight , had resolved to attack the enemy in the Grecian seas . The dockyards of Archangel , Cronstadt , and Reval resounded with her naval preparations . A fleet of twenty sail of the line was built ; the sailors were trained upon the Northern seas ; able English officers entered the Russian navy , and lent their aid in making Russia a maritime power ; and , to the astonishment of Europe , the powerful Russian fleet , commanded by Admiral Spiridoff , but in fact controlled by Alexey Orloff set sail from the Baltic for the Mediterranean , and was soon engaged in exciting to revolt the isles and continent of Greece . Once more Catherine had startled Western Europe by a display of unexampled energy . Never before had a Russian fleet been seen in the Mediterranean . A fierce battle took place ( 1770 ) between the Turkish and the Russian navies among the isles of Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , attacked the ship of Admiral Spiridoff . The vessels came alongside of each other , and poured upon each other an incessant fire . A rain of cannon-shot and grenades swept the decks , but neither side would yield . At length the Sultan took fire ; the Russian ship was unable to disengage itself , and both blew up together . The commanders and a few officers alone escaped . The Turks continued to fight the Russians all day with desperate courage , and at evening entered the narrow bay of Tschesme . Here , the next night , the English officers of the Russian fleet sent in fire-ships among them ; Lieutenant Dugdale himself fastened a fire-ship to one of the Turkish vessels ; the fleet , crowded together in a narrow space , was soon in flames , and before morning the Turkish navy was perfectly destroyed . Catherine 's towering ambition might well have been satisfied with the renown of her victories by sea and land . Turkey , once so terrible , lay almost at her mercy . In her exultation she rewarded Alexey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now perfectly assured . Her people looked upon her with reverence and pride . Foreign nations courted and feared her . Her great name overshadowed Europe , and if , after all , she did not win Constantinople , she obtained possession of the Crimea , and opened the path which must surely lead the Russians to the Byzantine capital . Nearly a hundred years have passed since her famous victories . Turkey has been saved by the interference of the united powers of the West . Yet it will probably be a happy day for millions of subject Greeks when the Russian standards float over the walls of Constantinople . Catherine 's life was one of ceaseless labor . She rose at six both in winter and summer , she always retired to her room at ten . Her day was chiefly passed in her own apartments , at her desk , or in consultations with her trusted counselors . She planned her own military expeditions , and attended to the internal regulations of her vast empire . She sent out scientific men to explore her distant territories , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of Bering Strait . She founded schools and charitable institutions , and looked with pity on the sufferings of the poor . She planned a vast scheme of internal improvement ; built canals , roads , and bridges in various parts of the empire ; reformed the laws of the nation ; enforced justice ; protected , when she could not emancipate , the serf ; recommended morality ; was assiduous in her religious observances ; and filled all Europe with the fame of her liberality and beneficence . Yet there were moments when Catherine must have felt how giddy was that splendid eminence upon which she had placed herself , and when the anticipated pains of deposition , shame , and death drove her to remorseless deeds of // cruelty and crime . At such moments no fear of infamy , no sentiment of pity , moved her from her fearful design . She crushed the feeble pretenders to her throne with relentless hand . She pursued them to their deaths with a malignity full of fraud and vindictiveness . Yet , in this respect , was she more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , or Mary , the assassin of her husband ; than Henry VIII. , or Louis XIV. ? The two most noted victims of Catherine 's jealous tyranny were Prince Ivan III . and the fair Princess TarrakanQff . Built upon an island in the midst of the Neva , about forty miles from St. Petersburg , stands the famous fortress of Schlusselburgh , the Bastile of Russia . Its walls are fifty feet high , of stone and brick , and within it are rows of horrible cells and dungeons , in which the miserable captives live in a kind of twilight gloom . Here Maria , the sister , and Eudocia , the first wife of Peter the Great , were confined ; and here the unhappy Prince Ivan lingered for twenty-three years , until put to death by the orders of Catherine . Ivan was descended from the elder halfbrother of Peter the Great . When an infant he was raised to the throne , from whence he was deposed by one of those sudden revolutions so common in Russia , and passed the remainder of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russias , the miserable youth was subjected to barbarities seldom equaled. lie was confined in a subterranean vault , from which the light of day was carefully excluded . He knew no difference between day and night . his guards were forbidden to speak to him , and he grew up without any intercourse with his fellowmen . He was never taught to read and write ; his mind was purposely enfeebled ; and , like Casper Hauser , his utterance was defective , and he seems to have become , in the gloom of his dreadful dungeon , a wretched imbecile . At least his persecutors spreadthe most degrading reports concerning his mental condition , and it was said that he was at times a raving lunatic , ferocious as a savage . But during all these long years of imprisonment the memory of the unfortunate young Czar seems still to have been cherished by the Russians , and many knew that there was shut up in the gloomy walls of the castle a prisoner who was entitled to sit on the throne of Russia . Conspiracies were formed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherii*e , alarmed for her own safety , placed two officers in Ivan 's cell , with orders to put him to death in case of an insurrection . The moment for the execution of this barbarous order soon came . A plot was formed to set Ivan free and place him on the throne ; the conspirators had obtained admission to the castle , and were hastening toward the prince 's chamber , when the two assassins attacked Ivan , and notwithstanding his cries for mercy , and his vain struggles , pierced him with many wounds . The body of Ivan was the next day exposed before the church in the castle of Schlusselburgh , and im mense crowds of people , full of pity and indignation , came from St. Petersburg and the neighboring country to weep over his remains . The assassins fled in a ship to Denmark , to escape the rage of their countrymen , b*ut were afterward amply rewarded and praised by the empress , and the death of her hapless rival seemed to complete Catherine 's security . The story of the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the miserable Ivan . She was the daughter of the Empress Elizabeth by a clandestine marriage . Prince Radzivil , of Poland , enraged at the cruelties exercised by Catherine upon the Poles , resolved to employ the young princess , the offspring of the beloved Elizabeth , as an instrument to disturb the peaceful rule of the usurper . It is even said that lie intended to marry the princess , and he took her to Rome to educate her under his own care . But Catherine , who was informed by her spies of all that happened in foreign courts , soon discovered the plans of Prince Radzivil . She at once confiscated his estates , and reduced him to live upon the sale of his diamonds , and at length prevailed upon him , by the offer of restoring his property , to promise that he would no longer concern himself about the daughter of Elizabeth . He could not , however , be induced to betray tlle young princess into the hands of her destroyers , and a different agent was therefore employed . Alexey Orloff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fearful ornaments of Catherine 's court . He was a savage , uneducated , coarse , insolent , and vain . His strength was enormous . He crushed pieces of iron or glass in his hand without an effort . He broke an apple in two with his fingers . His conscience was seared , and he is said to have boasted openly of his murder of Peter , and to have described minutely the manne* in which it was done before a large company . Yet the terrible power which Alexey had gained over the Empress forced her not only to tolerate his society , but to cover him with honors and emoluments . He shone in all her court entertainments at the head of the Russian nobles . He had been placed in command of the Mediterranean fleet , and to him the empress attributed all the glory of its success , which was in fact due to the English officers . Catherine gave him the title of Tschesmiaski . She presented him with a magnificent palace of Tschesme , which she had built for him near her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest order of knighthood , and foreign embassadors who came to pay their court to the empress saw the murderer of her husband always at her side . It was to this monster , who was cunning as well as brutal , that Catherine committed the duty of decoying the Princess Tarrakanoff within reach of her vengeance . Attended by a single domestic , her only friend , the princess was now living in poverty at Rome , the desertion of Prince Radzivil having left her quite alone , Here she was visited by a Neapolitan , Ribas , an p // emissary of Orloff , who pretended a deep concern for her misfortunes , and even supplied her with money when she was in great necessity . The princess was scarcely sixteen . She was innocent and trustful , and she soon learned to look upon Ribas as her benefactor and a preserver sent to her from Heaven . Her female attendant was also won by the arts of the betrayer ; and nothing can be more touching than the spectacle of these two hapless women falling a prey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ribas proceeded a step farther in his plan . He told the princess that he was commissioned by Count Alexey Orloff to offer her the Russian crown . He said that the Russians were discontented with Catherine 's rule ; that OrloW particularly , was incensed nt her ingratitude ; and that if the princess would accept his services and reward him by the gift of her hand , he could easily place her upon the throne of Russia , amidst the general joy of the people . This brilliant hope of a relief from her present sufferings. , so unlooked for and so imposing , filled the imagination of the poor young girl , and led her into an excess of confidence . Already she saw herself an empress . From miserable poverty and dependence she was suddenly to be raised to the splendors of a throne . The vision , which had been first presented to her fancy by Prince Radzivil , was now about to be realized , nor did it seem improbable that the daughter of Elizabeth would be more acceptable to the Russians than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approach of her benefactor , Orloff . He came covered with the renown of his late victories . He threw himself at the feet of the princess , and professed the deepest love and admiration for her ; and he soon won her heart , and she loved him with sincere affection . In vain did several persons , who saw through his evil designs , endeavor to persuade the princess of the danger of confiding in him . She only repeated what they said to OrlotI and gave him a new opportunity of showing his rare address by defending himself against their calumnies . He now urged their marriage , and the day was appointed for it solemnization . Th&amp; ceremony was to be performed according to the Greek ritual ; and Orloff employed several of his dependents to disguise themselves as priests and lawyers , and thus desecrate the holy rite . The murderer of Peter feared neither God nor man . The princess now appeared every where in Italy as the wife of Orloff . He treated her with studious attention . Her love and trust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touching faith that contrasts strangely with the murderous duplicity of the man she loved . When he urged upon her the necessity of their leaving Rome , in order to carry out their project of dethroning Catherine in some less conspicuous city , she said that she would follow him wherever he went . lie brought her to Pisa and lodged her in a magnificent palace ; but when she went to a play or any public place he always accompanied her himself . He scarcely suffered her to go out of his sight , and was fearful that his victim might yet be ravished from him . The plot was now drawing toward a successful close . A division of th' Russian fleet had entered the port of Leghorn , and Orloff pretended that it was necessary for him to go thither ; he offered to take the princess with him , and she gladly consented to go . She was eager to see the famous city , but , above all , to look upon the stately ships of her native land . Upon their arrival at Leghorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ladies of his family , and was received every where with great distinction , as the daughter of an empress and the wife of Count Orloff . A little court gathered around her , anxious to fulfill her slightest wish . The people thronged to see her as she passed through the streets . Balls and entertainments were given in her honor ; and the unhappy girl was plunged in a round of gayety and excitement in which she almost seemed an empress indeed . So wholly unconscious was she of treachery and danger that she at length asked to be shown the Russian fleet . Orloff consented , and gave the necessary orders . The next day , when they rose from the table , they went down to the water-side , where a boat , with a magnificent awning , had been prepared for the princess . She entered , followed by a party of ladies and the English consul . Orloff went in a second boat , accompanied by Admiral Greig ; and a third , filled with English and Russian officers , closed the procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharves : to witness the novel spectacle . As the boats approached the fleet the princess was received with salutes of artillery. ; a band of music played the national airs , and loud huzzas rang through the crowded vessels . Never was there a more inspiring welcome ; and as the princess approached the vessel she was to enter , a chair , splendidly adorned , was let down from the side , and when she alighted on deck it was observed that she was received by the Russian officers with all the honors due to her exalted rank . But in a moment she was seized and handcuffed . Vainly she implored the mercy* of him whom she still called her husband ; vainly did she throw herself at his feet and cover them with her tears . Orloff refused even to reply to her touching lamentations . She was carried down into the hold of the vessel , and the next day set sail , a prisoner in irons , for Russia . On reaching St. Petersburg the unhappy priacess was shut up in Schlusselburgh , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known certainly how she died ; but it is said that after six years ' imprisonment the waters of the Neva , in the disastrous inundation of 1771 , swept over the island of Schiussel // burgh and ended the sufferings of the royal prisoner . Catherine , meantime , showed no trace , in her outward bearing , of the cares and terrors of her lofty station . She still appeared among the ladies of her court with an air of dignity that , even in the plainest dress , would have marked her as their chief . Her look spoke authority and command . Her brown hair , her large blue eyes , her fair complexi.n , her graceful arm and hand , her well-rounded form , seemed untouched by time . Her dress was usually plain , except on solemn festivals , when her head and corset were covered with diamonds . She seemed courteous , gentle , beneficent , and was outwardly devout ; and strangers who visited her court were charmed by her easy dignity and native grace . Yet there was scarcely a moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her mind ; and had she forgotten him , a succession of impostors who assumed his name and endeavored to shake her power must have recalled him both to the nation and'the empress . The most successful of these was Pugatcheff . He was a Cossack who had been a common soldier in the army , but who bore a striking resemblance to Peter III . Russia at this time abounded in heretics or separatists , particularly among the Cossack hordes , who professed to hold a purer faith than that of the established priesthood , and who desired to restore the national church to its early simplicity . To these reformers Pugatcheff addressed himself , lie declared that he was the lost emperor , Peter III. , who had escaped from his murderers ; that the *ause of his deposition and imprisonment had been his zeal for religious reform ; and that he was come to lead his faithful Cossacks to the deliverance of the Church and the overthrow of their persecutors . A wild religious enthusiasm spread through the brave but ignorant hordes from the Caspian to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian commanders . Catherine might well tremble for her uncertain throne . All Southern Russia was overrun by the rebels , and even Moscow , never well-affected toward the empress , seemed about to fall into their hands . The impostor gave liberty to the serfs , and wherever his armies came the nobles were murdered by their slaves , who flocked to the banners of Peter III . A great reward was offered for Pugatcheff 's head , yet among all his wild followers not one would betray him . He was at last defeated by his own imprudence ( 1774 ) , and brought in an iron cage to Moscow , where he was put to death . It is believed that the impostor was an instrument in the hands of a large party of the priests and the nobility , and that Catherine prudently concealed from the nation the names of those who were the authors of the design . From this time Catherine reigned almost undisturbed-the mistress of the North . Good fortune attended all her enterprises . She waged another war with Turkey , and wrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible tranquillity . Her wonderful intellect seemed to expand in grandeur as her power increased . When the American Revolution broke out her sympathies were plainly with our forefathers , and she was among the first of the European powers to welcome the ships of the new-born nation to the free traffic of the seas . Much to the displeasure of the English Government , she opened her ports to the flag of the revolted colonists . But she also aimed a still more vigorous blow against the naval supremacy of England . She invented the scheme of an armed neutrality , and enforced the principle that free ships make free goods . Denmark , Sweden , Prussia , Austria , and even Portugal accepted her amendment to the maritime law , and thus Catherine has the merit of having made a valuable improvement in the code of nations . She recommended to her subjects perfect religious toleration , and all the various sects lived together under her equitable sway in perfect amity . The Catholics threw aside their exclusiveness , the Calvinists and the Ludierans their terror of popery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the harsh note of religious controversy was never heard . On the day when she blessed the waters of the Neva the empress gave to the clergy of all denominations an entertainment which she called the dinner of toleration . At the head of the bountiful table presided Gabriel , Archbishop of Novgorod and St. Petersburg , with the graceful and hospitable manner so common to the Russian noble . Around him the highest dignitaries of the Greek Church were mingled with the pastors of the Protestant congregations and the priests of the Catholic faith . A Jesuit took wine with the Dutch Reformed minister ; a Greek pope conversed freely with a Lutheran divine . When different wines were served around on the same salver , the archbishop said , pleasantly , in allusion to the occasion : " These wines are all good ; they differ only in color and taste ; " and at the close of the repast he repeated , in a clear voice , " Glory to God in the highest , on earth peace and goodwill to men . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian , French , German , and Latin were heard out all sides ; and the good-humored clergy ever retained a pleasing recollection of the dinner of toleration . The lesson which Catherine taught might well be studied in every land . Let us , by all means , give dinners of toleration . " On the darker shades of Catherine 's character I do not propose to dwell . Let her errors be buried with her . They certainly brought with them their own fearful retribution . Prince Gregory Orlofl her favorite for many years , and the chief author of her greatness , died , in 1784 , a raving madman , the victim of remorse . The bleeding shade of the murdered Peter III . followed him wherever he went ; terrified him 7 / // in horrible visions at night , and seemed constantly to threaten him with avenging darts . Orloff sometimes sunk into silent melancholy , and then broke out into wild shouts of insane merriment . He heaped curses and wild reproaches upon Catherine fearful to listen to , and which seemed to plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince fled to Moscow , and died in unspeakable agony . Deep as had been Catherine 's depression , she soon rose above it again , and plunged into business and dissipation . So long as the crescent waved over the Golden Horn , her life could never want an object . Her fierce ambition was easily fired , and her courtiers never ceased to point it toward Constantinople . Potemkin , her new favorite , led her armies against the Turks with various success ; but still the glittering prize remained unwon . The jealousy of the Western powers , and the obstinate courage of the Turks , defeated her design of placing her grandson , Constantine , on the Byzantine throne . Potemkin , meantime , raised by the favor of his sovereign from a low station , became the most magnificent subject in Europe . A giant in size and strength , half savage , half human , he astonished his age by his boundless extravagance and his unlimited power . Catherine alone could hold his savage nature in check . His intellect was vigorous , although uncultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight over the clear portraits and stately characters of Plutarch . He was accused of having been present at the murder of Peter , but he always denied it . At length his mighty frame gave way , destroyed by its own wild passions . He died in 1791 . Catherine buried him at Kherson , and raised a magnificent mausoleum over his remains . Age had now come upon her , death was drawing near , yet never was she more busy . She seemed to seek oblivion of the past in the exercise of her boundless power . She seized upon Couriand and annexed it to her empire . She overran a part of Persia . She concluded a treaty of alliance with Austria and England , by which Turkey was to be conquered and made Russian . The Greeks were eagerly awaiting her coming to rise against the hated Turk ; the empire of Constantine and of Justinian was to be revived in unexampled splendor by the mistress of the icy North ; and Catherine was the most successful and the most powerful sovereign that had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last grand scheme of ambition she died , on the morning of November 6 , 1796 . She arose in her usual excellent health , and took a cup of coffee . She then retired to her closet . Her women found her , about half an hour afterward , lying speechless on the floor . She never spoke again , although she lived until ten o'clock the next evening . It is sometimes said that Catherine - was as fortunate in her death as in her life ; yet who can tell what thoughts rushed to her active brain during that long period of humiliating weakness ! She saw , perhaps , the whole vision of her by-gone life in strange and startling distinctness . She was again the kind , the pure , the generous Sophia of Zerbst , full of the hallowed impulses of a spotless youth . Once more the venerable Lutheran pastor pointed out to her the way to eternal bliss ; once more she shrank with prophetic terror from the dazzling hope of an earthly crown . Again she was loved , wooed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then came the reign of passion , ambition , crime . She had murdered him who once loved her , but whom she had irrevocably estranged ; and the diamond crown of all the Russias glittered above her uneasy brow . The shade of Peter next passed slowly , with sad eyes , before her speechless form . Then came the mournful Ivan , showing his gaping wounds . Then the young daughter of Elizabeth , groveling at the feet of Orloff , her betrayer ; and then a countless host of vigorous men and helpless women and children , whom Catherine 's unholy ambition had condemned to sorrow , disease , and death . Then the passions which had ruled over her like raging demons must have seemed loathsome as Spenser 's pictures ; then the spectre of Sin , beheld for the first time in its true character , must have realized Milton 's allegory ; and then the consciousness of impending death must have drawn from that shrinking spirit a wail as full of unutterable melancholy as that which Homer ascribes to the Cimmerian shades . A strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , for his wonderful mother . It was the symbol of some hidden meaning . Paul seems to have meditated in secret upon his father 's fate and his mother 's errors , and in a dim way strove to make some atonement for both . He ordered the coffin of Peter to be brought and set by the side of that of Catherine , and stretching from one to the other was a true-lover 's knot , on which was inscribed , " Divided in life ; united in death . " The imperial crown was placed on his father 's coffin . But the most striking circumstance of the ceremony was the singular punishment which Paul now inflicted upon the two surviving murderers , Alexey Orloff and Prince Baratinsky . They were forced to stand , as chief mourners , one on each side of Peter 's coffin , for three hours , in the presence of a countless throng of spectators . Alexey Orloff bore the terrible ordeal without shrinking ; but the Prince Barntinsky was overwhelmed with confusion and remorse , and could scarcely be kept from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime , the two conspirators , after more than thirty years , looked once more upon the remains of him whom they had so cruelly murdered , and were pointed out to all Russia as the assassins of the Czar . They were then banished from the court , but received no other punishment . Such was the end of Sophia of Zerbst , and of that fatal marriage by which she became the mightiest monarch of her time .
