txt The proposal by Mr. MONTGOMERY , of Pennsylvania , for a temporary organization of the House , for the-purpose of voting money to pay the Government contractors , appears on the face of it to be illegal , or at all events , unprecedented , and we presume therefore it will not be entertained . But we must say we can not help regretting that it is not feasible and will not be adopted . If a Speaker could be elected and hold office just long enough to enable the House to vote the supplies for the coming year , we do not believe the people would trouble themselves much about its doings afterwards . The appropriations made , it would no doubt instantly veer to the old occupation of discussing Slavery , the political antecedents of the members , and HELPER 'S book , and would drag along through the remainder of the session almost unnoticed . The only thing which causes anybody now to devote any attention to the dreary columns of verbiage and vituperation which the telegraph forwards us every day from Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances of an organization , or of the person likely to be elected Speaker . But if the hope , as well as the pressing necessity of having a Speaker at all , were once past , the number of those who would find any time for their perusal would be exceedingly small , and the members of the House would return to the homes at the ' proper period without exciting either attention or remark . In other words , we think that the only good purpose which the House can serve just now , is to provide for the payment of the public debts , and the less it does beside this the hater for the nation . We do not need its speeches to throw light on any public question . The day has gone by when debates did much to remove doubts , or convey information , and owing to the temper of its members , the debates of the present Congress are less likely to serve these , or any other useful purposes than those of any deliberative body , present or past , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we certainly do not need , and hope we shall not be treated to a particle of it . We have already had a vast deal too much of the kind of legislation which this Congress is alone likely to afford us . It would be hard to mention a single public interest , which the Congress would not do well to let severely alone . The only questions which are likely to be made the subject of its action , are the Tariff and Slavery . As to the Tariff , there are few intelligent men who are not satisfied that the continued attempts made to tinker and change and remodel it , are productive of most mischievous uncertainty , insecurity , and derangement of business , and ire a most unfair interference with vested interests . hat the public wants most of all in a tariff , is tolerable immunity against sudden change , and to this desirable consummation Congress is the greatest obstacle . As to Slavery , it is hardly necessary to remind our readers that almost all our present troubles are due to legislation on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to it , we should no doubt be at this moment dwelling in the most perfect harmony and unity . The troubles , and alarms , and apprehensions from which we are suffering , are due mainly to legislation . The shortest and most cursory examination will convince any dispassionate man that no act can be passed in the present House of Representatives in any way affecting Slavery , either in the States or Territories , which will not increase the existing irritation , and lay the foundation of new griefs hereafter . There is no other political subject with which the House has power to deal , on which we stand in need of its action . The Mexican question needs only the action of the Senate . The President can get along another year without summary power to declare war against Spanish-American Republics . California can certainly wait a little for the Pacific Railroad . The San Juan difficulty is settled . Our relations with all European Powers are amicable . The Senate is organized and ready to Resist the President in discharging the Executive duties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are cared for by the State Legislatures . What good reason is there for the House remaining in session one minute longer than the appropriations require ,  --  and is it not a pity that a Speaker can not be chosen temporarily for that purpose ? The mutual recrimination and exposures in which members are now indulging , can appear in the columns of local newspapers just as well as in the Globe . Mr. CLARK need not wait in Washington to let the world know his opinion of HELPER 'S book ; Mr. DAVIS , of Indiana , can deny . his indorsement of the Dred Scot decision in his own State ; Mr. REAGAN can denounce the Republican Party in Texas ; and , in fact , every member in the House can ventilate his opinions through the Press much better than on his legs , without the risk of personal collision , with which their present mode of debating is attended . If this view of the case does not find favor with the House , and it obstinately refuses to pay the public creditors and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other mode of passing the time , for debates on Slavery and personal explanations . The Slavery question , in all its bearings , is discussed in the newspapers far better than members of Congress can do it , and personal explanations , when costing some thousands of dollars a week , are too expensive a luxury , however interesting they might be if we got them for nothing . Why not have readings from the poets occasionally , and discussions upon moral and scientific subjects , or in. fact on any sub .. ject about which our information is stilt imperfect ? Verses , composed by members over night , anecdotes of celebrated men , imitations of the cries of wild animals , and curious facts about their habits ; sketches of manners and character in the various Congressional districts , or even horrible accounts of the barbarous condition of the negroes in their own country , Nvould form a pleasing daily entertainment , and might be enlivened by egg-nogg , much more appropriately than the present performances .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
