ARTICLE P1. - MR . MITCHELL 'S NOVEL , " DR . JOHNS . " Dr. Johns ; being a Narrative of Certain Events in tke Life of an Orthodo*e ( ongregational Minister of Connecticut . By DONALD G. MITCHELL , author of " Reveries ot a Bachebr ; " " Dream Life ; " " My Farm at Edgewood , " etc . In two vols. l2mo . OUR English literature is peculiarly rich , especially at the present day , in the department of novels . The fame of De Foe and Fielding was obscured by the brilliant impression made by Sir Walter Scott ; yet those writers have merits so decided , that were it not for the taint of indecency that defiles their writings , they would forever retain their popularity among the classics of the language . Scott in his turn is eclipsed by Dickens and Thackeray , not to speak of numerous others of less renown . It may seem strange to persons old enough to have been the contemporaries of Scott , yet it is nevertheless the fact , that to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient in taste and culture , the once fascinating pages of the great novelist have lost their charm . The absence in Scott of what umay be called the * ) sychological element , which forms a characteristic feature and a principal attraction of the recent novels , is not atoned for by his powers of graphic description and by his other unquestionable merits . Without doubt , the decline of his popularity is partly due to that increasing sway of democratic ideas and feelings , in consequence of which the feudal ages are no longer clothed with a romantic interest , and distinctions of rank have less and less power to dazzle the imagination . The delineation of individual character in its growth and development forms no small part of the business of the modern novel . Among the recent works of fiction , not a few are included in the class termed by the Germans tenden2-Ponzanen-that is , novels designed to promulgate some opinion or effect some reform . It is remarkable , we may observe , that England should be the country in which the best novels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , in their mental qualities as well as in their geographical situation ; a people incapable of going out of themselves and of comprehending others . Yet , in England works of more genu1ne humor , better novels , and better dramas are produced than anywhere else . This would seem to require us to qualify the verdict commonly declared relative to the Englishman 's insular quality , and ignorance of all human nature except his own . Germany , time land of scholars and philosophers , is notoriously deficient in novels and dramatic works of high excellence . The finest plays of Goethe , Schiller , and Lessing are decidedly inferior in the distinctively dramatic element , not to speak here of general poetic merit , to the best English plays . German novels are generally dull , and frequently insipid . But it is not our design to enter into a general discussion of works of fiction , but rather to give some account of the late production of one of our own distinguished American writers , Mr. Mitchell . Dr. Johns , whose name gives the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain Mr. Johns , a youthful preacher , fresh from such a theological training as was furnished in New England forty or fifty years ago . Something is told of his boyhood , enough to make us understand that the child was fhther of the man . After having preached several discourses in the pulpit of the Congregational Church in Ashfield , Con necticut , where the opinion of Squire Elderkin , which is supported by the voice of Deacon Tourtelot , that the young candidate is a " sound sermonizer , " carries great influence , he is duly installed as pastor , and with his sweet young wife , Rachel , enters the parsonage in which the remainder of his life is to be spent . A son is born to him , an only child-Reuben . The mother dies young . Her death , and the memories connected with her , form a touching passage in the narrative . The importunities of certain parishioners , especially of IL ? ame Tourtelot , the wife of the Deacon , whose daughter . " Almiry " is of marriageable age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , but have the effect to induce the parson to procure a new housekeeper and companion , in the person of his sister , a stiff , elderly , unmarried lady , who afterwards fulfills , after her fashion , in the hospitalities of the parsonage and in the parish outside , the duties // expected of a " minister 's wife . " Little Reuben finds the chilly benevolence of this formal aunt a poor substitute for the warm and gushing sympathy of a mother 's heart . But he is partly comforted by the introduction into the family of the little girl Ad6le , the daughter of the minister 's college classmate , Maverick , who sends from France this vivacious and beautiful creature , that she may be sheltered and educated in a quiet New England home . The mystery that hangs over the domestic relations of Maverick , and over the mother of Ad6le , is a very important element in the plot of the story . The mother is living , but how and where ? Ad6le knows nothing of her , and supposes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generous-hearted boy Phil Elderkin , and his fair young sister Rose , grow up together in mutual friendship and close association . Unconsciously to all , Ad6le is awakening a feeling in the hearts of both Reuben and Frank , that may ripen into some . tfming deeper than a childish attachment , and Reuben is inspiring Rose with a like sentiment . With the relations and fortunes of these four persons , the development of the story is closely connected . Renben , a whole-souled , active , mischievour lad , finds nothing in the religions counsels of his father and aunt to meet his nature . A certain doctrinal austerity in Dr. Johns repels the son , who , nevertheless , is obliged to recognize a deep and sincere principle of godliness at the bottom of his father 's whole life . Reuben at length goes to New York , to engage in business as an assistant in an uncle 's counting-house . There , after a while , he is caught by the temptations about him , and runs a brief career of dissipation . But happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , he is moved by an aspect of Christianity which had not before been impressed upon his attention . Melted into penitence , he gives up his vices and " experiences religion . " Once more he is at the Ashfield parsonage , and engaged in the study of Divinity . But the longer he studies , the greater are the difficulties and perplexities in which he finds himself involved . His mind becomes a prey to skepticism , so that at last he throws aside his theological reading , and with it , to the great sorrow of his father , his religious professions . Before this mental change occurs , the influence going out from the freshness and // glow of his new feelings has had the effect to determine Ad6le* to a decided act of trust and of self-consecration to God . The accidental visit , and continued stay in Ashfield , of a French lady , a teacher of the French language , had been for Ad6le an event of striking significance . An intimacy had established itself between them . Maverick had wished that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom had once led him hastily to leave Ashdeld without seeing those whom he came to visit , should be prohibited , and the stranger at length took up her abode with the outcast daughter of the tavern-keeper , with one who was under the social ban of the village , as the victim of seduction and the mother of an illegitimate child . Finally , the French woman dies in the arms of Ad6le , who , with the good Dr. Johns , had called to see her at the opportune time ; and in the moment of death utters words which , in connection with other evidence , excites in the mind of Ad6le the belief that the dying stranger is her mother . It turns out that she is a sister of her mother , bearing to the latter so close a resemblance as to deceive even Maverick . The real mother , in her youth the comparatively innocent party to a guilty liai8on with Maverick , penitent for her sin , and a devout Catholic , is at length accidentally confronted with him , after so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a lawful and sacred bond , and the mother embarks for America , in order to see the long lost Ad6le , whom she loves tenderly as a daughter but looks upon as a benighted heretic . It happens that Reuben , who had resumed business and gone to Europe , is on the same vessel , and the two are brought together . As the ship draws near to port , it encounters a tempest . The wife of Maverick perishes . The life of Reuben is barely saved ; his injuries are fatal , and he is carried to his father 's home to die . In the great church of St. Peter at Rome , he had been struck by the words , %*difcczbo rn*eam* Eceleciam . " The thought of this majestic sentence , and of its historic fulfillment , fell in with a change of feeling already begun , and served to infuse a new religious faith into his heart  --  a faith independent of doctrines , and self-sustained in the seutiments of the soul . On his death-bed , this faith supports him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter on // the ground that his son 's views are not clearer on the " great scheme of the Atonement , " and on some other doctrines . The mutual love of Reuben and Ad6le finds expression ; and in this death the story reaches the tragic point . It is needless to give further details . After an interval of a few years , Frank Elderkin marries Ad6le , his long love thus gaining its reward , while his sister gives her hand to the young minister , the colleague of the venerable Doctor , who has grown old in the progress of the story . We fancy that most of Mr. Mitchell 's readers will quarrel with him for bringing his tale to this conclusion . It would seem that Frank might have been allowed to find his consolation and his happiness elsewhere ; and what we are told of the young minister will scarcely leave the reader satisfied with this disposition of Rose . The author might at least have raised up Reuben to health by some marvelous remedy , and then have made him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this entertaining story . It contains not a few genuine strokes of humor and pathos . The interest of the tale constantly increases to the close , the latter half being much more effective than the beginning . In general the characters are skillfully delineated . In particular is this true of Dr. Johns himself ; Reuben , and Ad6le , the persons in whom the charm of the story chiefly centres . It is a work the artistic merits of which deserve much commendation . There is another point of view from which this work must be considered . It proposes to be a picture of social life in a New england town , and especially of the religion and religious teaching of New England . Dr. Johns is a Congregational minister who is presented to us as he appeared in the family , in the pulpit , and among his people ; the scene of the story is a Connecticut parish . We are called upon to judge of the fairness of the picture which is here drawn of our New England life . The tone of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper place is given to Christ in the development of a religious life , and a due impression is made in respect to the value and supreme necessity of religious trust . Nor is there a failure to appreciate certain excellent features in that type of piety which the author attributes to the principal character in the story . The reader is made to feel that // Dr. Johns has " the root of the matter in him . " His prayers come from a deep place , and move the heart of every listener . The seriousness , the fidelity , the unvarying consistency , the self-abnegation of his character , are shown to extort the respect of those who find in him little else to applaud . His parsonage , even after the angular Aunt Eliza takes the place of the gentle and loving Rachel , proves a safe home for Ad6le , and neither author nor reader finds fault with the worldly-wise Maverick for choosing for his daughter this place , as one well fitted to guard her simplicity and truthfulness , and unfold her mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's description of the minister and the parish of Ashfield , it is evident that he looks with no little repugnance upon many of the religious and social characteristics which he undertakes to portray . He considers the Ashfield type of Christianity , and the ways *nd manners engendered by it , as narrow and austere . " Rigid " is a word of very frequent occurrence on his pages . Dr. Johns is rigid , his conceptions of Christian truth are rigid , his theory of life is rigid , his sister is rigid , his parish is rigid , and , in short , everything about the religion of Ashfield is repulsively rigid . An ungenial rigor prevails in the atmosphere of the place . The preaching is metaphysical . Religious feeling must submit to flow in doctrinal moulds , and is suspected if it do not run in the wonted channels . Roman Catholics are regarded as no better than pagan idolaters . Transgressors are dealt with in a spirit too little compassionate , and the sins of the parent , in some cases , bring contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a suspicious eye , especially such as afford most pleasure . Aunt Eliza is filled with pious horror when six or eight young people , casually assembled in Squire Elderkin 's parlor , spend an evening hour in dancing . Not unfrequently under sanctimonious manners and religious professions , there lurk an unpleasant amount of worldly shrewdness , a keenness in driving a bargain that goes to the very verge of honesty , and a hard , unsparing temper towards the poor , which is the more intense if their poverty is connected with imprudence . Perhaps the leading counts in this quct8i indictment of New England parochial life may be put under three heads . The // first is the obtruding of doctrines , or formal , technical statements of Christian truth , such as are wrought out by the understanding , in places where they do not belong . Thus a logical , cold , dry cast is given to the warm and living verities of the Gospel . Occasionally our author seems to find fault with the truth itself which underlies the dogma , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in other cases , the teaching , which he impliedly censures , is substantially conformed to the general creed of Christendom . If the New England preacher is condemned , the Anglican and Romanist fall under the same condemnation , and this lights at last upon Scripture itself . It is surely no fault if Dr. Johns , and such as he , give reality and practical force to an article of ' common belief . The main thing which excites repugnance is not , however , the doctrine , so much as the obtruding of it , in its theological form , beyond its proper sphere . The second blemish in Ashfield Christianity is nearly related to the foregoing . It may be described as a general lack of sentiment . The aesthetic and poetical side of nature and life is a sealed book . The mind is schooled to exclusively practical views . Some of the finer instincts of nature are stunted in their growth . A warm and catholic sympathy with human nature in its infinite varieties of innocent manifestation is wanting . The failings and infirmities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right culture of the more refined sensibilities are missed . Th* life and the next are made too much the subject of calculation , and estimated by a too bald application of the rules of profit and loss . Contracted views of the Christian life form the third item in the implied criticism of the religion of New England . The ideas of.duty have been tinged , it is thought , with asceticism . An unnatural gravity has been exacted of the young . Harmless forms of recreation have been proscribed , either because they may be perverted into an occasion of evil , or for no better reason than because they are in vogue outside of the church . There has been too munch prohibition of that which is evil , or supposed to be evil , compared with the recommendation of that which is good . Religion has been too much associated with sombre manners . Religion has taken the place of a taskmaster , rather than that of a guide and cheerful friend . // Life has been cramped ; it has been constrained where con- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leaven all pleasure , as well as all work , with the Christian spirit , in this way appropriating , while it elevates , whatever in the practices of the world is not contrary to the principles of the Gospel , the prevalent teaching has adopted too much the easier policy of forbidding outright what it ought to chasten and regulate . These remarks will give an idea of the darker lines which we find traced in the picture before us . We are far from intending to affirm that such criticisms upon New England are wholly without foundation . We are disposed to be as liberal in our concessions on this point as the truth requires . There is no room for denying that religious teaching , in the pulpit and out of it , in the last generation assumed a metaphysical cast . Sermons were devoted to the explanation and defense of doctrinal formulas . It was expected that religious experience should connect itself with these , arid pass through a defined series of stages . So whole-souled a man as Lyman Beecher states that he rode over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimonial engagement with an excellent young lady , in case he should find her not up to the point of llopkinsian " disinter. ested submission . " It must be conceded that important aspects and applications of Christianity were frequently left out *f this teaching , and it is no wonder if a class of minds not averse to religion found little to meet their spiritual hunger ; but it must be remembered that for a while this metaphysical style of teaching accorded with a widespread taste among the people . These discussions were for a period intensely relished . Religious emotion , in many cases , naturally connected itself with forms of statement , which , under different circumstances , would awaken but little feeling . As the popular taste changed , there was , of necessity , a transition period , in which the former method began to be repulsive . There was a call for a more lively , diversified , and popular style of pulpit teaching . There is , also , some truth in the allegation that too little space has been conceded to sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . There were many people who , to be sure , were good , but hard . They measured thing // by a severely utilitarian standard . The industrious , thrifty habits of New England , which , in many respects , have been so fruitful of benefits , have been attended by some traits not so pleasant to contemplate . In case the spirit of religion became enfeebled , a close , niggardly , grasping love of money frequently gained the upper hand . The sacrifice of anything to mere sentiment has been widely , even if unconsciously , deprecated . Think of the burial-places in New England , as they were until a recent period ! The most barren field was often selected as a receptacle of the dead . It was left almost without care . No pains were taken to surround the last resting-place of dear friends with trees and flowers . The " grave-yard " was the most gloomy , uninviting spot in the village . We notice this fact simply because it is one expression and a symbol of a style of feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still living . The provisions for the relief of innocent poverty had little , if any , reference to the sensibility of those who , often through age or infirmity , were involved in this calamity . They were " paupers , " and to be a pauper was deemed to be a disgrace hardly less to be shunned than crime . It must likewise be conceded that an ascetic element has mingled to some extent in the piety of New Englat*d . Christian life among us is not yet wholly freed from the influence of narrow , unintelligent views . Take the matter of amusements . There are various games and other pastimes which have been frowned upon by those who would not be able to found their condemnation of them upon any clear and sound rule of Christian ethics . Games of chance have been forbidden on the groundless and absurd pretext that in them an appeal is made to Chance as a kind of divinity . Some of the most enlightened writers on morals especially commend games involving an element of chance , for the reason that sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people feelings of jealousy and unpleasant rivalry . Many will remember when the game of nine-pins was a forbidden amusement . Now our college gymnasiums are furnished with a row of alleys for the practice of this mode of physical exercise . A like superstition in regard to billiards is fast vanishing from enlightened minds . But many of those who laugh at the solemn condemnation // once visited on these innocent forms of recreation , might find it difficult to explain the abhorrence which they still feel for card-playing . We do not design to enter into a discussion of the subject of amusements , but merely to call attention to the ill-defined , and for the most part , traditional notions which good people still entertain in regard to them . The principle has been adopted that whatever is liable to be abused , or turned into an instrument of evil , is to be abjured ,  --  a principle , the falsehood of which is apparent . Under the operation of this sweeping rule , innoxious recreations and amusements have been denounced . Luther said that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and an enlightened Christianity will say the same of other things that afford innocent pleasure . Whether dancing be objectionable or not depends entirely on the circumstances under which it takes place ; and to use such language respecting this amusement as pertains properly to sins of an aggravated character , like lying , is to countenance superstition . That religion consists in the love of God and man is a simple lesson , but one which the world , even the most intelligent portion of it , is slow to learn . But when the foibles and the grave faults of New England Christianity in the past have been all recited , some explanation must be given of the character and condition of the New England of to-day . There are phenomena for which a stranger would find no solution in the pages of this novel . Look at the State of Connecticut and the neighboring State of Massachusetts , which have been closely united from their first settlement . Here are these commonwealths : " behold them , and judge for yourselves ! " Where can there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpass them , or even gqual them , in all the elements of Christian civilization ? Nearly the entire population of these States have been taught to read and write . The number of persons who are destitute of the rudiments of learning is smaller here than anywhere else on the globe . Nowhere else is intelligence so widely diffused . The humblest cottage is not without its books and newspapers . Nowhere else are the hardships of poverty so little felt . In no other community is the population more generally industrious and thrifty . Here have been established , chiefly by private // beneficence , the best colleges in the land , whilst good schools for all the people are maintained at the public cost . In no other country is more abundant provision made , by means of hospitals and asylums , for the relief of the suffering . These communities are not excelled by any people under the sun in the amount of their spontaneous benefactions . Charged with parsimony , they are in reality the most liberal in the bestowal of property where there is. distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blot out from American literature the works of New Englanders , of the historians , poets , scholars who have been born on our soil , and comparatively few distinguished names would be left . The outward prosperity of these States and the long enjoyment of peace have not dulled their manhood . At the outbreak of the rebellion the people flew to arms , and entered into war with the same adventurous courage , unfaltering perseverance , and effective intelligence which they had displayed in the arts of peace . When we look at these communities with just pride and admiration , we are also to remember that for more than half a century they have been pouring out over the territories lying westward a large portion of their best population . New Englanders have been emigrating to the city of New York , to the western part of the State of New York , to Ohio , to the Mississippi , and beyond its banks , until the wonder is that we have anything left . They have done much towards building up new and powerful States , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of their old home . How many of the brave soldiers and eminent leaders in our late war claim a New England parentage ! And yet the old home tree is as fresh , and green , and vigorous as ever . How shall we account for the New England of to-day ? 4 stranger , perusing Mr. Mitchell 's book , might be at a loss to answer ; and this not through any intentional fault of the authoi ' . In truth , it is the religion of New England , more than anything else , that has made New England what it is .. " A. tree is known by its fruits : do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ? " Religion was the prevailing subject of thought and discussion , the pervading , controlling element in the people 's life . It was the religion of New England , and // the regard for the human soul which religious faith inspired , that led our fathers to provide means for the education of all , and likewise moved them to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion of New England that prompted the people to industry and prndent economy , and made them consider idleness a sin . It was their religion that made them thoughtful men , training the intellect as well as forming the character . It was the- discussion of thpse " rigid " doctrines that disciplined the mind . In the study of the great themes relating to the divine administration and human destiny , the intellect of New England acquired its fibre . We have said that the thrift of our people was an offshoot of their piety . Piety and thrift lie at the basis of New England 's prosperity . What if , in the early days of New England , or even later , the people had been unthrifty ? With a soil no more fertile , and a climate no more hospitable , into what condition would society have fallen ? But , as we have said , they practised frugality as a duty ; and thereby gained the means of doing good on a scale which deserves the admiration of less liberal communities which are inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religion of New England had been different . Suppose that in place of the grave discussion of religious truth in the meeting-house , and at the fireside , in place of the contact of the minds of the people with the abstract truths and doctrines of Christianity , there had been a religion of sentiment fostered by a ritual , nourished by the sight of the crucifix , and by delicious music ,  --  a religion that arises in the soul we know not how , and which can give no rational account of itself , for the reason that it depends on no clear , intelligent perception of truth . What would New England have been , and have done , if such had been her religion ? What would have been the intellect of New England ? and what would have been the state of morals flowing from such a religious system ? The settlers of a wilderness , and their descendants for several generations , will find little opportunity for sesthetic culture . Fighting Indians and building stone walls are unfavorable to this class of accomplishments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . When the rougher work has been done , // there will appear men like the graceful writer of this volume , the son of a New England Congregational minister ; and there will appear a generation qualified to read with a relish the productions of his pen . The oak must be allowed to grow ere it can support the vine . While the subject is before us , we have another observation to make respecting New England . The question has been asked , why , every politician of the baser sort , who sets himself to defend slavery , or any other social evil , has an arrow in his quiver to discharge at New England . Declamation against Puritanism has become very common among demagogues , to say nothing of public men who would deem themselves insulted if called by that name . We believe that the real source of this rancor is in the simple fact that the Puritans of New England have held to the distinction between right and wrong , and have steadfastly insisted on applying it in the practical concerns of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal law of righteousness upon magistrates , and upon a people , in their political conduct , have been pressed , greatly to the inconvenience of unprincipled or compromising politicians . If political affairs could only be allowed to go on without the meddlesome interference of moral considerations , this class of men would have a smooth path . After all , religion and morality are made too practical by the very people who are frequently accused of carrying them into the region of abstractions . Hence the animosity with which Puritanism , and New England , the seat of Puritanism , excite in the hearts of that numerous class of American politicians who practically , if not avowedly , hold " that religion has nothing to do with politics . " Important obligations rest upon those who still adhere to the ancient faith and order of the New England churches . Against aggressions from whatever quarter , we are bound to exert ourselves to retain whatever was good in the past , to hold . fast to the distinctive excellencies of the religious system in which we have been educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must continue to assert the importance of a clear , manly teaching and inculcation of the truths of the Christian system . Whatever tends to emasculate pulpit teaching , // make it merely a perfQnctory work , a less important ad , junct in a round of church services , or resolve it into the reading of vague homilies without power to wake up time minds or affect the consciences of men , will not only have the effect to deaden the earnest spirit of religion , but will , at the same time , enervate the intellect of the people . The form and style of religious instruction vary from age to age . The truth must be cast into new amid living statements . But whatever changes of this nature are appropriate to accommodate a changed era m culture and taste , the main point must not be given up , that Christian truth is to be distinctly stated , explained , discussed , defended , inculcated , and urged upon the conscience ; and that this is the great work of the Protestant preacher-a work not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elaborate ritual or a sentimental craving for " more worship . " There is another obligation equally imperative . We are bound to adopt and cherish catholic views bc th in regard to the terms of church communion and in regard to the Christian life . We do not hesitate to say that the doctrinal tests which are imposed upon applicants for membership in muost of our Congregational Churches , even upon children , are not authorized by the Scriptures , and are both wrong and baneful . The qualification for admission into the visible fold of the Saviour is repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ . It is character , the essential elements of Christian experience , which qualifies a man to join the Christian brotherhood . Whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil . The constitution of the Church is determined by its founder . He has defined what shall constitute discipleship , and what are the qualifications for baptismn and communion with the Church . No body of Christians have a right to depart from this law and set up a ditferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Episcopalian denomination , it must be remembered that the uncatholic constitution of many of our churches in the particular just named , is in no small degree responsible for the fact . It is high time to return from our innovations to the simpler , more Christian arrangements of the early churches of New England . The other matter in which a revision of traditional notions is required , is the general subject of the Christian life . // Heaven forbid that we should speak a word that favors a lax morality , or advocate the slightest departure in the manners and customs of society from the dictates of the pure spirit of Christianity . But the question is , what does the spirit of the Gospel permit , and what does it forbid ? And here we are sure that there is a great need of renewed reflection , which may lead to broader , more enlightened views , on the part of most of our people . It is harmful to deny to the young amusements which their consciences , even in after life , are incapable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in appearance , a yoke of ordinances . The great inquiry should be , not what is the fashion among professed Christians , what was thought to be right or wrong at a former day , but rather what is really contrary to the spirit of truth and the spirit of love ? What may be practiced without damping the flame of love to God and man , which , as we have said , is the essence of religion , the substance and soul of goodness , the final result , in the heart , of the redemptive work of Christ ? Narrow views of the Christian life , within our denomination , are the second great cause of the progress of the Episcopal Church in New England . In connection with these observations , thereisroom for a word on a kindred topic . There are many in Congregational Churches , and among them are especially to be reckoned educated persons , who chafe under the minute and meddlesome surveillance over their conduct and manners which is sometimes assumed by individuals who have little claim on the score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent , things not determined by plain precepts of the Gospel or obvious inferences flowing from them , the private judgment of the individual Christian must be respected . We may differ from his judgment on some occasions ; we may regret and even deplore the conclusions to which he is led on a great variety of questions , but it is not our business to govern him , or to visit him with penalties because he does not conform to our ideas of what is expedient . If a reasonable degree of independence is not conceded to the individual , church membership becomes an intolerable yoke . Men will seek for some communion in which they are not subject to an impertinent interference under the guise of fraternal watchfulness . The // Apostle Paul is often misrepresented by being claimed among the authorities for this infringement of Christian independence . fle does not teach that we are to be governed by the consciences of other people . He expressly repudiates this doctrine . No man is to find his rule of conduct in a neighbor 's cons*ience . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered in sacrifice to idols-which is guiltless , is yet thought to be wrong by a weak brother , and if he is to be led by my example into an act which his conscience mistakenly condemns , but which for him would be sin , then love will prompt me to refrain from the innocent practice for his sake . This is very different from saying that I am to be governed by the views of Christian duty which other people entertain , and follow their convictions instead of my own . The Apostle Paul was the last man to give his sanction to this galling species of servitude . Even the maxim which he does announce has its limitations , which common sense will suggest . We are not bound to foster by example more than by precept unfounded prejudice and superstitious belief ; especially when the result will be to hold forth to the world a distorted image of Christian character and a perverted representation of Christian life . We have been led into a train of remark which has a natural , though not a necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of this Article . We regard Mr. Mitchell 's book as a story of real power and genuine pathos , and if his picture of New England country life might , with no violation of truth , have been filled out in some directions , so that the total impression left on the reader 's mind would have been different , we are yet persuaded that he has not written in a captious or disingenuous spirit . We can not apply to him , born and bred in New England , the maxim , fa8 ed ab hoetibue doceri ; and yet we think that his work may be profitably read by orthodox Congregationalists , for the reason that it emanates from a point of view quite outside of their system .
