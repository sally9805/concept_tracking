txt CANADIAN WOODS AND WATERS . THE monotony so characteristic generally of the woodlands of Upper Canada is mitigated , to a great extent , by the pleasant *vaters with which many of the tracts of that country are intersected . Away back from the great lakes , chains of smaller lakes glisten in the bosom of the immense forest . Rivers take their course from these , narrow at first , but noisy , rushing along by sparse settlements and lonely Indian camps to their junction with the big lakes , where mills , and factories , and ships , and human dross in general , soon pollute with unclean contact their fair waters . Many of the early settlers of these regions were of a stamp far different from that of the tough pioneers by whom new settlements have generally been opened in the United States and their territories . Here and there through out Upper Canada there are communities - some . of them progressive , if not actually flourishing , others yet in a backward state - which were founded by men whose early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World civilization . Among these , retired officers of the army and navy were very frequently to be met with . They were generally married men , with incomes wretchedly inadequate to the support of themselves and their families on the " European plan . " Land in Canada was to be acquired in fee for a mere song , and it was something for the cadet of a landed family to become the squire of a thousand acres upon some remote Canadian lake or river , even although six hundred of his acres might be nothing but cedar swamp . The native British keenness for the pursuit of wild creatures had much to do with the choice of locality by the adventurers , who generally set up their log-houses in districts where game and fish were to be had in abundance . Communication by road , until within the last twenty years or so , was so imperfect in many of these tracts , that but little intercourse existed between 3 " // one settlement and another . On this account agricultural operations were very limited , being confined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . In these communities somebody was always found to build a mill ; and as the gentleman settlers themselves were not above doing carpenter and blacksmith work , no matter how bunglingly , things were made to look shapely enough in the course of time , and thus were founded villages , some of which have since expanded into towns of considerable size and local importance . Strangely grotesque , with their halfcivilization , were these places in their earlier days . Characters which would not have been out of place at a bc*il masqul were frequently to be met with in all of them . Blanket coats in winter , adorned with beaded epaulets , scarlet woollen stockings pulled up over the legs to fend off the snow , and Indian moccasons , were considered quite the proper thing . Once , as I was travelling by sleigh in a comparatively settled part of the country , a young man , who was driving rapidly in the opposite direction , pulled up to greet my companion , with whom he was acquainted . He was coming to the to*vn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty or forty miles from where we met him , and certainly I was astonished being then newly arrived in the country - at the extreme slenderness of the outfit of one who was bound to do the " man about to*vn " for a few days , and that in midwinter too . He was in his shirtsleeves , having no coat with him whatever . His black velvet waistcoat , now foxy and threadbare with much use , might once have been a chefd'wz , vre from the hand of some London tailor whose gossip was of Guardsmen and their measurement . The rest of his costume consisted of a pair of buckskin breeches fastened at the knee with pearl buttons , heavy woollen stockings , and pegged boots , - the latter indebted for their lustre more to the rind of pork than to the blacking-brush. - Singularly incongruous with this get-up was the kid-gloved hand with which he removed the black pipe from his mouth ; nor was his straw hat exactly the sort of head-dress that one might have expected to meet with during a Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet on the little rough sleigh , three feet by two , on which he had been sitting , that the full splendor of his wardrobe became revealed to us ; for then he threw around his shoulders a magnificent cloak , made , I think , of some kind of Siberian fur , and which , folded up , had served him for a cushion on his journey . I frequently afterwards met this exquisite of the backwoods , wrapped in that showy mantle , walking in the streets of the little wooden town , where his appearance , so strange to me , did not seem to excite any particular comment . In those parts , men would often come into the towns , in winter , dressed in blanket coats , with the rather inappropriate accompaniment of white duck trousers and straw hats . Residents did not appear to see anything eccentric in this ; but in the mind of a stranger a sense of the ludicrous was naturally excited by it . Contrasts were ever to be observed among the strikino features of these queer settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories , there dwelt a family whose eccentricities of costume and manner of life entitle them to some brief record here . A retired officer of the army , with a large troop of well-grown sons and daughters , had built himself a loghouse in this dreary wilderness , the roads leading to which were impa*sable for four months in the year . The girls of this family were of a beauty that may truthfully be described as magnificent . No painter that I know of ever gave to the world a Diana on canvas at all comparable in beauty of face and form to the eldest of these . The family , although English , had been brought up , I think , in the Greek Archipelago , with the language and dia // home these young wood-nymphs always went barefooted in summer . Their costume , whether in the woods or when they visited the more advanced settlements , was of the Oriental style . Ahead of Mrs. Bloomer , whose note of reform had not yet ruffled the sweeping skirts . of the period , they walked fearlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close-fitting bodices , with narrow skirts falling a little below the knee , completed their costume , and the luxuriant masses of their golden-brown hair fell in natural curls to their shoulders from beneath their wide-brimmed straw hats . It was strange thus to find a leaf from " Eothen " amid the black-ash swamps and rickety " corduroy " causeways of one of the dreariest districts of Canada . In the social life of these places , where rough hospitality is often curiously mingled with a strain of former luxury , incidents of a humorous character will sometimes attract the notice of the visitor . I remember being told by an acquaintance about a visit once made by him to the family of an English gentleman , who had settled upon a small clearing in the depth of the forest . The young men of the family were engaged in burning brush-wood when my informant arrived , and he , anxious to win their approbation , set to work wxth a will , and toiled with them until the distant horn announced that dinner-time had arrived . Ablution became necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black as a charcoalburner , could venture to greet the ladies of the household , and pails of water were accordingly furnished hard by the gable end of the house . There was no towel to see that some difficulty had arisen out of his request for one . Then , with sudden impulse , one of the young men went away , and returned in a minute or two with a long and richly embroidered scarf , the golden Web interwoven with 313 which , as well as the deep lace border , stamped it as a tissue of price . Assured by the young men that this brocade was inured to duty as the regular family towel , the visitor made use of it as such . The texture of it , as he told me , was not pleasant to the face , and it abraded a good deal of the skin from his nose . It went the rounds after he had used it , and the party adjourned to the dinner-table , where some remark was made as to the non-appearance of the daughter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took her place at the dinner-table . She had evidently bestowed some extra care upon her toilet in honor of the guest from beyond the " timber limits " but what chiefly attracted his notice in her costume was a curious , gold-embroidered scarg with deep lace edges , the folds of which , although artfully cast , revealed here and there the smudges of soiled hands . Indeed , my informant - who was a little given to exaggeration , perhaps - used to aver that he recognized upon the mystic garment , just at the point where it was crossed upon the bosom of the lovely sylvan damsel , a portion of the cuticle of his own Roman nose . In another of these settlements , - it was remote , then , though now it has a great line of railway running through it , - things used to be carried to an extreme just the opposite of that above noticed . It was a little English colony , several of the members of which were persons of tolerably good means , with influential family connections at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could chop down trees , and drive oxen , and plough , and mow , as well as any lout in the country round , and some of them built their own houses and made furniture for them . They had been swells , though , before they became " hawbucks , " and they brought some of their standard manners and customs with them . It was considered proper in this community to dine at the fashionable hour of six , when every person was expected to be precise in the matter of costume , - the ladies Ga ; iadia ; z ! 1&amp;ods and Waters . // d*'col/eties to the admissible extent , and the gentlemen in black dress-coats and white " chokers . " The necessity of supporting the position suggested by this attempt at style , though , induced extravagance . Many of the swells became bankrupt . Their farms passed into more homespun hands . Their black dress-coats have long since become rusty and out of the mode , and the mortiferous whiskey of the country now tantalizes such of them as it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The simple faith and primitive arrangements that existed in some of these clearings before the advent of the iron horse were peculiarities that never failed to impress visitors from far-off cities and settlements of older growth . Bolts and bars were the last things that a settler would think about , when fitting up his house . A man would leave his rifle in the canoe , upon the river 's bank , for days together , without the least misgiving as to its being spirited away . Rust would not touch it , the climate of Western Canada being singularly free from moisture ; and the roving Indians who traversed these woods were dependent in a great measure upon the white man , and had learned to look upon his property with respect . Looking over one of my note-books , I recall fhe picture of a deserted old shanty that stood in a meadow by the margin of a bright and swift river . The gentleman who had formerly occupied this weather-stained hut had built himself a larger and more ambitious mansion upon the opposite bank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the interior of the house remained in an unfinished state , and he had no accommodation for his books . Of these he had a choice collection , and they were left in their large wooden cases , for two years or so , on the upper floor of the old shanty , the doors of which had already parted from their hinges , and the windows yielded to the autumnal blasts . To this most curious of circulating libraries the owner accorded free access to the few neighbors who occupied the clearings around . Many a time I have swung myself up by the crazy ladder that led to the attic where the books were ; and in summer I would often sit there for hours , reading Coo*r 's novels , which had then an attraction enhanced by the circumstances and place . In winter I would take books away . If it was the season for wild ducks I would have a gun beside me , to get a shot at them from the attic window as they flew along the course of the stream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often haunt it in search of such small plunder as attracts his kind ; and once I encountered upon the threshold of it a milk-snake about five feet long , which disappeared through the chinks of the flooring before I could administer to it the coup degrdce by which man feels it to be his stern duty to cut short the serpentine career . There is a wonderful fascination in these grand old Canadian woods for sportsmen , whose wildest experiences of their craft , previous to their essay in it there , had been associated with stalking deer upon Highland mountains , or shooting grouse upon the moors . The solitude of woods is of a more impressive character , I think , than that of bare mountains , - in countries , at least , where one may expect to find traces of civilized man . From mountain peaks there is a wide range of view , in which some points of guidance to the traveller are usually visible . Wandering in the woods is much like groping one 's way in the dark ; and I know by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to them to keep moving in circles , until , after hours of what he imagined to be a straight course , he finds himself back again at some wood-mark long since passed , instead of the place for which he was bound . There is something decidedly sensational in this , especially in winter , as anybody who has ever experienced it will allow . The sounds of the forest are impressive , too , while its stillness , at times almost absolute , is painful . In the mystery // of its voices lies a good deal of the fascination of the wood . In the clear , frosty air of winter the cry of the great black woodpecker rings out like an elfin laugh , as he wings his curved way through the gray stems in quest of some skeleton tree . Explosions caused by the frost are heard among the branches of the trees . They are sometimes was loud as pistol-shots , and - as I can aver from my own observation - the deer , after they have become accustomed to them , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hunter will often get several shots at one herd , by keeping close in his ambush . But the slightest sound of a twig beneath his moccason , or the tinkle of the powderflask against the muzzle of the rifle as he reloads , will send the herd crashing and flashing a way . In the stillness of a summer evening there is something very *veird in the cry of the loon , or great Northern diver , as it comes vibrating over the surface of a woodland lake . Where the woods are very thick and dark and lonely , the hooting of owls is commonly to be heard in the daytime . Once only - it was in early summer - I heard the wild turkey-cock utter his vehement call . I made my way in the direction whence the sound came , until I was stopped by a river , on the farther side of which I saw a magnificent " gobbler , " strutting with drooped wings and expanded tail along the strip of greensward that lay between the water and the woods , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his orders for the ladies of his seraglio to attend . This action , in the case of the domestic turkey , is always provocative of ridicule ; but it was absolutely grand and striking as displayed by the large-feathered free bird , parading to and fro there upon the river-bank . I watched him for a while , expecting to see the hen-birds come , but they did not ; and so the noble Mormon of the thickets furled his tail at last , and , tucking up his wings , strode moodily into the bush , as if to search for the truants . To hunters who are accustomed to 315 glide through the forest observantly and with caution , most interesting little scenes of animal life are sometimes revealed . One day , in the snow-time , as I was roaming the woods close by a Canadian river , after wild - turkeys , I noticed a flock of mergansers , - thereabouts usually called saw-billed ducks , or sheldrakes , - swimming in a small air-hole that had remained open in the frozen surface of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool might have been about ten feet by six in size . I watched them for some time , as they kept stemming the current , but without any intention of wasting ammunition upon them . My attention was attracted elsewhere for a moment , and I was surprised , on again looking towards them , to see a splendid red fox sitting at the upper edge of the little pool , where he could not have been more than a couple of yards from the nearest of the ducks . Presently he jumped up , and , running to the other end of the pool , stretched out a paw , as if to seize one of them ; but they were too quick for him , placing themselves well beyond his reach with a few strokes of their paddles . He was far too cunning to plunge into the water and risk being carried under the ice by the current ; and the ducks appeared to be quite aware of this , for they did not make any attempt to rise , nor indeed did they seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was exceedingly interesting , not to say amusing , to watch the many stratagems of the fox to get at them . Sometimes he would lie down upon the snow and lash about him with his bushy tail , whimpering in a querulous and imbecile manner at being thus outwitted by simple water-fowl . Then a new idea would take possession of him , and he would start up and run round and round the pool at a tremendous pace , probably to try and get a chance at the ducks by flurrying them ; but they knew too much for Master Reynard , and always edged away from him just at the right moment . Tired at last of watching these // mancnuvres , I " drew a bead " upon the fox ; but my hands were numbed from keeping still so long , so that , instead of hitting him rn a vital spot , as I had intended , I only broke one of his forelegs , and away he went into the woods on three paws with amazing speed , while the ducks rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flew up the course of the river in search of lonelier water . I followed the track of the fox for a mile or more , but had to give up the chase at last . The snow was flecked with spots of blood where he ran ; and although the fox is not usually an object of sympathy around Canadian borders , yet I regretted much that I had not missed this one altogether , instead of maiming him , after all the amusement he had just afforded me by his curious pranks . This little incident of fox and ducks might offer a good subject for the pencil of an animal painter , and I hereby present it either to Mr. W. H. Beard or to Mr. Hays , - whichever of them may first happen to glance over these pages . In some of the districts where game is yet plentiful , and where the maskinonge - prince of the pike tribe - reigns supreme in the woodland lakes , and the speckled trout haunts the eddies of the clear streams , men who can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are often to be met with . They have been attracted thither by the free , wild romance of the forester 's life , the Bohemianism of which is a kind by itself , although based , like other phases of that philosophy , upon impatience of the formalities by which society is cramped . On one of these lakes , in a picturesque and not very remote part of Upper Canada , there was generally a little knot of such men to be found , - men who had forsworn the gay world , and come from beyond the sea to live among Indians and make havoc of the wild beasts and birds that still abounded in the region . Sometimes they would come to the cities , and return for a brief time to the usages of civilized life . After their arrival , their affectation was to despise such luxuries as chairs and beds . Of an evening they spread blankets on the floor , and sat there with their pipes and " fire-water , " like gentle savages as they were . I have met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avail themselves of either house or bed , resorting in preference to some open shed or garden , where they wrapped themselves in their inevitable blankets , and slept the sleep of wild men upon the hard ground , with their knives and rifles at hand , ready to resist any attack that might be made upon them by hostile tribes during the night . Once in the streets of a city I remarked a couple of Indian stragglers , such as are common in Canadian towns . They were dressed in blanket coats , handsomely ornamebted , and bound at the waist with sashes of gay colors , in which long knives and tobacco-pouches of marten fur were stuck , and they smoked black pipes as they strolled leisurely along . One of them was a Chippewa of the half-breed stamp , and rather a good specimen of his caste . His companion , who wore a Scotch bonnet , was far too light in complexion to be an Indian , for , though his face was tanned to a healthy brown by exposure to the weather , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , was of a fair , yellowish hue , and I observed , besides , that he did not turn his toes inward when walking , as Indians invariably do . On inquiry I found that this romantic young man was an English baronet of moderate fortune , who had been living among the Indians at the lake for two or three years . He had been a Guardsman in his time , and a man about the clubs , and , having drained society to the dregs , had taken to Canadian woods and waters as a change from the comforts and inconveniences of too much civilization . Some time afterwards I saw him again ; but in far different guise . He was once more a swefl , and was driving a smart English " trap , " with a handsome team , in the streets of the same town . Not long after this he returned to England , I believe , and is none the // worse , probably , for his adventures by the shores of the pleasant lake of the woods . Farther down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northeast until it reaches melancholy Labrador , lies an immense field of exploration . More picturesque in its featuro* than . the upper or western province , this offshoot of old France offers peculiar attractions to persons who would escape , for a while , from the turmoils and cares of the too-busy world . On the south side of the river , within thirty or forty miles of the picturesque fortress of Quebec , moose are still plentiful , and during the winter months their venison is always to be found in the markets of the old town . The caribou haunts the wildernesses of timbered mountains that rise away back from the north shore . Parties of hardy sportsmen set out every winter from Quebec for the chase of these noble deer . It is only upon snow-shoes , the raquettes of the French Canadians , that this sport can be pursued ; the snow generally lying to the depth of three or four feet on the level in the woods . The practice of walking upon these contrivances is general throughout Lower Canada . On fine afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men , and not unfrequently young ladies , may be seen scudding across the country , in every direction , outside the walls of Quebec . The fences are covered by the snow , so that no obstacles are offered to pedestrians unless they are bold enough to enter the woods . Walking upon snow-shoes is a regular part of the training of soldiers in garrison here and at Montreal . There are snowshoe clubs , which have races during the season , sometimes over hurdles three feet high . I have seen a good pefformer jump higher than that upon his snow-shoes . This training enables the sportsman to range the forest with ease , and to follow the tracks of the moose until he brings it to bay , - for the animal is heavy , and sinks deep into the snow at every plunge . With the caribou it is not so easy to come up , the hoofs of that animal being so arranged as to spread out and offer some resistance to the snow . When the hunter goes about his work in earnest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great . In the little churchyard at Rivi*re-du-Loup , one hundred and twenty miles below Quebec , there is a tombstone to the memory of Captain Turner , an English officer who went there many years ago to hunt moose . I made inquiries about him from the people of the village , who told me that his death was caused by over-fatigue in running down moose , and afterwards conveying the venison , together with the immense heads and horns , on irebogans through miles of the wild bush . One of two Indians whom he had with him as guides died from the same cause . Sometimes hunters are seized with what is cdled by Canadians the mal-az*x-raquettes , which is a kind of cramp caused by the pressure of the snow-shoe thongs near the instep , not unfrequently obliging the sufferer to set up camp and rest for several days before resuming his journey . But summer is , after all , the season in which to enjoy best the wild scenery and sports of the Lower St. Lawrence . On the north shore , especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the rock-bound coast . About one hundred and thirty miles below Quebec the savage , gloomy Saguenay rolls between its walls of rock into the St. Lawrence , which here is nearly twenty miles in width . A wild and beautiful spot is the little bay of Tadousac at the mouth of the Saguenay , with its curved beach of white sand . When I last visited the place there was a post of the Hudson 's Bay Company there , established chiefly for the purpose of the salmon fishery . Since that time , however , all these rivers have been taken under the immediate protection of the government . Laws have been passed for the protection of the fish , and they are rigidly enforced , too , under the direction of a // Superintendent of Fisheries . The resuit of this is , that within a few years the salmon have gradually returned to maay splendid rivers from which they had been driven . The system of netting has been regulated so as to favor the fish , although , as I am informed , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incumbent upon owners of saw-mills now to furnish their dams with " passes " of peculiar construction , up which the fish can travel by a succession of leaps . The Indians are forbidden to devastate the waters with the destructive negogue , or fish-spear ; with which weapon they used to mutilate more fish than they killed . One dark night , as I lay on the bank of the Escoumain , one of the most beautiful of these rivers , I was surprised to see a number of lights flashing out suddenly over the dark pool below the lower fall . A horde of Milicete Indians had silently paddled their canoes past us under cover of night , and were now busily.engaged in spearing the salmon . It was a curious and beautiful sight to see these ragged savages , by the light of their torches , darting their long spears into the water with wonderful quickness and precision , bringing up every now and then a bright-sided salmon , and knocking it off the barbs into the canoe . The perfect wildness and remoteness of the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bu* it was mortifying to think of the wholesale slaughter that was going on , and of our incapacity to put a stop to it , for our party consisted of but four , and would have been of no avail against twenty red savages armed with rifles and spears . It is true that we had brought with us a letter from the agent of the Hudson 's Bay Company at Tadousac to the net-keeper at the Escoumain , enjoining that functionary to give us every assistance and information in his power . One of the instructions contained in that missive ran , as I remember , " chassez Zes sauvages " ; but the chase of twenty armed savages by one small and smoke-dried old Canadian , September , like the net-keeper , would have been a futile , not to say ridiculous , proceeding . And so the Indians had the pool to themselves on that dark July night , and at gray dawn they drifted past us down the stream , their canoes loaded with salmon , to which we had fondly , though delusively , fancied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gamest " and most beautiful fish for which angler ever busked artificial fly is the sea-trout that comes up with the summer tides into all these tributaries of the Lower St. Lawrence . Seldom under one pound in weight , and often weighing as much as four pounds , these fish are so similar in appearance to the common brook-trout , that many experienced fishermen declare them to be one and the same species , the slight difference between the two being accounted for by the influence of the salt water and the peculiar feeding to be found in it . In color theyare rather more silvery than the brook-trout , but they are marked , like that fish , with brilliant spots of red and blue along the sides . The best place to fish for them is where the sea-tide meets the clear , fresh water of the river , near its mouth . There are times when the salmon becomes unaccountably reserved , and will not condescend to reply to the line of invitation wafted to him by the angler acro ssthe eddies of the pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valuable substitute for his larger congener of the river , to whom he is only second in affording excellent sport . In casting for the trout it is advisable to use but one fly . Once , in the Saguenay , I used a casting-line with three flies attached to it , as for ordinary trout-fishing . At the first cast three sea-trout , each apparently over a pound in weight , were upon my tackle at once , and the consequence was a tangle which resulted in the loss of my casting-line and flies . But for the mosquitoes and black-flies , which are very troublesome in all this region , there can be no pleasanter summer resort for the angler and the overworked city man . In winter there must be an awful , arctic dreariness upon the Canadian Woods and Waters . // place , and I can hardly imagine any person not a French Canadian or an Esquimau taking up his abode there . And yet upon one of the most savage of these rivers - the Mingan , I think - an angler with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish family . He bore a distinguished name , and had probably once been an ornament to the social circles in which he moved . XVhen my informant saw him , he had ceased to be ornamental in any sense of the word , and had long been a dweller in the wilderness . In appearance he differed but little from the dirty half-breeds of the coast . Like them , he lived in a wigwam , with a squaw , and had around him a family of children so numerous and dirty that they were a wonder to see . He had been there for many years , and did not seem to think that he should ever go back to England again . Society had galled him with its harness , and the " raw " was visible yet . He was in occasional communication with his relatives at home , had a small , but independent income , and was heir , I think , to a much larger one . Occasionally he would make his way to the nearest settlement or Hudson 's Bay post , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , although a little backward as to dates , he had still some general idea of how matters were going on in the great world . Strong in deed must be the fascination of the free Indian life , thus to work its spells upon a man of education and refinement like this eccentric dweller by the waters of the rugged Mingan . Among the creatures that visit the Lower St. Lawrence is the white whale , - beluga of the naturalists . On a fine summer 's day , when the water is blue and calm , these curious rovers of the deep may be seen basking with their backs just over the surface , looking so like small icebergs that they convey an agreeable sense of coolness to the observer . At other times , and especially just about nightfall , they are very active , tumbling and splashing and spouting in every direction , as if in play . Oftenhave I been startled by one as it rose , suddenly , and with a loud snort , close by the little yacht , while we lay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the calf , or young , of this whale utters a kind of bleating cry , and that tbe mother whales frequently carry their young ones upon their backs . Some few years ago I had an opportunity of verifying the truth of these statements by observing the habits of a white whale and her calf that were exhibited by Mr. Cutter , of Boston , at Jones 's Wood , near New York . The calf used to throw itself upon the back of its dam , with a peculiar squeal , and remain there till carried several times round the tank . Brush wears are built by the inhabitants of these coasts for the capture of this kind of whale , which is generally called the white porpoise here . These wears are merely hedges of stiff brushwood , arranged so as to enclose a wedge-like space , with its wide end open to the river . The whales wander up into them , when they soon become embarrassed by the obstacles on either side , losing their reckoning at last , and " coming to grief " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are not uncommonly from sixteen to twenty feet in length , and specimens have occasionally been captured which had attained the great length of forty feet . One of average size will yield about a hundred gallons of oil . A soft and excellent leather , well adapted for shoemakers ' and other work , is now manufactured from their skins , which were first discovered to be available for this purpose by an enterprising Canadian named T*tu , residing , I think , at Kamouraska , on the southern bank of the river . The chase of the pourcil- a small species of whale , not often exceeding five or six feet in length , and of a sooty color - affords good sport , hereabouts , to those who are skilful and hardy enough to follow it . In calm , clear weather only the hunter dares to pursue this creature in his frail canoe , and even then he runs the risk of being // caught in one of the squalls that arise so suddenly on this part of the St. Lawrence . One hunter sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other , armed with a long duck-gun , loaded with buck - shot , kneels in the bow . Now and then the pourciZ emerges partly from the water , and the canoe is kept swiftly upon his course until a chance offers for a shot . Sometimes the creature is killed by the shot , but more frequently only stunned , so as to enable the hunters to approach near enough to despatch him with their harpoons . Seals in great numbers haunt the mouths of the tributaries here , attracted by the travelling salmon , upon which they commit sad depredations , often following them even into the fishermen 's nets . The hunting of seals is carried on chiefly in the winter time , when the great river is partially blocked up with ice . About twenty-five years ago , at a place called Trois Pistoles , on the south bank , an immense number of seals made their appearance upon the ice just after it had become fixed along the shore . Seals are reckoned valuable game in those parts , and the inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase them , under the direction of six priests . They had killed some four hundred , when suddenly the ice parted from the shore , and went drifting down with the tide , priests , habitans , seals , and all . Down they drifted , past dreary shores , the sparse inhabitants of which did all they could to aid them , but succeeded in taking off only a few in their canoes . On , on , still they floated , past other parishes . where people knelt and prayed loudly for them on the shore ; then past other parishes , again , where the canoemen were more adventurous , and picked the poor fellows off the ice in detail , until every one of them was brought safely to land , yet not before they had suffered great hardship from cold and fright . The old French Canadian from whom I heard this was one of the hunters on the occasion ; and although he expressed exceeding gratitude to le bon Dieu for the rescue of himself and his companions , yet he had words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was recovered . A primitive and interesting race are the French Canadians of these coasts . Many of their villages- and churches - the latter with very steep roofs , generally painted red - have a quaint , antiquated air , and some of the settlements hereabouts are really of very remote date . Wind-bound for a couple of days at one of the oldest and queerest of these villages , on a forlorn little bay , not far from the Saguenay , I went ashore to observe the manners and customs of the place . By the threshold of every house there lay two or three pair of huge wooden clogs , looking almost like " dug-out " canoes , and into these the people popped their feet when the roads were muddy , and their occupations obliged them to go out of doors . A large wooden crucifix stood by the roadside near the entrance of the village , with a small space around it enclosed by a wooden railing . Young girls in widebrimmed straw hats were kneeling at the foot of it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing . Presently an old woman came along , and she too deposited her dug-outs reverently outside the little sanctuary before she entered . These roadside crosses are to be met with everywhere in the French Canadian settlements , many of them curiously fitted up as shrines , and decorated with votive offerings . The valley in which this little village stood had a pastoral appearance , but the hills to the north of it were of a wild and dreary character , suggesting endless tracts of wilderness beyond their dark ridges . At this place , near the margin of the little bay , there ' stood a frame house of better appearance than the ordinary dwellings of the village . It had a weird and weather-stained look , nevertheless , which was in keeping with the clump of stunted and sea-blighted pines by which it was partially sheltered . The garden belonging to it ap // peared to have been once well stocked , but it had run much to weeds and tangle now , and the fence had rotted away in places , and left it open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I strolled past , an old man , whose appearance was at once so singular , and so different from that of the ordinary inhabitan*ts of the place , that my curiosity impelled me to stop and speak to him as he saluted me in passing . He was tall and very thin , and , though apparently between seventy and eighty years of age , walked with an erect carriage , leaning but slightly upon the cane he carried . His face , which was remarkably small , looked like shrivelled parchment , and his iron-gray hair hung straight down to his shoulders , like that of an Indian . He was dressed , not in the gray cloth of the country , but in an old-fashioned suit , which might once have been black , but was now faded to a dingy greenish hue , and there was about him a decided air of tarnished gentility very much out of character with the place and its inhabitants . Speaking excellent English , he invited me to accompany him to his house ; and as dinner was nearly ready when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The table was spread by an old lady quite as faded and decayed as himself . She was his sister , he told me ; adding that she was very deaf , and so nervous that he hoped I would excuse her for not joining us at the repast . And so we two sat down quite companionably together to a dinner consisting of boiled pork and excellent potatoes and milk , with wild strawberries for a dessert . The record of this old man 's life was a strange one . He was born at Quebec , of Swiss parents , who took him with them , while he was yet a child , to Switzerland , in which country and in France he received his education and passed the earlier years of his life . Returning to Canada when a grown-up young man , he became a trader among the Indians , and was for some time in charge of ? t frontier post hard by where the city of Detroit now stands . After 321 various ups and downs in life , he joined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill and a country store . That was nearly fifty years before , and he had never been out of the place since . His brothers were all dead , and the sister to whom I have referred was the only one of the family besides himself now left . Another sister had died only two months previously , and this accounted for the bit of black crape twisted round the old gentleman 's little gallipot-shaped glazed hat , which he had lifted so politely when I met him on the road . One of his brothers was drowned by accident , and another j*ad committed suicide , - a fact which he communicated to me in a hollow whisper , as we sat there in the dim old room . Fourteen members of his family were buried , he told me , under the shade of the pine-trees near the house . Two more graves must have been added to the row long since ; and that is the end of a family which evidently had once enjoyed good social position , judging from the cultivated manners and conversation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly half a century in this remote place . Among the reminiscences imparted to me by the old man of the bay , I have note of the following . While he was at the frontier post near Detroit , engaged in commerce with the savage tribes and pioneering trappers , there was a gathering of warriors at the place , - a sort of carnival in celebration of some event interesting to the red men . One day the Indians got drunker than usual , and , having exhausted their sto*k of liquor , a deputation of them entered the store of the trader , and demanded a fresh supply on credit , which was refused . Upon this the savages became insolent and abusive , and the trader 's partner , a man of great . determination and personal strength , struck down the leader of them with an axe-handle , just as the tomahawks began to gleam . The savages were now leaping forward to cut down the white man , who had in- // 322 canadian Woods and Waters . trenched himself among some barrels , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyze them like an electric shock , and a short , thickset Indian , of very dark complexion , suddenly made his appearance in the midst of them . Raising his tomahawk aloft , and uttering a few words in his native tongue , the dark-faced warrior pointed to the door , through which the cowed savages filed sullenly away and sought their wigwams . This was the renowned Tecumseh , and such was the influence he exercised over his people , even when they were maddened by drink . From the rough and sterile nature of the country through which many of these north-shore Canadian rivers run , it seems unlikely that their solitudes will ever be converted into fields for the permanent civilization that agriculture alone can establish . Lumbering operations and the fisheries constitute their only inducements for settlers , and these branches of industry are chiefly carried on by a nomadic population , nearly as wild in their ways of life as the aborigines of the region . Sportsmen will be glad to know , however , that of late years the facilities for reaching these rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Lawrence , at least as far down as the Saguenay . Landing-piers have been built at many points where it was necessary , not many years ago , for passengers to wade ashore from their boats ; and the roads over the capes and highlands - where any roads have yet been made - are of a less impracticable and aggravating character than formerly . The right of leasing the rivers for fly-fishing is vested in the government , from whose Superintendent of Fisheries at Quebec all desired information on the subject can be obtamed . It is from Upper Canada that the curious old-time features of the country are passing rapidly away with the grand old woods . Within the present century the celebrated Joseph Brant , called Thayendenegea by the red men , held his half-barbaric court , as Chief of the Six Nations , at the very spot on the Grand River where the thriving town of Brantford now stands . Brant had seen European civilization , and was the friend and companion of English statesmen ; and he curiously grafted that civilization upon the Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong-hold on the Grand River . Old men in Upper Canada yet spin yarns about the entertainments given by this chief at his hospitable mansion , where the guests were waited on by negro servants dressed in liveries of green and gold , *nd a gigantic Indian with a barrel-organ used to be stationed in the hall , to enhance the pleasures of the banquet with sweet music . This condition of things can never exist again , for which people have reason to be thankful , perhaps ; but away into the past with the Indian and his gauds are vanishing the deer , and the wildturkeys , and the creatures that men covet for their fur . Many of the deep , cold brooks , in which the speckled trout used to abound , are evaporating to mere threads as the country is cleared . Others have been poisoned by manufactures or choked up with the dibris of saw-mills , to the extinction of the fish ; and Upper Canada , on the whole , offers but a cheerless prospect now to the blighted young man of leisure who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitudes on the produce of his rod and gun .
