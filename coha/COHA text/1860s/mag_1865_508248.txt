JEFFERSON DAVIS . The following article is written by General Tno . AS JORDAN , chief of etaff to General Beauregard from June , iSGi , to May , 1S64 , and eubeequently on Beauregard 's etaff at the close of the war . Without indorsing all the opinions of the writer , we present it as giving the views of one who , from his position , had the most ample means of forming a correct judgment as to the character and abilities of the Chief of the late Confederacy. - Eu .

Moreover , any thing tending to these ends must have present interest , especially that which may aid in forming a just conception of the chief personage to whom the Southern people intrusted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of historical matter that may serve these purposes-that will indeed explain , in some measure , much that otherwise may pear inexplicable in the course of events , I am induced at this early day to venture upon a sketch of Jefferson Davis , at the risk of saying much that , just now , may not be acceptable to many-much that may wear the seeming of personal feelings . JEFFESISON DAvIs received a military education . He was graduated at West Point in 1828 , and , entering the army , served as a subaltern in the First Regiment of Infantry until March , 1833 , when , on the formation of the First Regiment of Dragoons , he was transferred to it , and became Adjutant . In 1835 he resigned his commission , became a planter , and subsequently a politician in Mississippi , making his first appearance on the stage of Federal politics in 1845 , as a member of the House of Representatives . At the outbreak of the war with Mexico , May , 1846 , Mr. Davis promptly resigned his seat in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer riflemen , which , under his command , won signal distinction at Monterey and Buena Vista . In 1847 he was tendered by President Polk the grade of Brigadier-General of Volunteers , which he declined. * He then reentered political life as a Senator in Congress , in which high post he remained until his State withdrew from the Union in 1861 , except during the period he was called to the Cabinet of Mr. Pierce , as Secretary of War-that is , from March 4 , 1853 , to March 3,1857 . As Senator Mr. Davis unquestionably acquired a commanding influence , and was regarded with marked respect . His speeches , always carefully prepared , breathed an air of conviction , and were gracefully and effectively spoken . He signalized himself particularly as the watchful , effective friend of the Military Academy and of the Coast Survey , doing much to avert injurious legislation , as well as to add materially to the value of these two public establishments , which have rendered such conspicuous services to the United States in the course of the war just ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was overruling in all matters connected in any way with his Department , and his strong will was constantly felt in the councils of a Cabinet of which Mr. Marcy was the Premier . It *vns Mr. Davis who sent to the Crimea a commission of three officers-one of whom was General M'Clellan , then a Captain of Cavalry , and another the present chief of the United States Military Engineer Corps  --  to study and report upon the state of the science of war and the condition of European armies . By the efforts of Mr. Davis likewise , four regiments were added to the regular army , two of which were cavalry , particularly valuable to the United States in the last four years . On the whole , it may he said that his administration of the War Office was ap- received by the army and the people as able and suecqesful , though indeed there were some who found in it strong traces of passion-decided traits of character , which gave cause for grave apprehension that he was unsuited for the place of Chief Magistrate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much larger resources than the Southern States could command . One example of these perilous qualities may be seen in the course of Mr. Davis relative to staff organization . The United States staff system then as now was substantially that of the French army . It had worked with notable efficiency , during the Mexican war , while the French staff had just gone through the Russian war with confessed superiority over that of the British army . But Jefferson Davis had encountered in the American staff officers perma-. nently attached who proved personally objectionable , and , on the other hand , officers of the line whom he wished to provide with staff positions not within his disposal . Only a radical change of organization would enable him to gratify his wishes . With these motives to animate and color his views , ignoring American and yet more recent European experience , with specious arguments and dogmatic assertion , he sought to induce Congress to throw aside the permanent staff organization for one of details on staff duty , such as existed in the British service and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratification of personal aims , prejudices , or a spirit of nepotism he was capable of subverting the organization of a vital branch of the army , which was approved by the experience of the military world . It is the habit both here and abroad to speak * Declined because , as he asserted , the Federal Ezecutive of Mr. Davis as the very incarnation of the ideas , bad no lawful right to coufor the commission tendered , aims , and inspirations which led the Southern which could rightly be bestowed only by the Governor of people into the course of disunion . On all sidqs his State . we see ascribed tohim theprominence-if not fhe // crime-of the arch-plotter who deeply contrived and resolutely inaugurated the revolution . So prevalent is this notion that we fully appreciate how difficult it will be to sketch him as one of the leaders of the Confederate States , in his true proportions , upon the historical canvas . Nevertheless the facts revealed by a mere glance at his political antecedents during the eight years preceding secession mark him not as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any means , but as one who , keenly alive to the value of great national establishments , sought to foster them ; as one , too , whose ambition evidently looked up to a larger sphere than that which should embrace a section rather than the whole Union . This was conspicuously the inspiration of his speech delivered in Maine , when there in pursuit of health , during the administration of Buchanan . Hence too , after the election of Mr. Lincoln , and certain occurrences in South Carolina clearly portended her ultimate course , on the arrival of Mr. Davis in Washington in December , 1860 , he was taken to Mr. Buchanan , and gave assurances that he would counsel moderation on the part of his section , and the exhaustion of all measures for accommodation , at least until after the 4th of March , 1861 . It will be seen , too , that his course in open Senate accorded with this agreement . His set oration of the 21st January , 1861 , was a *velldigested , careful statement of the alleged causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path which they considered they must surely take in the event of the triumph of aggressive sectionalism by the election of Mr. Lincoln ; nevertheless it was conceived in a temperate spirit . Several of the Senators of his section had already spoken . Mr. Pugh , of Ohio , also had previously addressed the Senate in somewhat similar terms , with a lofty and fervid eloquence that no one who heard him can forget . The fact is , the people of the cotton States had gone far ahead of those of their leaders who had been so long their representatives at Washington as to be possessed with strong personal attachments for the ' life and associations there of national politicians , which they abdicated with extreme reluctance . The constituency of these gentlemen , ahead of their representatives , had been brought with remarkable unanimity to look upon a dissolution of the Union as their only means of relief from a state of political inequality , which they believed was fraught with the political , social , and industrial subordination of the Southern to the Northern States . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tItan any other Southern statesman , maturally was more reluctant to enter upon a movement that made that preferment impossible . I-us course , both as Secretary of War and Senator , we affirm , must acquit him of any tendency to extreme sectional sentiments , which made compromise under the Union impossible-disunion inevitable . So little , in fact , did the Provisional Congress regard him in the light of the peculiar leader or exponent of the movement , that he was elected Provisional President of the new Confederacy by a bare majority , not because of any recognized political leadership , but on account of his military education , experience , and reputation , and for his acquaintance with military administration , for which it was supposed he had special aptitudes ; qualities and training which were thought to be especially desirable at that juncture in their Chief Executive . Unable , however , to comprehend the proportions of the struggle impending , or to realize that downright war for coercing the seceded States back into the Federal Union would be the result , Mr. Davis from the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to provide arms and munitions of war in the least degree adequate to the exigency . A just measure of his ideas of the state of affairs and of possible contingencies is to be found in the first orders sent to Europe for arms , which were for but ten thousand Enfleld rifles . Ten thousand rifles with which to meet the shock of arms with a Power of such energies and resources as were wielded by his adversary ! One in his place , of mere civil experience , might be par* tially'excused for such a mistaken policy ; but an educated soldier , with views enlarged by connection with . the functions of Senator and War Minister , surely must be held to the severest accountability for such a fatal misconception of the situation. * At that time the Southern people were anxious that their Government should take their cotton and tobacco . There was a very large amount of foreign exchange also in possession of the banks , which I know was offered at favorable rates . There would have been little difficulty in exporting the cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supplies into Southern ports at that early stage of the blockade , as was shown by the ease with which the commercial operations of John Frazer and Co. ( including their large voluntary importation of small-arms , artillery , and powder ) were carried on , not to speak of the large commercial marine successfully engaged in running the blockade in 1863 and 1864 . The Provisional Congress made their legislation square implicitly with the wishes and views of Mr. Davis touchin* military matters , found reflected here and there in his Reports as Federal Secretary of War or otherwise . Hence if provisions were not made by that body for an army organization and state of military preparation commensurate with the emergency , and such as a wise experienced statesman of military education and knowledge would devise , Mr. Davis is rightly responsible . Yet that legislation gives no traces of a proper conception of the measures which were really called for in a conflict with such an adversary as the Southern people had profoundly affronted and defied . * M* . Toombs , then Secretary of State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles , and that only at his earnest suggestion the number was increased to lO , t ) OO . // Mr. Davis had been at West Point , and subsequently served for several yeass in the dragoons at a frontier post with a subaltern officer to whom it happened he became attached . About the time the former resigned his commission to turn planter in Mississippi , the latter was disabled by an accident , quit his border post likewise , went to his home , studied medicine , and turned parish doctor . Mr. Davis became in time a politician , Lieutenant Northrop a Catholic convert , but so eccentric and full of mental crotchets as to be generally regarded in Charleston as of unsound intellect , and unfit for the management of his own small affairs . He had not served long enough in the army , nor been thrown in connection with considerable operations , to acquire familiarity with military administration ; neither had his retired habits of life , his cast of thought , or avocations in Charleston , brought him in relation with men engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of such subjects , and in that way attained to that breadth of view and knowledge of general business details and of men which may make up for the want of professional bureau experience after a separation of twenty-five years from army life . This man , with whom Mr. Davis had no personal association since they were cavalry lieutenants together on the Indian frontier , he did not hesitate to make his chief of subsistence , nor scruple to intrust with the organization and administration of a bureau upon which the very existence of the Confederate armies must depend , and for the labors of which it is apparent the soundest practical order of intellect was essential . One member of Mr. Davis 's Cabinet* at least knew the local repute of Dr. Northrop ; and we assert that had the inquiry been made in Charleston , his pre-eminent unfitness would have been universally certified . As might be anticipated , his administration at once took all the characteristics of that unhealthy brain . Mr. Davis supported him , however , in every vagary , permitted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every army commander when , as was of daily occurrence , they chanced to differ from those of Colonel Northrop . Indeed , the crazy courses in which this man was suffered to indulge , to the mortal injury of every Confederate army , are incredible . Bat we have not the space for their relation , which would fill a volume . One example must serve to illustrate the surprising character of an administration which made success impossible . All reinforcements , ammunition , ordnance , and the greater part of the quarter-masters ' supplies were necessarily transported to the Confederate forces assembled at Manassas Junction by the Alexandria and Orange Railroad , which , of course , was thus tasked to the utmost tension of its resources . But another railroad , branching from it at Manassas , communicated with the most fertile region of Virginia , the famous Shenandoah Valley , which teemed with subsistence Mr. Meniminger , Secretary of the Treasury . that was also abundant in the adjoining counties of Fauquier and London . Not required for the transportation of troops or ordnance supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Subsistence Department ; and substantial supplies , we repeat , lay convenient to it , sufficient for all the forces the Confederates could possibly muster in that quarter . Nothing , indeed , could be more favorable for the Confederates than the arrangement of the , e two divergent roads . But all this was lost sight of by Colonel Northrop , who by some influence was led to determine that subsistence officers with General Beauregard should not draw their flour or meat either from the rich garners and stores of Loudon , Fauquier , or the valley counties . Forbidding his subordinates , imperatively and angrily , from purchasing supplies within easy reach and with ample means of otherwise idle transportation at hand , leaving them to fall into the hands of the enemy , he set other subordinates to gathering subsistence in the rear of the army , which he was obliged to send over the already overburdened Alexandria and Orange Railroad , for which he had to pay much more than such supplies could have been bought for in the Valley or in Loudon. * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of subsistence as General Beauregard needed , and there was not one day 's rations for the army at the time of the battle of Manassas ( or Bull Run , as it is usually styled ) , nor more than forty-eight hours ' supplies for weeks afterward of the material part of the ration . General Beauregard having urged the provision of a fortnight 's supply for some twenty or twenty-five thousand men , Northrop fell into a passion , wrote to the General a letter of surpassing insolence , and at the same time relieved the staff officer from duty who , under General Beauregard 's orders , had attempted to remove the evil . Mr. Davis , blind to the consequences , obdurately sustained this extraordinary conduct . An army left habitually without supplies for more than twenty-four hours , and the wishes and views of whose commander in so vital a matter as its subsistence are offensively thwarted , it is needless to say , can have little mobility . Its commander can not have the power to handle it at will . This was signally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1861 . Want of subsistence rooted it fast to its d*p6t , through which Colonel Northrop issued a daily dole sent up once in twenty-four hours by the Alexandria and Orange Railroad . Not was this state of affairs bettered as late as 1 7th August , when General Johnston , in a note ta General Beauregard , wrote : " It is in*possihlc , as the affairs of the Commissariat are now man aged , to think of any other military coarse than a strictly defensive base . " Why suck a man as Northrop was dragged forth from his seclusion , his favorite church po * Indeed , flour bought by speculators in the Valley and London was carried to Richmond , sold to the Subsistence Bureau , and transported back to Manassas. // lemics and squabbles and monomaniac habitudes , to be thrust into duties profoundly intermixed with the very existence of his government , must ever remain one of tbe inexplicable mysteries of human history . Rendered arrogant beyond bearing , at length he used language one day which his doting patron could not brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only then-about February , 1865 - that this veritable tenacious " Old Man of the Sea " for the South was shaken off and his successor appointed ; but too late for any radical benefit , for , in no small degree from commissanat follies , the Confederate cause was already in the throes of death . If Mr. Davis did not fill the position of Quarter-Master-General with a special favorite , but permitted its duties to be devolved upon the senior officer of the United States QuarterMaster 's Department , who had entered his service , he is none the less responsible for the administration of that branch of his staff . We say this because we know that he constantly interfered with and decided matters that absorbed time which might have been better occupied . One instance of this kind will serve to show both his habitual course and his responsibility for what was ineffective in any Department under him . General Beauregard , early in June , 1861 , in view of the similarity of the flags of the United States and the Confederate States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had proposed to distinguish his men by a scarf to be worn in battle , which he asked should be supplied without delay by the Quarter-Master 's Department . But even this small matter Mr. Davis could not suffer his General to decide . Accepting the idea , he directed that not the proposed scarf , ' but an altogether different contrivance , should be provided . Therefore-if occupied with such petty details  --  the historian must hold him accountable when his main army is found unprovided , as it was , with the means of wheel transportation needful for the ordinary operations of the camp-not to speak of an offensive campaign . On assuming command at Manassas , early in June , 1861 , General Beauregard at once gave his attention to this material element of military operations . He made urgent , repeated requisitions for what he anxiously regarded as essential for the safe mobility of his force . The question was one which , as far as practicable , it was his province to determine If possible , his requisitions should have been filled . Mr. Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badge matter . He had been besought to order compliance . The Quarter-Master-General either did not realize the scale of impending operations , and had little conception of the resources of the State of Virginia , or in his communications concerning this matter and his actions was but the echo and organ of the Execntive , to whom the responsibility must attach in either case . If competent to be the chief of a great revolution , he would have compre hended that the requisitions of his General were both in accordance with exigent military needs and not in excess of the available supply of the country . We know that General Johnston dwells upon other reasons for not pursuing M'Dowell than the want either of subsistence or transportation for munitions of w " r ; but , be it observed , this was in connection with any direct movement upon the line of retreat of that General 's routed forces . Had it been practicable for the Confederates to take the offensive at once after the battle of Manassas , as ' Johnston 's main army would not have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Potomac near Leesburg , and marched rapidly to the rear of Washington . This was rendered impracticable by the want not only of subsistence , but of means of transportation . It is in this connection that Mr. Davis may be rightly blamed for the failure of his army to pursue and reap the legitimate fruits of a really wondrous victory , and not because he opposed at the time a proposed forward movement , as has been ignorantly alleged by partisans of the two Generals . As is known , he was at Manassas the evening of the 21st July , 1861 . Until a late hour that night he was engaged with Generals Johnston and Beauregard , at the quarters of the latter , in discussing the momentous achievements of the day , the extent of which was not as yet recognized at all by him or his Generals . Much gratified with known results , his bearing was eminently proper . He certainly expressed no opposition to any forward movement : nor at the time displayed a disposition to interpose his opinions or authority touching operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see a marvelous ' array of proof that Mr. Davis lacked the very qualities the supposed possession of which had elevated him to the head of the Confederate Government - those of the military organizer and statesman acquainted with the higher ranges of war administration . Without showing by his measures of preparation , by recommendations to Congress , or in any way whatsoever , that he believed the war wouldbe prolonged beyond a year , but the contrary indeed ; yet before leaving Montgomery for Richmond he had declined to receive a large number of men tendered for twelve months , * for the reason that they were not offered for the war or three years . If he had anticipated a long war , few and short indeed were his steps for the con. tingency . But the fact is , his course and the utterances of his Cabinet indicate that he looked for an early pacification , either through that recognition by France and England " in ninety days " which Mr. Benjamin was ever confidently looking for and predicting , or from other causes ; therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proscribed these enrollments for less time than three years or the war * We are assured quite iOt4 , OOO of these men were tendered . // at so early a day . By that course he greatly diminished the effective force that might have met M'Dowell-risked , we may say , that battle , and weakened Johnston and Beauregard especially in cavalry-one of the reasons given by General Johnston for not having been able to pursue his adversary and discover the actual extent of the disaster inflicted . Will it be credited , moreover , that as late as the middle of August , 1861 , there was no engineer or other officer on the staff of Geneial J. E. Johnston competent to plan an ordinary railroad bridge. * In fact all the staff departments of that army were organized on the same inexcusably inadequate scale . It was not until the middle of September , 1861 , two months after the battle of Manassas , that a single Major or Divisional General was appointed for that army , and then but twoGenerals Van Dora and G. W. Smith-though six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jot uston , including G. W. Smith , whom he specially desired to place in command of his own corps ( old Army of the Shenandoah ) , so that he might be enabled to give exclusive attention to the chief command . Smith was indeed made a Major- General ; but as if Mr. Davis could not possibly coincide or sympathize with the views of his Generals , Van Dora was at the same ti'me sent to report , with a senior commission . An element of discord was introduced into the army by this act , which , whether casual or not , we must regard as another illustration of the proneness of Mr. Davis to lose sight ofin fact how little he was wont to consider-public interests when they conflicted in any way with his personal will , fancies , or schemes . Some weeks later several other Major-Generals were commissioned , though nGt to the number requested . Meantime Mr. Davis had visited head-quar -- ters . A discussion had likewise grown up between him and his Generals relative to the organization of their army . He had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State should all be brigaded together , and commanded by Brigadiers from such State . With some exceptions , thought to be specially for the good of the service , this had been already done . But it chanced that one of these very exceptions was in the way of the promotion of a brother-in-law to the command of a brigade , and could not be tolerated . At the same time the division of the army into two corps was objected to . Long communications were written on this subject by Mr. Davis and his Secretary of War that will amaze the military reader who , we are sure , will be at a loss to understand with what possible end , other than an " apple of discord , " this discussion was cast between Mr. Davis and his Generals . " The President disapproves the division of the army into two corps , " wrote the Chief of the Bureau of War to General Beauregard October 18 , 1861 . And on the 20th of October Mr. Davis himself characterized the division as irregular , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of military organization . " * Intermixed was also the question of the position of General Beauregard , who , as " second in command , " Mr. Davis thought should not have " special charge of any subdivision " - that is , corpsof that army ; " because in the absence of General Johnston " Beauregard 's " succession to the command of the whole would not disturb the relations of the officer and troops , " nor " involve any changes of position on the line occupied . " Moreover his acquaintance with the whole body of the army , and the absence of any identification with a part of them , would better qualify " him for the succession . Mr. Benjamin , thrown forward to reinforce these curious notions of his chief , with " nice sharp quillets of the law , " does it with characteristic assumption of superior knowledge even of the details of military organization , while attributing ignorance to the generals of the laws germain to the subject . " I beg to say , in all kindness , " writes the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is false , 4 but your idea of organization of the army as established by the acts of Congress , and I feel confident you can not have studied the legislation of Congress relative to the army . I have entered into these details because , in a conversation with the President since his return from your head-quarters , he has informed me that he found the same views as to the organization of the army which you seem to entertain very generally prevalent . " These details are as follows : " You are second in command of the whole Army of the Potomac , and not first in command of half of the army . The position is very simple , if you will take the pains to read the sixth section of the Act to provide for the Public Defense , ' approved 6th March , 1861 . You will see that the President has no authority to divide an army into two corps d'crnse'e , but only into brigades and divisions . Now your rank being superior to that of a commander of a brigade or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army into which the army can be legally divided , you necessarily command the whole army ; but having present with you an officer of equal grade but older commission , who also commands the whole army , you become second in command . " This construction of the law was too far-fetched to be adhered to after it had served the immediate end in view at the tune . Comments are unnecessary . What functions Mr. Davis and his subtiell see- * Letter to General Beauregard. f Letter to General Beauregard , October 17 , 1861 . I That is , if connected with the troops without a command . I Which , after all said , save in a few minor particulars , was hut a re-enactment of the laws of the United States . II " How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done , " are true words put by Shakspeare into the mouth of King John . This has been amply illustrated in * Note of General Johnston to General Beauregard-in which he observes also : " It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers to advantage . " // retary designed to be performed by the " second in command " we really can not understand , unless indeed those of the " spare wheel " which bangs to the rear of an artillery caisson . But he evidently fancied that what be desired was usual in European armies , and yet we apprehend it were difficult to cite an instance. * Indeed Mr. Davis himself appears to have forgotten these fancies in 1864 , as he permitted General Beauregard to hold a special command , under General Lee , in the lines at Petersburg , when next in rank to the latter  --  a command , too , much inferior in size to that ohjected to in 1861 , and actually inferior to those held by the LieutenantGenerals of the same army . When Mr. Davis was on a visit at the headquarters of the army , General Johnston submitted a plan , supported by Generals Beauregari and G. W. Smith , for an offensive campaign . These Generals urged the immediate concentration in that quarter of the greater part of the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yorktown , and Fredericksburg , for example ; with which , added to the troops already in hand , a campaign across the Potomac should he initiated , before General M'Clellan had completed the organization of his grand army . This , they believed , might be done without risk to the positions weakened by the measure-though , in fact , the principles of the art of war prescribed that places of such relative military unimportance should be sacrificed or hazarded for the sake of the vital advantage anticipated . A very considerable army of the best personnel could have been thus assembledlarger , be it observed , than either of those which subsequently General Lee was able to lead across the border under much less favorable military conditions . Their President could not be induced to sanction the measure , or to give up his own settled policy of dispersion , his waste of defensive resources in the attempted defense of every threatened position . He proposed , however , an operation instead , which may he fairly taken as a measure of his calible in war affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force-about one weak division-on the Maryland shore , opposite to Evansport , on the Virginia shore of the Potomac , occupied by the Confederates . This force Mr. Davis proposed to capture by a coup de main . A glance at the map will show that the attacking party ( with the scantiest possible means of ferriage in small boats ) must cross the Potomac-there over a mile wide , navigable , and full of steam ships of war of the class of the Pawnee . Were a surprise effected , it would be nevertheless impossible for the Confederates to get away with impunity , much less to carry off the fruits of vie- the relations between Mr. Davis and tbe pliant Benjamin , always " liable to be used . " * In Continental European armies the officer next in rank to the commander-in-chief is often unattached to any special command-in which event he is chief of staff , specially selected on that account , as was Count Guelsenan , under Bliicher. tory . From close proximity to Washington the alarm must be immediate ; Federal war ships would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and render repassage of the river impracticable , it being impossible , from the features of the country , for the Confederates to occupy two points on the river with batteries within which the movement might be securely made . Tilese views , forcibly presented by his Generals , he could not combat , and the project fell still-born , lie then returned to Richmond , thenceforward to look with marked disfavor upon all the wishes and views of both Johnston and Beauregard affecting the army they commanded , even declining to confer the grade of Brigadier-General on their respective chiefs of staff , which had been asked not only as due to these officers for their services and professional experience , but as calculat'A to enhance their usefulness in their delicate and most responsible posts . These are examples tak*n at random . Already they crowd the space allotted , and we must hereafter relate matters wider apart in order of time . The Provisional Congress having met in Richmond , and the war spirit of the North having been excited to a pitcll that nsede it evident all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war at tile call of the Federal President and General , we find still Jefferson Davis comparatively dumb-making 110 recommendations to Congress which indicate the least appreciation of the impending scale of attack , the least conception of measures requisite to meet and foil it . Such , for example , as a conscription law . Unadvised on this point , Congress indulged in the dream that a great war could be prolonged by voluntary contributions of brawn and **29;615;TOOLONG ! Mr. Davis had at that time the influence to have corrected this fatal delusion , but he shared it equally with Congress ; and here again fell infinitely short of the height of his position . AiThirs meantime grew troublous in the West . Crittenden had been routed , and by the end of January , 1862 , there were portents of the loss of the Mississippi River . General Beauregard , at the instance of Congressmen , was now detached to take command at Columbus , Kentucky , with the implied prolnise that he should be supported by the requisite general officers to enable him to organize his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for promotion ; but he was assured through his Adjutant - General , by Mr. Benjamin , that there was no need of this , as he would find his new command " admirably organized . " Tills was not the fact , for the ort had was altogether irregular and insufficient for the field ! Corrected as far as practicable just before the battle of Shiloh , for the want of proper Brigadiers their duties bad to be trusted to senior Colonels of brigades who were utterly without experience , as well as in some cases by no means the best of their // grade present . General Beauregard had taken the responsibility of carrying with him a capable engineer on his staff , whom he was able , therefore , to employ at once upon works which made the obstinate defense of Island No. 10 , Madrid Bend , and Fort Pillow . But other engineer officers promised were not available until after the battle of Shilob , and consequently it had been impossible to acquire accurate information of the terrain in the vicinity of that battle-fielda circumstance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent to the general reader . Those applied for were line officers , and might as well have been appointed in the first week of February as ultimately in April and May ; but Mr. Benjamin , when urged to act at once and give the orders by telegraph , replied that he could not do so without first obtaining the permission of the President . That is , not even a captain of engineers could be appointed , though reported to be capable and absolutely needed by an army commander , until the head of the Government had consented . The fact is , affairs of this sort engrossed his time , his thoughts , and left little for matters that legitimately belonged to his high functions . Finding his command virtually unorganized Beauregard , by telegraph , applied again for the officers he had specified in February . The reply was that , belonging ( as Colonels ) to Johnston 's army , they could not be spared , and officers attached to his own forces must he recommended for promotion instead . Time was pressing , and certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generals Polk and Bragg . The answer then was that he must wait until he could nominate officers as deserving and capable , from his own knowledge . One or two promotions were made , however , but when recommendations were again made the reply came : Recommend such officers as have won promotion in battle . Under all the circumstances this was downright trifling ; and the want of these officers was one of the chief reasons why the battle of Shilob was not brought to a decisive close by noonday on the 6th of April , 1862 , which must have made the arrival of Buell too late to be of the least use in rescuing General Grant 's army . General Beauregard , for some time in had health , thought it best for the service to take advantage of the lull in operations incident tn the position of his army at Tupelo after the successful evacuation of Corinth , and by a short respite from duty seek to recuperate . He therefore retired to Bladon Springs , some twelve hours distant by railroad , turning over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation of the army for the field at once on his return , which he anticipated would be in three weeks . But no sooner had Mr. Davis heard of this step than he telegraphed General Bragg to assume permanent command . General Beauregard was thus laid on the shelf , not to be reinstated , as Mr. , Davis passionately declared , though the whole world should urge him to the measure. * What General Bragg achieved in the campaign which he soon undertook has passed into history ; what General Beauregard , in his place might have accomplished may only be inferred from the plan of campaign which he submitted at the time to General Cooper , a copy of which has been published . The military reader , it is believed , will approve that plan , and will find it difficult to understand why General Buell was not obliged to accept battle at Munfordsville , Kentucky , and why it was that Bragg 's and Kirby Smith 's forces operated on separate lines in that campaign . Passing now to the campaign of 1863 , 50 filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides evidences of the hand that was surely guiding the Southern cause to utter ruin . The extent of the defeat inflicted by General Lee at Chancellorsville in May , 1863 , is admitted ; but it may not be generally known that Longstreet 's corps was absent from that field , having been detached under instructions or at least a pressure from Richmond , due to that evil genius of the Confederates , Northrop , though General Lee believed an attack imminent . During the fortnight ' following that brilliant Confederate success never did affairs look so propitious for the Confederates . The Federal arumy , stunned and much disorganized , lay behind the Rappabannock . Bragg confronted Rosecrans at Duck River with a force strong enough to hold him at bay . One corps* would have enabled him to take the offensive under conditions so unfavorable to Rosecrans as almost to insure decisive defeat ; defeat with the Cumberland River behind his back to embarrass retreat , and with no supporting force available , while without such a stock of subsistence as would have enabled him to decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the transfer of the corps could have been made in ten days at most , for two lines of railroad as far as Chattanooga , were then open to the Confederates ; the time was far more favorable indeed than when , after the defeat at Gettysburg , Longstreet was actually sent . Such an operation was in strict accordance with the cardinal principles of the art of war . The Confederates occupied the interior * Notes of interview of Congressional Committee with Mr. Davis to request restoration of General Beauregard to his command . t Two corps could have been spared without risk long enough for the operation . When Longotreet was finally detached , and took part in the battle of Chickamauga with such effect , Meade 's army bad acquired prestige at Gettysburg , and was much stronger than Hooker could have been on the heels of the signal defeat at Chancelloreville. * This is shown by evidence of General Rosecraus himself before the Congressional Committee on Conduct of the War .

General Grant had just entered upon his campaign against Vicksburg . The Confederates held Port Hudson , so that neither supplies nor reinforcements could reach him from the south . Were R*secrans defeated , one Confederate corps at least would then have been disposable for a juncture with Johnston : a detachment from it taking Fort Pillow at the same time , and thus cutting off reinforcements and subsistence from the north as the possession of Port Hudson did from the southern quarter . This the military reader will readily perceive , as also that Johnston would then have been superior in force to General Grant , who , for lack of subsistence , must soon have been obliged to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deaf as an adder were the Richmond authorities to all the promises of the situation . Their fiat went forth ; the Gettysburg campaign was inaugurated-that is , the old policy was continued of keeping the Confederate forces divided and operating on widely divergent lines . General Lee is too great a soldier not to have read aright at that time the clear lessons of his art , not to have seen at a glance what was to*be gained by the blow at Rosecrans with a crushing force , and what the continued dispersion of forces in war inevitably involved . We have never heard the Gettysburg campaign defended except as a commissariat device , and this gives the clew to the inspiration that prompted it-the Confederate Commissary-General . From it " woes unnumbered " followed for the Confederate arms . The campaign itself ended in disaster and the loss of over thirty thousand men at Gettysburg , where also was buried much of the prestige which had hitherto wondrously strengthened the dauntless " Army of North Virginia . " Bragg was forced first out of Middle Tennessee , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicksburg and Port Hudson , with their large garrisons , succumbed to the indomitable Grant . The Mississippi River passed into Federal possession , and communication with the trans-Mississippi portion of the Confederacy was cut off . In brief : a long train of almost mortal disasters was only interrupted by a transient success at Chickamauga , the value of which was soon " shook in air " by Jefferson Davis , who , visiting the field , detached Longstreet to be baffled before Knoxville ; while Rosecrans , strongly reinforced , beat Bragg decisively . From the effects of such immense losses of men , and from the natural deep depression consequent , the Confederate people really never recovered ; for it had become apparent that their Presi*lent , unmoved by experience , was inflexible in his adherence to his favorites , to his passionate prejudices , and in his policy .

Mr. Davis disapproved it . At the next session it was re-enacted , with a clause , however , giving him the power to carry it out at his discretion . Under these circumstances he signed the law , but absolutely withheld its execution until the 1st day of April , 1865 , when General Cooper was directed to put it in force-that is , the day before General Lee 's lines at Petersburg were broken , and the end was plainly at hand . Actuated by the narrowest views concerning both the rank and number of staff-officers who should be employed with his armies from the outset of the war , time and the wishes of his generals but served to fix him ineradicably in his notions , the nature and scope of which may be better understood by the foreign soldier when assured that Confederate generals of the highest rank , including General Lee , were allowed only two aids-dc-camp , and these but of the grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of his staff a Berthier or a Soult , Marshals of the Empire , who had commanded armies .

The chief Adjutant-General on the staff of General Lee was a young officer of the grade of a lieutenant - colonel ; doubtless judicious , apt , clever , zealous , but who was a bank officer at the outbreak of the war , with no knowledge of military routine and administration . His two assistants-majors -- were of the same description , as were also the small staff of inspectors . General Johnston was placed in the same situation . And all this was the result of Mr. Davis 's peculiar inflexible notions . More than in any other service did the Confederate armies need high rank for their staffofficers , for the patent reason that , lacking enough officers of professional training , the attraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability , ripest culture , and large knowled*ge of men and affairs , to accept and retain staff appointments with Confederate generals-men who could most readily make up for the want of soldierly culture .

If M. Thiers feels warranted in ascribing the loss of Waterloo in part to Marshal Soult 's inexperience as a staff*officer , * we may believe that General Lee and other Confederate generals must have suffered serious detriment from the extraordinary abnormal staff organization imposed by Jefferson Davis , and specially prescribed by orders in the face of law , in April , 1864 , just as General Grant began his campaign . Surely even the general reader in this must see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must have tended to clog the efforts of the highest genius , and made success impossible , denied , as Confederate generals were , the aid of staff-officers of the character employed by their adversary , and such as have been available to all successful commanders , since Frederick down to the recent war in Italy , on both sides . About the middle of May , 1864 , General Beauregard reached Drury 's Bluff below Richmond , and had an interview with General Bragg , at the time exercising a species of general command . This officer appeared to apprehend that General Lee , yielding to the pressure of superior numbers , must before long give way and lose Richmond . Beauregard replied that he did not regard the situation as so nnfavorahle if the right remedy were promptly applied . He then pointed out the isolated position of Butler , south of the James , as affording an opportunity for his destruction with a superior force , and that such a force might be assembled if General Lee would furnish 10,000 men . Falling upon Butler under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him must fall the d*p6t at Bermuda Hunreds . This effected , at a concerted moment he would throw his whole force upon General Grant 's flailk while General Lee made an attack in front . All circumstances favored the plan , and General Bragg expressed his approbation . Mr. Davis , informed of it , came at once to see General Beauregard , who explained all its details and earnestly urged the attempt . Mr. Davis seemed much impressed , but objected that it would involve the retrograde of General Lee from his position at Spottsylvania Court House , which " could not be thought of . " " Yes , " rejoined the General , " what of that when it will enable him in two or three days at most to gain a great victory ? " That is , when like the Titan he would touch the earth to spring up refreshed and all the stronger . This line of argument was fruitless . Nothing that affected General Lee 's army , howsoever temporarily , could be entertained . Beauregard had said that he might beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , like so many other Confederate successes , without material profit . This ability to gain the color of victory caught Mr. Davis 's attention and the attempt must he made . It was made . Butler was driven from his position the next day ; hut , just as Beauregard predicted , no * And yet Soult had been Chief of Staff in Spain ; also in 1194 , under Lefebre , at battle of Fleurus. substantial results followed the success . In the end , too , as might have been anticipated , unless some such decided success as that sought over Butler had been gained and enabled the concentration of the scattered Confederate forces , General Lee was forced step by step to follow the march of his opponent . The removal of Johnston from his command and the substitution of Hood , who was expected by Mr. Davis to strike at least " one manly blow " for the defense of Atlahta , few will now venture to deny was a sad mistake for the Confederates . That was indeed " the feather that broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Atlanta the inevital ) le issue was pointed out unless a force was collected strong enough to vanquish him after he had penetrated deeply into the interior , where defeat would entail not merely a foiled but a destroyed army . If permitted to traverse the land unchecked the consequences were mcrtol . Bold , prompt measures alone could avert dire calamity . Great sacrifices had now become inevitable ; the " heroic treatment " could alone serve the " sick man " now . Especially after the fall of Savannah was this urged upon those in power , who as little comprehended the crisis as the antidote . Even when General Beauregard directed the evacuation of Charleston , and urged a similar course with respect to Wilmington , so as to provide a force with which to fdl upon Sherman , Mr. Davis wrote such a dispatch to General Hardee , commanding in Charleston , as led him to suspend the evacuation , and obliged Beauregard to assume command and to direct imperatively the measure to he completed . Of course Wilmington , of no use since the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with no force afield to check his course Sherman marched like Fate through the heart of the country . In the conduct of civil affairs the same traits have characterized the regime of Jefferson Davis which we have sought to show governed his military administration , and with the same baleful results for the cause placed in his keeping . We shall not have space , however , to spread the proof upon the record , except so far as this may be done by the relation of two occurrences . When Mr. Toomhs quit the Cabinet to become a Brigadier-General , Mr. Hunter of Virginia took his place , which he soon left , for reasons best known to himself , to take the seat of Senator in Congress , only secured after a warm contest . There was a Virginia statesman preeminently fitted to succeed Mr. Hunter in the Cabinet . We mean W. C. Rives , whom all recognized as a man of great breadth and accuracy of culture , enlarged views of statesmanship , and who , having served as a diplomatist with high credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in that capacity by the United States . His connection with the Cabinet must have given weight to the cause abroad . But Mr. Davis could not stifle that characteristic distrust and intolerance of superior men of independent minds , which have made him , // by his course as President of the Confederate States , at once a patricide and a moral suicide . It was enough that Mr. Rives was brought to his notice as one whom the people would like to see among his advisers . That looked like dictation-like an interference with his prerogative . Mr. Judah P. Benjamin was transferred to the State Department ; General Randolph - as it happened , a gentleman of real administrative ability as well as of too much independence to remain a Cabinet officer merely in name-was made Secretary of War , though at the time little known for capacity beyond the place of his residence . A little later Mr. Davis also appointed as his Attorney-General  --  the law adviser of his Government-a gentleman doubtless of much civil worth , but who at the time was a lieutenantcolonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of recent insubordination of such flagrant character as to make General Gladden place him for a time in close arrest in his tent in charge of an armed sentinel . Mr. Davis must be judged at the bar of history by the aggregate results of his administration . He must be measured by what was done or left undone-successes and reverses-either directly by himself or through the instruments of his will , the men on whom he relied for the performance of ' the highest services of the State ; Brought to this rightful test , what statesman of whom history tells us will be found more deficient than Jefferson Davis ? Had he been equal to his position he would have known how to develop , combine , wield the splendid resources of his land in such a manner as to produce the largest possible results . With his long experience and acquaintance with the public men of the United States he should have known the best men to call around him , and should have known , too , the best course for baffling the statesmen opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon as in the case of Morean and Talleyrand-he should have been wise enough to attach to his Government and secure the services of men of talent , even though perchnnce not well affected personally toward them . A genuine leader of men would have done so-would have stifled personal passions , which alone , it would appear , have influenced Mr. Davis since an early day . Swayed by these , and amorous to an incredible degree of the office-giving powers of his place , and the exercise of which absorbed by far the larger part of his waking hours , he was blind alike to those insuperable as to those favoring circumstances or favorable occasions which the statesman will be quick to recognize . As a natural consequence of the predominant qualities of the man , there immediately grew up in the South a party of " President 's Friends , " from whose ranks , as far as possible , were drawn the occupants of all civil places . Men for the most part malleable to his will , who , looking up to him as the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upheld his views and wishes as the only safe rule and law for the times . Thus in a little while almost every person of ability , nearly ' every one of spirit , was driven from the councils of the South and the direction of affairs , leaving the Government to a large degree in the hands of those from whom efficient administration was not to be expectedselected as they were for instruments thought to be best adapted to his purpose : that of absorbing in himself all the substantial functions of the State . As obstinate as James II . or George III. , whom he greatly resembled in many traits of character , as in the management of public bu*iness-with the same tendency to employ mediocrity and the same dislike for independent ability-Jefferson Davis for four years illustrated , like his monarchical prototypes , that no two natures are so widely opposite and unlike as the *villful and the wise . Imperious , yet without genuine vigor of character , pride and weakness were strangely blended in his actions . It was said of George III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Chatham . Mr. Davis looked with a moody brow and a skeptical lip when either Johnston or Beauregard tendered the trophies of successful war . Napoleon , once urged by an undistinguished general to confer upon him the marshal 's baton , exclaimed : " It is not I who make a marshal-it is victories ! " What Napoleon would not attempt Mr. Davis did without hesitation , making major and lieutenant generals who previously bud not been in battle , and if possibly capable , had never had opportunities to show capacity for high command ; some of whom too , we may add , whose promotion has not been justified by subsequent events . The longer he held power the narrower grew his conceptions , the more imperious his will , until to differ from or cross the orbit of his fancies , or even to run counter to the plans and wishes of his favorites , became a personal affront . No man in as high and critical a position ever less understood the value of wise , independent ministers , or was ever less able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major advantage . lIe and his ministerial clerks , always as sanguine us Napier describes the British Cabinet to have been in 1810 , like that Cabinet were always " anticipating success in a preposterous manuer ' - always displaying little practical industry , and quite as little judgment in preparing for contingencies . In no instance did he and his favorites comprehend at their value the golden opportunities that more than once were vouchsafed them , and by seizing which with a resolute hand they might have neutralized the superior resources of the United States . With a leader like William of Orange in his stead this had surely been accomplished . We have heard much , from Mr. Davis and his friends in the last months of time struggle , concerning the frightful extent of desertions from Confederate armies . Unquestionably this evil was very great ; indeed , so numerous hm*fl deser // @ qwq // HARPER 'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . qwq CHAPTER XIV . MISS GWILT 5 DIARY . " ALL SAINTs ' TERRACE , NEW ROAD , LONDON , " July 2S-Monday night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I tired . But , in my situation , I must trust nothing to memory . Before I go to bed I must write my customary record of the events of the day . " So far , the turn of luck in my favor ( it was long enough before it took the turn ! ) seems likely to continue . I succeeded in forcing Armadale-the brute required nothing short of forcing ! )  --  to leave Thorpe-Ambrose for London alone in the same carriage with me , before all the people in the station . There was a full attendance of dealers in small scandal , all staring hard at us , and all evidently drawing their own conclusions . Either I knew nothing of ThorpeAmbrose , or the town-gossip is busy enough by this time with Mr. Armadale and Miss Gwilt . " I had some difficulty with him for the first half hour after we left the station . The guard ( delightful man ! -I felt so grateful to him ! ) had shut us up together , in expectation of haIfa-crown at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he showed it plainly . Little by little I tamed my wild beast-partly by taking care to display no curiosity about his journey to town , and partly by interesting him on the subject of his friend Midwinter , dwelling especially on the opportunity that now offered itself for a reconciliation between them . I kept harping on this string till I set his tongue going , and made him amuse me as a gentleman is bound to do when he has the honor of escorting a lady on a long railway journey . " What little mind he has was full , of course , of his own affairs and Miss Milroy 's . No words can express the clumsiness he showed in trying to talk about himself , without taking me into his confidence or mentioning Miss Milroy 's name . He was going to London , be gravely informed me , on a matter of indescribable interest to him . It was a secret for the present , but he hoped to tell it me soon ; it had made a great difference already in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thorpe-Ambrose ; he was too happy to care what the scandal-mongers said of him now , and he should soon stop their mouths by appeari'ng in a new character that would surprise them all . So he blundered on , with the firm persuasion that he was keeping me quite in the dark . It was hard not to laugh , when I thought of my anonymous letter on its way to the major ; but I managed to control myselfthough , I must own , with some difficulty . As the time wore on I began to feel a terrible excitement ; the position was , I think , a little too much for me . There I was , alone with him , talking in the most innocent , easy , familiar manner , and having it in my mind all this time to brush his life out of my way , when the moment comes , as I might brush a stain off my gown . It made my blood leap and my cheeks flush . I caught myself laughing once or twice much louder than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it desirable to put my face in hiding by pulling down my veil . " There was no difficulty , on reaching the terminus , in getting him to come in the cab with me to the hotel where Midwinter is staying . He was all eagerness to be reconciled with his // C a a a Cl a a Cl Cl a C dear friend-principally , I hay o doubt because he wants the dear friend lend a helping-hand to the elopement . The real difficulty lay , of coarse , with Midwinter . My sudden journey to London had allowed me no opportunity of writing to warn him-or , rather , of writing to combat his superstitious conviction that he and his former friend are better apart . I thought it wise to leave Armadale in the cab at the door , and to go into the hotel by myself to pave the way for him .

I felt as if I was back in my teens-until I recovered and remembered the lout in the cabat the door . And then I was five-amf-thirty again in an iustant . " His face altered when he heard who was below , and what it was I wanted of him . He looked not angry but distressed . He yielded , // however , before long , not to nay reasons , for I gave him norfe , but to my entreaties . His old fondness for his friend might possibly have had some share in persuading him against his will ; hut my own opinion is that he acted entirely under the influence of his fondness for Me . " I waited in the sitting-room while he went down to the door ; so I knew nothing of what passed between them when they first saw each other again . But oh , the difference between the two men when the interval had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were both agitated , but in such different ways ! The hateful Armadale , so loud and red and clumsy ; the dear , lovable Midwinter , so pale and quiet , with such a gentleness in his voice when he spoke , and such tenderness in his eyes every time they turned my way . Armadale overlooked me as completely as if I had not been in the room . He referred to me over and over again in the conversation ; he constantly looked at me to see what I thought , while I *t in my corner silently watching them ; he wanted to go with me and see me safe to my lodgings , and spare me all trouble with the cabman and the luggage . When I thanked him and declined , Armadale looked unaffected , relieved at the prospect of seeing my back turned at last , and of having his friend all to himself . I left him with his awkward elbows half over the table , scrawling a letter ( no doubt to Miss Milroy ) , and shou*ng to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had calculated ( if I succeeded in reconciling them ) on his staying as a matter of course where he found his friend staying . It was pleasant to find my anticipations realized , and to know that I have as good as got him now under my own eye . " After promising to let Midwinter know where he could see me to-morrow , I went away in the cab to hunt for lodgings by myself . " With some difficulty I have succeeded in getting a sitting-room and bedroom to suit me in this house , where the people are perfect strangers to me . Having paid a week 's rent in advance ( for I naturally preferred dispensing with a reference ) , I find myself with exactly three shillings and ninepence left in my purse . It is impossible to ask Midwinter for money , after he has already paid Mrs. Oldershaw 's note-of-hand . I must borrow something to - morrow on my watch and chain at the pawnbroker 's . Enough to keep me going for a fortnight is all , and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in less than that time , Midwinter will have married me . " Julg 29th . Two o'clock - Early in the morning I sent a line to Midwinter , telling him that he would find me here at three this afternoon . That done , I devoted the morning to two errands of my own . One is hardly worth mentioning-it was only to raise money on my watch and chain . I got more than I expected , and more ( even supposing I buymyself one or two little things in the way of cheap summer dress ) than I am at all likely to spend before the wedding-day . " The other errand was of a far more serious kind . It led me into an attorney 's office . " I was well aware last night ( though I was too weary to put it down in my diary ) that I could not possibly see Midwinter this morning , in the position he now occupies toward me , without at least appearing to take him into my confidence on the subject of myself and nay circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to overlook , there is not the least difficulty in my drawing on my invention , and telling him any story I pleasefor thus far I have told no story to any body . Midwinter went away to London before it was possible to approach the su*ect . As to the Milroys ( having provided them with the customary reference ) , I could fortunately keep them at arm's-length on all questions relating purely to myself . And lastly , when I effected my memorable reconciliation with Armadale on the drive in front of the house , he was fool enough to be too generous to let me defend my character . When I had expressed my regret for having lost my temper and threatened Miss Milroy , and when I had accepted his assurance that my pupil had never done nor meant to do me any injury , he was too magnanimous to hear a word on the subject of my private affairs . Thus I am quite unfettered by any former assertions of my own ; and I may tell any story I pleasewith the one drawback hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may invent in the way of pure fiction , I must preserve the character in which I have appeared at ThorpeAmbrose-for , with the notoriety that is attached to my other name , I have no other choice but to marry Midwinter in my maiden name as Miss Gwilt . ' " This was the consideration that took me into the lawyer 's office . I felt that I must inform myself , before I saw Midwinter later in the day , of any awkward consequences that may follow the marriage of a widow who conceals her widow 's name . " Knowing of no other professional person whom I could trust , I went boldly to the lawyer who had my interests in his charge at that terrible past time in my life which I have more reason than ever to shrink from thinking of now . He was astonished , and , as I could plainly detect , by no means pleased to see me . I hardly opened my lips before he said he hoped I was not consul im again ( with a strong emphasis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin , and put the question I had come to ask in the interests of that accommodating personage on such occasions-an absent friend . The lawyer evidently saw through it at once ; but he was sharp enough to turn my friend ' to good account on his side . He said he would answer the question as a matter of courtesy toward a lady represented by myself ; but he must make it a condition that this consultation of him by deputy should go no further . // " I accepted his terms , for I really respected the clever manner in which he contrived to keep me at a*rm's-length without violating the laws of good-breeding . In two minutes I heard what he had to say , mastered it in my own mind , and went out . " Short as it was , the consultation told me every thing I wanted to know . I risk nothing by marrying Midwinter in my maiden instead of my widow 's name .

The only imposture my husband will ever discover-and then only if he happens to be on the spot-is the imposture that puts me in the place , and gives me the income , of Armadale 's widow ; and by that time I shall have invalidated my own marriage forever . " Half past two ! He will be here in half an hour . I must go and ask my glass how I look . I must rouse my invention , and make up my little domestic romance . Am I feeling nervous about it ? Something flutters in the place where my heart used to be . At five-and-thirty too ! and after such a life as mine ! " Six o'clocle. - He has just gone .

" What can be the secret of this man 's hold on me ? How is it that he alters me so that I hardly know myself again ? I was like myself in the railway carriage yesterday with Armadale . It was surely frightful to be talking to the living man , through the whole of that long journey , with the knowledge in me all the while that I meant to be his widow  --  and yet I was only excited and fevered . Hour after hour I never shrunk once from speaking to Armadale  --  but the first trumpery falsehood I told Midwinter turned me cold when I saw that he believed it !

I ca n't write it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I remember that he believed it because I said it-that he was distressed by it because it was my story ! I will face the chances of contradicting myself-I will risk discovery and ruin-any thing rather than dwell on that contemptible deception of him a moment longer . " My lies came to an end at last . And then he talked to me of himself and of his prospects . Oh , what a relief it was to turn to that , at the time ! What a relief it is to come to it now ! " He has accepted the offer about which he wrote to me at Thorpe-Ambrose ; and he is now engaged as occasional foreign correspondent to the new newspaper . His first destination is Naples . I wish it had been some other place ; for I have certain past associations with Naples which I am not at all anxious to renew . It has been arranged that he is to leave England not later than the eleventh of next month . Before that time , therefore , I , who am to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . " There is not the slightest difficulty about the marriage . All this part of it is so easy that I begin to dread an accident . The proposal to keep the thing strictly private4*vhich it might have embarrassed me to make-comes from him . Marrying me in his own name - the name that he has kept concealed from every living creature but myself and . Mr. Brock-it is his interest that not a soul who knows him should be present at the ceremony ; his friend Armadale least of all . He has been a week in London already . When another week has passed he proposes to get the License , and to // be married in the church belonging to the parish in which the hotel is situated . These are the only necessary formalities . I had but to say Yes ' ( he told me ) , and to feel no further anxiety about the future . I said Yes , ' with such a devouring anxiety about the future that I was afraid he would see it . What minutes the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , while I hid my face on his breast ! " I recovered myself first , and led him hack to the subject of Armadale ; having my own reasons for wanting to know what they said to each other after I had left them yesterday . " The manner in which Midwinter replied showed me that he was speaking under the restraint of respecting a confidence placed in him by his friend . Long before he had done I detected what the confidence was . Armadale had been consulting him ( exactly as I anticipated ) on the subject of the elopement . Although he appears to have remonstrated against taking the girl secretly away from her home , Midwinter seems to have felt some delicacy about speaking strongly ; remembering ( widely different as the circumstances are ) that he was c*rntemplating a private marriage himself . I gathered , at any rate , that he had produced very little effect by what he had said ; and that Armadale had already carried out his absurd intention of consulting the head-clerk in the office of his London lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the qt*estion which I felt must come sooner or later . He asked if I objected to our engagement being mentioned iu the strictest secrecy to his friend . " I will answer , ' he said , for Allan 's respecting any confidence that I place in him And I will undertake , when the time comes , so to use my influence over him as to prevent his being present at the marriage , and discovering ( what he must never know ) that my name is the same as his own . It would help me , ' he went on , to speak more strongly to him about the object that has brought him to London , if I can requite the frankness with which he has spoken of his private affairs to me , by the same frankness on my side . ' " I had no choice but to give the necessary permission , and I gave it .

Let him one trusted with the knowledge that I am to be idwinter 's wife ; and what he tells his friend about his love-affair he will tell me . " When it had been understood between us that Armadale was to be taken into our confidence , we began to talk about ourselves again . How the time flew ! What a sweet enchantment it was to forget every thing in his arms ! How he loves me ! - ah , poor fellow , how he loves me ! " I have promised to meet him to-morrow morning in the Regent 's Park . The less he is seen here the b*tter . The people in this house are strangers to me c*rtainlv  --  but it may be wise to consult appearances , and not to produce the impression , even on their minds , that Midwinter is engaged to me .

If any after-inquiries are made , when fhave run my grand risk , the testimony of my London landlady Thight be testimony worth having . " That wretched old Bashwood ! Writing of Thorpe-Ambrose reminds me of him . What will he say when the town-gossip tells him that Armadale has taken me to London , in a carriage reserved for ourselves ? It really is too absurd in a man of Bashwoods age and appearance to presume to be iu love " Jidy 301k . News at last ! Armadale has heard from Miss Milroy . My anonymous letter has produced its effect . The girl is removed from Thorpe-Ambrose already ; and the whole project of the elopement is blown to the winds at once and forever . This was the substance of what Midwinter had to tell me , when I met him in the Park . I affected to he excessively astonished , and to feel the necessary feminine longing to know all the particulars . Not that I expect to have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I are little better than mere acquaintances , after all . ' " You are far more than a mere acquaintance in Allan 's eyes , ' said Midwinter . Having your permission to trust him , I have already told him how near and dear you are to me . ' " Hearing this , I thought it desirable , before put any questions about Miss Milroy , to uttend my own interests first , and to find out what effect the announcement of my coming marriage had produced on Armadale . It was possible that he might be still suspicious of me , and that the inquiries he made in London , at Mrs. Milroy 's instigation , might be still hanging on his mind . " Did Mr. Armadale seem surprised , ' I asked , when you told him of our engagement , and when you said it was to be kept a secret from every body ? ' " He seemed greatly surprised , ' said Midwinter , to hear that we were going to be married . All he said when I told him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were family reasons on your sid&amp;for making the marriage a private one . ' " What did you say , ' I inquired , when he made that remark ? ' " I said there were family reasons on my side , ' answered Midwinter . And I thought it right to add-considering that Allan had allowed himself to be misled by the ignorant distrust of you at Thorpe-Ambrose-that you had confided to me the whole of your sad family // story , and that you had amply justified , in my eyes , your unwillingness to speak of your private affairs , under all ordinary circumstances . ' . Q'l breathed freely again . He had said just what was wanted , just in the right way . ) " Thank you , ' I said , for putting me right in your friend 's estimation . Does he wish to see me ? I added , by way of getting back to the other subject of Miss Milroy and the elopement . " He is longing to see you , ' returned Midwinter . He is in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soothe , but which I believe would yield far more readiJy to a woman 's sympathy than to mine . ' " Where is he now ? ' I asked . " lie was at the hotel ; and to the hotel I instantly proposed that we should go . It is a busy , crowded place ; and ( with my veil down ) I have less fear of compromising myself there than at my quiet lodgings . Besides , it is vitally important to me to know what Armadale does next , under this total change of circumstances - for I must so control his proceedings as to get him away from England if I can . We took a cab : such was my eagerness to sympathize with the heart-broken lover , that we took a cab . " Any thing so ridiculous as Armadale 's behavior under the double shock of discovering that his young lady has been taken away from him , and that I am to be married to Midwinter , I never before witnessed in all my experience . To say that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not born idiots . He congratulated me on my coming marriage , and execrated the unknown wretch who had written the anonymous letter , little thinking that he was speaking of one and the same person in one and the same breath . Now he submissively acknowledged that Major Milroy had his rights as a father , and now he reviled the major as having no feeling for any thing but his mechanics and his clock . At one moment he started up , with the tears in his eyes , and declared that his darling Neelie ' was an angel on earth . At another he sat dow* sulkily , and thought that a girl of her spirit might have run away on the spot and joined him in London . After a good half hour of this absurd exhibition I succeeded in quieting him ; and then a few words of tender inquiry produced what I had expressly come to the hotel to see-Miss Milroy 's letter . " It was outrageously long and rambling and confused-in short , the letter of a fool . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose time and patience over maudlin and nauseous outbursts of affection , of kisses inclosed in circles of ink . However , I contrived to extract the information I wanted at last ; and here it is : " The major , . on receipt of my anonymous warning , appears to have sent at once for his daughter , and to have shown her the letter . You know what a hard life I lead with your mother ; do n't make it harder still , Neelie , by deceiving me . ' That was all the poor old gen* tleman said . I always did like the major ; and , though he was afraid to show it , I know he always liked me . His appeal to his daughter ( if her account of it is to be believed ) cut her to th' heart . She burst out crying ( let her alone for crying at the right moment ! ) , and confessed every thing . " After giving her time to recover herself ( if he had given her a good box on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) the major seems to have put certain questions , and to have become convinced ( as I was convinced myself ) that his daughter 's heart , or fancy , or whatever she calls it , was really and truly set on Armadale . The discovery evidently distressed as well as surprised him . He appears to have hesitated , and to have maintained his own unfavorable opinion of Miss Neelie 's lover for some little time . But his daughter 's tears and entreaties ( so like the weakness of the dear old gentleman ! ) shook him at last . Though he firmly refused to allow of any marriage engagement at present , he consented to overlook the clandestine meetings in the Park , and to put Armadale 's fitness to become his son-in-law to the test , on certain conditions . " These conditions are , that for the next six months to come all communication is to be broken off , both personally and by writing , between Armadale and Miss Milroy . That space of time is to be occupied by the young gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in completing her education at school . If when the six months have passed they are both still of the same mind , and if Armadale 's conduct in the interval has been such as to improve the major 's opinion of him , he will be allowed to present himself in the character of Miss Milroy 's suitor ; and in six months more , if all goes well , the marriage may take place . " I declare I could kiss the dear old major if I was only within reach of him ! If I had been at his elbow , and had dictated the conditions myself , I could have asked for nothing better than this . Six months of total separation between Armadale and Miss Milroy ! In half that time-with all communication cut off between the two-it must go hard with me indeed if I do n't find myself dressed in the necessary mourning , and publicly recognized as Armadale 's widow . " But I am forgetting the girl 's letter . She gives her faTher 's reasons for making his conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spoken so sensibly and so feelingly that he left his daughter no decent alternative-and he leaves Armadale no decent alternative-but to submit . As well as I can remember it , he seems to have expressed himself to Miss Neelie in these , or nearly in these terms : " Do n't think I am behaving cruelly to you , my dear ; I am merely asking you to put Mr. Armadale to the proof . It is not only right , it is absolutely necessary , that you should hold no communication with him for some time to come  --  and I will show you why . In the first place , // if you go to school , the necessary rules in such places-necessary for the sake of the other girls - would not permit you to see Mr. Armadale or to receive letters from him ; and , if you are to become mistress of Thorpe-Ambrose , you must finish your education ; for you would be ashamed , and I should be ashamed , if you occupied the position of a lady of station without having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second place , I want to see whether Mr. Armadale will continue to think of yoa as he thinks now , without being encouraged in his- attachment by seeing you , or reminded of it by bearing from you . If I am wrong in thinking him flighty and unreliable , and if your opinion of him is the right one , this is not putting the young man to an unfair test-true love survives much longer separation than a separation of six months . And when that time is over , and well over-and when I have had him under my eye for another six months , and have learned to think as highly of him as you do-even then , my dear , after all that terrible delay , you will still be a niarried woman before you are eighteen . Think of this , Neelie , and show that you love me and trust me by accepting my proposals . I will hold no communication with Mr. Armadale myself . I will leave it to you to write and tell him what has been decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one only , to acquaint you with his decision . After that , for the sake of your reputation , nothing more is to be said , and nothing more is to be done , and the matter is to be kept strictly private between ourselves until the six months ' interval is at an end . ' " To this effect the major spoke . His behavior to that little slut of a girl has produced a stranger impression on me than any thing else in the letter . It has set me thinking ( me , of all the people in the world ! ) of what they call a moral difficulty . ' We are perpetually told that there can be no possible connection between virtue and vice . Can there not ? Here is Major Milroy doing exactly what an excellent father , at once kind and prudent , affectionate and firm , would do under the circumstances-and by that very course of conduct he has now smoothed the way for me , as completely as if he had been the chosen accomplice of that abominable creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way ! But I am in such good spirits I can do any thing to-day . I have not looked so bright and so young as I look now for months past ! " To return to the letter , for the last timeit is so excessively dull and stupid that I really ca n't help wandering away from it into reflections of my own , as a mere relief . " After informing her disconsolate swain that she meant to sacrifice herself to her beloved father 's wishes ( the brazen assurance of her setting up for a martyr after what has happened exceeds any thing I ever heard or read of ! ) , Miss Neelie next mentioned that the major proposed taking her to the sea-side for change of air , during the few days that were still to elapse before she went to school . Armadale was to send his answer by return of post , and to address her , under cover to her father , at Lowetoft . With this , and with a last outburst of tender protestation , crammed crookedly into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.B.-The major 's object in taking her to the sea-side is plain enough . He still privately distrusts Armadale , and he is wisely determined to prevent any more clandestine meetings in the park , before the girl is safely disposed of at school . ) " When I had done with the letter-I had requested permission to read parts of it which I particularly admired , for the second and third time ! - we all consulted together in a friendly way about what Armadale was to do . " He was fool enough , at the outset , to protest against submitting to Major Milroy 's conditions . He declared , with his odious red face , looking the picture of brute health , that he should never survive a six months ' separation from his beloved Neelie . Midwinter ( as may easily be imagined ) looked a little ashamed of him , and joined me in bringing him to his senses . We showed him , what would have been plain enough to any body but a booby , that there was no honorable , or even decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set by the young lady . Wait  --  and you will have her for your wife , ' was what I said . Wait-and you will force the major to alter his unjust opinion of you , ' was what Midwinter added . With two clever people hammering common sense into his head at that rate , it is needless to say that his head gave way , and he submitted . " Having decided him to accept the major 's conditions ( I was careful to warn him , before he wrote to Miss Milroy , that my engagement to Midwinter was to be kept as strictly secret from her as from every body else ) . the next question we had to settle related to his future proceedings . I was ready with the necessary arguments to stop him , if he had proposed returning to Thorpe-Ambrose . But he proposed nothing of the sort . On the contrary he declared , of his own accord , that nothing would induce him to go back . The place and the people were associated with every thing that was hateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him in the park , and no Midwinter to keephim company in the solitary house . I 'd rather break stones on the road , ' was the sensible and cheerful way in which he put it , than go back to Thorpe-Ambrose . ' " The first suggestion after this came from Midwinter . The sly old clergyman who gave Mrs. Oldershaw and me so much trouble , has , it seems , been ill ; but has been latterly reported better . Why not go to Somersetshire , ' said Midwinter , and see your good friend , and my good friend , Mr. Brock ? ' " Armadale caught at the proposal readily enough . He longed , in the first place , to see dear old Brock , ' and he longed , in the second place , to see his yacht . Yes ; he would stay a // few days more in London with Midwinter , and then he would go to Somersetshire . But wha ; after that ? I " Seeing my opportunity , I came to the rescue this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I said ; and you know that Midwinter is going to Italy . When you are tired of Somersetshire , why not make a voyage to the Mediterranean , and meet your friend , and your friend 's wife , at Naples ? ' " I made the allusion to his friend 's wife , ' with the most becoming modesty and confusion . Armadale wa 's enchanted . I had hit on the best of all ways of occupying the weary time . He started up and wrung my hand in quite an ecstasy of gratitude . How I do hate people who can only express their feelings by hurting other peoples ' hands ! " Midwinter was as pleased with my proposal as Armadale ; but he saw difficulties in the way of carryiug it out . He considered the yacht too small for a cruise to the Mediterranean , and he thought it would be wise to hire a larger vessel . His friend thought otherwise . I left them arguing the question . It was quite enough for me to have made sure , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to have decided him , in the second place , on going abroad . He may go how he likes . I should prefer the small yacht myself-for there seems to be a chance that the small yacht might do me the inestimable service of drowning him " Five o'clocle. - The excitement of feeling that I have got Armadale 's future movements completely under my own control made me so restless , when I returned to my lodgings , that I was obliged to go out again and do something . A new interest to occupy me being what I wanted , I went to Pimlico to have it out with Mother Oldershaw . " I walked  --  and made up my mind on the way that I would begin by quarreling with her . One of my notes of hand being paid already , and Midwinter being willing to pay the other two when they fall due , my present position with the old wretch is as independent a one as I could desire . I always get the petter of her when it comes to a downright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliging the moment I have made her feel that mine is the strongest will of the two . In my present situation she might be of use to me in various ways , if I could secure her assistance without trusting her with secrets which I am now more than ever determined to keep to myself . That was my idea as I walked to Pimlico . Upsetting Mother Oldershaw 's nerves , in the first place , and then twisting her round my little finger , in the second , promised me , as I thought , an interesting occupation for the rest of the afternoon . " When I got to Pimlico a surprise was in store for me . The house was shut up-not only on Mrs. Oldershaw 's side , but on Doctor Downward 's as well . A padlock was on the shop-door ; and a man was hanging about on the watch , who migh* have been an ordinary idler certainly , but who looked , to my mind , like a policeman in disguise . " Knowing the risks the doctor runs in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something serious had happened , and that even cunning Mrs. Oldershaw was compromised this time . Without stopping , or making any inquiry , therefore , I called the first cab that passed me and drove to the post-office , to which I had desired my letters to be forwarded if any came for me after I left my Thorpe-Ambrose lodging . " On inquiry a letter was produced for Miss Gwilt . ' It was in Mother Oldershaw 's handwriting , and it told me ( as I had supposed ) that the doctor had got into a serious difficultythat she was herself more unfortunately mixed up in the matter  --  and that they were both in hiding for the present . The letter ended with some sufficiently venomous sentences about my conduct at Thorpe-Ambrose , and with a warning that I have not heard the last of Mrs. Oldershaw yet . It relieved me to find her writing in this way-for she would have been civil and cringing if she had had any suspicion of what I have really got in view . I burned the letter as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present , is an end of the connection between Mother Jezebel and me . I must do all my own dirty work now  --  and I shall be all the safer , perhaps , for trusting nobody 's hands to do it but my own . " . Jui*1 3lst. - More useful information for me . I met Midwinter again in the Park ( on the pretext that my reputation might suffer if he called too often at my lodgings ) ; and heard the last news of Armadale since I left the hotel yesterday . " After he had written to Miss Milroy , Midwinter took the opportunity of speaking to him about the necessary business arrangements during his absence from the great house . It was decided that the servants should be put on board wages , and that Mr. Bashwood should be left in charge . ( Somehow I do n't like this reappearance of Mr. Bashwood in connection with my present interests , but there is no help for it . ) The next question  --  the question of money-was settled at once by Armadale himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be lodged by Mr. Bashwood in Coutts 's Bank , and to be there deposited in Armadale 's name . This , he said , would save him the worry of any further letter-writing to his steward , and would enable him to get what he wanted , when he went abroad , at a moment 's notice . The plan thus proposed being certainly the simplest and the safest , was adopted with Midwinter 's full concurrence ; and here the business discussion would have ended , if the everlasting Mr. Bashwood had not turned up again in the conversation and prolonged it in an entirely new direction . // " On reflection , it seems to have struck Midwinter that the whole responsibility at ThorpeAmbrose ought not to rest on Mr. Bashwood ' * shoulders . Without in the least distrusting him , Midwinter felt , nevertheless , that he ought to have somebody set over him to apply to in case of emergency . Armadale made no objection to this ; he only asked , in his helpless way , who the person was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at . Either of the two solicitors at Thorpe-Ambrose might have been employed  --  but Armadale was on bad terms with both of them . Any reconciliation with such a bitter enemy as the elder lawyer , Mr. Darch , was out of the question ; and reinstating Mr. Pedgift in his former position implied a tacit sanction on Armadale 's part of the lawyer 's abominable conduct toward me , which was scarcely consistent with the respect and regard that he felt for the lady who was soon to be his friend 's wife . After some further discussion Midwinter hit on a new suggestion which appeared to meet the difficulty . He proposed that Armadale should write to a respectable solicitor at Norwich , stating his position in general terms , and requesting that gentleman to take charge of his affairs , and to act as Mr. Bashwood 's adviser and superintendent when occasion required . Norwich being within an easy railway ride of Thorpe-Ambrose , Armadale saw no objection to the proposal , and promised to write to the Norwich lawyer . Fearing that he might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew him out a draft of the necessary letter , and Armadale having delayed till the next morning , was now engaged in copying the draft , and also in writing to Mr. Bashwood to lodge the money immediately in Coutts 's Bank . " These details are so dry and uninteresting in themselves that I hesitated at first about putting them down in my diary . But a little reflection has convinced me that they are too important to be passed over . Looked at from my point of view they mean this-that Armadale 's own act is now cutting him off from all communication with Thorpe-Ambrose , even by letter . He is as good as dead already to every body he leaves behind him . The causes which have led to such a result as that are causes which certainly claim the best place I can give them in these pages . " August 1st-Nothing to record , but that I have had a long , quiet , happy day with Midwinter . He hired a carriage , and we drove to Richmond , and dined there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer . Come what may of it , I love him . " I have fallen into low spirits since he left me . A persuasion has taken possession of my mind , that the smooth and prosperous course of my affairs since I have been in London is too smooth and prosperous to last . There is something oppressing me to-night , which is more than the oppression of the heavy London air . " August 2d . Three o'clock-My presenti* meats , like otR*er peoples ' , have deceived me ten enough  --  but I am ahnost afraid that my presentiment of last night was really prophetic , for once in a way . " I went after breakfast to a milliner 's in this neighborhood to order a few cheap summer things . From the milliner 's I drove to Midwinter 's hotel ; and ( in pursuance of my resolution to throw dust , if I can , in the eyes of the people of this house ) when I invited him to come and drink tea with me to-night , I begged that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and to the hotel , and part of the way back . Then , feeling disgusted with the horrid close smell of the cab ( somebody had been smoking in it , I suppose ) , I got out to walk the rest of the way . Before I had been two minutes on my feet I discovered that I was being followed by a strange man . " This may mean nothing but that an idle fellow has been struck by my figure , and my appearance generally . My face could have made no impression on him-for it was hidden as usual by my veil . Whether he followed me ( in a cab of course ) from the milliner 's , or from the hotel , I can not say . Nor am I quite certain whether he did or did not track me to this door . I only know that I lost sight of him before I got back . Th*ere is no help for it but to wait till events enlighten me . If there is any thing serious in what has happened I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . Ten minutes since I was in my bedroom , which communicates with the sitting-room . I was just coming out when I heard a strange voice on the landing outside  --  a womans voice . The next in- stant the sitting-room door was suddenly opened ; the woman 's voice said , Are these the apartments you have got to let ? ' and though the landlady , behind her , answered , No ! higher up , ma'am , ' the woman came on straight to my bedroom , as if she had not heard . I had just time to slam the door in her face before she saw me . The necessary explanations and apologies followed between the landlady and the stranger in the sitting-room  --  and then I was left alone again . " I have no time to write more . It is plain that somebody has an interest in trying to identify me , and that , but for my own quickness , the strange woman would have accomplished this object by taking mc by surprise . She and the man who followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league together ; and there is probably somebody in the back-ground whose interests they are serving . Is Mother Oldershaw attacking me in the dark ? or who else can it be ? No matter who it is , my present situation is too critical to be trifled with . I must get away from this house to-night , and leave no trace behind me by which I can be followed to another place . // I ? oad. -I got away last night ( after writing an excuse to Midwinter , in which my invalid mother ' figured as the all-sufficient cause of my disappearance ) ; and I have found refuge here . It has cost me some money ; but my object is attained ! Nobody can possibly have traced me from All Saints ' Terrace to this address . &amp; After paying my landlady the necessary forf*t for leaving her without notice , I arranged with her son that lie should take my boxes in a cab to the cloak-room at the nearest railway station , and send me the ticket in a letter , to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went his way in one cab I went mine in another , with a few things for the night in my little hand-bag . I drove straight to the milliner 's shop-which I had observed , when I was there yesterday , had a back entrance into a mews , for the apprentices to go in and out by . I went in at once , leaving the cab waiting for me at the door . A man is following me , ' I said ; and I want to get rid of him . Here is my cab-fare ; *vait ten minutes before you give it to the driver , and let me out at once by the back way . In a moment I was out in the mews - in another , I was in the next street-in a third , I hailed a passing omnibus , and was a free woman again . " Having now cut off all communication between me and my last lodgings , the next precaution ( in case Midwinter or Armadale are watched ) is to cut off all communication , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . I have written to Midwinter-making my supposititious mother once more the excuse  --  to say that I am tied to my nursing duties , and that we must communicate by writing only for the present . Ignorant as I still am of who my hidden enemy is , and of what that enemy 's object may be , I can do no more to defend myself than I have done now . " August 4tk. - The two friends at the hotel have both written to me . Midwinter expresses his sympathy , and his regret at our separation , in the tenderest terms . Armadale writes an entreaty for help under very awk*vard circumstances . A letter from Major Milroy has been forwarded to him from the great house , and he incloses it in his letter to me . Having left the sea-side , and placed his daughter safely at the school originally chosen for her ( in the neighborhood of Ely ) , the major appears to have returned to Thorpe-Ambrose at the close of last week ; to have heard then , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written instantly to Armadale to tell him so . The letter is stern and short . Major Milroy dismisses the report as unworthy of credit , because it is impossible for him to believe in such an act of cold-blooded treachery , ' as the scandal would imply , if the scandal were true . He simply writes to warn Armadale that , if he is not more careful in his actions for the future , he must resign all pretensions to Miss Milroy 's hand . I neither expect , nor wish for , an answer to this ' ( the letter ends ) , for I desire to receive no mere protestations in words . By your conduct , and by your conduct alone , I shall judge you as time goes on . Let me also add , that I positively forbid you to consider this letter as an excuse for violatipg the terms agreed on between us , by writing again to my daughter . You have no need to justify yourself in her eyes-for I fortunately removed her from Thorpe-Ambrose before this abominable report had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , for her sake , that she is not agitated and unsettled by hearing it where she is now . ' " Armadale 's petition to me , under these circumstances , entreats ( as I am the innocent cause of the new attack on his character ) that I will write to the major to absolve him of all indiscretion in the matter , and to say that he could not , in common politeness , do otherwise than accompany me to London . I forgive the impudence of his request , in consideration of the news that he sends me . It is certainly another circumstance in my favor , that the scandal at ThorpeAmbrose is not to be allowed to reach Miss Milroy 's ears . With her temper ( if she did bear it ) she might do something desperate in the way of claiming her lover , and might compromise me seriously . As for my own course with Armadale , it is easy enough . I shall quiet him by promising to write to Major Milroy ; and I shall take the liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " Nothing in the least suspicious has happened to-day . Whoever my enemies are , they have lost me , and between this and the time when I leave England they shall not find me again . I have been to the post-office , and have got the ticket for my luggage inclosed to me in a letter from All Saints ' Terrace , as I directed . The luggage itself I shall still leave at the cloakroom until I see the way before me more clearly than I see it now . " August 5th. - Two letters again from the hotel . Midwinter writes to remind me , in the prettiest possible way , that he will have lived long enough in the parish by to-morrow to be able to get our marriage license , and that he proposes applying for it in the usual way at Doctors ' Commons . Now , if I am ever to say it , is the time to say No . But I have n't the heart to disappoint him , he is so eager to marry me . " Armadale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for my kindness in writing to the major , sends me his best wishes , and bids me good-by till we meet again at Naples . He has learned from his friend that there are private reasons which will oblige him to forbid himself the pleasure of being present at our marriage . Under these circumstances , there is nothing to keep him in London . He has made all his business arrangements ; he goes to Somersetshire by to-night 's train , and , after staying some time with Mr. Brock , he will sail for the Mediterranean from the Bristol Channel ( in spite of Midwinter 's objections ) in his own yacht . // " The letter incloses a jeweler 's box , with a ring in it-Armadale 's present to me on my marriage . It is a rnby  --  but rather a small one , and set in the worst possible taste . He could have given Miss Milroy a ring worth ten times the money , if it had been her marriage present . There is no more hateful creature , in my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trumpery little yacht will drown him ? " I am so excited and fluttered I hardly know what I am writing . Not that I shrink from what is coming-I only feel as if I was being hurried on faster than I quite like to go . At this rate , if nothing happens , Midwinter will have married me by the end of the week . And then- ! " August 6th. - If any thing could startle me now , I should feel startled by the news that has reached me to-day . " On his return to the hotel this morning , after getting the Marriage License , Midwinter found a telegram waiting for him . It contained an urgent message from Armadale , announcing that Mr. Brock had had a relapse on the previous day , and that all hope of his recovery was pronounced by the doctors to be at an end . By the dying man 's own desire Midwinter was summoned to take leave of him , and was entreated by Armadale not to lose a moment in starting for the rectory by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tells me also that , by the time I receive it , Midwinter will be on his way to the west . He promised to write at greater length , after he had seen Mr. Brock , by to-night 's post . " This news has an interest for me which Midwinter little suspects . There is but one human creature besides myself who knows the secret of his birth and his name  --  and that one is the old man who now lies waiting for him at the point of death . What will they say to each other at the last moment ? Will some chance word take them back to the time when I was in Mrs. Armadale 's service at Madeira ? Will they speak of Me ? " August 7tlL-The promised letter has just reached me . No parting words have been exchanged between them-it was all over before Midwinter reached Somersetshire . Armadale met him at the rectory gate with the news that Mr. Brock was dead . " I try to struggle against it , but , coming after the strange complication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is something in this latest event of all that shakes my nerves . But one last chance of detection stood in my way when I opened my diary yesterday . When I open it to-day that chance is removed by Mr. Brock 's death . It means something ; I wish I knew what . " The funeral is to be on Saturday morning . Midwinter will attend it as well as Armadale . But he proposes returning to London first ; and he writes word that he will call to-night , in the hope of seeing me on his way from the station to the hotel . Even if there was any risk in it , I should see him , as things are now . But there is no risk if he comes here from the station , instead of coming from the hotel . " It is not ten o'clock yet-how am I to get through the long , lonely hours before Midwinter comes ? I ca n't read ; I ca n't work . If I had a piano-no , even if I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariness of this empty , solitary day ! If I could only sleep through it from now to the evening ! " Five o'cloclc. -I was not mistaken in believing that my nerves were all unstrung . Trifles that would not have cost me a second thought at other times weigh heavily on my mind now . " Two hours since , in despair of knowing how to get through the day , I bethought myself of the milliner who is making my summer dress . I had intended to go and try it on yesterday , but it slipped out of my memory in the excitement of hearing about Mr. Brock . So I went this afternoon , eager to do any thing that might help me to get rid of myself . I have returned , feeling more uneasy and more depressed than I felt when I went out-for I have come hack , fearing that I may yet have reason to repent not having left my unfinished dress on the milliner 's hands . " Nothing happened to me , this time , in the street . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused ; and there it certainly did cross my mind that the attempt to discover me , which I defeated at All Saints ' Terrace , was not given up yet , and that some of the shop*vomen had been tampered with , if not the mistress herself . " Can I give myself any thing in the shape of a reason for this impression ? Let me think a little . " I certainly noticed two things which were out of the ordinary routine , under the circumstances . In the first place , there were twice as many women as were needed in the trying-on room . This looked suspicious  --  and yet I might have accounted for it in more ways than one . Is it not the slack time now ? and do n't I know by experience that I am the sort of woman about whom other women are always spitefully curious ? I thought again , in the second place , that one of the assistants persisted rather oddly in keeping me turned in a particular direction , with my face toward the glazed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , she gave a reason when I asked for it . She said the light fell better on me that way ; and when I looked round there was the window to prove her right . Still , these trifles produced such an effect on me at the time that I purposely found . fault with the dress , so as to have an excuse for trying it on again , before I told them where I lived and had it sent home . Pure fancy , I dare say . Pure fancy , perhaps , at the present moment . I do n't care ; I shall act on // instinct ( as they say ) and give up the dress . In plainer words still , I wo n't go back . " llidnight. - An hour has passed since Midwinter left me ; and here I still sit , with my pen in my hand , thinking of him . No words of mine can describe what has passed between us . The end of it is all I can write in these pages  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution . For the first time since I saw the easy way to Armadale 's life at Thorpe-Ambrose I feel as if the man whom I have doomed in my own thoughts had a chance of escaping me . " Is it my love for Midwinter that has *iltered me ? Or is it his love for me that has taken possession , not only of all I wish to give him , but of all I wish to keep from him as well ? I feel as if I had lost myself-lost myself , I mean , in him-all through the evening . He was in great agitation about what had happened in Somersetshire ; and he made me feel as disheartened and as wretched about it as lie did . Though he never confessed it in words , I know that Mr. Brock 's death has startled him as an ill-omen for our marriage-I knew it , because I felt Mr. Brock 's death as an ill-omen too . The superstition-his superstition-took so strong a hold on me that when we grew calmer and he spoke of the future-when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his new employers , or go abroad , as he is pledged to go , on Monday next-I actually shrank at the thought of our marriage tollowing close on Mr. Broek 's funeral , I actually said to him , in the impulse of the moment , Go , and begin yonr new life alone ! go , and leave me here to wait ' for happier times . ' " He took me in his arms . lie sighed , and kissed me with an angelic tenderness . He said - oh , so softly and so sadly -* I have no life now apart from you . ' As these words passed his lips the . thought seemed to rise in my mind like an echo , Why not live out all the days that are left to me , happy and harmless , in a love like this ! ' I ca n't explain it-I ca n't realize it . That was the thought in me at the time ; and that is the thought in me still . I see my own hand while I write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is really the hand of Lydia Gwilt ! " Armadale " No ! I will never write , I will never think of Armadale again . " Yes ! Let me write once more-let me think once more of him , because it quiets me to know that he is going away , and that the sea will have parted us before I am married . His old home is home to him no longer , now that the loss of his mother has been followed by the loss of his best and earliest friend . When the funeral is over he has decided to sail the same day for the foreign seas . We may or we may not meet at Naples . Shall I be an altered woman if we do ? I wonder ! I wonder ! " August Sth. -A line from Midwinter. lie VOL . XXXII. - No. 190. -H in has gone back to Somersetshire to be in readiness for the Cuneral to-morro*v ; and he will return here ( after bidding Arinadale good-by ) tomorrow evening . " The last forms and ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ani to be his wife on Monday next . The hour must not be later than half past ten-which will give us just time , when the service is over , to get from the church door to the railway , and to start on our journey to Naples the same day . " To-day-Saturday-Sunday ! I am not afraid of the time ; the time will pass . I am not afraid of myself , if I can only keep all thoughts but one out of my mind . I love him ! Day and night , till Monday comes , I will think of nothing but that . I love him ! " Four oclock-Other thonghts arc forced into my mind in spite of me . My suspicions of yesterday were no mere fancies ; the milliner has been tampered with . My folly in going hack to her house has led to my being traced here . I am absolutely certain that I never gave the woman my address  --  and yet my new gown was sent home to me at two o*clock to-day ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil message to say that , as I had not called at the appointed time to try it on again , the ( Iress had been finished and sent to me . He caught me in the passage ; I had no choice but to pay the bill and dismiss him . Any other proceeding , as events have now turned out , would have been pure folly . The messenger ( not the man who tollowed me in the street , but another spy sent to look at me beyond all doubt ) would have dedared he knew nothing about it , if I had spoken to him . The milliner would tell me to my face , if I went to her , that I had given her ray address . The one useful thing to do now is to set my wits to work in the interests of my own security , and to step out of the false position in which nay own rashness has placed me-if I can . Seven o'clock-My spirits have risen again . I believe I am in a fair way of extricating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long round in a cab . First , to the cloak-room of the Great Western , to get the luggage which I sent there from All Saints ' Terrace . Next , to the cloakroom of the South Eastern , to leave my luggage ( labeled in Midwinter 's name ) , to wait for me till the starting of the tidal train on Monday . Next , to the General Post-office , to post a letter to Midwinter at the rectory , which he will receive to-morrow morning . Lastly back again to this house-from which I shall move no more till Monday comes . " My letter to Midwinter will , I have little doubt , lead to his seconding ( quite innocently ) the precautions that I am taking for my own safety . The shortness of the time at our disl ) 05a1 on Monday will oblige him to pay his bill at the hotel and to remove his luggage before the marriage ceremony takes place . All I ask // him to do beyond this is to take . the luggage " Eleven o'clock - We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( so as to make time before the day comes that makes us man any inquiries useless which may address them- and wife . selves to the servants at the hotel ) - and , that " lie has left me , as he left me before , with done , to meet me at the church door instead of an absorbing subject of interest to think of in calling for me here .

But it was impossible to ask appointed when he found that my family embarwhat I have been obliged to ask of him , without rassments would prevent our meeting to-morrow , making my false family circumstances once more and plainly uneasy at the prospect of leaving me the excuse ; and having this to do-I must own to find my way by myself on Monday to the the truth-I wrote to him because , after what I church . But there was a certain hopefulness suffered on the last occasion , I can never again and composure of manner underlying it all , deceive him to his face . which produced so strong an impression on me that I was obliged to notice it .

The letter had only that day been discovered , dropped , and lost , under the bed on which Mr. Brock had died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person to whom it was addressed was Midwinter himself . " Having told me this , nearly in the words in which I have written it , he lifted his hand from the written paper that lay on the table between us . " Read it , he said ; and you will not need to be told that my mind is at peace again , and that I took Allan 's hand at parting , with a heart that was worthier of Allan 's love . ' " I read the letter . There was no superstition to be conquered in my mind ; there were no old feelings of gratitude toward Armadale to be roused in my heart  --  and yet , the effect which the letter had had on Midwinter was , I firmly believe , more than matched by the effect that the letter now produced on Me . " It was vain to ask him to leave it , and to let me read it again ( as I wished ) when I was left by myself . He is determined not to let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it side by side with that other paper which I had seen him take out of his pocket-book , and which contains the written narrative of Armadale 's Dream . All I could do was to ask his leave to copy it ; and this he granted readily . I wrote the copy in his presence ; and I now place it here in my diary , to mark a day which is one of the memorable days of my life : " Boscoxaz REOTOP.Y , August 2 . " Mv DEAR MIDwINTErm ,  --  For the first time since the beginning of my illness , I found strength enough yesterday to look over my letters . One among them is is letter from Allan , which has been lying unopened on my table for ten days l ) ast . He writes to me in great distress , to say that there has been dissension between you , and that you have left him . If you still remember what passed between us , when you first opened your heart to me in the Isle of Man , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought over this miserable news , through the night that has now passed , and you will not he surprised to hear that I have roused myself this morning to make the effort of writing to you . Although I am far from despairing of myself , I dare not , at my age , trust too confidently to my prospects of recovery . While the time is still my own I must employ it for Allan 's sake and for yours . " I want no explanation of the circumstances which have parted you from your friend . If my estimate of your character is not founded on an entire delusion , the one influence which can have led to your estrangement from Allan is the influence of that evil spirit of Superstition , which I have once already cast out of your heart-which I will once again conquer , please God , if I have strength enough to make my pen speak my mind to you in this letter . " It is no part of my design to combat the belief which I know you to hold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pilgrimage through this world . Speaking as a reasonable man , I own that I can not prove you to be wrong . Speaking as a believer in the Bible , I am bound to go farther , and to admit that you possess a higher than any human warrant for the faith that is in you . The one object which I have it at heart to attain , is to induce you to free yourself from the paralyzing fatalism of the heathen and the savage , and to look at the mysteries that perplex , and the portents that daunt you , from the Christian 's point of view . If I can succeed in this , I shall clear your mind of the ghastly doubts that now oppress it , arid I shall reunite you to your friend , never to he parted from him again . " I have no means of seeing and questioning you . I can only send this letter to Allan to be for*varded , if he knows , or can discover , your present address . Placed in this position toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assumed in your favor . I will take it for granted that something has happened to you or to Allan , which to your mind has not only confirmed the fatalist conviction in which your father died , but has added a new and terrible meaning to the warning which he sent you in his death-bed letter . " On this common ground I meet you . On this common ground I appeal to your higher nature and your better sense . " Preserve your present conviction that the events which have happened ( he they what they may ) are not to be reconciled with ordinary mortal coincidences and ordinary mortal laws ; and view your own position hy the best and clearest light that your superstition can throw on it . What are you ? You are a helpless instrument in the hands of Fate . You are doomed , beyond all human capacity of resistance , to bring misery and destrubtion blindfold on a man to whom you have harmlessly and gratefully united yourself in the bonds of a brother 's love . All that is morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , avails nothing against the hereditary impulsion of you toward evil , caused by a crime which your father committed before you were born . In what does that belief end ? It ends in the darkness in which you are no'v lost ; in the self-contradictions in which you are univ bewildered in the stubborn despair by which a man profanes his own soul , and lowers himself to the level of the brutes that perish . " Look up , my poor suffering brother-look up , my hardly-tried , my well-loved friend , higher than this ! Meet the doubts that now assail you from the blessed vantage-ground of Christian courage and Christian hope ; and your heart will turn again to All an , and your mind will be at peace . Happen what may , God is all-merciful , God is all-ivise : natural or supernatural , it happens through him . The mystery of Evil that perplexes our feeble minds , the sorrow and the suffering that torture us in this little life , leave the one great truth unshaken that the destiny // of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God*s blessed Son died to make us worthier * ? it . Nothing that is done in unquestioning submission to the wisdom of the Almighty is done wrong . No evil exists , out of which , in obedience to His laws , Good may not come . Be true to what Christ tells you is true . Encouruge in yourself , be the circumstances what they may , all that is loving , all that is grateful , all that is patient , all that is forgiving , toward your fellow-men . And humbly and trustfully leave the rest to the God who made you , aud to the Saviour who loved you better than his own life . " This is the faith in which I have lived , by the Divine help and mercy , from my youth upward , I ask you earnestly , I ask you confidently , to make it your faith too . It is the mainspring of all the good I have ever done , of all the happiness I have ever known ; it lightens my darkness , it sustains my hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live or die , I know not which . Let it sustain , enml'uiv* und en you . It will help you in your sorest need , as it has helped me in mine . It will show you another purpose in the events which brought you and Allan together than the purpose which your guilty father foresaw . Strange things , I do not deny it , have happened to you already . Stranger things still may happen before long , which I may not live to see . Remember , if that time comes , that I died firmly disbelieving in your influence over Allan being other than an influence for good . The great sacrifice of the Atonement-I say it reverently-has its mortal reflections , even in this world . It danger ever threatens Allan , you , whose father took his father 's life-you , and no other , may be the man whom the providence of God has . appointed to save him . " Come to me , if I live . Go back to the friend who loves you , whether 1 live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *DEC1MUS Betocet .

' " Those are the words which have shaken me to the soul . Those are the words which make me feel as if the dead man had left his grave , and had put his hand on the place in my heart where my terrible secret lies hidden from every living creature but myself . One part of the letter has come true already . The danger that it foresees threatens Armadale at this momentaudi threatens him from Me ! " If the favoring circumstances and the frightful temptation which have driven me thus fir drive me on to the end ; and if that old man 's last earthly conviction is prophetic of the truth , Armnadale will escape me , do what I may , and Midwinter will be the victim who is sacrificed to save his life . " It is horrible ! it is impossible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only my hand trembles and my heart sinks . I bless the trembling that unnerves me ! I bless the sinking that turns me faint ! I bless ' those words in the letter which have revived the relenting thoughts that first came to me two days since ! Is it hard , now that events are taking me. smoothly and safely , nearer and nearer to the End ? is it hard to conquer the temptation to go on ? No ! it is easy to conquer the temptation-for Midwinter 's sake . I have never loved him yet , never , never , never as I love him now ! " Sunday , Asequst lOt/i. - The eve of my wedding-day !
