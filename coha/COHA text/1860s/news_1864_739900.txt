txt The present New-Year in Nashville deserves special honor and grateful acknowledgment . All things in and around the city for many miles away , with the hopes , prospects , feelings of those who love the grand old Union , are happily changed within a year . Sojourners not only , but ' citizens , true of heart , exult today in the sense of security to our blessed institutions , and which they deeply believe will be abiding . They look Into the future , and see the portentous clouds , that for so many months lowered . over the land . threatening to burst with desolating fury far and wide , manifestly breaking away and letting the glad sunshine . through , God 's harbinger:of the . calm and the peace and the joy which are surely soon to cheer us . A New-Year 's Day with such healing in its beams , should be a very lustrous one indeed A twelvemonth ago ROSECRANS still had his headquarters here , For some days previously his army had begun to move slowly toward the South  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and a battle to decide the possession of Nashville. , and of Middle and Western Tennessee as well , liable at any moment to occur . The issue of that battle , when it should come , was felt to involve stupendous consequences . The rebel  --  favorers hoped and prayed for the success of their arms , while they trembled for the result . All staunch Union souls shared the grim uncertainty . The country all around was agitated by war 's alarums . A Union man or party chancing to stray a few miles beyond the city on either side , was liable to be fired upon or captured by guerrilla ruffians . The Cumberland from Nashville to its junction wltn the Ohio , was a gauntlet of of fire and peril which no craft short of a gunboat was brave enough to run . The banks of the Mississippi bristled with hostile cannon , and commerce was sighing for a safe transit  --  a very remote realization , seemingly  --  to the Gulf . The railroad between Louisville and Nashville was frequently broken up , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human or other freight , a rather risky business . In short , Nashville may be said to have been , one year ago , in jeopardy every hour , and everything in and about it wore the look of a place whose very tenure was doubtful and its fate wrapped in mystery that none might pierce . ROSECRAN8 ' great victory at Stone River , on the very opening of the year , wrought a wondrous change . The line of Tennessee in the Union was moved by that splendid stroke to Chattanooga , to remain there till it should be pushed still farther forward and embrace East Tennessee in its restoring girdle . The victories of GRANT and BANKS made the Mississippi free , and restored safe communication by this great highway between Nashville and New-Orleans . Guerrilla raids and depredations became less and less frequent and fierce , owing to the energy with which these bandits were pursued , and the sharp Punishment they were almost certain to receive . An obstruction on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , from this source , is now a very rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing down ' the Cumberland , without molestation . Farmers and producers , from the country for a score of miles around Nashville , come to the city to traffic , and re ? turn home , with perfect immunity from harm . The feeling , the certainty that Nashville is anchored to the Union , and can never glide , if she would , from beneath the protecting and saving Stars and Stripes , is producing its appropriate results , Prominent among them is abhorrence of a rebellion which , without gaining a solitary beneficial end , or any end it proposed to gain , has sacrificed myriads of lives and covered the land with mourning . The sober second thought has come or is coming to the people here . They see that the rebellion ham been evil and only evil ; that their only hope and safe . ty is the Union . Numbers of the misguided are long . ing to have its protecting arms around them again am in the good old prosperous times .

These are all favorable symptoms of returning sanity and sense . More than all , discussions of the evils of Slavery , and its incompatibility with a permanent peace and s true prosperity , is an everyday occurrence with those who a brief time ago would as soon have quote tinned their own existence as the immovable stability of the " divinely given institution . " In truth , as good old Galileo averred , " the earth does move . " And its motion for the twelve months past has found signal correspondence here , in the progress of ideas in the direction of Liberty and Union , of Truth and Right . The twelvemonth to come will no doubt witness for these ideas a still more beneficent expansion . Tennessee will have come to herself , and restored fully to the Union , will occupy a higher place than she ever did among her sister stars  --  for being true to freedom , she will never more prove false to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its suggestive memories , its present promise , and hopes ol better things to come , should be a very happy one to Tennessee . There is more emphasis laid upon the Christmas holidays here than there is at tite North . The people regard and treat them more in the spirit of " Merry England " than we are wont to do . Social and festive gatherings , congratulations , music , mirth and merriment , mark the auspicious day . The " inferior race , " is specially hilarious and jubilant on the arrival of Christmas , for the interval between this and the New Year is , prescriptively , Sambo 's own . No work and all play , or merry-making , while the golden hours glide away . Nothing done for nothing , is his motto . If he consents to work , It is only from a sheer good will or a more solid " consideration .

But this is leading me astray from my Christmas holiday topic , on which I shall only add that our " boys " in hospital did not enjoy the luxury of a Christmas dinner , specially provided , as on Thanksgiving Day , for the reason that the extraordinary effort to furnish forth the latter quite exhausted our supplies ? so difficult in this far-off region  --  though the good will remained the same . We envied Louisville a little , whose numerous hospitals were provided with a sumptuous repast worthy of the day . But having ampler means at hand , and a large and rich and loyal city , not war-scathed , as this is , their successful effort to make glad the soldier 's heart will be put down to the account , not of superior benevolence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is la course of being rapidly circumscribed Out of twentyfour , filled full after the fight of Chickamauga , not more than eight or nine will remain open , several being closes up already , . The reason for this step is economy . The cost of running one of these huge establishments , with its legion of doctors , nurses , subordinates , ( 56c .. is enormous . To close a dozen of these in a city is a vast saving to the Government , as to keep one open unnecessarily , involves a wanton wasto of the nation 's money . We have another spasm of piercing weather , which rushed upon us suddenly , Introduced by gusts and hail and sleet'ast evening . This is far the fiercest yetinsinuating its icy clutches into our very bed-rooms , showing v ? titer-pan and pitcher covered this morning with an inch-thick robe of ire . This is a great feat for Tennessee . Two 1-i-enlisted soldiers , 1 learn , on their way home , on leave , were found to-day frozen to death . God pity the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress may force them to wander abroad for bread , saying , " Where is it ?
