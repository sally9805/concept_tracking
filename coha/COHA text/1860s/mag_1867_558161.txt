WHILE the engrossing problem of the present hour is indubitably that of Southern restoration , there are nevertheless several secondary questions which crowd the antechamber of public discussion , and eagerly await their turn for final settlement . // Pre-eminent among these is one on which the commercial and political prosperity of the country in no small degree depends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foresight that modern legislation is master of is needed . This is the monopolizing tendency of the carrying trade , whether it relate to the transmission of telegraphic messages , of freight , or of human passengers . The political use which the management of well-known railroads have made of their extraordinary powers is another feature that may justly alarm the thoughtful men of all parties ; and this danger is equally menacing to the probity of our legislators and the purity of the ballot-box . It is not our intention in the present article to discuss the remedy for these evils , or to expose them in any general way . We propose to exhibit , by a rapid , though somewhat extended examination , the growth , the ordinary working , and the paralyzing influences of one representative monopoly ; and it is to the instructive facts in the history of the Joint Railroad and Canal Companies of New Jersey that we would now call the reader 's attention . Partly , however , in extenuation of the offending State , partly also because the antecedent facts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without historic interest , we shall permit ourselves to pause a moment on the threshold of the subject , in order to glance briefly at certain attendant circumstances in the creation of this gigantic monopoly , which explain , although they do not justify , the legislation on which it was based . The necessity of a more direct and rapid communication between New York and Philadelphia than could be furnished by the existing roads was painfully impressed upon the nation during the war of 1812 . In that struggle the government expended some two millions of dollars for the cartage of military stores across the Jersey peninsula . When , therefore , New York , under the skilful lead of DeWitt Clinton , began to push forward the Erie Canal , the proposition for a similar connection between the Hudson and the Delaware met with considerable favor . A company was accordingly formed , and , although many citizens of New Jersey objected to a hasty surrender of franchises which might prove of vast value , this difficulty was finally surmounted , and a charter obtained from // the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act made the grant dependent on the willingness of Pennsylvania to permit the Delaware River , over which it had a jbint proprietorship , to be tapped for a feeder , which previous surveys had shown to be essential for the success of the canal . On applying for the assent of that State , the company suddenly encountered an exasperating and unexpected obstacle . Permission , indeed , was given , but on terms tantamount to a refusal . It was demanded that the feeder should be navigable , that its course should be changed , and that the tolls thereon should be one fourth the rate allowed by the charter , being a less sum than had ever been adopted on any canal in the world . Moreover , if New Jersey should ever refuse Pennsylvania a similar use of the common stream , or if the feeder should at any time lower the water of the river more than an inch , the consent was to be revoked . Thus hampered with impossible conditions , and the continuance of their privileges rendered subject to the chance good-will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the effects of a droubht , the company was sorely perplexed . As a last resort they once more memorialized the Assembly at Harrisburg , begging for a modification of the demands . The response to this petition was much the same as that made by Rehoboam to the people of Israel . Repealing the former act , the Legislature substituted in its place a bill the terms of which were even more intolerable , requiring in return for the desired privilege that the company , whose capital was limited to a million , should erect works calculated to benefit Pennsylvania solely , and which would cost more than two millions of dollars ! The projectors , who had thus far been unremitting in their efforts toward interstate navigation , had now no alternative but to retire , not without serious money losses , from the field . One result followed on this illiberality of legislation . In New Jersey the canal movement had been favored only by a meagre majority . Stage-owners , inn-keepers , and the turnpike corporations opposed it . Many farmers resisted it , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessen the sale of wood in New York . The conservative element was in natural antagonism to it ; and the original bill had passed the // House by only one majority , gained by " log-rolling " with a similar enterprise in the northern part of the State . But the action of Pennsylvania was felt to be so unjust and ungenerous , that a sudden change came over the people at large , and they began to look upon the navigation scheme as affording a means of retaliation . Moreover , the deep current of New Jersey prejudice already set with equal strength against its eastern neighbor . For by a curious concatenation of causes the imperial State of New York had likewise been persuaded into the infliction of injuries , not only peculiarly offensive , but also of long continuance . The source of these injuries was the famous steamboat monopoly of Livingston and Fulton . In 1787 , four of the great central States had granted to ingenious , but poor and ill-starred John Fitch , certain special privileges of steam navigation . The untiring inventor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for vessels , or credit for machinery ; and several years slipped by without any fruit from his labors . Meanwhile Robert Fulton had been experimenting in the same direction , and had succeeded in bringing his discoveries to a practical shape . At Paris circumstances threw him in contact with Chancellor Livingston , then Minister Plenipotentiary to France , and that statesman , having already interested himself in steamboat construction , entered warmly into the new project , and advanced funds to carry it on for the joint benefit of Fulton and himself . Returning home , they procured in 1798 the passage by the New York Legislature of an act which repealed Fitch 's exclusive privileges , on the ground that he had made no use of his invention , and was supposed to be dead , ' ' and granted similar ones to Livingston for the term of twenty years . In 1803 a second law was enacted , making Fulton a co-associate , and extending the grant to 1823 . Finally , upon the successful working of the " Clermont " in 1807 , a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each additional boat that they should build , - the whole term , however , not to extend beyond 1838 . The field now seemed clear for the enterprising projectors , and they immediately proceeded to enlarge the revenue of their valuable franchises by the construction of the " Car of Neptune , " and other boats of lesser burden . Rival steam-lines // were driven from the New York waters , and when at length opposition disclosed itself at Albany , the case was rapidly forced up to the Court of Errors , where the claims of Livingston and Fulton were effectually maintained . The protection thus secured remained undisturbed during the remainder of their lives . A more formidable resistance was soon offered by the two adjoining States . As Connecticut steam-vessels entering New York harbor without Fulton 's license were forfeited by New York law , Connecticut retaliated by seizing such vessels as entered her domain having that license . Against New Jersey the pretensions of New York were especially arrogant . The monopolists , sustained by the Legislature and the courts , held that their grant covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of the bay which formed the dividing line between the two States . Under this construction non-licensed vessels were not only precluded from carrying on the long-established trade between New York and New Jersey , but even from plying between two ports in the latter State . Moreover , Fulton and his colleague had made themselves peculiarly odious by permitting their sub-agents to exact extortionate charges , while passengers were compelled to pay for meals , whether eaten or not ; and the New Jersey stage proprietors were taxed twenty-five cents for every person whom they transferred to the boats . The indignation which this conduct occasioned was heightened by the fact that the use of steam as a propelling power by no means originated with the monopolists , and that both Fitch and John Stevens had prior claims , in no respect invalidated by their ill success with c*italists and legislators . New Jersey , therefore , determined upon a counterblast . During the session of 1811 an act was passed at Trenton which provided that any citizen of the State who had suffered from the invidious law should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her waters . Two years later a further enactment declared that , " whereas Fitch died without deriving any benefit from the exclusive privilege awarded him ( March 18 , 1786 ) , and whereas his executor had sold his rights to Aaron Ogden , who had advanced capital to Daniel Dod , and thus made great improvements in steamboat navigation , the said Ogden and Dod // shall have sole and exclusive rights for two years within New Jersey jurisdiction , or until New York shall except New Jersey boats from its law , with right to seize all steamboats infringing on Dod 's improvement , including all New York boats found in New Jersey waters . " Here were rival interests , each claiming , under the laws of their respective States , the exclusive navigation of the same waters . Fulton , now left alone by the decease of Livingston , saw in these measures the death-blow to one of the chief sources of his revenue . A compromise was proposed and summarily rejected . The builder of the " Clermont , " exasperated at this cavalier treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot the owner if he ventured to navigate the Hudson , and that the intruder should be crushed , if there were power enough in his adopted State to do it . He resolved to go further , and to carry the war into Africa . Ogden , who had recently been a Governor of the State during the temporary supremacy of the Federalists , had made himself specially oW noxious to the Democrats . At the next session of the New Jersey Legislature this party was in a majority , and Fulton , accompanied by John H. Livingston , the brother of the late Chancellor , who had purchased the right of navigating the contested waters , presented himself at Trenton , soliciting the repeal of the recent law , and asking that the question might be heard by counsel . The petition was accorded , and an investigation ensued , lasting two weeks . It was proved that Fulton had been anticipated in his invention ; that he had pirated much and falsified more . But the keen New York monopolist , contenting himself with a bold denial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective means of gaining his ends . The issue was made a partisan one . So bitter was the animosity of the Democrats against the exGovernor , that the Speaker swore at him from his desk . IRecalcitrant members of the party were forced and browbeaten into acting against their convictions . One legislator was dragged into the room to vote . Bribes were freely used , and , finally , the law was repealed by a majority of three in the lower house and one in the upper . Having thus re-established his exclusive privileges , Fulton // turned to his home ; but , in crossing the Hudson to New York in an open boat , he was exposed for some hours to a winter storm , and contracted an illness which speedily proved fatal . His death left the monopoly in the hands of John IR . Livingston , who within two months effectually ended Ogden 's opposition , by making him a joint associate in the management . The monopoly now , however , encountered a formidable antagonist in Thomas Gibbons of New Jersey , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . Dividing his ample means , he appropriated one share to the maintenance of his steamboats , and another to his determination to " smash Ogden . " The gossip of the time was not slow to impute a personal motive to this quarrel ; and it is known that Gibbons had once challenged his opponent for " interfering in a dispute between Mrs. Gibbons and " himself . Be this as it may , he at once proceeded to act upon his resolution by taking out a United States coasting license , and establishing a line between New York and Elizabethtown . When enjoined by the New York Court of Chancery , he found a temporary evasion in transferring passengers from vessels legally licensed to his own , thus bringing them to the same destination , and at a less cost than by the boats of the monopolists . The " Bellona , " which was employed for this purpose , had for its captain Cornelius Vanderbilt , a name not unfamiliar to the present generation .. Being again enjoined and compelled to pay costs , Gibbons , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Supreme Court , betook himself to the Legislature of his own State . At the opening of the session of 1820 , Governor Williamson , in a special message , recounted the progress of the steamboat dispute , and advised the adoption of " effectual measures to assert and maintain free from interruption the just rights of the citizens of New Jersey . " The Legislature responded by passing a bill , providing that any one availing himself of the New York Court of Chancery to molest citizens of New Jersey navigating between the States , besides being liable to them for all damages and for triple costs , should be perpetually enjoined from using New Jersey waters or bringing passengers into the State . This act , of the nature of a hostile pronunciamento , had an immediate effect . No further // applications for injunctions in New York were allowed , and both sides waited patiently for the decision of the supreme tribunal . In 1824 the case finally came up before the court , and the cause of Gibbons , their client , was supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Thomas Addis Emmet could combat , and which secured from the bench , then occupied by Chief Justice Marshall , an indorsement that settled the fate of the monopoly forever . The reader will have already observed that the main events in this controversy preceded a little space that of the Pennsylvania difficulty . But the constant irritation of several years had produced a profound effect . Prejudices were excited which colored every discussion , and the traditions of that struggle have had a modifying effect upon New Jersey legislation even to the present day . The feeder dispute now added fresh acrimony to the popular ill-feeling , and the fact that two States had become offenders intensified while it divided the resentment . It was not long before the passions of the hour found vent in harsh measures of retaliation . The discomfiture of the first project for interstate travel , far from discouraging capitalists , resulted in setting on foot , not merely a new canal scheme , but also that of a railroad as a substitute . These enterprises , rivals for the same trade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State with stormy agitation . Governor I. H. Williamson , who had occupied the executive chair for more than ten years , threw his influence on the side of the water route , and in 1829 called special attention in his message to a recent act of the Pennsylvania legislature authorizing the Bristol and Lehigh Canal , by which the Delaware would be tapped , and the unfriendly State be compelled , for the sake of consistency , to offer no further obstacles to the construction of a similar work in New Jersey . It was not , however , till the session of 1830 that final action was taken . In the General Assembly of that year the advocates of neither project could secure a working majority , as they embraced only the representatives of the counties which were to be directly favored by the extension through their sections of the rival routes . It was , nevertheless , possible , by combining votes , to make both measures law ; and , in preference // to mutual defeat , this alternative was chosen . Accordingly , on the 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company , and on the same day a charter was granted to the Camden and Amboy Transportation Company . The only protective clause in either act was a provision preventing the construction of a second canal or a new railroad within five and three miles severally of the commencement and termination of the respective works . The capital stock of each corporation was fixed at a million of dollars , with power of increase to the extent of half a million more . Tariff rates were established for each route , and a system of transit dues , to be paid in to the State , was also incorporated in the charter . In this temporary coalition only one party achieved an immediate advantage . The railroad was a success . Offering early returns to the investment of capital , it had an additional support in being under the control of practical men , who had already proved their ability to turn a penny into a pound . Conspicuous among these were John Stevens and his three sons , John , Robert , and Edwin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State than that of this remarkable family . Owning all Hoboken and vicinity , and devoting themselves assiduously to their business , the Stevenses had accumulated sufficient wealth to hold a stringent monopoly of the through stage route , their steady tactics being to drop fares below cost until competition was killed off , and then to raise them to the maximum of popular endurance . Energetic and adventurous , they succeeded in so perfecting the stage-lines - which when Franklin was Postmaster had made the journey from Philadelphia to New York in two and a half summer days - that the traveller between the cities secured an easy passage in seven hours . This rapidity of transit was in part attained by a steamboat on the waters of New York Bay . Here Fulton 's privilege hampered them , and their interest in the steamboat controversy was quite as great as that of either Ogden or Gibbons . John Stevens , the father , like his son Robert afterward , was prominent in the mechanical discoveries of the age . In 1804 he had put the steamer Phenix on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pamphlet on railroads , and // a proposition , which the Legislature laughed down , for connecting the Hudson and Delaware by this novel mode of transportation , He was not , however , of a nature to permit defeat ; and by enlisting his sons in the scheme , by keeping up a chronic agitation and seizing the proper moment , he had now succeeded in bringing his ideas to a satisfactory conclusion . No sooner was legislative indorsement of the road obtained , than the Stevenses showed their faith by taking more than half of the stock , and vigorously pressing the work to a completion . Meanwhile the canal enterprise languished . No one would buy the scrip . Out of fifteen thousand shares only eleven hundred and thirty-four had been taken . It seemed impossible to preserve the charter . At this critical juncture there suddenly stepped into the arena a man whose enthusiasm , pluck , and large wealth gave a new aspect to affairs . This was Robert Field Stockton , the grandson of one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm friends and fierce enemies in almost equal numbers . His career up to the moment under consideration had been brilliant , and there were features in it calculated to command a wide-spread popularity . *He had served under Commodore Rogers during the war of 1812 , had helped to punish the Algerines , had done much to root out the slave-trade , and had enhanced his growing renown by pursuing to their fastnesses the pirates of the Caribbean Sea . In Spain he had fought a duel with a British officer who had insulted his nation . In Africa , with three companions , he had penetrated the jungles and cowed down an angry mob of natives , so that they fell to the ground as before one gifted with divine authority , and he had compelled the trembling chief , under the coercion of a loaded revolver , to make a grant of Liberia . Returning home , and plunging into politics , he revolutionized his State by the sheer force of personal influence , carrying it for Adams in the face of a long series of Democratic victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence might easily have won his way . But Captain Stockton added to the prestige of his naval and political exploits a courtly politeness , an insidious suavity , generous impulses , and great apparent frankness . He was also still under thirty , and the young country gentlemen es // pecially adhered to him . Like them , he took a keen pleasure in the hunt . He entered with great zest into the hazards and the joy of the turf . At one time he owned the finest stud in America . Nor is it one of the least singular phases of his character , that , with this taste for what many good people regard as demoralizing amusements , he was habitually free from intemperance , profanity , and cognate vices . Happening to be at home on a long furlough at the present emergency , he interested himself in the canal , and , perceiving the magnificent opportunity it afforded for the exhibition of his peculiar powers , he persuaded his wealthy father-in-law , John Potter , to embark money in the enterprise . With this assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty treasury of the company . He did more . Heretofore , the Stevens family had displayed superior ability in legislative manipulation ; he now determined to defeat them in their stronghold . At the next session Captain Stockton appeared with a bill which , while it required an enlargement of the proposed dimensions of the canal , contained the germ of a railroad grant . By running a track along the line of the water-way , the company would thus be able to double its revenue and ruin its antagonist by competition . This modification of the charter met with an energetic but ineffectual resistance on the part of the Camden and Amboy managers . The young naval officer added a fresh leaf to his laurels , and the bill became a law . The result of the Stockton strategy soon discovered itself . A proposition came from the Stevens party which , after having been duly considered by the Delaware and Raritan leaders , was finally acceded to . The rival corporations were to coalesce . Accordingly , on the 15th of February , 1831 , the amalgamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the " Marriage Act . " The terms of this measure declared the capital of the two coNpanies consolidate , the stock joint , the dividends dependent upon the aggregate earnings , and the management resident in the hands of a superior board of direction . The bitterness against New York thus united with the bitterness against Pennsylvania . The two companies combined the best modes of intercommunication between the East and South , and were already in the possession of a mo // nopoly by virtue of their double capital . It only remained to fortify this position by bringing the State into a partnership in their operations , and thereby secure to what was already a practical control of through travel the additional safeguard of law . Nor was an adequate pretext wanting . The increase in the size of the canal , rendered obligatory by Captain Stockton 's bill , made it necessary that the capital stock should be largely increased . But , as it was alleged , the loans for this object could uot be negotiated without more satisfactory guaranties . The agents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a fresh proposition . The right of the State to take one fourth of the stock of the canal company was to be abrogated . In lieu of this a transfer would be made of one thousand shares of the joint capital stock , upon which all instalments should be paid by the companies , the State to appoint one director to represent said stock , but without a vote in the proceedings of the board . As New Jersey was already an owner of a thousand shares in the Camden and Amboy Railroad by a provision of the charter of that company , she would thns be in possession of two thousand shares of stock without payment of a single mill . But the companies were ready to be even more liberal . If the State would insure them against all danger of competition , they would pledge themselves to pay into the treasury an annual revenue of not less than thirty thousand dollars , in transit dues and dividends , from the day the works were completed . Here was a tempting bribe , artful in its construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring of money in it , which captivated the people of a State whose provident finances had passed into a proverb . To lower the tax-estimate almost to a nullity by a mere act of retributive legislation , was to realize something beyond the dreams of the shrewdest politician at Trenton . Early in the succeeding year , therefore , a bill embodying the proposed contract was introduced in the General Assembly , and on the 2d of March became a law without serious opposition . The prohibitory clause was to the following effect - " SEc. 2 . And be it enacted , That it shall not he lawful , at any time during the said railroad charter , to construct any other railroad // or railroads in this State , without the consent of the said companies , which shall be intended or used for the transportation of passengers or merchandise between the cities of New York and Philadelphia , or to compete in business with the railroad authorized by the act to which this supplement is relative , etc . " Nothing could be broader or more exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this grant the State pledged whatever sovereignty is inherent in it to prevent the building of any railroad which could be used for the through carriage of freibht or passengers between the waters of the Delaware and Hudson . Of the unconstitutionality of this enactment there can be but one opinion . The regulation of interstate commerce is resident in Congress by the express language of the national Constitution , and the United States Supreme Court has more than once recognized this in its decisions . It was this very question which was involved in the famous steamboat controversy ; and the ruling of Chief Justice Marshall , with which New Jersey for the past five years had been ringing , applied with no less force to the Camden and Amboy Railroad than to Ogden 's monopoly . The same principle has also been strenuously maintained by Justices Story , McLean , and Grier . And it is but little more than a year ago that in a case precisely similar to this , - that of the Erie Railroad Company vs . The State of New Jersey ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the exercise by a State of a prerogative of this character , either so far as to burden transportation , or to prevent it altogether , is a regulation of commerce which falls under the prohibition of the Gonstitution of the United States . " By this decision of its own supreme tribunal , therefore , New Jersey is convicted of having asserted a power totally inadmissible in the present structure of government . Nor can there be found a stronger proof of the immense and dangerous influence of large moneyed corporations , than is afforded by the tenacity with which for more than thirty years the joint companies have upheld their railroad privilege , in palpable defiance of the national law . It ought not to be supposed , however , that New Jersey sought in this covenant to place itself in antagonism with the natioft . The history of the time shows a disposition // on the part of all the States to push the exercise of their sovereignty to the broadest possible limits . Massachusetts and New York imposed taxes on alien passengers arriving at their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ohio River to the State of Ohio . Virginia asserted a similar prerogative over the same stream . And , in comparison with these claims , the protection given the Camden and Amboy monopoly was neither harsh nor offensive . The error of the State was immense , but scarcely calculable at the time . In its haste to punish the adjacent communities , and its greed to reap the benefits of two hundred thousand dollars in stocks and the transit tax of ten cents on each passenger and fifteen cents on each ton of freight , it unwittingly became particeps criminis , and was compelled step by step to acquiesce in measures the most repugnant and the most humiliating . From the day that the bill became a law , New Jersey parted with its freedom . The affined companies clung to the contract with the avidity of a Shylock . At every breath of opposition , they pointed to the letter of the bond . And , inasmuch as the railroad and canal were paying nearly the whole of the State tax , while their revenue seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in the minds of the managers a sense of State ownership , which gave an arrogance to their conduct totally inconceivable to any one not intimately versed in the secret politics of New Jersey . Up to this point we have found it all clear sailing . The facts we have collated , though difficult of access , have in no wise conflicted , and may be depended upon with as much confidence as any historical data . Though mainly antecedent to the monopoly , they show the influences which converged to its establishment , and may also stand as a warning against hasty legislation , and the madness which gives to temporary passion the permanence of law . But the details that follow are of a more painful description , while the labor of separating truth from falsehood , or , at best , floating and unsubstantiated opinion , has been correspondingly arduous . We have arrived at that stage where the State becomes secondary , and its creature first . From 1832 onward , New Jersey is , practically , Camden and Amboy ; and the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the people , of crimes of a corporation in the name of a State , of bargaining and corruption , of adroit ring management , of plundering reduced to a science , screened from punishment and calling itself patriotism . The sources of information lay in many separate directions . Newspapers filled with windy rumor , rank with partisanship and plausible falsehood , were to be consulted , and the grains of truth to be eliminated out of reams of rubbish . The archives of the State library are defective , and many important documents , which might have thrown light upon obscure transactions of the joint companies , have very curiously disappeared . Copies of journals desirable to establish a date , or to determine a fact , have been cut from the files , and knavishly destroyed . An imniense swarm of pamphlets , etc. were to be looked through , and the conflicting nature of their statements is such as almost to defy any satisfactory conclusions . There is the material for two octavo volumes of interesting particulars in the ensuing struggle , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter would be scarcely sufficient , has added to the perplexities of the task . If , in these circumstances , it shall be found that here and there an error of opinion or of fact has crept in , the fault should be attributed only to the obscurity of the subject , and the tortuous and subterranean character of the joint companies ' transactions . Conscious of the advantage of bringing their franchises into immediate and lucrative use , the management of the companies pressed with energy the completion of the railroad . In the same year with the compact , the track was graded and rails laid from Bordentown to South Amboy . In the winter of 18*3 it was carried west as far as Rancocus , and by the spring of 18*4 the whole line was in practical operation . At this juncture the monopoly found itself confronted by unexpected opposition . Five days after the passage of the Protective Act , a charter had been granted at Trenton to the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company , permitting the construction of a track from Jersey City to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation whenever any other railroad should so intersect their line as to constitute a through road from Pennsylvania to New York . Meanwhile , the former State // had just incorporated the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad , and a subsequent addition to the charter empowered the company to purchase property in any direction whereby a continuous line to New York city could be accomplished . In pursuance of this purpose , the Straight Turnpike from Trenton to New Brunswick was bought up , and preparations were made for laying a track . There were features in this movement which gave it special popularity . The Camden and Amboy road afforded no facilities for travel to the State capital . Assembly-men were compelled to rely upon a stage route , which incessant alternation of frost and thaw throughout the months of the session made doubly disagreeable . The projected line would largely obviate this , - passing according to plan through the most thickly-settled portions of the State , while the distance to New York city would at the same time be shortened eleven miles . It was in fact very nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ticket by the New Jersey Railroad . Against this formidable scheme the joint companies had nothing to oppose but the bargain , and the still lingering jealousies of the State . Of these , their main-stay seemed crumbling under foot . Eminent jurists , among them Judge Taney , pronounced the exclusive privileges unconstitutional . The first lawyer of Philadelphia , Joseph R. Ingersoll , appeared for the Straight Turnpike Company before the Legislature at Trenton in 1834 , and boldly supported the prayer of the corporators for the powers of a transportation company to carry passengers and merchandise over their road , in a plea which exhausted the whole subject of contracts , and proved that the past action of New Jersey was in no wise irrevocable . Another argument of the opposition was found in the fact that the Camden and Amboy Railroad had neglected to pay the full amount of transit dues . The State Treasurer , when ordered to report upon this point , here threw his influence on the side of the monopoly , and , by delaying his answer to the resolution of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nick of time . Captain Stockton supplemented this finesse by a political demonstration . Threats* entreaties , the old State grudges , and , as is alleged , bribes were employed . A stormy // debate took place in the lower house , and on the final vote the Straight Turnpike Company was defeated by a majority of three . But the struggle was not yet ended . Able counsel gave it as their opinion that the turnpike incorporators had full power to lay a track without permission of the Legislature , and , on the strength of this opinion , rails were put down for nearly three miles . Not to be outdone , the joint companies quietly purchased a few outlying shares of the turnpike , and threw the case into the Court of Chancery . But in this sharp practice the managers overleaped themselves . They had appealed to a tribunal whose decision might be destructively adverse . The situation grew every day more perplexing . One avenue of escape remained , yet the difficulties attending it seemed insuperable . At this crisis , the habitual dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his associates recoiled . Covertly placing his agents at work , he purchased a controlling share of the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad , and immediately quashed all legal procedure . Popular tradition affirms , that , in this magnificent counter movement , the operators made use of the Wall Street artifice of a " corner , " forcing the stock up to $250 a share , and thereby pocketing a neat fortune in the transaction . But however this may be , it is certain that , at a subsequent period , the Camden and Amboy Company was made to pay heavily for this oblique victory . In 1840 , the monopoly fonud itself compelled to take these shares , amounting to 5,500 , and the net gains by the transfer have been estimated by a competent authority at four hundred thousand dollars ! It was not only by this opportune purchase that Stockton established himself in the confidence of the stockholders of the joint companies ; his capacity for astute financial and legislative expedients was to be still further illustrated . On the 14th of February , 1835 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declaring that the authorizing of any other railroad between the two cities " would be unjust , impolitic , in violation of the plighted faith of the State , and deeply injurious to its interests . " But two negatives to this proposition are recorded . Yet this did not suffice . In April of the next year , the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad Company and the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Delaware and // Raritan Canal Companies were consolidated by a formal agreement execnted under the corporate seals . Immediately upon this amalgamation , the skilful manipulator came forward with his associates and proposed to the State Legislatnre , that , inasmnch as the joint companies were stigmatized as monopolies , they were ready and eager to sell their franchises to New Jersey on terms that would insure to the State complete possession of canal and railroad in thirty-six years , together with a surplus in the treasury of over two and a half millions . This proposal , seemingly so magnificent , was accompanied by such limitations as forbade its acceptance ; but the adroitness of the presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patriotism , and generosity of the stockholders . We have no space to enter into details , and will merely remark , in this connection , that a shrewd writer in the Newark Advertiser showed , with some little ciphering , that in reality the State would have been a loser to the extent of nearly two millions . On most Jerseymen , however , the deceptive estimates of the management had the anticipated effect , and the monopoly gained in popularity at the very moment that it was augmenting in power . Although the railroad was now completed and in running order , the canal still lagged . Wages were high , nor could laborers in sufficient numbers be collected . It was not until 1838 that this great enterprise was ready for through navigation . Meanwhile , the joint companies had other expenses pressing on them . A spur had been thrown from Trenton to Bordentown , and on the opening of the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad passengers were conveyed to the capital , thence south by the branch road , and so forward by the Camden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled the monopolists to build a line from Trenton , northeast to New Brunswick . This route intersected the New Jersey Railroad , and in January , 1839 , was open for through travel . The construction account was consequently enormously disproportionate to the revenues ; and as the State dividends and the transit dues pressed heavily on the companies , it was natural , on business principles , for the management to profit by every possible evasion . Stockton was at present abroad in the naval service , and upon Edwin A. Stevens - who , by tacit agreement , now represented his family // in the active operations of the direction - devolved the care of railroad interests . A novel device occurred to him , and was at once acted upon . The State tax fell only on through passengers ; but from Trenton to New York travellers were classified as " way , " and were therefore omitted in the quarterly returns . This circumstance was put to use . On the Pennsylvania side , at the terminus of the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad , the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge , across the Delaware . In Trenton they took the Bordentown line , and were counted with the " way " fare . Ten cents a head was saved by this evasion . But a corporation which already controlled more than five millions of capital , though not above being " penny wise , " had too magnificent conceptions to be " pound foolish . " The completion of the junction with the New Jersey Railroad enabled the management to advance immensely in their scheme of defrauding the State . A secret compact was made with the connecting line , whereby one sixth of the net profits of transit were to accrue to that company , while at the same time the Camden and Amboy directors guaranteed " that not less than two thirds of the whole aggregate number of through passengers by both routes " should be carried by way of New Brunswick . Having thus laid their foundations , they proceeded , by a pettifogging interpretation of the charter , to build the superstructure . The language of that paper would , to an ordinary mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the act , " for the said companies to charge more than three dollars for the transportation of passengers from and to the cities of New York and Philadelphia . " It happened , however , that part of the upper route lay through Pennsylvania . Claiming that , by a liberal reading , the limitation was from State to State rather than from city to city , they fixed the price of first-class tickets from Trenton at $2.50 , and from Philadelphia at $4 . Every passenger , therefore , paid one dollar more than the law permitted , while the low fares within the State temporarily checked agitation . In the Quaker City , however , the overcharge produced a profound irritation . As the south route was the least remunerative , it was natuural for the companies to try to force all travel over the // 447 Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad . In order to effect this , the Camden and Amboy line was premeditatedly ill-managed . The cars placed on the track were inferior ; the hours of starting were unseasonable ; the trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridgway , a wealthy Philadelphian , was the proprietor of the Market Street Ferry to Camden . The Jersey managers had established a rival boat , and thereby materially diminished his business . In the prevailing condition of public sentiment , he now saw an opportunity for revenge . Placing the steamboat Hornet on the Delaware , he carried passengers from Philadelphia to Trenton , transferred them to the cars at the latter place , and thus made the through fare from city to city only three dollars . This sharp competition , accompanied as it was by a very considerable patronage , excessively annoyed the railroad kings ; and the manner in which they put an end to it deserves notice , since it illustrates the arrogance and contempt for law which the possession of enormous franchises was beginning to develop . A variety of minor expedients , such as selling tickets twentyfour hours in advance , building a high fence around the train , and interrogating travellers as to their residence , had been tried without avail . Stockton , made post-captain while in the Mediterranean , had now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond measure . One day , a little before the arrival of the Philadelphia boat , he appeared on the railway platform in company with the President of the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad , his cousin Robert Stockton Field , then Attorney-General of the State , John R. Thompson , and other directors of the joint companies . The excitement had been on the increase for some weeks , and a large crowd of Trenton people was assembled , - their sympathies mainly on the side of Ridgway . When the passengers by the Hornet arrived at the depot , hot words were passed , which presently changed to blows ; Stockton felling Payne , the steamboat agent , with his cane . Then followed a startling scene . The enraged mob closed upon the canal president , and for a second he was obscured from sight . At this juncture , the Attorney-General gave his signal . A gate flew open , and a body of Irish navvies , who had been sent up from the railroad workshops at Bordentown , and were hitherto // concealed , sprung forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the fight to an end ; but on taking up the senseless body of Payne , it was found that he had been stabbed . The grand jury chanced to be in session , and not even the fact that a State official had lent his presence to this infraction of the peace could prevent their instituting an immediate inquiry . The investigation resulted in a true bill being found against Captain Stockton ; but the judge on the bench , availing himself of the pretext that the victim of the disturbance exhibited signs of recovery , dismissed the defendant with a eulogy on his great national and State services , and a nominal fine of fifty dollars . It was evident , however , that these high-handed proceedings could not safely be repeated ; and a few days after the opposition was effectually stopped by the purchase of the Hornet and the rest of Ridgway 's ferry property both in Philadelphia and Trenton . This action of the grand jury was not the only proof of a still existing independence on the part of the people . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bordentown fraud , and the illegal charges by the New Jersey Railroad . Hints were , moreover , thrown out of collusion between the joint companies and public officers . The State Treasurer , in alarm , began a correspondence with the Attorney-General and the railroad managers . In 1840 , the Legislature took the matter in hand ; and finally , after two years of discussion , a joint resolution , accepted by the companies under seal on October 3 , 1842 , declared that the transit dues covered all cases where the transportation was from the Delaware to the Raritan ; while it was also agreed that the State should receive one half of any sum over three dollars that might be charged on any of the lines between Philadelphia and New York . As we shall presently be overcrowded with examples of the utter disregard of the joint companies for its solemn compacts , it may not be improper at this point to anticipate events , and state at once that the second clause in this agreement was never carried out . The four dollars fare continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became due to New Jersey , by overcharges on passengers , a sum amounting to not less than // half a million of dollars . Yet of this the State never received one cent , nor was the question brought before the courts , or in any wise pressed upon the defaulting party . The manner in which the Legislature was drugged into silence upon this as well as other subjects will shortly be shown . In the mean time another movement of the monopolists deserves notice . By a provision of their charters , the State was entitled to purchase the works of the joint companies at the expiration of a certain number of years , and this permission had a powerful influence in securing the protective grant . The managers of the canal and road now determined to make this stipulation nugatory , and the opportunity was found in the change of the State Constitution . The convention for this purpose met in 1844 . Stockton , although busy at the time in constructing the steamfrigate Princeton , had still leisure to put the political machinery in motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family connections , were sent as delegates from Mercer County . Other more or less prominent agents of the monopoly were foisted upon the remaining districts , and a clause was inserted into the Constitution forbidding the State to create any debt or liability which should in the aggregate exceed a hundred thousand dollars , except for some single object or work . As the roads and canal were separate works , this was an effectual check upon any future attempt of New Jersey to resume the franchises ; and in 1853 the joint companies were able to employ it with signal advantage . But although triumphant on this occasion , the next political demonstration of the managers was less successful . The Governor elect , under the revised Constitution , would have the appointment of the entire judiciary of the State . The monopolists , anxious to control the courts , compelled the Democratic party to nominate John R. Thompson for the office . A fiercely contested campaign ensued . The canvass closed in October ; and although New Jersey went for Polk and Dallas in the following month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant vote . Thus far , through good and evil report , the managers have approved themselves as useful , and in the main faithful , servants of the stockholders . We now come to a different phase , // in which , by virtue of their official position , they converted the whole power of the affined companies to personal ends . The anthor of a recent clever brochure , entitled , " The IRailroad and Political Ring Manual , " enunciates two cardinal points in all " ring " transactions - " Axiom 1 . A railway ring ' is a partnership among the managers for the acquisition of personal advantages from the stockholders or the public , without their knowledge , and without rendering an account or an equivalent . " Axiom 2 . The criterion of success is the obtaining of the largest profits to the partners without a resulting displacement in position and consequent loss of future operations . " In another part of the pamphlet , it is added that this system " was first adopted , so far as known in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately for the reputation of the country , this statement is erroneous . The axioms above laid down were discovered and practically developed more than twenty years ago by a few leading directors of the joint companies of New Jersey . The steamboat Napoleon , owned by a company whose charter was obtained in the month of January , 1831* had been put upon the waters of the Raritan to run between New Brunswick and New York . Its only rival was the Union line , managed by the Stevens family ; and the new enterprise s6on distanced its competitor . Perceiving , by the diminishing balances of their books , that the opposition was gaining the mastery , the representatives of the older boats made overtures for the consolidation of the two companies , and fortified this proposition by a menace of ruinously low fares unless the compromise was acceded to . The threat proved effective ; the Stevenses obtained a controlling interest in the New Brunswick corporation , and by May of the same year they established themselves in the Board of Direction . Three yeiirs later , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was decided to water the stock , and the effect was to throw the affairs of the company more entirely into the hands of persons interested in the railroad monopoly . As it is essential that this should be clearly understood , we subjoin a list of the owners of a majority of the two hundred shares - // Shares . R. L. Stevens , Pres. Camden &amp; Amboy Rail . Co. ) * E. A. Stevens , Treas. &amp; Supt. " " Robert F. Stockton , Pres. Del. &amp; Rar . Canal Co. . 22 John Potter , Pres. Joint Co. . . . . . 20 James Neilson , Treas . Canal Co. . . . . 12 104 These men were all of them directors of the joint companies , and , as their official positions indicate , pre-eminent in influence , much trusted , and bound to respect the interests of the stockholders . It now devolves upon us to show the mode in which this solicitude displayed itself . At a meeting of the Joint Board of Directors in 1834 , the legal responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as a result of the plausible arguments advanced , a resolution was finally passed , authorizing Edwin A. Stevens to make a satisfactory arrangement with the Napoleon Company for undertaking the complete charge of all transportation over the railroad , and subsequently on the canal . Mr. Stevens , as agent of the monopoly , consequently held communication with Mr. Stevens , as manager in the New Brunswick corporation , and the conference naturally terminated in an immediate bargain . The agreement , as ultimately concluded , was to this effect . All the employees , rolling-stock , and equipment of the railroad , all the barges , tow-boats , and other agencies of the canal , were to be turned over to the Napoleon Company , and every expense to be defrayed by the joint companies . In return , the Napoleon Company was to pay $7.64 per ton on the railroad , and one fourth of all freight receipts on the canal . By this means the monopoly shareholders received , or appeared to receive , all the tolls that they were in law entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exclusive control the entire transportation across and in the State of New Jersey . Shortly after , they persuaded the Joint Board to enter into a similar arrangement with the Camden Ferry Company , which was also managed in their interest ; and the western as well as the eastern terminus of the two great works thus came into the possession of the operators . Then commenced a system of organized plunder . The joint // companies were limited by their charter to eight cents a mile on through freight . The New Brunswick Company , on the other hand , charged per mile ten , twelve , and even fifteen cents habitually , while for the whole route , the legal rate of which was $ 7.54 , they demanded as much as $60 a ton for large amounts , and in some cases , even for the short distance of Burlington , they compelled payment at the rate of $ 80 per ton , which was equivalent to $ 100 per ton from city to city ! It was precisely similar on the canal . As this water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the managers made the tariff so enormous as to force private parties in preference to employ their agency . Their own charges were then raised to the highest amount that the public would endure . What the earnings by this double business averaged it is now impossible to state , as the Company published no reports , apparently declared no dividends , and were in fact a close corporation . But there are still data for a partial conception of their profits . The " Ring " paid the canal twenty-five per cent on their bills of freight . For every dollar coming into the joint companies three dollars were taken by the Direction . Up to 1845 the canal noiminally received $ 359,000 , which would give to the managers $1,077,000 . A further idea may be obtained by their gains through the Camden Ferry Company . In winter , as the canal could not be used , a contract was made for transportation on railroad . An estimate of a careful pamphleteer of the period , from the receipts on only 27,000 tons of winter freight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . . . $ 32,000 Camden and Amboy Railroad , ninety-two miles , 63,000 Managers for collecting bills ( through the New Brunswick Company contract ) , . . . 75,000 Total , . $170,000 Of which the " Ring " took $107,000 . Nor should the reader neglect to notice the relative profitableness of the managers ' one mile to that of the ninety-two miles of railroad which was simply stockholders ' property . The crowning feature in this magnificent system has yet to be related . The " Ring " was charging extortionate rates , on // the pretext that the office of common carriers imposed heavy risks . Whether the dangers on this score were as great as asserted may reasonably be doubted , since other roads habitually perform the same work for a less compensation than accrued to the stockholders of the affined companies . But however this may be , the managers determined to free themselves of the hypothetical burden . All merchandise intrusted to them was conveyed by certain nominal unincorporated companies , called the Merchants ' and Swift Sure lines , whose agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . In case of miscarriage of goods these subordinates affected to be ignorant of the names of their employers , and it was found practically impossible to discover any party who could be made legally responsible . In these operations , covering a space of nearly eleven years , the grasping and eager hands of the managers fell with equal weight upon the citizens of New Jersey and those of the adjacent communities . Feeling themselves secure from the law they became careless in the delivery of freight , insolent in their replies , and excessively arbitrary in their charges . It would seem from the history of New 4ersey that its population is long-suffering and patient under indignities . But it happened that in Trenton there resided a New-Englander , one Peter Briggs , brother of Governor Briggs of Massachusetts , who had been a victim of the extortions of the " Ring , " and was determined to test their legality . A statute of the State laid a penalty of one hundred dollars on each and every infringement by a corporation of its authorized tariff rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briggs , putting one of the overcharged bills into court , demanded payment of this fine . In April , 1847 , he obtained judgment against the monopoly . The case was next carried up to the Supreme Court , where , in the succeeding year , the judgment was reaffirmed . Once again the managers appealed , and went before the Court of Errors . Previous to this litigation , however , the managers had caught the alarm , and , fearing lest their high-handed contempt for statutory law might involve them in desperate bankruptcy , they suddenly refused to prolong the Napoleon contract . Accordingly , // on the first of April , 1846 , the responsibility of the overcharges was transferred to the joint companies . But this admirable stroke of cunning , although it saved them from personal liability in the Briggs suit , did not prevent an exposure of the " Ring . " Mr. John ID . Hagar had been Secretary of the New Brunswick Company from the day of its charter . Owning eight shares , and accustomed to annual dividends of from thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreement with the joint companies , when the earnings of the business were more than quadrupled , he was paid only sixteen per cent on his stock . Moreover , though holding an important office , lie had been most contemptuously put aside . His calls for meetings were laughed at , and in no case responded to . The control of the corporation was in the hands of the monopoly leaders . The Treasurer , Mr. Neilson , was also Treasurer of the Canal Company . The books were therefore denied him , and to his request for an explanation the cavalier reply was vouchsafed that the interests of the stockholders required a concealment of the business and profits . Hagar , indignant at this manifest fraud , and being of a different mould from the other minority shareholders , filed a bill in the Court of Chancery , and brought the case to issue . As the managers had already excited the displeasure of the English bondholders , besides being the object of sharp clamor at home , they now made every effort to hush up the proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share , although the original price of the stock was only $125 . The inquiry was brought to a close in the court , and the quarrel veiled as far as possible from the public . But it was not in the nature of things that the malfeasances of the " Ring " should escape scrutiny . In the midst of the ilagar difficulty and the brisk litigation of Mr. Briggs , opposition of a not less serious nature had developed itself in an unexpected quarter . During the month of January , 1848 , a series of letters made their appearance in the Burlington Gazette , which at once attracted wide attention . The style of the writer was trenchant ; his language defiant ; his logic remorseless and irrefutable . But what most caught the public was the startling character of the statements . It was an ex // position in an ascending scale of the encroachments of the State on the nation , of the joint companies on the State , and of the Management on the joint companies . It was shown that the railroad still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law limited it to three , and that , despite the stipulation recorded in an earlier part of this article , the State was defrauded of all profits in this transaction . It was proved that for over eleven years there had been an habitual continuance of overcharges in freight , and that inaccurate and insufficient returns were made to the State Treasurer by the monopoly , and to the joint companies by the New Brunswick Company . The loss to the stockholders alone by the suppression of earnings was estimated at from $2,000,000 to $ 3,000,000 , equal to a dividend of one hundred per cent , of which the State was entitled to $ 200,000 . Nor was it only in this last particular that the citizens of New Jersey suffered . A table was drawn up of the fares on thirty-five railroads in the United States ( being all north of Baltimore and east of Ohio ) , including a number of small roads , whose yearly business was less than that of the Camden and Amboy in a fortnight . These averaged * cents per mile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroad were at the rate of 4*%* cents per mile . Still further , a general belief was abroad that New Jersey profited largely by the bargain . But the actual figures sadly shook the foundations of this theory . The State received annually - In Transit Duties , about . . . . . $ 57,000 In Dividends , " . . . . . 24,000 Total , . . . . . . . $81,000 While by virtue of the monopoly grant there was received By the C. &amp; A. Rail , and the D. &amp; R. Canal , $ 1,400,000 From Trenton Railroad and Sub-Companies , over 600,000 $2,000,000 As the joint companies exacted double rates of fare , it followed that New Jersey , for the sake of eighty-one thousand dollars , robbed itself and the nation at large of a million of dollars each year , while trade languished , travel was hindered , // and the natural extension of new lines hopelessly checked . " As citizens of New Jersey , " the writer added , in language homely but pithy , " we plunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells , while the managers pick out the kernels for their own eating . " These energetic appeals began to produce echoes . Some few journals had the courage to reprint the letters . Merchants and farmers repeated the arguments to each other , and the question became a disturbing element in politics . In Philadelphia also a movement was set on foot to secure from government the charter of a national post-route . For four months the managers remained silent in the presence of the augmenting storm ; then they dropped their reserve and issued an " Address to the People of New Jersey . " To this paper the signatures of all the Directors of the Joint Board were by some means obtained . As for the style , it was probably the most sentimental document ever put forth by a corporate body . Fresh from the audacious plundering of the " Ring , " they complain that no longer are their ears greeted by " the voice of cheering encouragement and approbation . " The press , even , was " surrendered to sinister influences , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of the pity of the many . " Then followed a strange jumble of haughty self-assertion , of denials , of bitter invectives against their assailants , of explanations which themselves needed an explanation , of arrogant allusions to the profits of the State by the protection . This halting and timid defence did not produce the desired impression . The public was distrustful . A new sheaf of letters filled the columns of the Burlingtoh paper , in which the " Appeal " was reviewed with a tone of quiet exultation and an increased pungency of language . The writer charged the directors with conscious falsehood . He asserted that they had used $ 117,000 in building boats which yielded no return to the stockholders ; that the towing machinery , barges , &amp;c. of the canal had augmented at least eightfold from 1838 to 1846 , although the transportation in sworn reports was represented at two fifths less ; that gi*ater receipts were admitted to shareholders than to the State , while even from these there had been concealed nearly one hundred thousand tons of // merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the State was so great as to prove manifest perjury on the part of the officers of the railroad , whom it was the clear duty of the Attorney-General to indict . Coming down once more to figures , he boldly declared that the total sum unacconnted for by the managers might be thus tabnlated : - On railroads , from 1840 to 1847 , . . $ 3,093,431 canal , " " . . . 1,4 ' 23,000 $ 4,516,431 Alleged expenses , which did not exist , . . 750,000 $ 5,266,431 Out of this the State was entitled in dividends and transit dues to $493,066 ! These statements , evidently originating in conscientious conviction and fortified by the most varions proof , had a tangible effect . A motion was made and carried in the session of the General As*enibly of 1848 for an investigation , although , oddly enough , the selection of the members of the board of inquisition was left to the joint companies . Moreover , the monopoly managers tacitly acknowledged the truth of some of the allegations , by hastily withdrawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the personality of the newspaper attack , they threatened a libel suit . Up to this time the correspondent of the Gazette had modestly concealed his name , his letters appearing over the signature of " A Citizen of Burlington . " But the menace of the law led him to cast aside his disguise , and it soon became known throughout New Jersey that the remorseless antagonist of the " iRing " was none other than Henry C. Carey , whose merits as a powerful and original thinker in social science were already recognized both in the United States and in Europe . Mr. Carey , having thus made the way clear to the injured managers for retrieving their crumbling reputation by appeal to a jury , gave a fresh proof of his confidence in the truthfulness of his assertions , by throwing his letters into the form of pamphlets , and distributing them in every corner of the State . In these publications the influence of the monopoly system upon the value of land , upon the products of agriculture , upon manufactures and all indus* // trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited beyond dispute the advantage of free railroads . Some of the contrasting facts may be worthy of mention here . It was shown , for instance , that the charges on domestic travel were enormous . The citizen of New Haven could be carried on an easy route and in commodious cars to New York for $1.50 . The citizen of Camden , conveyed to the same city at far less actual cost , was obliged to pay twice this . In New Jersey no commutation tickets were sold . Travelling every day between New Haven and New York would cost $100 ; between Camden and the same city , $ 2,000 . The Burlington ( N. J. ) farmer , going up to New York once a week with his produce , paid $ 360 annually for his fare alone . The Goshen ( N. Y. ) farmer for the same distance paid $ 80 . In regard to freights also , the monopoly was not less oppressive . A farmer in Burlington , having an orchard of forty acres , producing five thousand baskets of peaches , paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goshen farmer sent up the same quantity for 240 . So that the monopoly was fleecing the small fruitgrowers at the rate of $ 760 a year for every forty acres in orchards . Nor was this the worst part of the story . Peaches , tomatoes , and the like , are perishable products . A delay of a few hours reduces their value rapidly . The managers condescended to turn this fact to their advantage . At Gravesend , Mr. Stevens and the Camden and Amboy political manager , Colonel Cook , had an extensive orchard and . kitcben garden . An arrangement was made to carry their fruit , plucked with the dew still on , by the early passeuger trains , while other farmers were compelled to wait till afternoon and send by freight cars . By this means the monopoly agriculturists were able to beat their competitors some twenty hours , and to get the highest market prices . Having made it clear by these and a vast number of other examples , that the State was undergoing rapid impoverishment , Mr. Carey urged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quo warranto proceeding on the part of the Legislature , whereby the protective bill might be repealed , and New Jersey thrown open to a system of free railroads . In that event the " Citizen of Burlington " guaranteed a revenue of at least twice the amount then coming // into the treasury , by a tax on capital stock no greater than was imposed by other States in the Union . While these pamphlet appeals were sowing the seed of agitation among the people at large , the Legislature of 1849 convened , and the report of the investigating commission was placed in the hands of the members . It may well be doubted whether a more shameless paper was ever submitted to an august body . In place of an inquiry , it was a eulogy ; and the " Ring , " instead of being criminals at the bar , were elevated to the bench and sat in judgment upon their accusers . The composition of the commission explains the anomaly . One of these men was counsel to a monopoly known as the Patterson Associates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A third had held a State office which brought him in collusion with the managers . It was , in fact , an impudent amalgamation of the very clique which ought to have been especially excluded . The General Assembly manifested its appreciation of this white-washing document by flinging it under the table . Carey exposed its falsifications in a scathing review ; and the Judiciary Committee , determined no longer to trust the joint board with the choice of its inquisitors , brought in a bill creating a special commission of its own appointment . By March , this second body got to work . The Burlington pamphleteer , who next to the " Ring " itself was the man in New Jersey most thoroughly cognizant of the affairs of the company , was invited to assist in the investigation . He instantly accepted the proffer , and this fact inspired the public with confidence . It became necessary , however , during the summer months , for the commission to visit Bordentown , where the books of the monopoly were kept . From that moment a strange stupor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Citizen of Burlington . " The boundaries of their duties narrowed . The enormous operations of the " Ring , " which at Trenton appeared to them as the meshes of a gigantic net in which the State was becoming hopelessly entangled , assumed the shape of a guileless and beneficent system as they sat at ease in the sleepy Bordentown offices . Some faint intimations of the change reached the ears of the anti-monopolists , and they resolved to try the effect of political pressure . Meetings were // held in Morristown , Newton , Jersey City , and other sections . A mass convention assembled at the State capital . Able orators lent their aid to the movement , and , in speeches compact with statistics , established the malfeasance of the monopoly management ; showed how terribly the State was suffering through the bargain , - by the prevention of local roads , - by the corruption of its public men , - by the fatal stigma that already attached to New Jersey in the country at large ; and urged upon the people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the passage of a general railroad bill in its place . The directors of the joint companies now became visibly alarmed . The air seemed charged with revolution ; and an appalling fear arose lest the arguments of the agitators should bear fruit , and their franchise be forcibly wrested away . To break the force of the blow , Commodore Stockton , once more at home after a brilliant campaign in California , issued an address on his own responsibility , which had just enough of truth in its texture to bewilder superficial readers . The situation , however , was too perilous to permit of supine reliance on eloquent sophistries , and a resort was made to certain powerful agencies , which on previous occasious had been of singular efficacy . The manner and the nature of this machinery shall presently be explained ; but we prefer at this point simply to state the result . The fall election came off ; the Legislature assembled , and the second report was submitted to the members . It possessed some very significant features . The appendix , consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important charges made against the " Ring . " The text , on the other hand , was a substantial exoneration of the joint companies . The commission had , indeed , discovered several clerical errors , by which the returns of transit-dues to the State were lessened to the extent of thousands of dollars ; but this was owing to venial blunders on the part of subordinates , and should assuredly not be ascribed to the high-minded members of the Direction . The General Assembly professed itself content . The appendix was ignored , the report accepted , and quiet reigned in Warsaw . We have entered somewhat into detail in our description of this struggle , because among all the wars waged against the // monopoly this had the largest elements of success . Men from each of the two great parties which divided the State participated in the movement . The courts lent their support . The weight of argument against the monopoly was overwhelming . That Mr. Carey was substantially correct in his indictment is capable of cumulative proof . The report of the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . The voters of New Jersey , by refraining ever after to elevate the members of that commission to situations of public trust , ( although they had been previously rising men in the State , ) testified to the popular view of the matter . The revelations of the Court of Chancery , and the decision of the Court of Errors in Mr. Briggs 's favor , are also in evidence . Moreover , the " Ring " itself , by refusing to allow Mr. Carey to examine the books , and by shrinking from bringing the libel suit which they had once threatened , and which it was certainly their duty to carry to issue if the allegations were false , supplied the only link wanting in this chain . But if the charges were true , how is it possible to account for the extraordinary spectacle of a Legislature voluntarily abandoning claims on behalf of the State treasury amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars , - unwilling to resume franchises which were clearly forfeit , and which had been so managed as to clothe the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint companies for their solemn obligations , - and criminally careless of the interests of a large industrial population ground beneath excessive and destructive burdens ? How , also , shall we explain the subsequent apathy of the people , when the Legislature at Trenton proved false to its trust ? There is but one answer to this question , and it lies in these words : New Jersey was drugged ! The an*sthetics were skilfully applied ; an expert in political corruption might at times be baffled in his effort to detect the manner of the application , but of the fact there can be no doubt whatever . The system through which this result had been obtained was the growth of years and the product of more than a single brain . From 1848 onward , its operations were never without some , and generally with complete success . Not even the splendid machinery of Lord Strafford merited the name of Thorough so // entirely as did that which the Stockton and Stevens families put in force in New Jersey . Yet , both in its origin and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bargain , and to the monopoly leaders merely an affair of dollars , cents , and mills . They had given to the State two thousand shares ; they had pledged a certain amount of transit-dues ; and , on account of the mooted question of the constitutionality of the grant , they felt that their privileges were at any moment in danger of being swept away . As , then , the property itself was in dispute , they were naturally eager to pay as little as possible for it . Thence the frauds in returns , the illebal fares , the freight overcharges . If the State suffered by this , it was precisely what the managers desired . The way trade they had never sought ; what they wished was a sweeping control of the interstate travel and transportation . By driving out manufacturers and the artisan class , by impoverishing the agriculturalists and the small traders , they rendered the yearly dole more necessary as a relief from State tax. * Occasionally they * The anti-monopoly pamphlets of Mr. Carey contain innumerable illustrations of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be amiss , however , to point out some further consequences of the protectivc bill . New Jersey , by virtue of its proximity to two great markets , ought to he eminently an agricultural State . Its soil is very prolific , not merely of fruit and garden produce , but also of the great staples . In proof , we subjoin two tables taken from a recent Agricultural Report of the Patent Office . Avera*e yield per acre Avera* , e market value of Indian corn . of wheat . of corn per bushel. of wheat per bushel . In New York , 35 bushels 18 bushels $ 0.66 $ 1.25 Pennsylvania , 36 " 15 " .56 1.22 New Jersey , 37 " 19 " .68 1.30 Illinois , 40 " 14 " .23 .76 Indiana , 42 " 16 " .29 .88 Thus New Jersey surpasses its immediate neighbors in the fecundity of its soil and the market value of its products , while , if it be considered that two thirds of the profits on Western grain are eaten up in transportation , the relative advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Camden and Amboy compact has neutralized this is shown by the following statistics , compiled from the UniteJ States Census Report of 1860 .

But the permanent problem was how to turil down the screws on the people without exasperating them into uncontrollable revolution . This latter alternative was unquestionably an ever-present terror . But besides smooth words , ostentatious patriotism , and frequent appeals to smouldering prejudices , they brought to the task of averting this danger the element of influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure of American society political movements originate with the press , the professed politicians , and the legal class . Upon these three springs of popular action the Management converged the weight of their wealth , and as the State was in process of depletion they found the labor of debauching the public mind correspondingly less difficult . By noon of each secular day the journals of New York and Philadelphia are read in every city , town , and village of New Jersey . The ciramount of unimproved land than fertile Jersey ; while their agricultural population is relatively far greater . But the injury of the monopoly is still further shown hy its influence upon immigration . The census of 1860 gives the aggregate population of each State , together with the foreign and domestic immigration . From the tahles we obtain the annexed ratio of native immigrants to foreign , selecting the purely or mainly agricultural States . New Jersey , 80:122 Wisconsin , 251 276 Iowa , 377 : 106 Ohio , 482 328 Indiana , 457 : 118 South Carolina , 14 : 9 Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions to the population of New Jersey are , as the table indicates , mainly from abroad . The Camden and Amboy monopoly is less known in Europe than in America . Still another evidence is afforded by a comparison of railroad facilities , since on them depend , in no measured degree , the value and quick profits of agricultural products . Rhode Island , with an area in square miles of 1306 , had in 1858 , 472 miles of rail . Connecticut , " " " 4674 , " " 601 Massachusetts , " " " " 7800 , " " 1285 " New Jersey , " " " " 8320 , " " 472 " The explanation of this is , that the monopoly steadily prevents the construction of new roads , unless they connect its own lines and are controlled by its manage . ment . As an instance of the high rates of freight , we might mention the recent statement of a gentleman largely interested in the pottery business at Trenton , - that the cost of bringing material from Liverpool to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trenton. // culation of local papers is thereby lessened , their profits diminished , and the struggle of existence rendered more severe . Few newspapers in the State pay . These few do it by a slavish silence in reference to whatever might decrease their daily receipts . As the monopoly was the overshadowing moneyed power , controlling capital to the extent of twenty millions , with a whole army of employees , contractors , and other agents , editors naturally hesitated to put themselves in opposition to it . The Direction gently assisted this hesitancy . Advertising patronage was offered . Editors , publishers , and their families received free passes on the line . Their goods were frequently transmitted for nothing , or at low rates . In case of revolt these privileges were forfeited , threats of diminished circulation followed , and , if the warning went unheeded , other arguments were brought to bear . How complete was the triumph of the companies in this particular is partly shown in the fact that , although the Briggs case was an exciting topic of discussion throughout the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal which mentioned it even by way of mere news . It is still further exhibited in the virulence with which every opponent of the monopoly is habitually attacked in their columns , in the shameless abuse of " foreigners " ( i. e. non-Jerseymen ) , and in the constant misrepresentation of all railroad measures not emanating from the council-chamber of Hoboken . Even the spasmodic opposition of some of the papers illustrates this , as a time always comes when the clamor abruptly ceases , and the explanation of the silence would probably be found in an examination of the private account-books at Bordentown . In reference to the legal fraternity a somewhat similar method was adopted . They also had free passes showered upon them . Wherever any danger was anticipated from members of the bar , by virtue of personal influence or oratorical gifts , they were elected as counsel to the companies , and a generous retaining-fee paid in . A competent authority asserts that in Mercer County , which contains the State capital , only two lawyers refused to be thus suborned . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heavy subscriptions were made by individual managers for election // expenses . At important junctures the workmen and other subordinates of the railroad and canal were sent into the primary meetings . In the State conventions efficient influences were brought to bear to secure the nomination of pliable candidates . Then , where all these agencies failed , the joint companies fell back on the lobby ; and it was found that in the long run it was cheaper to buy off a member at Trenton than to defeat him at home . An example of the smooth working of this machinery was given in the contest that we have just described . A certain gentleman , who had been markedly prominent in the State anti-monopoly convention , desired an appointment in connection with the Legislature . The managers arranged the wires , the agitator received the office , and from that day he has not opened his mouth except to defend or to glorify the monopoly r6*gime . What occurred in this case occurred in a hundred others ; and the culpable indifference of the General Assembly for 1850 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilful manipulations of lobby agents . Supervising all these operations with steadfast self-interest were Edwin A. Stevens and C.ommodore Stockton . Although both of them had been ruling spirits of the Napoleon " Ring , " they were nevertheless still confided in by the stockholders . And the reason is obvious . If these members of the Direction had falsified reports , burdened the companies with unnecessary expenses , and taken to themselves the lion 's share of the profits , they had also secured the maintenance of the compact with its corollary of promptly paid dividends , amounting for several years to over eleven per cent annually . Moreover , the two families of which they were the head owned an absolute majority of the stock , so that the only recourse for redress was to bring a suit in chancery , - a proceeding certain to result in depreciation of shares , loss of profits , irritation of foreign bondholders , and many other disagreeable consequences , from all of which the financial public very naturally shrunk . The railway and canal kings , therefore , sat firmly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each in his own way . Edwin A. Stevens was impelled to take prominence in party manoeuvres simply from an abounding love of money . A nomination on the State Electoral ticket satisfied his ambition in politics . To // have secured his brother , Robert L. Stevens , the contract for a floating battery , which cost the national government a vast sum , and proved in the end absolutely useless , was a feat in his mind greater than a Presidential nomination . Nine years later , he was able to turn the whole of the immense power of the joint companies against the New Jersey Railroad , for the sake of personal interests involved in the Hoboken Improvei cut Company ; and in the present emergency it was because his own property was at stake that he concerned himself with rendering the Legislature pliant . Commodore Stockton was governed by a totally different ambition . An uncontrollable impulse forced him into the political arena . There was , it is true , an element of instability in his character , which would have proved fatal to success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in New Jersey also , had he not been supported by the monopoly contingent fund . At one time he was a Federalist , at another a Whig , mainly a Democrat , and finally a Native American . Nor was it the least of his incongruities , that , while adhering to the party of Harrison , he op* osed the national bank ; and , while scheming for a Democratic nomination to the Presidency , he upheld a protective tariff . The immense influence of the joint companies tided him , however , over these dangers , and he was able constantly to control administrative patronage , to punish irretrievably his political enemies , and to procure for his sons , his brother-in-law , and more distant relatives important public positions . The New York Central Railroad has perhaps sent more directors and superior officers to Congress ; but no corporate body in the country ever did so much for a single family as have the affined companies of New Jersey for the Stocktons . In the session of 1850 Commodore Stockton had no immediate political object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . Yet it may not be amiss to remark , that the influences which Mr. Stevens was bringing to bear in order to overslaugh Carey 's charges were in a very curious manner helpful to his colleague 's aspirations . The people of the State were always struggling in a blind and hopeless way to frustrate the monopoly power . As the Legislature of 1850 was Whig in complexioii , New // Jersey showed its indignation by electing a Democratic Assembly in the coming fall . Nothing was gained by the antimonopolists in this seesawing ; but to the President of the Canal it was a fortunate event . A deep longing had taken possession of him to be elected to the United States Senate ; and , as the term of William L. Dayton was to expire in 1852 , the duty of choosing a successor devolved upon the session of 1851 . The manner in which Stockton satisfied his $ ambition affords a splendid illustration of monopoly tactics . In the Democratic caucus he was a minority candidate ; but William Wright , who stood even lower on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party , entered upon a secret alliance with the Commodore . There is an apartment at the Trenton House ( the principal hotel at the capital ) known as Number Ten , - the supper-room of the monopoly lobby . The walls of this banquet-chamber , could they speak , would disclose a terrible tale of treachery to public interests , of shameless bargains , of deadened consciences and poisoned patriotism . Here , over oysters and champagne , occurred the secret bartering and jobbery which have made the New Jersey Legislature a by-word for corruption ; and here was effected the scheme by which , through the perfidy of two Democrats and a Whig , Mr. Stockton became a Senator . Two years later , Mr. Wright ; having publicly apostatized and joined the Pierce party , received the reward of his treason by an election to the very office which the Whigs had denied him ; and at the same session Commodore Stockton , tired of his experience at Washington , sent in a resignation of his Senatorship . But it was not in the man to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national post-route from Washington to New York was pending in Congress , under the charge of Governor Doty , then Ilepresentative from Wiscousin . It was necessary , therefore , that the joint companies should have a competent agent in the Senate to defeat this movement , and Stockton , putting the lobby machinery to work , succeeded in establishing his brother-in-law , John II . Thompson , in the vacant chair . The Assembly of 1853 , in which these Senatorial bargains were completed , was earning notoriety from other events . A bill for an Air-Line llailroad from // Key Port to Delaware Bay had passed the House , when the monopoly leaders , perceiving that a competition was threatened , came forward with their usual appliances of entreaties and bribes . The bill was hastily recalled . A resolution was adopted to the effect that neither this nor any similar measure could become a law " without the consent of the Camden and Amboy Railroad " ; and the projected line was summarily killed by a majority of nine votes . One of the members who helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postmaster at Rahway , another was made collector for the port of Newark , and a third obtained the collectorship of Egg Harbor . Public opinion was inclined to perceive , in these opportune gifts of office , the relation of cause to effect ; and , as the Air-Line was regarded as of vast importance to South Jersey , great dissatisfaction was felt . The Whig party determined to use this irritation as a stepping-stone to power . A convention was held ; Joel Heywood was nominated as Governor , and a vigorous series of antimonopoly resolutions were adopted . In the campaign which followed , all the old arguments were advanced , while the recent political conduct of the managers was sharply commented upon . Some years before , Commodore Stockton had been reported as saying that he " carried the State in his breeches pocket , and meant to keep it there . " This utterance , never authoritatively denied , was now repeated from every platform , and helped to swell the tide of indignation . The newspapers caught the enthusiasm . Prominent members of the Direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " viceroys , " " Earls of Bordentown , " " Marquises of Hoboken , " " Dukes of Princeton . " Unfortunately , the Whigs had added to their freerailroad programme a stringent Maine-law plank . Between unrestricted apple-brandy and cider-champagne , and the overthrow of a monopoly which , after all , paid most of the State expenses , the ordinary Jersey mind found no great difficulty of choice . The joint companies , with customary generosity , supplied unstinted quantities of the objectionable beverages at all the Democratic head-quarters . They also drew on their contingent fund , and , as they now controlled capital to the extent of twenty-seven millions , and had a yearly revenue of // more than a million , they could afford to pay largely to prevent a repeal of their compact of 1832 . How well they employed their moneyed power is shown by the result of the election . Rodman M. Price , the Democratic candidate , though personally unpopular , was able to carry the State by about eight thousand majority . In the Legislature , the Whigs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower house the preponderance of the monopoly party was equally great . So complete a triumph had hardly been looked for , and the managers lost no time in improving it . The charter of the railroad was to expire in 1859 . As the limitation was for twenty years , and the road had really been in operation since 1834 , the year 1853 ought in equity to have completed the monopoly . But the Direction , on one pretext and another , had been enabled to delay the requisite announcement until 1839 , and it was from this date that the State had been compelled to reckon . In the lengthy , exculpatory document of the commission of 1850 , there was contained a statement of extensive loans of money , made by the joint companies in Europe , amounting to four millions of dollars , and payable in 1863 and 1864. *ow these loans were effected , when the bonds were mainly upon a road whose charter was to expire four years before the stipulated term of payment , is difficult to explain , except on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to secure a prolongation of the bargain . If this supposition be true , it will readily be seen that no time could be more auspicious for the work than that in which the Legislature which came in with Price would be in session . Accordingly , the joint companies sent their agents to Trenton , with a proposition that the monopoly grant of the canal ( which extended to 1882 ) should be cut down thirteen years ; that the monopoly clause of the railroad should be lengthened ten years , and in this way all monopoly privileges would be extinct in 1869 . It is not our purpose to enter into the details of the struggle of which this was the occasion . The history is too dark , the revelations of political baseness and legislative depravity too revolting , to make the subject a profitable one . We will only add , that , after a fierce and bitter discussion , which spread over many days // 470 April , and involved all New Jersey in excitement , a bill substantially embodying the provisions previonsly mentioned passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a law . By this act it was declared not lawful , " before the first day of Jannary , 1869 , to constrnct any other railroad in the State without the consent of the joint companies , which shall be used in the traiisportation of passengers between the cities of New York and Philadelphia . " When the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad , the charter of which had been obtained in the same year with the renewal of the protection , was so far completed as to afford , in conjunction with the Camden and Atlantic Railroad , a circuitous through route from Philadelphia to New York , the monopoly managers were able , by means of this supplementary act , to secure an injunction from the Court of Chancery . By virtue of the renewal the joint companies have also been strong enough to prevent the construction of all local roads not immediately available for their own lines ; and there can be little doubt that by 1869 they will be so entirely masters of the situation as to continue to control legislation for their purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible independence of the courts . Heretofore , however , the monopoly managers have exhibited great tact in this direction . In general the subordinate judges have been kept docile by the " slaughtering ' * of such as were refractory , while in the higher courts the ruling method has been to stay the proceedings by buying off opposition . The names of Judges Nevins and Yandyke , and the studied silence of Chancellor Greene , are suggestive of the former line of tactics ; and the withdrawal of the appeals to the Court of Chancery in the case of the Straight Turnpike and that of Hagar are instances of the latter . It is probably by reason of this last mode of procedure that the appeal of the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad to the Court of Errors has made no progress , since there can be no doubt but this tribunal would reiterate its decision in the Erie Railroad case , and the monopoly contract be thus declared unconstitutional by the highest judicial body in New Jersey . If the joint companies can contrive in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from coming to issue , they are // probably secure in the possession of their franchises for an unlimited number of years , so far as New Jersey is concerned . The permanence of the privileges of all railroads depends upon their ability to check competition from existing lines , and to thwart every effort toward the creation of new ones . By enjoining the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad from carrying passengers or freight save to way-stations , the monopoly r* moved one of its most dangerous rivals from the field . Nevertheless the New Jersey Railroad remained . We have already recounted the attempt of this company to prolong its line to Philadelphia , by the construction of a road over the New Brunswick Turnpike , which should connect with the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad at the capital . Shortly after this fruitless struggle , a temporary compact had been sealed with the Camden and Amboy , which , however , did not preclude subsequent collisions . The New Jersey Company was still eager to effect an independent intercourse with the West and South , and sought legislative permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betwixt Easton and Trenton . This scheme the joint companies readily foiled ; and Mr. Stevens was able ,  --  in 1859 , to punish severely the uneasy antagonists of the monopoly , and at the same time to further his own interests , by the extension of the Morris and Essex Railroad to Hoboken . The secret history of that contest would probably throw more light upon the peculiar instrumentalities employed in corrupting legislations , than is afforded by any previous lobby operations of the great railroad king . Its immediate result was to paralyze the New Jersey Company , which has since ceased all active opposition . But though recently passive , there has yet been an immense power of harm to the monopoly in this railroad ; and , in order to remove the last barrier to State absolution , the joint companies have this very year effected a complete consolidation with their former rival . The contract , which has been assented to by the General Assembly of New Jersey , and is certain to be acquiesced in by the stockholders , dates back to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unifying measure elects nine , and the original monopoly sixteen Directors to the new Joint Board , while the State will continue to have a nominal representation in the // Direction . The shares are to be equalized , the stock largely increased , the receipts and expenses kept on joint account , and the vast capital of the two corporations practically amalgamated . By this master-stroke of policy , the last embarrassment arising from railroads already in existence has been surmounted ; and at the same time the other danger - that of future competing companies-is effectually frustrated . Our modern legislatures are proverbially inert . The spur of money is needed to overcome their lethargy , and it is exceedingly improbable that an organization of capital can be brought about capable of contending on equal footing with the immense moneyed power and political influence of the two roads . The consolidaton will give to the Joint Direction a control of capital which at the lowest computation is estimated at thirty millions . Moreover , this immense wealth is spread with singular prudence over the whole State . The companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the wharves , and nearly all the grounds suitable for dock purposes in Camden ; nearly every wharf and wharfage property at White Hill and Bordentown ; all the water-line at Amboy ; the Delaware Bridge and much of the river front at Trenton ; the Kingston and Princeton Turnpike , and the Straight Turnpike from Trenton to New Brunswick ; nearly all the West and South Jersey Railroads ; the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad ; both the original tracks , from Amboy and from Jersey City ; the Belvidere Railroad ; a large number of country railroads which feed the main trunk ; the Delaware and Raritan Canal ; depots , etc. in Philadelphia and New York ; besides possessing enormous workshops at Bordentown for the construction of locomotives , cars , etc. , and employing an innumerable body of operatives , railway agents , and bargemen . With resources much more restricted , the Camden and Amboy managers have been able to maintain the bargain against the strenuous exertions of the best men of the State ; to crush out all projects for local roads not immediately serviceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at unseasonable hours in crowded and filthy cars , and before 1864 on a single track , with constant danger of collision ; to fix extortionate rates for the transportation of freight , and unreasonably high fares // for passengers ; in fact , to render not merely New Jersey , but the whole Union , subservient to the exigencies of the joint companies ' treasury . The Direction has perpetually interfered in politics , even when its moneyed interests were in no respect at stake , as markedly in the McClellan campaign . By the sophistry of transit-dues , it has prevented New Jersey from doubling its revenues by a direct tax on railroads ; and in 1864 it assisted the New Jersey Railroad in obtaining a prolongation of its charter , whereby the State was defrauded of not less than two millions of dollars . The subterfuges by which the monopoly sought to evade taxation in Pennsylvania - so admirably exposed in Mr. Latham 's pamphlet - would still further illustrate the ruling passion of the managers . It is preposterous , in presence of these facts , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , judging by the ease with which the joint companies have repeatedly broken their solemn pledges , and considering the alacrity of the New Jersey Legislature in consenting to these infractions , it is much more rational to believe that before 1869 there will be a fresh bargain and a perpetuation of the monopoly . In this event the General Assembly could not do better than adopt the suggestion of Mr. Ripley , in the session of 1854 , when he proposed , in view of the shameless scenes of the renewal , that the members elect of the Legislature should henceforth meet at Trenton , dine , draw their pay , and go home , leaving the Camden and Amboy managers , who already practically controlled the State , the promulgation of such laws as they might be pleased to grant . Such a decisive reduetio ad absurdurn of the monopoly rule would perhaps arouse the people of New Jersey from their singular and untoward apathy . Up to this point we have discussed the subject purely from its aspect in reference to the State . We desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedged in and walled around by stringent limitations , it is within the power of a corporation , when backed by an expanding capital , to encroach steadily and effectually upon popular rights , until it shall finally attain to an unassailable supremacy . Yet there is another inference from this discussion . The New Jersey monopoly offends against interstate commerce . It is a revolt against a clearly-defined Constitutional // provision . It attempts to regulate what Congress alone can regulate . It levies imposts upon citizens of the United States , when this privilege inheres only in the central government . Heretofore , when this question has come up before the national legislature , it has been argued that , although Congress has the power to establish a post-route , and to nullify the existing compact , it is expedient that New Jersey herself should take the initiative and remove the obstruction . But if the facts already laid before the reader mean anything , they mean that the people of this State are so fettered and drugged that it is impossible for them to act in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have abdicated the functions of government . Mainly by the demoralization resulting from the monopoly rgime , but partly by an imperfect conception of interstate comity , which the education of the last one or two generations has rendered seemingly ineradicable , New Jersey has become blind to the nature of the privileges it has created . Some of the first lawyers of the State can see in the transit-dues only an equitable tax on the amount of business transacted by the companies . Interest perpetually steps in to corrupt the perception of right . " The way fares , " Mr. Stevens once wrote , " between places where there is a large local business , may be reduced with advantage as the business increases , where it does not iuterfere with the through fares . " And again , on another occasion , after recapitulating the immense sums which had been accumulated through the working of the monopoly , the Directors add , with persuasive eloquence , that nearly all of it had been derived " from strangers and persons not living in New Jersey . " These selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers , have produced a callousness to duty ; and there is , therefore , no alternative but for the nation to interfere . Of the commercial necessity of such interference no doubt can be entertained . A glance at the widening map of the United States will show that New Jersey occupies a significant position . Close to the eastern indentation of its coast-line lies the city of New York . This metropolis , which for some years has been the principal port of the nation , bids fair to become , at a period not very remote , the great mercantile centre of the // globe . With its own and the New England States , the communication of New York is direct ; with the South and Southwest its intercourse by railroad is across the State of which Trenton is the capital , and the lately consolidated companies the controlling power . Heretofore its communication with the West has been by the Central Railroad and the Erie Canal ; but it is already apparent that the only swift and short route possible must be one that shall cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of the future , - in reference , that is , to the day when the Pacific Railroad will have been completed , - New Jersey may be described as the keystone which unites the whole of America west of the longitude of New York with the chief commercial harbor of the United States , and consequently with the Old World . The New England States , indeed , are partially isolated from its influence . The coal for the factories and the iron for the machinery of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Connecticut , and Rhode Island , are brought from Philadelphia direct by water . Nevertheless , where rapid transportation is required , and in all cases of passenger travel , the citizens of Boston and Providence , as well as of Philadelphia and Baltimore , must cross the sandy level of New Jersey . In that State , therefore , if anywhere , commerce should be without impediment , without restraint , and without tax ; while in fact it is there that impediments , restraints , and taxes have existed , and exist , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of Scheldt imports and Danish Sound Dues . The postal service has suffered seriously in previous years from this cause . In the war of the rebellion , the inadequacy of the existing lines was demonstrated again and again ; while the loss to the commercial community by the exorhitancy of charges can be estimated only by millions of dollars . All these embarrassments are susceptible of a ready removal . A national post-route , properly limited in tariff rates , with a prescribed double track , solidly constructed , and built with reference to great speed , infrequent stoppages , and supreme regard to the convenience of the public , would do away with all complaints . Congress can grant this , and is bound to grant it . 1-litherto , the supple manipulations of the railroad kings have been efficient to produce inaction . Indeed , the peculiar and // subtile workings of the Camden and Amboy lobby at Washington would furnish an instructive chapter of political history . But we do not choose to enter upon the miserable details . It is sufficient that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly agent in the House , and the expulsion of John P. Stockton , who was elected for service in the Senate , the influence of the joint companies has met with a signal check . The field is therefore clear for action on the part of the general government , and it is one of the imperative duties of Congress to secure for the nation a free railroad through New Jersey . Should they do this a strenuous blow will be dealt , not merely at the Jersey oppression , but at all those other monopolies that result from the absence of competition , and which have made themselves hateful through the Union by intolerable exactions and their hurtful political sway .
