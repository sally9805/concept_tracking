ARTICLE V.-OUR FINANCES . THAT all should be just , and more punctiliously so in cases in which the party dealt with has no power of redress , is universally admitted ; but as the aggregation of people which constitutes a nation has no commou soul to suffer for its delinquencies , many seem willing to profit by public wrong , and let the penalty fall upon the individual instruments of it . They would not cheat their country 's creditors , nor even incur the suspicion of any such design , but are willing that others should repudiate for them , and thus hope to participate in the profit without having their characters tarnished Or their personal credit or safety impaired . But no member of a community can thus escape the penalty of its dishonor . If the individual is not polluted , his character is stained by the national guilt or meanness . The dishonesty of a nation imposes upon each of its citizens the onus of proving that he is not a knave . The power of a country , too , is essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy its credit is to destroy its protecting power . When loss of credit arises from want of means , a nation may still be respected ; but when , with ample resources , it refuses to pay , or seeks by a show of fraudulent intention to frighten its creditors into a compromise , it loses both credit and character , and can no longer sway by moral , or coerce by physical , agencies . We are at the moment insisting upon the right of our naturalized citizens to exemption from foreign allegiance . With the taint of repudiation upon us we could exert no moral influence upon such a question , nor could we enforce our doctrine by any physical demonstration . A case recently occurred , in which one of our adopted citizens was arrested in France as a deserter , on the ground that he had been drafted after having emigrated to this country , and had not answered to the demand of the government under which he was born for military service at his hands . Our moral influence proved to be sufficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wou'Id have been put forth in his behalf . // We are also now insisting that England shall pay for the depredations of the Alabama upon our commerce , and with a strong probability that our claims will be paid without a resort to arms . But morally and physically weakened by evading the payment of our creditors , what could we do ? England might tauntingly tell us to pay our own debts , rather than make such demands of her , as France could have bidden us be sure that we could command the services of our own citizens , before we interfered with her claims upon those born on her soil . Without credit we could neither equip an army nor float our navy . We should be powerless either to protect our rights or to resent insult . It may be said that the resource of taxation would still be left to us ; but national dishonesty so demoralizes a people , that with the taxes increased to the maximum ability to pay , the amount which will reach the treasury will still be insufficient for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engendered by the same laxity of principle . Already the most alarming feature of our posi. tion is the indication that there is not sufficient honesty among us to insure the faithful collection of the revenues , and a government which , at tremendous cost , subdued a formidable rebellion , ingloriously succumbs to a villainous gang of whisky distillers . The next expedient for the demands of war is a resort to forcedloans ; but this soon paralyzes productive industry and absorbs its accumulations , reducing the community to a semi-barbarous condition , as is practically illustrated in our neighborhood . It appears then that attacks upon our credit are more subversive of our power , as well as more destructive to our honor , than assaults upon our arms , and that treason in that form is more dangerous , and should be regarded as much more odious than armed rebellion , as fraud is meaner than open combat with equal or superior force . But the folly of the recent insidious attacks upon our credit is even greater than their meanness and guilt . By foolishly threatening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises without interest-in greenbacks-when we had no greenbacks to pay with , our credit and reputation have been wantonly injured without even the chance of pecuniary gain . Any man // who , in the management of his own business , should commit such a blunder , should thus destroy his financial credit and moral reputation , without the possibility of any compensating advantage , would be deemed a fit subject either for an idiotic school or a lunatic asylum . Even those so obtuse that they can not comprehend abstract reasoning , or even arithmetical computations , should learn something from facts before their eyes . Massachusetts , actuated by high moral principle , harmonizing with au enlightened and clear perception of her material interests , by paying gold without question , has sustained her honor and her credit , and thereby , in her comparatively small financial operations , already profited to the amount of millions . It may be said , in mitigation , that some of those who advocate payment in depreciated paper contemplate the emission of $1,200,000,000 of greenbacks to take up the bonds which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet had the hardihood to claim that this $1,200,000,000 is never to be paid in coin , but only that the time of payment is to be indefinite or payable when convenient . The bribe thus proffered to the people to fraudulently depreciate the currency is the gain of the interest on the $1,200,000,000 , or $72,000,000 per annuma large sum , well worth attention . But though large , what is it compared with the disadvantages of a fluctuating , irredeemable currency , on such a scale , and the general disarrangement thereby of a business , the gains of which , in a normal condition , paid the cost of government , furnished a generous living to all the people , and left a surplus of over $1,000,000,000 of gold value ? The additional labor required to do the business with such a currency , and its influence in diverting labor from production to mere speculation in its products , would far more than offset the $72,000,000 which it is proposed to save by the inflation . Issue this additional currency , making in all nearly $2,000,000,000 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would , even if its eventual payment at some indefinite time were undoubted , be worth only // just equal to the amount of gold required to effect the exchanges . In our case it would be only $500,000 , 000 , and it would be passed and received at that rate . It may be supposed that this result would be modified by capitalists at home or abroad withdrawing the paper from use , and holding it for the profit of eventual payment in gold , but it is obvious that so long as parties would pay any interest upon it for use , this would not be done . It would be loaned to these and put in use . But in the case in hand such relief would be cut off in another way . It would be obvious that the same reason which is assigned for paying the bonds in greenbacks , viz. , that they were bought with greenbacks , would apply to paying the holders of the currency only the 25 per cent. , which they paid for it , and in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent. , payable at a time indefinitely future , say only 20 per cent . But for the same reason it would again be reduced below the 20 per cent. , and thus run down continually until wholly refused . This last consideration relates to the credit of the currency rather than to the effect of its quantity ; so long as by common consent it is accredited as the universal medium of exchange in the country , it will have the aggregate value which is required for that service or use , say $500,000,000 and no more , and if double or fourfold that amount is put in circulation each bill will pass for half or quarter its nominal value , for , as just shown , so long as any one will give any interest for its use , the whole will be forced into use at this depreciation in its purchasing power . The effect of such a currency upon the business of a country would be exceedingly injurious . With the measure of value four for one , nobody would risk investments in the means of saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their cost . No one would build storehouses for grain , or mills to grind , or railroads or ships to transport it . Such enterprises as the Pacific railroad would have to be abandoned and roads already built would only be repaired under conditions onerous to the public . The companies would not buy rails for repairs at fourfold price , unless they could get tenfold price for their use , because by a change in the currency they might any day lose all the extra cost . Our farmers could not afford even to replace their // wornout reapers and threshing machines , and would soon be reduced to the old modes by scythe and flail . Add to these disadvantages that of sustaining in extravagant living an army of speculators and peculators engendered by inflation , and the $72,000,000 of interest sinks into insignificance , compared with the loss and burden put upon the country in the process by which it is proposed to save it . But let us note this process a little more in detail . In the first place the bondholders would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large portion of this would fall not on wealthy capitalists , but on the depositors in savings banks and holders of small amounts , either of bonds or of the previous issue of currency , to whom it would bring actual privation and suffering , and another large portion would be more severely felt by laborers than by capitalists who employ them . Most of the latter class would profit in other ways by the change in value . Take , for instance , the case of a baker , who , when the inflation occurs , is employing men at fifty dollars payable at the end of each month , and having a month 's stock of flour on hand , of which each laborer will convert thirty barrels per month into bread . The cost of the thirty barrels of flour l*efore the inflation is , say $500 Cost of labor 50  --  550 Add for cu*stomary profit , . . . 50 V value of the bread in sound currency , $600 . Its value in the inflated currency will be $2,400 . So that for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread he would have done , and as all other articles rise in the same proportion , the laborer for this month 's wages can obtain only a quarter the usual quantity of supplies . This may be divided over a longer period than one month , but this loss of three quarters of a month 's wages must fall upon him . It may be argued that thb gain to the employer and loss to the laborer are only temporary , and will eventually be neutralized by an equal decline in prices when a sound currency is restored . This is at most only partially true , for the capitalists and dealers immediately begin to charge extra profits as guar // antee for this risk of decline , and prices to the laborers and other consumers are thereby enhanced during the whole period of inflation . There is also an actual addition to the cost of production and distribution , not only from the consequent deficiency of labor-saving apparatus before alluded to , but from the increased labor of doing business with such a currency . With the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should curtail his operations and do less in proportion to his capital . With the necessity for increased thought and vigil and to guard against losses by its fluctuations he can give less attention to other details , and hence more persons are required to manage the same business . This makes a loss to the whole community . The bad effects of an irredeemable paper currency have been so repeatedly proved by actual experience , that it seems strange that it should still finds advocates . Our continental money , the subsequent separate experience of nearly every State in this Union , and our present condition , furnish ample testimony of its baneful effects . In the Southern Confederacy we have a warning of what would be our fate if we adopted the plan of the expansionists . There , one common ruin and almost universal destitution and suffering have been the result . It may be said , and truly , that the effect was there aggravated by civil war ; but it was only aggravated , and such an emission of paper money , without any war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . No labor-saving machinery being provided , and even the reward of manual toil made uncertain , product would have been diminished till the necessaries of life became scarce . The writer has scen a community of great productive ability reduced to great straits , by an inflated irredeemable paper currency , when there was no aggravation by war . In the revulsion which succeeded the great expansion of 183k to 1837 , the citizens of the State of Mississippi were much embarrassed by debt . This arose in part from the cost of clearing the land and other expenses incident to recent settlement ; and partly from speculation at the high prices which the expansion engendered . Most of their banks failed , and various devices were resorted to to supply the imperative demand for a // medium of exchange which exists in all civilized communities , and which is an essential element of social progress . In one intelligent community , well executed bills of one to five dollars each , payable in ulwmpsonian medicines , were current ; and in another their change bills read , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The urgent necessity of the hour , however , seemed to call forth the talent suited to the emergency . One man , regarded as a miracle of financial ability , stepped forward to supply the want . He was hailed as the Nicholas Biddle of the South , and regarded as the deliverer of his country . With wonderful energy he put press and paper in requisition , and flooded the State with Brandon Bank bills . With these he and his coadjutors bought the cotton crop of a large section of the State . The day was not long enough and they bought by night also . The planters , in the rage which then possessed them for producing cotton , had neglected to raise food ; they sold their cotton for Brandon Bank bills or other paper of about equal value . This sufficed to pay a portion of their debts , but very soon the flat boatmen refused to take it in payment for corn or provisions , and among an active and energetic people , possessing an abundant area of one of the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no war or pestilence , with ordy the calamities incident to bad currency , there was actual suffering for food . In view of the apparent sincerity of those who still advocate expansion , it would be unfair to charge the principal agent of this suffering with intentional fraud . He may only have been misled by the same glittering and seductive fallacies which now bewilder some of our statesmen . That on witnessing the result he ran away and hung himself , should incline us to a charitable verdict . If the proposed plan of increasing our currency by thousands of millions to pay the bonds should be adopted , we should probably see suffering for food among the laborers , even in this land of abundant provisions and prudent forethought . They will find , some pay-day , that their month 's wages will hardly suffice for a day 's living , and if the authors of such calamity should not then , like their Mississippi proto // type , have the grace to hang themselves , it is very probable that at least their effigies would grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtless and ignorant are easily deceived . The laborer or mechanic who has not investigated it , and only knows that he does not get enough greenbacks to buy food for his family , readily believes that this is because there are not greenbacks enough , and hence he clamors for more . He is naturally very skeptical as to the demonstrated truth that the greater the quantity issued the greater will be his deficiency . This , on its face , is to him a mystical paradox , directly opposed to the evidence of his senses ; and yet he may readily perceive , that as the products are not thereby increased , giving to every man double the amount of greenbacks can not enable the holders to buy double , or even add at all to the quantity of products which each can obtain . If , as generally happens , the additional issue is unequally divided , the favored class will gain at the expense of the others , who are thus very conveniently swindled of a portion of their rightful share . Our legislators are presumed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act ; it is their duty to give the requisite thought and attention to them , and they can no more excuse themselves for wrong action by the plea that the people demanded it , than a druggist can excuse himself for administering arsenic to an importunate customer who thought it was white sugar . The fact , however , seems to be that a very small portion of the people desire either expansion of the currency or payment of the bonds in greenbacks . This small portion , being made up of active , pushing speculators and noisy demagogues , appears much more numerous than it really is . In the Chicago Convention , every section of our country being represented , these doctrines were rebuked with great unanimity , and the speeches of prominent democrats encouraged the hope that they would be discountenanced by the New York Convention in July . Necessity can no longer be even asserted . Profound thought and the actual experience of centuries have demonstrated that an inflated currency fosters gambling and speculation at the expense of regular industry ; that it makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of its // distribution to the consumers , and that it is demoralizing in its tendency . There is now no excuse for the lawmakers who inflict it upon us , and no apology for their action , except that of an ignorance unpardonable in those who assume the duties and responsibilities of legislators . It would be easy to show that our losses from inflated currency have already been more than $1,000,000,000 , or that our public debt has been nearly or quite doubled by its use . But independently of the increase of our debt and the diminished ability to pay it , which still continues as a consequence of our financial policy , the unequal distribution of the burden brought about by the same means is worthy of serious consideration . During the war the average depreciation of our currency was about 50 per cent. ; in other words , the nominal prices of staple commodities were nealy double what they would have been with a sound currency . But the wages of labor did not advance in the same ratio . The risks of doing business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits were necessarily charged by those who risked capital in trade , or put it out in any way to be repaid by future production . Hence , in the division of product , the laborer had to concede to the capitalists a larger proportion than usual , of course getting for themselves less than their customary share of what they produced . Besides the laborers , there was another large class , upon whom economy and privation were thus enforced , including all those who were living on limited incomes derived from interest of money loaned by themselves or by trust companies and savings and other banks , or upon fixed salaries which were not increased with the depreciation of the current money , in which , by force of law , they were obliged to receive their dues . The effect upon all those was just the same as though Congress had enacted that all such should pay an income tax of 50 per cent . per annum , and collected it with unfailing certainty . Here was a monstrous wrong inflicted upon a large class , embracing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless families among us , and a wrong which , to the extent of the depreciation of the currency , we still persist // in inflicting upon them . Those who , with capital , have activity , ability , and skill to use it , obtain more than their fair share of products , and the laborers must take less ; while those who , from age , sex , debility , or other cause , are unfitted for hard work or active business , must take a yet smaller share . Any man may now find , in his own neighborhood , families who have thus been compelled to submit to unwonted privation , or perhaps been obliged to choose between the physical pangs of hunger and the mental agony of dependence upon the charity of others . Often , no doubt , their sense of selfrespect , their cherished hopes and honorable pride have forbidden them to complain , and their sighs have been heard and their anguish known only by Him whose ear is ever open to the cry of the weak and the oppressed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than beg or excite a mortifying pity by exposing their destitution , while most of them have been as guileless of the cause of their suffering as the gazelle of the bow which speeds the fatal shaft . Previous to the war , the South , by its peculiar institution , imposed all the burdens of the community upon an unprotected class , rendered helpless by ignorance and disabilities legally enforced upon them ; and in our imposition of so large a portion of our burdens upon the weak and helpless there is something akin to this ; though it does not involve the repulsive brutality of slavery , it too nearly resembles it in its injustice and its meanness . To persevere in thus taxing this class is a national disgrace , and for the wrong and the suffering consequent upon it the party in power and permitting it will ultimately be held responsible even by those who can not trace it either to their action or inaction . During the war more large fortunes , even at gold value , were here accumulated than at any previous period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading and wealthy classes ; and yet the aggregate spare income of the nation was then very much diminished , nearly all of it being absorbed in the cost of war . Nor except among the injured classes , to whom I have alluded , was their increased economy . It is then clear that these large fortunes must have been mnade up from the accumulated savings of the coerced economy and privation of the laborers and // those living on limited incomes from salaries , rents , or interest of money . By the instrumentality of an inflated currency , their savings were concentrated in the hands of the active traders and grasping speculators . If this is an intended result of the legislation which continues to inflict this currency upon us without even a pretence of necessity , it is a crime deserving the severest retribution ; and , if this result was unforeseen , it betrays an ignorance which a very little thought would have enlightened , and which is therefore unpardonable in those who assume the duty of directing our national affairs . But it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very recent period money was exceedingly scarce in the Atlantic States , and the West complains that it does not have enough . Reduce this sectional complaint to its ultimate , and every man will tell you he wants more greenbacls than he has got or can get , and hence , as each individual wants more , it may be inferred that the aggregate community wants more . Though this is not the form in which the advocates of expansion put it , some of their arguments amount only to this . These advocates certainly do not mean to say that it is desirable to have a greater bulk , or greater number of current bills , without any increase of value ; or that doubling or quadrupling their present thickness , size , or number , without any increase in their aggregate value , is desirable . Some of those who demand expansion still assert that the depreciation of our currency does not arise from its excessive quantity . They say we have less per capita in this country than in England or France , and hence argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This argument is fallacious in many ways . If it is admitted that we have less than our proper share of the currency of the world , it is obvious that we shall not remedy this difficulty by increasing the volume of our paper issues , which , as already stated , will add nothing to its aggregate value ; the value of each bill will lessen just in proportion as the quantity is increased . A man might as well say , I have not got as many dollars asmy neighbors ; I will cut each of mine in two , and still call each one a dollar . INo one need object to this . Those who make // exchanges with him on this basis may take his money at his new valuation and double the prices of their commodities . Diluting the paper currency by issuing double the quantity required will have the same effect as depreciating the weight or value of coins by one half . The warmest advocate for expansion will hardly assert that the end he desires could thus be attained . But the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circulating medium of the world which properly belongs to it , depends upon so many elements that no inference drawn from its mere ratio to population is reliable . A community in which each individual produces a large portion of what he consumes , will require less than one in which each sells the product of his own labor and buys his supplies of others . The degree of confidence which exists among the members of a community is also an important element . If in April a manufacturer lets a farmer have iron or cloth on his verbal promise that in December he will in payment deliver corn from the crop he is then planting , and those employed by the manufacturer to make the iron or cloth will take his promise then to pay them in this corn , these exchanges can be effected without any other medium than words spoken . Or if the manufacturer takes the farmer 's note payable in December , and gives hi* own to his workmen on same time , the exchanges will be made with a medium which the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day due , these notes may all be settled through a clearing house in which they balance , and thus the whole exchanges be effected without resorting to the general circulation . If they will not trust one another , then they must pay real value down , or substitute some acceptable credit , e. q. pay gold or give the credit of the government in the form of greenbacks . The great confidence reposed in each other enables bankers to establish clearing houses , with a daily saving of the use of millions in the settlement of their exchanges . It is evident then that such comparisons between communities diverse in character , and differing also in the amount and kind of business and in the mode of doing it , very imperfectly indicate the // amount of currency required for each , and certainly such deductions should not be urged against the results of actual experience . If we now admit that greater value of currency is desirable , we come to the question whether increasing the issue or any other legislative provision can accomplish this object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , or can enable us without limit to get the products of labor in exchange for that which costs no labor , how thoughtless , how remorseless in them to let us all be toiling and moiling at the plough , the loom , and the forge , to produce value which their mere fiat would create . Again , under the broadest admissions it would in view of the facts still be pertinent to inquire if it would be expedient for our rulers to promise a dollar 's worth of our labor in the future for seventy cents worth down . The fact , however , is , that no addition to the actual value of the currency can be effected by increasing its nominal quantity . It is universally admitted by all who have given any thought to the si*bject , that , other things remaining the same , increasing the quantity of coin in the world would not increase its aggregate value or purchasing power ; that if the quantity were doubled , cach dollar would buy only half of the products of labor that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true of any section , however small , provided all interchange of coin or of coin metals with the rest of the world were rendered impossible . Suppose that in this country labor being worth one dollar per day , and all other things in that proportion , 400,000,000 of dollars is required to make the internal exchanges . If the quantity of coin should , under the conditions just mentioned , be increased to $800,000,000 , other things would be at double price , and in fact the value or purchashing power of the $800,000,000 would be just what the $400,000,000 was before the expansion . It is a peculiarity of currency that its aggregate value , as compared with the exchanges it has to effect , can not be altered by merely changing its quantity . The amount required will vary inversely as the rapidity of circulation ( i. e. with the greater or less amount of exchanges which a given sum can effect in a given time ) . This may be increased by mechanical contri // vances for rapid movement , or by increased confidence among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but other things being the same , the actual value or purchasing power of the whole currency , be it one million or a thousand millions of gold or of paper , will be the same . This peculiarity , however , consists in the accuracy with which the depreciation may be comparatively stated , rather than in any exclusive application of the general principle which , with some modification , applies to other things as well as to currency . If , for instance , we had in this country double the quantity of wheat re ( luired for bread , and its export were impossible , it would fall to a price at which it would all be used . It ; for instance , it were usually worth two dollars per bushel for bread , and there was no other use for it except to feed swine , and for this its value was only one dollar , its price would fall to one dollar . Currency as such has only one use , that of effecting exchanges . Any excess of it can not be devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exchangeable value , till the whole is required for that purpose . If , as before assumed , wages being one dollar per day and its products in proportion . 400,000,000 of dollars are sufficient and $800,000,000 are permanently put in circulation , labor and its products will rise to double price , and the value of the $800,000,000 will buy the same amount or have the same aggregate excWangeable value that $400,000,000 had at the old standard . Its aggregate value would still be just the equiva. lent for $400,000,000 of days labor or its product and no more . These positions , true even of gold , are , obviously , at least equally true of paper currency made up of the most reliable promises to pay gold , and in regard to this the condition of non-export is at once reached . If our internal trade at gold prices requires only $500,000,000 , and the government issues $700,000,000 , its whole value will still be only $50U,000 , 000 , and gold will be at 40 per cent . premium , fluctuating to the one side or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of supply and demand . The argument then that the government should increase its issues to make money plentiful , is wholly fallacious , such increase adding nothing to its aggregate value or its power of effecting exchanges . // Indeed , from some other considerations it has been demonstrated , that the practical effect of expansion must be to make money scarce . This was experimentally proved in the great inflation of 1834 to 1836 , and again in that of 1844 to 1856 . This however would not apply to a currency , the credit basis of which was doubted . It is always easy to exchange certain value at very full price for doubtful promises of payment . It is evident that in the case of a surplus of wheat above stated , that a large crop might command less money than a smaller one , and it would then be to the interest of the holders to destroy the surplus quantity , as the Dntch monopolizers did with spices . In the case of currency the reduced value being the same , the owners of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we have seven dollars for every five needed , then if all would combine and every one burn twosevenths of all he owned , they would not individually lose anything , and would confer a great benefit upon the community-relieving it of the excess and its attendant evils . By the owners I do not mean those who merely have the current money in possession . They may owe it to others at whose charge the two-sevenths should be destroyed , whether it be in their own pockets or in those of their debtors . But both wheat and currenc*y are always in too many hands to admit of such combination . The evils of a depreciated currency being admitted , the important question is , how can we best get rid of it ? We have now about $700,000 , o00 of paper which , gold averaging about 140 , is worth $600,000,000 in coin , indicating that the last amount is what is now required to effect our internal exchanges at gold value . This seems larger than the calculation founded upon the supposed amount prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the addition to the precious metals in the world during that time , added to the increase of the latter in other countries by the disuse of them in this , would justify ; but it is impossible to ascertain how much coin entered into our circulation before the suspension of specie payments . This element is the more important because it counts in the estimate in two ways ; first as indicating an amount to be replaced with paper , and again // as adding to the quantity of gold in other countries to which ours has gone , requiring a corresponding increase of currency here to keel ) our proportion good . We may therefore fairly assume that the gold value of our $700,000,000 of paper for use is $500,000,000 . To get a gold basis we must correct this discrepancy between the nominal and actual value . There are various modes of doing this . The most direct would be to withdraw $200,000,000 of paper . The government could do this by collecting that amount more than is required for its current payments and retiring it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds which would be taken to get the interest and not for use as currency ; or it might require the National Banks to withdraw any portion of the amount , and surrender it in exchange for the bonds held as security for its issue . As the debts due those banks would all , by the process , become payable in gold value , they might thus withdraw the whole amount , and still be benefited by so doing . Another mode of rectification would be to depreciate our coins to five-sevenths of their present value . People will now give five-sevenths of a gold dollar for a paper dollar , and if the gold dollar were reduced to five-sevenths , its present value , they would as readily exchange at par . In this case the whole paper issue now out would be required , and its actual value would remain the same , viz. , $700,000 , 000 in the new coin , or $5*0,000,000 in the old or present coinage. ? lhe discrepancy between the nominal and actual value of our currency being corrected , in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact become convertible into gold at par , and specie basis be practically reached without any law commanding it . The depreciation of the coinage is so generally associated with national dishonesty that without good reason we ought not to think of subjecting ourselves to the suspicion which attaches to such a measure . There are , however , good reasons why some reduction should now be made . It is desirable to have the value of coins made uniform throughout the world , and to do this the readiest way seems to be to adopt that of France . This would require our gold coins to be reduced about 7 per cent . Nearly all the indebtedness among us is // now payable in paper , which is about 28 per cent . below par . To return to a specie basis reduced 7 per cent , in value would relieve the debtors of one-fourth of the difference at the cost of the creditor . If this were done , and with the requirement that all contracts properly payable in gold should be paid at the old standard , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be preserved , and an important change be effected with less disturbance to trade than would result from making it under normal specie paying conditions . Those who loaned specie value without stipulating for like payment would still be the losers by thus receiving only 93 per cent . of the amount in payment . But they would also lose as much in the value of their interest in less than three years , and a law which substituted paper for coin payments  --  a law which only necessity could justify-must entail some evils upon the community . With this reduction in the value of our coins we should only have to withdraw $160,000,000 of paper to reach specie basis , which could be very easily accomplished . The plan proposed by Mr. Endicutt of substituting compound interest notes for the amount to be withdrawn would tend to throw the contraction upon the periods at which the currency could be most conveniently spared , and thus lessen the disturbance to trade ; but that the contraction should begin at the earliest of such periods a portion of these notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest *in currency . This being much below the rate obtained on government bonds , may be regarded as a coinparatively low rate , indicating abundant supply of money , and hence , that when that rate prevails , it is a proper time to contract . Without thus reducing the volume of paper to the quantity required to make the exchanges for which it is used , at gold value , or ample provision to do it , no law requiring specie payments would avail . As well enact that people should pay their debts whether able to or not . Something more than a legislative edict is required . If with only $100,000,000 of gold at its command the government should resume , the gold would all be taken at once , and another $100,000,000 be demanded ; for gold would still be at 20 per cent . premium . On the other hand , some recent writers of financial reputation , assert that the government must // as a prerequisite to resumption be prepared to redeem all the greenbacks with coin . This is an exaggeration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When the paper is so reduced that it is only sufficient to effect , at gold prices , that portion of the exchanges for which it answers as well as coin , the point of resumption or of actual convertibility at par is reached . Reduce the paper below this , and it would command a premium in gold ( unless there was at the same time a like deficiency of gold for the purposes to which it was best adapted ) . This was clearly shown in the case of the $50,000,000 of paper issued early in the war , and which was receivable in lieu of gold for duties on imports . So long as there was more out than was needed for this purpose the notes of this issue were at a discount , but when the quantity was reduced they commanded a small premium in gold , not that they would pay more custom dues , but simply because they could be more readily , safely , and cheaply transferred from the debtor to the creditor-there being at that time no circulating notes or certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that legalizing contracts payable in gold would gradually improve the currency and lead to resumption . That such contracts should be legalized is eminently proper . Nothing but the real or supposed necessities of war could justify such tyrannical restraint upon a people having any pretension to free government . It may , however , be doubted whether the effect upon the currency anticipated by these writers would be realized . In former cases of bank suspensions , when coin was the only lawful money , paper only was used as currency , and hence it seems very improbable that without this advantage gold would not now get into common use . But suppose it should , say to an equal extent with paper , the whole paper currency would then be applied to onehalf the amount of business for which it is now used , and consequently its value , instead of being 72 , would be only 36 cents to the dollar . Experience does not encourage the hope that at this , or even a much greater depreciation , it would be discarded . At Buenos Ayres the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . of its nominal value , // and though very inconvenient and very destructive to their prosperity , the people there persist in using it . The mere depreciation has no tendency to cause a portion of currency to be withdrawn . For the reasons before stated , its real value never can be in excess of what is required for the uses to which it is applied ; and hence the demand for the whole , when there is only $500,000,000 , is no more than if the quantity were tenfold the amount ; and it is just as likely to be scarce or insufficient for trade with the greater as with the lesser quantity . Again , as before stated , no portion of a currency will be hoarded for eventual payment so long as it will command interest for use , and as interest is paid in kind , those hiring can afford to pay the same per cent . upon a depreciated as upon a sound currency .                  @ @ @
