J N the autumn of 1863 I was making the necessary preparations at Peking for a journey homeward through Tartary and Siberia , when , at the instance of Mr. Burlingame and Sir Frederick Bruce , the Chinese Government requested that I should undertake the examination of some of their principal coal fields . In order to suppress piracy and smuggling , the Government had instructed Mr. Lay , their Inspector-General of Maritime Customs , who was then in England , to purchase and send out a fleet of gunboats , officered and manned by Englishmen . A flotilla of eight steamers had accordingly arrived , under the command of Captain Sherard Osborne . Alarmed at the idea of having to pay from fifteen to twenty dollars a ton for English coal , and knowing that they had themselves large deposits of this mineral , they decided to search for desirable fuel among their own mines . The arrangements were made over a lunch at the Tsung-li-yamun , with the officers of the Board of Foreign Affairs . The interview , which was very friendly , brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belief in the growth of coal in abandoned mines : everything was produced by the co-action of yin and yang , force and matter , the active and passive , male and female principles in nature , and where surrounding conditions had once favored the production of coal , why should they not always favor it ? But at the same time they objected to extensive mining , on the ground that it would exhaust the store on which future generations would be dependent ; an inconsistency in reasoning which they got over by saying that the rate of growth of new coal is not known . Another objection to extensive mining was the danger of litigation from trespass , and one of the officers immediately proceeded to give a long and romantic story of a desperate subterranean battle which had raged for days between the forces of two mines which had suddenly become connected under ground ; an encounter in which the participants were mutually exterminated . It was agreed that three mandarins , two civil , and one military , should go with me . The question having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chinese , Tung-Ta-jin selected for the first syllable the word Pang , as the nearest approach offered by the language , and wrote it for me on a card in a character in which the principal element was the sign of a dragon ; did they think there might be some connection between the intended approach to foreign innovations and the clutches of this terrific monster ? Through the kindness of Sir Frederick Bruce , Mr. Murray , of the English Legation , was permitted to accompany me , and I will say in advance that much of the success which attended the excursion was due to his excellent knowledge of the Chinese language , as much of the pleasure was due to his genial companionship . qwq a characteristic scene . " What have you to eat ? " demanded Too . " Boiled millet and eggs , " replied the landlord . " What do you charge for four eggs ? " " Very little-almost nothing , only six cash apiece , " was the reply . " How dare you call that cheap ? You must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought foreign steamers , and Prince Kung has sent this gentleman to find coal for them ; therefore you should let us have the eggs for three cash . " By this time , Too had worked himself into a passion , and fairly shrieked his argument into the ears of the host and of the gathered crowd . By his appeal to patriotism , he finally succeeded in reducing the price , by our money , about onetenth of a cent per egg , making a gain of about two cents on our bill , to be divided among the pockets of our escort . Although within fifty miles of one of the largest cities of the world , we were in a region where money is little used , nearly all the small transactions of the people being effected by barter of the necessaries of life . The currency of China is very clumsy , the copper coin being so bulky as to render its transportation costly , while the uncoined silver is extremely inconvenient , from the fact that it has to be weighed at every payment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the legal standard of weight differs several times in the course of a few days ' journey . In Peking , besides the ordinary cash , there is a copper coin the actual value of which is many times less than that which is stamped upon it ; this is useless beyond the walls of the city . Peking also enjoys an institution which I had supposed was peculiar , in past years , to the United States , namely , an endless number of wild-cat banks issuing paper currency ; their notes are useless out of the town , as no one will take them for fear the bank may have already failed , or that it may suspend before its notes can be presented for payment . We found in the inhabitants of these mountains a simple-hearted and civil people who were quite free from the dislike to foreigners which prevails among the inhabitants of the South , and for which Europeans and Americans have chiefly themselves to blame . Although every ounce of food that is gained from // these barren hills is won by the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . They are contented with the boiled yellow millet and a few vegetables , with now and then a dish of fried eggs , or a chicken which has passed the prime of life , whatever that period may be in the time allotted to a fowl . The next day we continued our journey southward , through a deep and narrow valley in the limestone . The high and precipitous walls frequently approached each other so closely that the valley became a gorge . Finally , we emerged into the mOre open country of the Huen-ho . Crossing a high spur , around which the river bends , we began our initiation into Chinese mountain paths . Here the limestone has been traversed and dislocated by large dykes of porphyry , inclosing fragments of the slate which belongs between the upper and lower beds of the traversed rock . After passing this spur , our road lay , for several miles , along the steep face of the mountain , and high above the rushing river . The road , paved with porphyry boulders , was almost impassable ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as glass by the daily passage , for centuries , of long trains of mules loaded with coal . On such a road , a false step might plunge both horse and rider into the roaring torrent below . At Ching-pai-kau we were ferried across the river , and entered the valley of the Chai-tang Creek . Here , passing a little mill worked by an overshot wheel , we continued our route under the shade of willows along the edge of a sluice , until the valley narrowed and we entered a wild gorge . The limestone cliffs which at first formed the walls were succeeded as we went south by the towering peaks and steep declivities and side ravines of the great mass of conglomerate , which , overlying the limestone , forms itself the foundation of the coalmeasures . Soon this was succeeded by overlying beds of the softer sandstones and slates of the coal series , and we emerged from the narrow gorge into th' broad and open valley of Chai-tang , a region of low hills with soft outlines , such as are characteristic of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. sight of the walls of Chai-tang over one side of the creek , while on the other rose a high , flat-topped hill , with a lofty watch-tower at each end , ancient guardians of the valley . Soon after our arrival at the inn , we were waited upon by the magistrate of the district , from whom we obtained a complete list of the coal mines in theneighborhood . As I do not propose to give a detailed account of the mines of this district , I will here remark that there are , within a radius of four miles from Chai-tang , a large number of openings upon the coal seams . Within this area . the coal varies from caking bituminous varieties to pure anthracite . The seam containing the Fu-tau mine averages about seven feet in thickness , and produces . a steam coal equal , if not superior , to the best Welsh variety . The " Ta-tsau " ( great seam ) , about three miles south of the Fu-tau , consisting of two beds , separated by about eight feet of sandstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal , is a deposit of remarkably fine anthracite . The other mines contain coal of a more bituminous character . Each kind has its distinctive Chinese name , and is mined for some special purpose in the domestic and manufacturing arts . The caking varieties are burned to coke , and at every mine the dust , which with us is thrown away , is mixed with a little clay and moulded into cakes for artificial fuel . For many purposes , especially for use in the kitchen , the artificial product is esteemed more highly than when in the natural shape , as the globular form of the cakes admits a ready draught , while their composition is said to enable the consumer to control the rate of burning much better than with any other fuel . In large citi Cs , situated at a distance 30 // from the mines , the dust and cinders of coal are mixed with the dung of cows and horses , and with clay . The absence of machinery for draining has prevented the Chinese from working more than a few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chai-tang District are highly inclined , this point is soon reached . Aside from this , their whole system is so defective that the utmost capacity of production of any one mine in this district is less than two thousand tons a year . The works are entered by an inclined plane , which descends in the coal to less than a hundred feet below water level , where it communicates with a nearly horizontal gallery , which , extending to the farthest limits of the property , forms the main thoroughfare of the mine . Though unable to work below this level , the Chinese miner literally exhausts the fuel lying above it . By means of rising inclined planes connected by levels , he subdivides the seam into pillars . Ventilation is effected either by air shafts or by a blowing machine constructed much upon the same principle as our fanning mill for grain , and resembling this more than our fan ventilators . The timbering , which is mostly confined to the main level , is very costly , owing to the almost entire absence of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom level to the foot of the inclined plane . One half the width of this slope is cut out into hollow steps four or five feet high , in each one of which stands a man armed with a bucket . By these the water is bailed from step to step until it reaches the surface . In some mines this work is done entirely by blind men . The manner of raising the coal is not less primitive than the drainage ; the bottom level and the inclined plane are usually covered with smooth , round sticks , over which the coal is dragged on sledges by the coolies . The passages are generally so low that these men are forced to go on hands and knees , dragging the sledge by menns of a cord passed round the neck and between the legs . The foel sells at the different mines of this district at prices ranging from $i 70 to 2 00 per ton2,000 l ) ounds . The coal field of Chai-tang is cut off at the west by a high escarpment , the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there occurs a small patch of coal which is cut up into dislocated fragments by ( lykes of porphyry , which in places traverse the seams , and in some instances are spread out parallel to these , forming for a greater or less distance the roof or the floor of the bed . Near this place , which is called Ching-shui , there are the ruins of an old furnace , where , some years since , there were cast large quantities of iron currency . This expedient was adopted by the Government during its financial straits , with the view of making the iron cash pass for the same value as those of copper ; than which latter , if anything , they were a little smaller . This attempt was a complete failure , and to this day this iron currency lies stored in immense quantities in one of the old palaces of the Tartar city . After having finished the examination of the Chai-tang District , I determined to visit the coal fields lying at the edge of the great plain on the eastern slope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route we should take , Too instantly informed us that he had made careful inquiries into the geography of the region , and had found that there was actually only one road leading out of it , namely , the one by which we had come . I had wished to descend the valley of the Yang-ho to the point where it enters the plain , and , in spite of Too 's geographical investigations , I felt confident that there must be a road of some kind following the course of the river . Calling on thc magistrate of the // district , and several men who were said to be thoroughly acquainted with the country , I held a council , which I had no doubt would confirm my belief in the existence of the desired road . But no I Too led off with an argument giving physical and political reasons why no road could either now he , or ever have been built in the valley and he was unanimously sustained by the others . Murray . after a severe cross-examination , elicited the fact that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time during the Han dynasty , or later but that in many l ) laces tile l ) recipices , in the sides of which it bad been dug , had fallen . But there was no road now ; this they were all agreed upon . Close questioning , how ever , brought out an additional fact , namely , that there was a path , impassable , however , for animals , and attended with the greatest danger even for foot passengers . " Good , " I said ; " we will take this road to-morro*v . " But we had not yet vanquished all the lions that seemed to stand guard over the valley of tile Xan g-ho . The path , they said , if such it could be called , was very winding , crossing tile river , from shore to shore , and in places where the bed contained fathomless quicksands . This lion being defeated , a host of fresh ones came to tile rescue . There were no inhabitants , and we could *et nothing to eat in places , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific blasts of wind ; the river was subject to unaccountable freshets , which were liable at any time to fill the gorges , carrying everything before them . When we asked one of the mountaineers how he had gained all this information about a valley wilich no one could visit , he replied that he knew it from two men *vllo , in ooino tbrouob Ilad experiented these ; but , * for all horrors *n*rLunaLe ? y his testimony , he added that they were both swallowed up by quicksands . I must give credit to Wan* and Ma for having taken no part in the argument . The next morning , we returned to the valley of the Huen-ho , which we descended to tile pont at which we had previously entered it . Here the road forked , and the one which descended the river was certainly larger than the other on e , by which we had come into the valley from the north . To the great disgust of Too , I turned into the river road . Ve soon found that this was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a point where the river narrowed , and the valley contracted to a gloomy gorge , inclosed between lofty cliffs of limestone . In the face of tile wall tile roa*t was hewn into steps , by which it ascended to a point high above the river , from which it again descended by another steep stairway . The route was less tilan three feet wide , with a vertical cliff on one side , while tow-ird the river it was protected by a parapet about one foot and a half higll . It was an ugly place for man or beast ; long use had polished the rock till it was as smooth as glass . 1-laying begun the passage on horseback , neither Murray nor myself ventured to dismount , fearing to disturb the horses ' balance on the smooth and narrow place . In making the descent , my horse went down on his haunches , and I confidently expected that , in his st ruoole to rise , he would plunge us both over the parapet , and down to the dark mass of waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong animal with great caution regailled his feet , trembling like a leaf . I was not surprised when we found a considerable village a little farther down , and , better yet , a comfortable dinner and bed , in a region where we had been warned of the absence of people and food . if anything astonisned me , it was the long trains of hundreds of mules , Ileaxily laden with coal , which we saw tile next day ; for it seemed to me impossible that they could go up and down the smooth stairways which we hadi l ) assedl . During this day 's journey we crossed tile river once* fording over a bed ot // beautiful gravel ; but , although there were neither quicksands nor terrific winds howling from the bo*vels of the earth , the road was certainly horrible enough to have been built in the time of the Han , and used ever since without being repaired . The river here keeps near the contact between the limestone and the overlying porphyry conglomerates . In each of these formations the aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely wild . At the little village of Wang-ping-tsun we stopped for the night . Murray and myself paid a friendly visit to Wang . Behind all the politeness of the old man we could perceive that our visit was not well-timed . An opium pipe and lamp lying on the table were sufficient explanation of our friend 's uneasiness . We had long known that he smoked opium ; but the old man had supposed his habit unknown to all but himself . Seeing my looks involuntarily directed to the pipe , he made the common excuse , saying that he sometimes used the drug for relief from pain , but that he neither had contracted the habit nor should he do so . When we were seated , Wang told us how a former friend of his , who had once been a magistrate of the place where we then were , had fallen into the habit of using opium ; how this habit , gaining on him , had caused him to neglect his official duties , and had transformed a kind-hearted and beloved magistrate into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the then high price of the drug ; how , after being mobbed and driven from his office , he became an outcast and his family beggars . When Wang finished the story of his friend by saying that , in an attack of remorse and despair , he had ended life by an overdose of opium , there were tears in the old man 's eyes ; and I could not help thinking that he was unfolding his own future , so true was his story to the career of almost all who become addicted to this vice . The next day our road passed over three high ridges , by crossing one of which , the Niu-chRu-ling , we saved a very great bend in the river . Having reached the climax of the horrible , in describing roads already mentioned , I have no words left to do justice to this . For a distance of several miles the way over this hill is paved with large irregular blocks of porphyry , the . surfaces of which are everywhere rounded and polished . In many places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four blocks have been worn into holes several inches deep by the shoes of countless mules , which during centuries have daily packed their heavy loads over this tedious pass . At San-kia-tien we came upon an arm of the great plain , finishing safely our journey through what Too had cau*ed to be described as the very Valley of the Shadow of Death . The real object of dread on the part of Too was the shortening of the journey , thereby depriving him of the chance to " squeeze " perhaps ten dollars in his accounts . Rounding a mountain spur , we entered the coal field of Mun-ta-kau , which lies in another arm or bay of the great plain . Here we found that a temple had been prepared for our reception , and that many little things had been done to make our stay comfortable . The coal of mis region is altogether anthracite , and many openings have been made upon the several beds . One mine which I visited has been worked to a horizontal distance of 8 , *oo feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few inches to six or seven feet . In this mine one man can bring to the surface only about one hundred and thirty-three pounds daily , owing to the great loss of time experienced in dragging the sledge one mile and a half on hands and knees . The ventilation is assisted in this mine by a very large fanblower . After staying a few days at Mun-ta-kau , I determined to skirt along the edge of the plain to the coal district of Fang-shan ( hien ) . To do this , both mules // 4/3 A JOURNEY IN NORTHERN CHINA . for the transportation of the baggage , and carriers for the chairs of Wang and Too were needed . For these a requisition was sent in to the local magistrate with a request that they might he ready by daylight the next morning . The next day , seeing no signs of the animals , the magistrate was sent for , but we received word that he was so drunk with opium that it would be some time before he could come . After several hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a native of Sz-chuen , with a very effeminate and finely chiselled face . Dressed with the most scrupulous care , he was a type of the Chinese exquisite . He had made arrangements for men and mules the night before , and now sen : off his attendants to find out why they had not appeared . These arms of justice soon returned with the delinquents . The latter pleaded that their animals were employed on permanent contracts from which they could not remove them with out suffering much loss . " But you must fulfil the demands of the Government , " replied the officer . " We can not , " answered the men , sullenly . " Halloa there beat these fellows , " cried the enraged mandarin . Two executioners with peaked hats immediately stepped forward and forced the men to their knees , while others proceeded to apply a few blows with bamboo rods . In the meantime a considerable crowd had gathered in the temple court , and were beginning to force their way into the temporary hall of justice . " How dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive them out ! drive them out ! " But the people , caring as little for the executioners as for their magistrate , and heeding the words of neither , continued to press in . The throng grew larger , and it seemed probable that a long-growing dislike of their mandarin was about to find vent in a riot . Just at this moment the crowd opened in the court , making way for Wang , who approached from our quarters on the other side . Wang had formerly been the magistrate at this very place , and the silence which came over the . crowd , as well as the deference shown him as he passed , proved that the old man had ruled kindly and well , and that his memory was still held in respect . A few words from Wang put an end to our trouble , and men and animals were immediately forthcoming . The small valley of Mun-ta-kau opens into a larger arm of the great plain , and in the middle of this a rugged hill , rising abruptly from the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple of Shi-ching-miau . As in some of the ruined castles of Europe , so here , the broken sides and tops of cliffs are filled out with heavy masonry to make a foundation for the building , upon the most picturesque and commanding point . Passages and rooms are hewn out of the sandstone rock . Ponderous doors of stone guard the entrance to these rooms . The lands belonging to the temple are tilled by people who inhabit less ruined buildings , but probably small part of the proceeds is devoted to repairs . I was told that this was the dwelling and temple of a formerly wealthy family . Proceeding southward , we skirted the foot of the mountains . On our left , the great plain stretched away to the eastward . From slight eminences in the road we could see the gate-towers , and pagodas of Peking , and the triple roof of the Temple of Heaven . On our right were the roun*led spurs and knobs of the sandstone hills of the Mun-ta-kau coal field , while over these towered an immense peak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the summit , almost inaccessible , except for stairways hewn in the rock , and perched , 500 or more feet above the plain , are the cloisters and temples of a Buddhist monastery . The mountain is said to be honeycombed with caves . Our road now crosses a long , low spur which juts out into the plain . On the southern side of this ridge there are immense quarries of limestone . These have been worked // for a great length of time , and over a large area ; and the valley , in the sides of which they occur , is filled to the depth often of forty or fifty feet with layers of half-burnt limestone . chert , fragments of coal and ashes , the remains of former kilns . Through this deposit , which is now cemented to a concrete with the hardness of rock , the mountain brook has cut its channel to the bottom . Passing out of this small valley we came to a town of considerable size , called Ta-hwei-chang , or great lime depot . The walls had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But dilapidated walls in China are not necessarily a sign of decay in l ) OPulation or industry . As we proposed to dine at this l ) lace we rode up to the principal eating house . This was open to the street , and long before our dinner was served up the room was crowded with the curious of all ages , anxious to see for the first time , and not only to see but to feel of the queer barbarians of the western seas . " Go out , boys , " said Ma . Upon this , the largest lad in the crowd turned to one a little smaller and exclaimed , " Go out , boy , go out ; do n't you hear that the lo-yd does not want any boys here ? " But this one passiig the injunction to a still smaller neighbor , it was repeated , in a descending scale , till a little fellow about two feet high picked up the smallest child in the room and thrust him into the street . This turned the joke against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese crowd . A traveller who has command of the language , to ether with l ) patience and sufficient wit to put the more demonstrative members of even a Chinese mob in a ridiculous light , has little to fear , provided the people are swayed by no stronger motives than mere curiosity . If , however , he resents the great personal annoyance by blows , he places himself in a positFon of danger . An instance somewhat illustrative of this occurred to us in leaving Ta-hweichang . The whole population of men and boys followed us through the streets . From laughing at each other 's jokes made at our expense , they proceeded to open ridicule of us , and regardless of our official escort , began to hoot and finally to throw missiles . When they had reached this point Murray stopped his horse , and turning to face the crowd , raised his hand to motion silence . 0 people of Ta-hwei-chang , " exclaimed Murray , in excellent Chinese , " is this your hospitality ? Do ye thus observe the injunctions of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is within your gates have ye forgotten that your great teacher Confucius hath said , What I would not that men should do to me , that would I not also do to men ? " The effect of this exhortation was as remarkable as it was unexpected by me . In an instant the character of the crowd was changed ; the hooting and pelting was stopped to hear the barbarian talking in the familiar words of Confucius the old men bowed approvinely , and a number of boys jumped forward to show us the way . This scene will appear more impressive by contrast , if we suppose a couple of Chinamen followed by a crowd of a few thousand American men and boys , and if we suppose the two strangers to turn and quote , in good English , the similar passage of our Lord 's Sermon on the Mount . The reader may form his own opinion as to the success of such an experiment . Before sunset we reached Fang-shan . Among the principal mines which we visited in the neighborhood , were those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fang-shan . They belonged to the family Chang , one of whose members is decorated with a blue button . We reached this place about noon . As these mines had been worked for a great length of time , I determined to enter them . It was no slight undertaking . After reaching the foot of the indined plane , I found the gallery so low as to be passable only on handls and knees for a great part of the distance . After creeping for more than half a mile , // the proprietor , who I believe had never been so far before in his own mine , gave out completely , and I continued my way to the end , accompanied only by the head miner . After penetrating to a distance of six thousand feet , I had little strength left to use in examining the workings , which are conducted in the same manner as those already described . Much timbering is used , though chiefly the wood of fruit trees , etc. , which costs at the mine twenty-nine cents per hundred pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone from my knees , I learned that the miners protect these joints , as well as the hands , with pads . This was not very consoling information for one who had crept nearly two miles and a half without such protection . It was a source of great wonder to the Chinese , as it was also to the Japanese , that a person holding my rank and acting under an Imperial commission , with authority to demand the presence of all officials on my route , should subject himself to the hardships which attend a personal examination of a mine . The sun was setting behind the mountain cliffs when I reached the open air . The owner had prepared an extensive dinner in honor of the occasion . It would perhaps be uncharitable to say that this hospitality was in any way suggested by a desire to have the coal of this mine recommended for the new fleet . But I always had a suspicion that our friend Too , who was very fond of the good things of the world , had suggested the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I urged the lateness of the hour , and the danger of riding over the mountain road by night . Our host insisted that we should stay , and promised a procession of torch-bearers to light the way on our return . The dinner was good , as was also the rice wine ; and we talked , and laughed , and ate , and drank , until I began to doubt even the ability of torch-bearers to guide our merry party safely over eight miles of dangerous road . It was nine or ten o'clock before we mounted our horses , and I think that with the prospect before us , even Ma envied Wang and Too the chairs , for using which he had despised them . With a large number of torchmen we left the mine and started upon our perilous journey . I have given so many descriptions of bad roads that it is only necessary to say of this that it was nearly equal to the worst . Paved with large and polished blocks , it wound along the side of a rocky ravine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have presented a remarkable sight , as our party wound along this road , with flaming torches , which lighted up at every instant some new feature in the wild scenery ; now a frowning crag towering above our heads , or again , a yawning gorge beneath us , and the rushin* torrent and waterfalls at its bottom . A wild sight it was no doubt ; and so , too , thought the inhabitants of the small hamlets which we passed in the dead of the night , for here we heard the barricading of doors . So thourht also a lone and frightened Chinaman whom we found , shaking with fear and hidden among some boulders , holding fast to a pig which had betrayed him by its grunting . Everywhere we passed for a band of Minghwo , a class of robbers who , in town and country , make rapid raids by torchlight . In the small hours of the morning our remarkable procession reached one of the gates of Fang-shan . The gates of Chinese cities are locked at dark , and the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being opened before daybreak . It required a long parley through the closed portal with the guard on the inside , before the5 could be induced to send word to the ya-mun that we wished to enter . As it was , nothing but the fact that 1 was trivelling under an Imperial commission caused the gates finally to swing open and admit our weary party . The next day we received invitations to dine with the magistrate of the city . // OCTOBER , As we traversed the court of the ya-mun at the appointed time , our ears were greeted with . a sound of suppressed chattering , and we could see that all the chinks of the surrounding windows were occupied by the ladies of the household . Our host led us into a room where the table was spread . In accordance with Chinese etiquette , he spent some time in persuading each of the guests to take the head of the table , a distinction which each one was bound by the laws of politeness to decline . The host then , standing in that place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , which , of course , was persistently declined , as it would have been a breach of politeness for a guest to take his seat first . The dinner began with a cup of hot rice wine . The table was loaded with dishes , which were placed one upon another in tiers , forming a pyramid of Chinese delicacies . There were soups made of birds ' nests , of the haliotis , and of sharks ' fins ; there was beche-de-mer ; there were stews and pAt6s ; there were roots of the water-lily ; but it would take too long to enumerate all the dishes spread before us , of each of which one was expected to taste . Great as is the variety of articles of food in the Chinese cuisine , some things which in other countries are considered most essential are missed by the traveller , and of these none more than butter , bread , and milk . There is a kind of bread which is cooked by steam . and there are flour cakes fried in oil ; they are poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's milk is peddled round the cities for the use of invalids . Foreigners are shy of patronizing the Chinese milkmen . There is an old story on the coast that at a dinner given by a foreigner , the host took a servant to task for serving no milk for the coffee . " Boy , go catchee milk , " said the gentleman . The servant disappearing soon returned with the answer , " No have got . " " What for no have got ? " " That sow have got too muchee piecee chilo ; that woman have die , " replied the boy . By this the servant informed the gentleman and his guests that they had been saved from drinking the milk of either a sow or a woman , only by the death of the latter and the birth of a litter to the former . The only unpleasant feature about our dinner was the custom of every one 's helping everybody else , so that I could eat nothing which had not made acquaintance with my neighbors ' chopsticks . The intervals between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds , which are so much used in China that they form an important item in the trade of certain provinces . In peeling these seeds , if in no other way , the long nails of a Chinese exquisite certainly do good service . The next day we started on our return to Peking . The crops were all harvested , and the tall stalks of the sorghum no longer obstructed the view . Hamlets and farm-houses were scattered far and near ; the plain seemed like one vast field , broken only here and there by rows of willow trees , which are cultivated for the manufacture of charcoal . At every farm-house the hard threshing-floor of pounded earth presented a busy scene . Laughing gro ups of men , women , and children were threshing grain or tossing it in the air to be winnowed , while others , pushing a Ion g lever , worked the mill which ground it to flour . Toward sunset we reached the suburbs of Peking , long rows of shops and caravansaries lining the highways which radiate from the gates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near , and the great archway and its approaches were crowded with pedestrians and horsemen , and with long trains of patient , slow-stepping camels . When I reached the American legation I learned that the Government had determined to send its flotilla back to England . The pressing necessity for steam coal no longer troubled the official mind , and my connection with the Gov ernment came to an end . RAPHAEL PUMPELLY.
