ARTICLE Y.-MOTLEY 'S UNITED NETHERLANDS . History of the United Netherlands : from the Death of William the Silent to the Synod of Dort . With a full view of the English-Dutch struggle against Spain , and of the origin and destruction of the Spanish Armada . By JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY , IL . D. , D. C. L. Two vols . Svo . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . 1861 . HIsToRY should belong to what De Quincey calls the literature of power , and not to that of mere knowledge . It not only should contain a body of facts , but it should have a soul-it should be written by live men , and then it will move men as well as inform them . The historian should have the power of transferring himself to distant places and times , as if an actor himself ; and thus of entering into the spirit of what he records . He should have an ardent love of right and a burning hatred of wrong . In this way he will write with enthusiasm , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , but to the whole man . To this class belongs the work which now claims our attention . The author , in his former work on the " Rise of the Dutch iRepublic , " took the world by surprise . Few were aware that a history of such a character was in preparation , outside the circle of his particular friends . He had published nothing that was . sufficient to indicate what was to come ; in fact , very few knew that there was such a man as John Lothrop Motley , before his , name was annonnced in connection with his history . Then the inquiry was made in all quarters of the literary world , who the author could be ? Many did not know whether he was an Englishman , a Scotchman , or an American . When Bancroft and Macaulay published their histories , the reading world were somewhat prepared by a knowledge of their antecedents . But not so in regard to Mr. Motley , who took his rank among the // first historians of his age , as by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : " Those twelve or fourteen youths have had various destinies , but none of them has made more mark in the world than the handsome , brilliant , free-and-easy fellow who used to declaim Byron with down-turned collar , that showed a throat smooth and full as a girl 's . He spoke and wrote well , but we never expected Motley to read Dutch and write the history of Holland . " Most of the time since he left college , thirty years ago , he has been working quietly , and with unsurpassed industry , on his histories . The work which he has attempted he has done thoroughly . He has not been content to sit down and compile from histories that had already appeared , but he has gone to the fonntainhead for himself . He has spent years in several of the principal places where the chief events recorded took place , and there consulted original authorities in different languages . Within the last twenty-five or thirty years there have been facilities for doing this , which did not previously exist . Libraries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable manuscripts , both official and private , without which such a history could not approach completeness . Mr. Motley has entered so heartily into his undertaking that his arduous labor has been a pleasure , and a striking individuality characterizes his productions . He has not undertaken to write history for the sake of writing it , but in an important sense , because he could not help it . The history of the struggle in the Netherlands took him up , as he has declared , and not he it . The great conflict he describes rouses his whole soul , so that he enters into its history with all the enthusiasm of an actor . He hates despotism , and loves to hate it , and expresses himself accordingly ; he loves freedom most heartily , and utters the strongest words in its defense and praise . He can not help uttering scorching words of condemnation , or glowing words of eulogy in regard to prominent actors , according as he views their characters . He makes all his readers feel that lie is a Protestant and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep impression on their minds in // favor of the cause he so much loves . In this respect we consider him far superior to Prescott . The struggle in the Netherlands , viewed in itself and in its relations , may be regarded as the most important one in the case of civil and religious liberty since the iReformation . According to all human appearance , had despotism been triumphant , Protestantism would have been retarded for centuries , and countries now flourishing would be under the crushing sway of IRomanism . The emperor Charles V , at the age of fifty-five , abdicated his throne , and retired to a convent in Spain to spend the remainder of his life . He left the greatest monarchy ever known in Christendom , whose subjects boasted that the sun never set within its boundaries . The Netherlands formed that part of his dominion where the doctrines of the Reformation had taken a very deep hold , and where the people were far in advance , in most respects , of those in any other country of the empire . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edicts , and had introduced the Inquisition in order that he might enforce them effectually . Multitudes of his most valuable subjects were put to death in various ways . The number of Netherlauders destroyed by him has been estimated , by the best authorities , as not less than fifty thousand . With a constitution mostly broken down by gluttony , and exhausted with his efforts to exterminate heresy , he concluded to leave to his son Philip , his successor , the completion of the work . Charles , after his retirement to private life , did not lose in the least degree his persecuting spirit . He wrote letters to Philip , urging him to burn all heretics that could be found in Spain or elsewhere . He urged Philip in the very last communication he sent to him , to destroy all heretics , and to cherish the Inquisition as the best instrument for effecting such a work , and concluded by saying , " so shall you have my blessing , and the Lord shall prosper you in all your undertakings . " The emperor even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of his promise of protection , when the latter appeared before the IDiet at Worms . The advice of the dying monarch did not fall on the ear of a disobedient son . Phillip II adopted // heartily the principle that the heretics were to be exterminated . Following the advice of his father and that of the Pope , and stimulated by his own fiendish ambition , his whole reign was stained with deeds of the blackest dye . Philip soon succeeded in crushing the IReformation in Spain , but he did not find the undertaking so easy in the Netherlands . He appointed as regent , Margaret of Parma , the natural daughter of Charles Y , and the eldest of his children . She had been under the training of Ignatius Loyola , and , as might be expected , was a bigoted Catholic . The king revived the edicts of his father against heretics , and gave new instructions in regard to their execution . He resolved to make the Inquisition as potent an instrument in the Netherlands as it had been in the Peninsula . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by Protestants , but by Catholics . The regent endeavored to carry out the will of the king , but the opposition became so great that her life was a burden . More and more determined measures were resorted to , but greater and greater resistance was manifested by the Netherlanders . The most prominent in resistance was William of Nassau , Prince of Orange . He belonged to an ancient and honorable family . His early education prepared him , in a great degree , for the noble part he acted in planting the Dutch Republic . At an early age he became a page in the family of the emperor , and was admitted as an observer of the most important transactions . Charles evidently entertained a more exalted opinion of his ability and promise , than of those of any other youth conmiected with his court . It was on his shoulder that the emperor leaned at his abdication . William , though a Catholic at first , seemed to have the principle of toleration firmly rooted in him , which principle became more and more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestantism . He was the Washington of his age , and was as tolerant and noble , as Philip was despotic and mean . It was after a long series of defeats and victories experienced by the patriots , headed by William of Orange , before the tide essentially turned on the side of freedom , and the Dutch Republic was founded . Our historian , in his first great work , // gives a most graphic and thrilling account of these down to the death of William in 1584 , who fell by the pistol of an assassin , to whom Philip promised a large reward . There were two previous attempts made on the life of the Prince , but the third and last was successful . Philip , when he received the intelligence of this event , exclaimed , " Had that blow been struck two years ago , the Catholic church and I would have gained by it . " But though the hero was dead , the victory was gained  --  the foundation of the Dutch Republic was laid . At this point commences the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into detail than he at first intended . It covers a period of only six years , but one full of events of vast magnitude in themselves and in their results ,  --  events essentially identified with the history of several of the principal nations of the world . None , we think , will complain that the author is too minute ; but all , after they peruse these volumes , can not but look forward with intense interest for the promised appearance of those which are to give us time sequel of this fascinating story . Mr. Motley here gives conclusive evidence of having availed himself of rich materials that have never before been given to the world . He tells us that the most valuable materials he has found are those " entirely unpublished . " He has found the archives of England to be mines of rich historical wealth adapted to his purpose , of which the State Paper Office and the MSS . Department of the British Museum are specially referred to by him . He purposes , in two subsequent volumes , to complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dort . The murder of the Prince of Orange was a most important event , and caused the deepest mourning . That disaster seemed to many to be fatal to the cause at ? the head of which he had been for years . The thinker , the actor , and the soul of the movement , So far as one man could be , was gone , when his help was deeply needed . The prospect seenmed truly dark . A medal , struck off in Holland at the time , represented her as a dismasted hulk , reeling through the tempest , with the motto , " incertarn quo fata ferent . " But true patriotism was not extinct in the Netherlands ; there were still brave minds and // 1861 . Miotley 's United Net , 4erla'nd8. stout hearts . The English agent wrote to Queen Elizabeth that there existed among the people " a resolution to revenge the foulness of the fact committed on the person of the Prince by the tyrant of Spain , and to defend their liberties advisedly against him and his adherents by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of their substance , and the last drop of their blood . " A Provisional Council was established by the States General , to preside at the head of which Maurice , the second son of William , was called from the University of Leyden , where he was pursuing his studies . Alexander of Parma was prompt to take advantage of the sad disaster that had occurred to the rebellious Provinces , He evidently regarded the death of Orange as a death-blow to their cause , and offered them reconciliation with Philip on easy terms , except those pertaining to religion , for there was no hope of his making the least concession on that subject . But in Holland and Zeeland , all his proposals were in vain . The friends of freedom were determined not to yield their rights , and to fight and die , if necessary , in their defense . Stringent decrees were passed , forbidding any countenance or aid to the enemy . The city of Dort passed an act and proclaimed it by sound of trumpet , " to live and die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be reconciled to the Spanish crown knew that they had a most formidable enemy to contend with , and that without help from abroad ultimate success was almost hopeless . They were ready to offer their allegiance to any power that would pledge them essential aid . It was concluded to look to France . The Prince of Orange , whose associations had been in a great degree French , had relied much on the support of that government . The influence of William , and the sympathy existing between the Dutch Calvinists and French Huguenots , were such , that the first prompting was naturally in favor of applying to Henry III . A doubtful character certainly , for the rugged Protestant champions of freedom to expect aid from , under their trying circumstances ! Our author thus describes him : // " With silken flounces , jeweled stomachers , and painted face , with pearls of great price adorning his bared neck and breast , and satin slippered feet , of whose delicate shape and size he was justly vain , it was his delight to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivals , tourneys , processions , masquerades , banquets , and balls , the cost of which glittering frivolities caused the popular burden and the popular execration to grow , from day to day , more intolerable and more audible . Surrounded by a gang of minions , the most debauched and the most desperate of France , whose bedizened dresses exhaled perfumes throughout Paris , whose sanguinary encounters dyed every street in blood , Henry lived a life of what he called pleasure , careless of what might come after , for he was the last of his race . The fortunes of his minions rose higher and higher , as their crimes rendered them more and more estimable in the eyes of a King , who took a woman 's pride in the valor of such champions to his weakness , and more odious to a people whose miserable homes were made even more miserable , that the coffers of a few court-favorites might be filled . Now sauntering , full-dressed , in the public promenades , with ghastly little death 's heads strung upon his sumptuous garments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders of knighthood-playing at cup and ball as he walked , and followed by a few select courtiers who gravely pursued the same exciting occupation-now presiding like a queen of beauty at a tournament to assign the prize of valor , and now , by the advice of his mother , going about the streets in robes of penitence , telling his beads as he went , that the populace might be edified by his piety , and solemnly offering up prayers in the churches that the blessing of an heir might be vouchsafed to him ,  --  Henry of Yalois seemed straining every nerve in order to bring himself and his great office into contempt . " The offer of the sovereignty of the Netherlands made to Henry was not accepted , after two embassies had been sent , who had been shamefully trifled with . Neither IJenry , nor his Queen Mother Catherine , had any real intention of rendering aid to the Netherlands , though they had given them encouragement . After eight mouths had been spent in fruitless negotiations , it was felt to be full time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going on , the siege of Antwerp was in progress . Antwerp , at that time , was the leading commercial city of the Netherlands , if not of all Europe . The Prince of Parma had had the taking of that city in view , for some time , for its subjugation he regarded as equivalent to the fall of the infant Dutch Republic . William , before his death , was aware of the plan of Farina , and was careful to call attention to the importance of specially preparing for defense , and had signified certain plans which if carried out // would save it from Spanish tyranny . He had indicated his plans to Sainte Aldegonde , of whom he entertained a very high opinion . Before his death he had expressed his wish that Aldegonde should accept the office of burgomaster of the city , which was by no means a desirable one , as anarchy and disunion had gained the ascendency over good order in its government . He was , therefore , at the head of the defense against Parnia . He seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities . A short extract from Mr. Motley 's lengthy description of his character , will be sufficient to show that he was no ordinary man : " There were few more brilliant characters than he in all Christendom . He was a man of a most rare and versatile genius . Educated in Geneva , at the very feet of Calvin , he had drunk , like mother 's milk , the strong and bitter waters of the stern reformer 's creed ; but he had , in after life , attempted , although hardly with success , to lift himself to the bight of a general religious toleration . He had also been trained in the severe and thorough literary culture which characterized that rigid school . He was a scholar , ripe and rare ; no holiday trifler in the gardens of learning . He spoke and wrote Latin like his native tongue . He could compose poignant Greek epi*rams . Lie was so familiar with Hebrew that he had rendered the Psalms of David out of the original into flowing Flemish verse , for the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilized Europe-Spanish , Italian , French , and German-was a matter of course . He was a profound jurisconsult , capable of holding debate against all competitors upon any point of theory or practice of law , civil , municipal , international . He was a learned theologian , and had often proved himself a match for the doctors , bishops , or rabbin of Europe , in highest argument of do*ma , creed , or tradition . lie was a practised diplomatist , constantly employed in delicate and difficult negotiations by William the Silent , who ever admired his genius , cherished his friendship , and relied upon his character . " The preparations of Parma for the siege were on a magnificent scale , which showed him to be a man eminently adapted to such an undertaking . Aldegonde was embarrassed in conducting the defense by dissension and insubordination . There was reason to believe that an effort would be made to close the Scheldt , so as to cut off the city from necessary supplies . When orders were given to carry corn , Admiral Treslong refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dikes of the sea and river , which mode of defense experience had shown to be very efficient in several previous instances . But the butchers opposed that plan , through fear of having their pasture grounds submerged . Some thought it impossible for the enemy to close the river . But the undertaking , though so difficult , was accomplished . A fortified bridge of boats was constructed , which was about half a mile in length . The Autwerpers hit upon an ingenious plan of demolishing the bridge . Fire ships , or explosive vessels , were sent in the direction of the bridge . One huge vessel of this description did great execution . She had seven thousand pounds of powder on board , and was charged with ponderous projectiles . A terrible explosion took place , in which all that boarded her , the block-house against which she struck , with its garrison , and a large portion of the bridge with the troops stationed upon it , were blown to atoms , and demolished . One thousand Spanish soldiers were destroyed in an instant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge . But through mnisman agement , the advantage gained by that explosion was not turned to its proper account , and Antwerp soon fell into the power of the enemy . A strong peace party within its walls , and starvation , had a powerful influence in leading to a capitulation , by which it fell into the power of the enemy . Had the plans of Orange been carried out , which might have been done , essentially , that disastrous event would never have taken place . Aldegonde has been till now resting under severe censure for the course he took in connection with this siege ; but Mr. Motley , by a presentation of ' facts which have never before come to the light , removes , in a great degree , the cloud that has been resting over him . The Dutch IRepublic , having failed to receive assistance from France , began to look to another quarter . There was a hope that England might be secured as an ally . Queen Elizabeth had not been an indifferent spectator of the conflict going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had not manifested the interest in favor of the Netherlands , that she probably felt . England , at that time , was not a strong power , and Elizabeth wished // to act cautiously in regard to giving offense to her powerful Spanish neighbor . But she soon saw clearly that the Netherlands must either fall into the power of Spain , or receive aid ; that if the former took place , her own throne would be far less secure than before . She was evidently not displeased at the result of the application to France . Steps were immediately taken to intimate the willingness of the English government to b*come an ally . Elizabeth did not wish to accept the sovereignty of the Netherlands , though she had no objection to having the offer made to her , but she was disposed to render aid . Secretary Walsiugham , too , felt a very deep interest , and brought his influence to bear in that direction . At an interview of the Dutch envoys with him at Greenwich , he expressed the strongest affection for the Provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly for home , to declare the Queen 's inclination to afford aid for the protection of the civil and religious privileges of the people . The envoys likewise found the Earl of Leicester favorably disposed towards their cause . After protracted negotiations , which , according to the account given by Mr. Motley , were far from being adapted to reflect honor on Elizabeth , a definite arrangement was agreed upon for the assistance of the Netherlands . She drove a hard bargain , and was determined not to lose money by the operation . She was to hold Flushing and Brill as securities until the money was repaid by the States . It was agreed to supply the provinces with a permanent force of five thousand foot and one thousand horse , at the Queen 's expense . This seems quite small to us , but at that time , in view of the nation 's strength , it was by no means an inconsiderable force . The Earl of Leicester was appointed Commander-in-Chief . He embarked with a fleet of fifty ships , and was attended by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Philip Sydney and Sir Thomas Cecil . He was received with very high demonstrations of honor . His progress through the land was accompanied with banquets and festivities , in which no one could participate with greater pleasure and better grace than he . His procession , it was said , was attended // with even greater demonstrations than those of Charles V had ever been . Soon after the Earl arrived in the Provinces he was offered the sole command of the army , which he accepted . That offer was evidently prompted by a conviction of the need of a central and controlling authority , and through a feeling of gratitude for the aid afl*rded them in their need . The Queen , however , was displeased at Leicester 's accepting the command , though , at first , she had in a measure encouraged the offer and its acceptance ; but when an effort was made to curtail his power on the part of those who conferred it , she wa* offended . She wrote letters to the Earl and to the States , in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of Leicester , and to produce an unfavorable impression respecting the English . This effect was the more readily produced , as the Earl did not hear officially from home for several months after his arrival , and his soldiers suffered for food and clothing , as the necessary supply of money did not come from Elizabeth . Though his qualifications for the post to which the Queen appointed him were not of a very high order , yet , according to the facts stated by Mr. Motley , he did not deserve the censure which was cast upon him at the tiiue . The ablest commander , if treated as he was after he left home , could not have done much better . He was recalled in the latter part of 1687 , and Lord Willoughby took his place as commander of the Queen 's forces . Little had been done thus far for the Netherlands by England , and Alexander of Parma was still active in prosecuting his plans for their subjugation . IDuriug all this time preparations were in progress for the invasion of England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They felt that while the English government remained Protestant , a formidable obstruction stood in the way of prosecuting their plans . They concluded , therefore , that if England could be brought into subjection , the way was open for the complete extinction of heresy in Europe . The plan of the enterprise had been fully sketched for Philip at his request in 1586 . Preparations were commenced on a grand scale . The dock-yards of INaples , Portugal , Spain , and of // other countries , displayed such a scene of activity as had never been witnessed in them before . The great objects of the military and naval preparations were kept secret . The preparations in Spain were ostensibly for an expedition to the Indies . The continuance of the civil war in France , and of the disturbed state of things in the Provinces , were regarded as essential conditions of success . Secretary Walsiugham , who took such deep interest in rendering English aid to the Netherlands , had minute information in regard to the stupendous preparations that were going forward for the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advised steps to be taken for defense . But Burleigh , the Lord Treasurer , who had great influence over the Queen , endeavored to lull her fears , which was the more easily done on account of her parsimony . He seems to have belonged to that class of prudent and respectable gentlemen , who think the world is very much indebted to them , when it really owes them little or nothing , and does not seriously feel their loss when they are out of office or when they die-who seem very wise and brave in time of peace , but in an *mergency are good for nothing . England was , therefore , poorly prepared for such an invasion . The naval force of England at that time was the most reliable means of defense , at the head of which were some of the ablest commanders of the time , such as IDrake and Howard . In the month of May , L588 , the Armada sailed from Lisbon , after being blessed by Cardinal Archduke Albert , viceroy of Portugal . It consisted of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of Spanish troops , sailors , and galley slaves , not more than half of which number ever returned to Spain . The description given by Mr. Motley of the Invincible Armada , of short but eventful history , is most glowing and thrilling . It far surpasses all the numerous accounts that have ever been given . He has brought to light many new facts , and so full and vivid is the narrative , that it strikes the mii.id with the force of a present reality . We give one extract von . XIX. 26 // from the description of a scene that took place while the two fleets were lying in Calais Roads : " At an hour past midnight , it was so dark that it was difficult for the most practiced eye to pierce far into the gloom . But a faint drip of the oars now struck the ears of the Spaniards as they watched from the decks . A few moments afterwards the sea became suddenly luminous , and six flaming vessels appeared at a slight distance , bearing steadily down upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Armada , who had been at the siege of Antwerp , only three years before . They remembered , with horror , the devil-ships of Gianibelli , those floating volcanoes , which had seemed to rend earth and ocean ; whose explosion had laid so many thousands of soldiers dead at a blow , and which had shattered the bridge and floating forts of Farnese , as though they had been toys of glass . They knew , too , that the famous engineer was at that moment in England . " In a moment , one of those horrible panics , which spread with such contagious rapidity among large bodies of men , seized upon the Spaniards . There was a yell throughout the fleet , the fire-ships of Antwerp ! the fire-ships of Antwerp ! ' and in an instant every cable was cut , and frantic attempts were made by each galleon and galeasse , to escape what seemed imminent destruction . The confuBion was beyond description . Four or five of the largest ships became entangled with each other . Two others were set on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medina Sidonia , who had been warned , even before his departure from Spain , that some such artifice would probably be attempted , and who had even , early that morning , sent out a party of sailors in a pinnace , to search for indications of the scheme , was not surprised or dismayed . He gave ordersas well as might be-that every ship , after the danger should be passed , was to return to its post , and await his further orders . But it was useless , in that moment of unreasonable panic , to issue commands . " The final defeat and dispersion of ' the Spanish Armada , one in such great measure to the winds and waves raised by Providence , was a blow struck at Papal and Spanish tyranny , from which it has never recovered . We shall conclude this Article by glancing at the influence and relations of the struggle in the Netherlands , so vividly described by Mr. Motley . The cause of civil and religious freedom in other countries is greatly indebted to the men who then labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great influence on the English revolution , of which Oliver Cromwell was the hero . " There is no doubt , " as a living writer has remarked , " that the patriots of England were stimulated to increased exertions , by their acquaintance with what had been and still was going on in the Low Countries . The echoes that the east wind wafted to their shores , // went to swell what Carlyle calls the vast inarticulate , widespread , slumberous mumblement , ' that grew and deepened day by day , till it burst forth in majestic tones of a nation 's voice , as Charles Stuart kneeled upon a scaffold , and Oliver Cromwell mounted to a throne . ' " The establishment of the Dutch Republic had an important bearing , too , on the English revolution of 1688 . That was a critical period in British history , when the king was a Roman Catholic , and manifested a determination to eradicate Protestantism , and to re*3stablish IRomanism ; when he went so far as to receive the Pope 's nuncio , to appoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposite views ; when the king was not only counseled and urged on by Louis XIY of France , but could have men and money from that monarch , to carry out his purpose . The friends of Protestant freedom , in England , in the midst of those dark and trying times , looked to Holland for help , and did not look in vain . It was the direct descendant of William of Orange , who then came to the rescue , with troops from his native land . He ascended the throne of England , as William III , and under his administration , British liberty was established on a firmer basis than ever before . To the same struggle , recorded by our historian , the cause of freedom in this country is very much indebted . Says Mr. Brodhead , in his history of New York , " without undervaluing others , it may confidently be claimed that to no other nation in the world is the republic of the West more indebted , than to the United Provinces , for the idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom ; for magnanimous sentiments of religious toleration ; for characteristic sympathy with the subjects of oppression ; for liberal doctrines in trade and commerce ; for illustrious patterns of private integrity , and public virtue ; and for generous and timely aid in the establishment of independence . Nowhere , among the people of the United States , can any be found who excel in honesty , industry , courtesy , or accomplishments , the posterity of the early Dutch settlers in New Netherlands . And when the providence of God decreed that // the rights of humanity were again to be maintained , through long years of human endurance and of war , the descendants of Hollanders nobly emulated the example of their forefathers ; nor was their steadfast patriotism outdone by that of any of the heroes in the strife , which made the blood-stained soil of New York and New Jersey the INETHERLAND5 OF AMERIcA . " That such a history as this has appeared , should be a matter of joy and gratitude on the part of all true lovers of their country . The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefactor . Such a work is calculated to quicken the conscience ; it is adapted to kindle into a ilame our love of liberty and hatred of despotism ; to increase ou*r appreciation of the worth of freedom , by showing its cost ; and to teach us to guard it with constant vigilance . We heartily rejoice that Mr. Motley 's volmues are now given to the world at a time when the conflict in the old world and the new , between freedom and despotism , is assuming such important aspects .
