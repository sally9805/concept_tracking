Oxford : Wheeler and Day . 1864 . Post 8vo . OUR existing civil war is separating us as a nation , , not only from our own past , but also from the Old World . The IRevolution , the war of 1812 , though dividing us politically from England , left us still provincials . And this was natural , for nationality is not the growth of a night ; it is not to be created by a declaration of independence ; it is not of regular procedure , or the product of calculable forces . Even to define it precisely is difficult . It may be said , in general , to be the sum of the differences , geographical , historical , political , and moral , which separate a people as a community from every other , - of those differences which modify the character of each individual , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . The consciousness of its existence is developed // slowly , and it is long before the sentiment of nationality - the true foundation of patriotism-gains force over the hearts and convictions of a people . But this sentiment , when it has once taken root , is one of the most powerful of those by which human conduct is affected . It is a sentiment of the highest order , lifting men out of narrow and selfish individualism into a region where they behold their duties as members one of another , and as partakers of the general life of humanity , - the inheritors of the past , the trustees of the future . It is capable , indeed , of being perverted to low ends ; its force may be reduced to the mean uses of mere vulgar politics ; it may be narrowed into a bigoted and insolent pride , or degraded to the level of partisanship ; but in its noblest exercise it is brought into close connection with religion , inspiring men to behold in the nation , not a mere conglomeration of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intricate organization , testifying to the wisdom and providence of Him who maketh and who ruleth the people . Nothing shows more clearly how favorable were the elements of our social and political condition , how fortunate have been our circumstances , and how vigorous has been our growth , than that in less than a century we have become from colonies a nation , and have changed from Englishmen to Americans . And though the rebellion of the slaveholders might at first sight seem an indication to the contrary , it has really furnished the most substantial proof , not only of the existence of a true nationality in the people of the United States , but - and this has been one of the most important results of the war - of the existence among them of a sentiment of nationality capable of supplying a permanent motive for the performance of the most wearisome and difficult patriotIc duties . The attack upon the life of the nation has been the means of exhibiting its indestructible vitality and astonishing vigor . The chief external form in which nationality embodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be denied , that our political and social institutions proving themselves capable of bearing this enormous strain of rebellion , will have proved themselves the strongest the world has known , as they long since proved themselves the best fitted to secure and to promote independence , justice , prosperity , and happiness . // Founded as they are on the principle of respect for the rights of man , however much that principle may have been violated in practice , they are the only institutions of government under which , theoretically at least , every individual in the community is assured of the possession and enjoyment of all natural rights , of all the dignities and privileges of manhood ; while , as a consequence of this , the community and the government are assured of the support and respect of every individual . There is under them no division of interest between classes , between those that make and administer and those that obey the laws . There are , it is true , difficulties and dangers inherent to our system as to every other . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its success depends on continually new conditions . Were our system to fail to-morrow , it would be from no inherent fault , but from some external and remediable cause . The final problem of popular government , in other words , of popular sovereignty , is constantly presenting itself under new forms for solution . It is a double problem , - to make law stronger than the passionate will of the multitude , and to secure to the permanent and intelligent will of the people its due expression in law , - to guard against the despotism of the many , of the few , or of one , - and it is this double problem which we are continually working out , and which generations to come will not cease to be required to work out for themselves . But we have already proved that the problem is capable of satisfactory solution by each generation , and that our system is essentially one of stability and regularity . The contrast between such a system of politics and government as this , and those which exist as inheritances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The political institutions of Europe are founded not on the broad , general principles of right , rest finally on no moral basis , but are established on the notion of privilege ; in other words , on the fallacy that a man or a class may justly , whether by right of birth or of force , possess political rights in which other men have no share . These institutions consequently do not protect and promote the interests of all alike , but only of a comparatively few individuals at the expense of the great multitude of the people . // No nation in Europe presents the aspect of a true community . One form or another of government and of institutions may be fitted for one or another nation , but no form of government and no institutions can be regarded as good or as permanent which establish unjust distinctions among men in those matters in which by nature they have equal rights . There is then an irrepressible conflict between the Old World and the New . Europe is still feudal . America is democratic . The war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , in other words , in contending for the integrity of the institutions in which the distinctive principles of our nationality have taken form , we are destroying slavery , an institution contradictory to them in its nature , which , having been engrafted on our political system , was becoming irreconcilable with its permanence and was threatening its ruin . And in destroying slavery we are destroying the worst form of classprivilege , and a base and spurious counterfeit of aristocracy . In this contest we can not fail to have our principles confirmed , and our confidence in our free democratic system quickened and made stronger . A man feels the worth of that for which he voluntarily suffers , and learns the real meaning of that to protect or maintain which he is forced to expose himself to death . We shall come out of this war with faith justly deepened in the principles of justice and liberty on which our institutions rest . We shall have new reason for trust in the political instincts and intentions of an instructed and intelligent people . We shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those very qualities which it has been commonly though erroneously supposed such a government was incapable of exhibiting . Ours is indeed no ideally perfect frame of government or of society . But it is founded on ideal principles , capable of practical application , and thus it affords opportunities of improvement according to the progress and elevation of the thoughts and desires of men . The moral nature of its fundamental ideas justifies us in believing it capable of indefinite development . Not yet are our people educated up to the great argument of their own principles ; never will humanity , however educated , reach the fulness of justice , of liberty , of love . But as our people become // more enlightened and more virtuous , they will find their institutions capable of adaptation to the new demands of their improved moral sense . Politics will be brought naturally into closer dependence upon morals , and the identity of the principles of American democracy with the abstract , eternal principles of right will be more clearly recognized and completely established . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abstract justice , the arrangements of society resulting from the practical application of these principles are not just . In striking opposition to our American theory , and to the tendency of our political action , the result of the unequal distribution of political power in England is to promote social justice and to increase popular liberty only so far as is consistent with the preservation of the privileges of the governing classes . Such a difference necessarily separates the two countries widely ; but it is obvious that the separation is increasing , not only by the widening divergence of political and social theory and practice , but also by a growing difference in the modes of thought and forms of opinion . The mental temper , the spiritual condition , of the two peoples are becoming more and more distiiict . This difference is radical . It is evident in the insatiable curiosity with which the two nations regard each other , and in the increasing difficulty which each finds in comprehending the other . We seem no longer to be brothers , - hardly of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . This separation , so far as it is the result of absolute differonce of national character and of institutions resulting from it , is not matter of regret . Nations are the complements of each other . Their diversities secure the full development of humanity . Civilization , in its present stage at least , depends greatly for its progress on the combined results of these differences . " Nations redeem each other . They do for each other nationally very much what men of different characters do for each other morally in the intercourse of life . " But if the separation be produced or aggravated by other circumstances than the real differences of national character , - if it be // widened by unfair dealing , by jealousy , by selfish diplomacy , by force , - then indeed it becomes lamentable , for then the sympathy which should bind the nations together , in spite of differences , is weakened , and it may be destroyed . Underneath national diversity lies human similarity , - and it is the human element in life that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no reason for regret that our present war , by developing our national character , has widened the separation between us and England , there is reason for the deepest regret that circumstances arising out of the war have greatly diminished the sympathy between the two countries , have put them in almost a hostile attitude to each other , and have rendered doubtful what ought never to be called in doubt , - the continuance of peace between them . This condition of feeling is a misfortune not alone to England and America , but to the world . It has sprung mainly from the inevitable jealousy with which a declining aristocracy must regard a democratic community like ours , exhibiting for the first time its tremendous strength . This jealousy of the governing class has been heightened by the misconceptions of an astonishing ignorance , by the perversions of malice , and by the fact that the only class in England which has felt and exhibited sympathy with us in our present trials is that of the intelligent workingmen , upon whose democratic sentiments the oligarchy looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unenfranchised masses in England regard the constitution of their country with apathy , and the more activeminded of them with sullen disaffection . Our failure would be cited as the failure of the democratic system . Our success will be shared by the people all the world over . And thus the great body of the aristocracy , the wealthy , and those who live on the established order of things , true to the instinct of selfinterest , have proved untrue to the cause of liberty to which England in better days was pledged , and have given the benefit of subterfuge , evasion , and sympathy to those rebels who would destroy , not only our nationality and freedom , but the best hopes of the oppressed and the poor in the Old World . It is the course of England as directed , not by her people , but by // her oligarchy , that has parted us from her , that has widened the ocean between us , that has cut away one after another of those tenderest ties which no force and no conscious effort can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England have done greater harm to themselves than to us . For , so far as their interests are those of the whole people of England , we are the only nation on the face of the globe which can be their real support and hearty ally . So far as the English rulers mean liberty , justice , law , and equal rights , so far they are our friends and we theirs by nature . But though the aristocracy in England , the clergy of the Established Church , the men of letters , and the wealthy middle class generally , have been against us during this war , yet a few men have been found in each class to recognize that we are fighting the battles of the English people , and that patriotism , no less than reverence for liberty and for law , respect for the right , and faith in progress , called upon them to take part with us , and to give us not merely their sympathy , but their most strenuous efforts and most faithful service . They have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of selfish and cynical reaction , that the qualities which have made England great are not wholly extinct , and , however large may be the debt of gratitude which America owes to them , England owes to them still more , for striving , and not unsuccessfully , to save her from the degradation and the danger to which her evil counsellors and our ill-wishers would have brought her . Among the supporters of the cause of the Free States in England , those who understand the historical and moral elements of the rebellion and the true nature of our government are very few . The most ardent sympathy is frequently united with great misconceptions of facts , or with great ignorance of them . Lord Russell 's epigram about " independence " and " empire " was the clever false statement of ignorance , far more than the invention of wilful malice . How , indeed , should truth be reached concerning matters so intricate , especially when it is the object of many individuals both at the North and in England to obscure the truth both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wrong cause must be supported by false arguments , and the false argument may persuade even good men that the wrong cause is right . Old lies have helped the new . It has been said in England , and the saying has been believed , that the newspaper press was independent . But the truth is , that the Times , the influence of which upon public impressions is hardly to be exaggerated , is as devoid of real independence as the Paris Moniteur or the New York Herald . It is not dependent in the same way , but it is not the less the organ of prepossession and of prejudice . At the very head-quarters of intelligence facts have been perverted , news has been garbled , fables have been invented , true statements have been denied and false ones affirmed , till it is more strange that there should be any among the English who take part with us than that there should be so few . If the estrangement between the two nations should widen until war shall ensue , the historian will trace one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily repeated malignant falsehoods of that great newspaper which had established a firm despotism over the minds of the vast unthinking mass of the upper classes of English society . Among the men in England who have most thoroughly studied and most clearly understand the real nature of the rebellion is Mr. Goidwin Smith , Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford . And no man has shown a keener appreciation of the distinctive characteristics of our institutions , or a more genuine and hearty sympathy in our endeavors to protect and maintain those institutions , as the means and instrument by which freedom and justice may be secured , perpetuated , and extended . Writing with great vigor of style , which corresponds well to the vigor of his thought , and sure to be listened to not merely oii account of the authority of his position , but also on account of the pith and force of his arguments , he has been one of the most constant and effective defenders of the Northern cause and of the course of the administration . In frequent letters to the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blunders or the falsehoods of the Times , and enlightened the public as to the causes and conditions of the war . With a talent for controversy perhaps // unrivalled by any living writer in England , lie has with sharp irony , or with still sharper moral indignation , cut through the masks of the Confederate slave-dealers and their friends , and torn off the infamous disguises with which they endeavored to make the worse appear the better cause . He has made clear the fact that the rebellion is one , not against the American government alone , and against the unity and life of one nation , but that it is an attack upon the very foundations of all government , a rebellion against law itself , and that its success would be the success of false opinions , subversive of the principles mainly characteristiG of modern civilization . He has never ceased to urge upon England the adoption of a policy not only worthy of her honor and dignity , but also in accordance with her most inspiring traditions and her hereditary claims as the guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fearless defender of the right . Watching with the deep interest of a liberal political student the course of affairs and the current of public opinion in both countries , Mr. Smith has brought all the resources of his learning , as well as all the powers of his mind , to his great task . If the highest duty of a Professor of History be to apply the lessons of the past to the understaiiding of the present time , and in the conflict and confusion of contending forces and opinions to discover and set forth the truth , lie has well performed it . His well-known essay on the relation of the Bible to Slavery affords an excellent instance of the wise use of historical studies . But the very question of the title , " Does the Bible sanction American Slavery ? " is in itself a curious evidence of the extraordinary corruption of opinion wrought by slavery during the last few years . That an eminent Professor of History at Oxford should find it needful , for the sake of enlightening public opinion , to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery among the Jews in the time of Moses affords no ground of defence for slavery in the nineteenth century , and that the Christian religion is the natural enemy of slavery , - that such a man should publish such a treatise affords striking evidence of the low condition of moral feeling and of intelligence among the most enlightened and civilized people of the present time . // In this excellent essay , Mr. Smith has vindicated Christianity against that misinterpretation of its teachings , and that perversion of its spirit , by which the apologists of slavery have obscured the truth and corrupted religion . He has also found occasion to present a strong argument in favor of that community which , founded upon free labor , is inspired with the Christian idea that " the state is a brotherhood , of which all are equally recognized as members . " Mr. Smith 's more recent " Letter to a Whig Member of the Southern Association** is a more popular , and , as covering the whole ground of the war , a more important production . No abler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic . It is written with such strength of feeling , with such sympathetic intelligence , with such accuracy and abundance of knowledge , and with such clear historic insight , as to excite just surprise as the production of a foreigner , viewing our institutions and conditions from across the ocean . Such a judgment upon our affairs is an indication of what the judgment of posterity upon this great epoch in our history is likely to be . Had Mr. Goldwin Smith , however , never engaged in the discussion of American questions , his works in other fields of inquiry have given him so high a place among the younger generation of English men of letters , and he has displayed in them abilities of so rare and high an order , that American readers and thinkers could not long have remained ignorant of his reputation or indifferent to his writings . It is now about four years since he published , one after another separately , and then collected in a small volume , a brief series of Lectures on Modern History , which established his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in England . Perhaps no more valuable contribution to thought in this department of knowledge , and no more important discussion of the theory and philosophy of history , have appeared in England during the present period of renewed interest in the topic and controversy concerning it . The two Lectures " On the Study of History , " and the one " On some Supposed Consequences of the Doctrine of instorical Progress , " exhibit the leading historical views of Professor // Smith , and display the most marked qualities of his intellect and character . It is one of the peculiarities of Mr. Goldwin Smith 's writing , that it shows the qualities of his moral character with no less distinctness than those of his intellect , and while it excites the respect of the reader , it at the same time wins his sympathy and regard . The first of the Lectures on the Study of History is , in the main , an examination of the claims of history to be regarded as an exact science , and a refutation of the hypothesis of the positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who assert that history is governed by necessary laws . The course of history , according to Professor Smith , does not allow us to infer from it a law of development , by which it may be ranked and studied among the inductive sciences , but , on the contrary , the true induction from the phenomena of history is the doctrine of the progress of mankind through the efforts of individuals . History is made up of the actions of men , and , as every man knows from his own consciousness , the actions of men are free . " Human actions , in history as in individual life and society , may and do present moral connections of the most intimate and momentous kind , but not that necessary sequence of causation on which alone science can be based . " " Humanity advances by free effort , but is not developed by invariable laws , such as , when discovered , give birth to a new science . " This view of history , confirmed as it is not only by what we know of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , of man , not only as a physical , , but as a spiritual being , and its harmony with our highest conceptions of the Divine nature and the purposes of God in the creation of the world , commends itself alike to common sense and to religious sentiment . It gives us a philosophy of history , though it deprives us of a science . It accounts for and leaves room for the influence of the moral nature , and it gives meaning to the two grand facts in the life of the world , - the division of nations and the succession of ages . This religious theory of history covers all the facts , the physical view of the world covers the physical facts alone . In the second Lecture Mr. Goldwin Smith devolops this philosophy of history with great breadth of view , fertility of // illustration , clearness of statement , and moral earnestness . The conclusion of this Lecture is in a noble strain of eloquence ; we can quote but the last admirable words . " That the human race is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tend in some measure to a joint result ; that its several members may stand in the eye of their Maker , not only as individual agents , but as contributors to this joint result , - is a doctrine which our reason , perhaps , finds something to support , and which our hearts readily accept . It unites us not only in sympathy , but in real interest , with the generations that are to come after us , as well as with those that have gone before us ; it makes each generation , each man , a partaker in the wealth of all ; it encourages us to sow a harvest which we shall reap , not with our own hands , indeed , but by the hands of those that come after us ; it at once represses selfish ambition and stimulates the desire of earning the gratitude of our kind ; it strengthens all social and regulates all personal desires ; it limits , and by limiting sustains effort , and calms the passionate craving to grnsp political perfection or final truth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently wasted , and covers present failure with ultimate success ; it turns the deaths of states , as of men , into incidents in one vast life ; and quenches the melancholy which flows from the ruins of the past , - that past into which we too are sinking , just when great things seem about to come . ' * The solidity of the foundation upon which the philosophy of history maintained by Mr. Goldwin Smith is constructed , and the truth of its main elements , are confirmed by the fact that it rests in great part upon " the doctrine that the Human Morality is identical with the Divine , and that the moral nature of man points truly , though remotely , to that of God , " - a doctrine which forms the basis not only of the philosophy of history , but also of rational religion itself . Mr. Smith was led to emphasize and insist the more strongly upon this doctrine , because it had recently been ably though indirectly controverted by Mr. Mansel , in his Bampton Lectures for 1858 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Leetures on the Study of History , Mr. Smith appended a postscript defending the doctrine of the identity of the Divine and Human Morality against the arguments of the Bampton Lecturer , by showing that the opposite doctrines would , if logically carried out , lead to the absurdity of atheism . To this postscript Mr. // Mansel published a reply , vindicating his doctrine against the conclusions which had been drawn from it . To this reply Mr. Smith aiiswered in the volume entitled " Rational Religion , " which drew from Mr. Mansel a second letter , and with this the controversy ended . The discussion was conducted upon both sides with ability . It was not a dispute in regard to individual opinions , but it regarded the very foundations of religion and morality , and presented the last phase of the old controversy between the advocates of reason and those of authority in matters of religion ,  --  between those who have faith in the free thought of man as the means by which he can attain to intelligible and consistent , however incomplete , notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who , denying to him this power , found upon a negative philosophy the doctrine of an incomprehensible God . The opposite tendencies of thought in England at the present time , and the divergence between the two schools of religious philosophy , were distinctly marked by this controversy between men alike eminent in their respective spheres . Mr. Mansel met Mr. Smith 's objections to his views with an appeal to the consent of ecclesiastical authorities ; an appeal to which there could be but one answer . As the champion of the liberal cause , Professor Smith showed that he had cut himself loose from the bonds of ancient error and traditional creeds , while he struck blows of telling effect against those who fight intrenched behind the figments of metaphysics and scholasticism , armed with the weapons furnished from the full armory of human creeds . But the very freedom and vigor with which he contended , - his confidence in the power of reason , his eager impatience of the mere subtleties of metaphysical disputation , - occasionally exposed him to the keen thrusts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputant , as Mr. Mansel . But the opponents were not unequally matched , for if superior skill in the use of metaphysical argument was on the one side , the force of rational conviction was upon the other . In the Lecture on " Some supposed Consequences of the Doctrine of Historical Progress , " Mr. Smith shows the harmony of this doctrine with the truths of Christianity , and the support it derives , not only from the teachings , but also from // the character of Christ , and exposes some of the crudities and errors of the theories of Comte , and of the other Positivists . The portion of this Lecture devoted to the development of the author 's view of the character , teaching , and life of Christ in their relation to the progress of mankind , is a remarkable expression of its author 's character as indicated in its manly freedom of thought , its eloquent dignity of tone , its spiritual insight , and comprehensive wisdom . The concluding Lecture in the volume is a very admirable one on " The Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of print in England , but we trust that it may be reprinted in this country , where it would find a large circle of readers . In 1861 Professor Smith published his essay on Irish History and Irish Character . It is a brief sketch of the history of Ireland , and of the relation between the history and the character of the Irish people , from the earliest period to the present time . This difficult and thorny subject is treated with a fairness of judgment , an historic learning , a sound common sense , and a right feeling , that are not surpassed in the works of any English historian . The essay is a model of condensation and clearness of statement . It is written in a style exceedingly attractive from its simplicity and animation , illumined by the flashes of moral indignation and the pure light of Christian liberality and charity . It is a book for the statesman as well as for the student of history , in the New World as well as in the Old ; for in America half the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal rights , the religious and political freedom , which have been denied them in their own land . Calamity after calamity has driven them into happy exile , and here at length the wrongs of centuries are redressed . The effect of the sudden influx of a people so long misgoverned , and whose progress was arrested at an almost primitive stage , the effect , moreover , of the mingling of so large an element of a race foreign to our own , upon our habits and our institutions , deserve more careful study and consideration than they have received , and this treatise of Professor Smith 's affords means for forming correct opinions of the character of a people that already takes so large a part in the conduct of our political affairs , and in our industrial , social , and domestic life . // The volume called " The Empire " contains a series of letters published in " The Daily News " in 1862 and 1863 , treating of the relations between England and her various colonies and dependencies . The first letter was occasioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precariousness of the existing connection between Canada and England , - and the main argument of the volume is that of Colonial Emancipation . In Professor Smith 's view , the colonies and dependencies of England , with very small exception , are sources , not of strength , but of weakness ; and the present system is maintained , not for the advantage of England , but to the real diminution of her power , for the benefit of a class , and for the gratification of a false pride of empire . The question is one of the most important to England in the whole range of those which relate to her honor , her glory , her prestige , and her prosperity ; and it is not strange that the opinions of Mr. Goldwin Smith are not regarded with favor by the large class who hold the false notion that the glory and power and prosperity of a nation are dependent upon , and synonymous with , the extent of territory over which she holds direct dominion . But to those of juster and more enlightened thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith will not seem unpatriotic or extravagant in arguing that England would be vastly stronger , both in material power and in moral influence , as the mother of free , selfgoverning nations in Canada , in Australia , in New Zealand , or elsewhere , than as the mistress of colonies which she can neither govern well nor sufficiently protect , of colonies which are an annual charge upon her own resources , and whose independence and political and material progress are all alike impeded by their unnecessary connection with her . The prevailing characteristic of this , as of Mr. Smith 's other works , is its philosophic breadth of view and good common sense ; all his books illustrate his own maxim , that " History is a mere string of facts without moral philosophy , and without history philosophy is apt to become a dream . " He stands in the very front ranks of the intelligent , enlightened liberals of England , and his views are indications of the course which public opinion is likely to take , rather than an exposition of its present condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // leaders of thought , and in the definiteness of his opinions on many of the most important subjects of thought it is probable that he stands nearly alone among his own class . He is a liberal by nature and by conviction , in religion and in politics , and has fairly thought his way out of social and political feudalism , and out of that state Church which is its religious complement . Such a man is naturally in sympathy with the principles and objects of American institutions , with the better hopes , purposes , and aspirations of the American people . He has studied history too deeply and with too clear a mind not to recognize that the American state represents , better than any other , a true community ; that it represents , imperfectly it may be , but still in increasing measure , the highest ideal of a state to which human conceptions have attained , - the ideal of a people enjoying freedom under self-imposed law , seekiiig justice in political and social arrangements , and sharing alike the benefits and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part at least , to use his own words , " solved a great problem for humanity ; - the full rights of citizenship have been conferred on a whole people ; a real community has been called into being and American institutions have received that which is the best practical stamp of excellence , - the loyal attachment of a perfectly free people . " Not yet are the results of this great novelty in history fully developed , not yet is the fulfilment of hope ; but even now , in spite of all the calamities which beset and all which still await our , state , the hearts of the lovers of mankind can not fail to be with that nation which more than any other bears in the bark of its fortunes the political and the religious hopes of man . And it is because Mr. Goldwin Smith is not merely a wise political student , but a true lover of mankind , that he has stood firmly by us in our great contest , and fought manfully for us against the bigotry , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assailed in England . Therefore it is that with full confidence he has given us his sympathy and his strength and while other men , professed lovers of liberty and of justice , have failed us , he has striven with unwavering fidelity to rouse the better mind of England , to quicken her nobler instincts , and to waken her to a sense of the wrongs she was inflicting on // us , and the injury she was inflicting on herself , in recklessly loosing the bonds by which the two nations should be indissolubly connected in interest , in respect , and in affection . America is not ungrateful to him who thus serves her , and in serving her promotes the universal cause of liberty and justice . She pays to him the tribute of heartiest gratitude . She welcomes him , not as a stranger , but as a son . In that long distant future when , in the grand federation of the world , the day of lasting peace shall dawn , the name of Goldwin Smith shall be remembered as of one who labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
