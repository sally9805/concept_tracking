txt ART . VIII . - The Election of Representatives Parliamentary and Municipal . A Treatise by THOMAS HARE , ESQ . Third Edition . London : Longman . 1865 . THE constant and apparently irresistible tendency of modern society towards democracy , which is now witnessed throughout Christendom , has banished from the iiilnds of even the most conservative Europeans all hope of successful resistance to the movement . The expectations which were excited by the secession of the Southern States on anti-democratic grounds have been rudely destroyed by the result of the war , and the course of events in Italy and Germany has naturally tended to strengthen the impression already widely diffused , that we are witnessing the last days even of constitutional monarchies , and that the next century will probably see the whole Western world ruled by a numerical majority , exercising its power either through the medium of one man or of an elected assembly . Some of the acutest political thinkers of the day are , accordingly , busily occupied in making preparations for the coming flood . Some , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torrent , making the barrier as strong as possible , and leave the rest to Providence . Others believe that , by a judicious arrangement // of aqueducts , it can not only be prevented from doing any damage , but can be converted into a fertilizing agent of great value . The earlier croakers over the progress of democracy , of whom it may be said , without disrespect , that M. de Tocqueville was the chief , gave up the struggle in despair , and , while deeply impressed with the evils which the government of the majority would , in their opinion , bring on the countries in which it might be established , saw no way of meeting them , and comforted themselves with the reflection that God would take care of society in his own way and at his own time . De Tocqueville did not believe that civil liberty would in any country exist very long without an aristocracy to protect it . But for an aristocracy he knew of no substitute . The liberals of the present day are not so faint-hearted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for preventing the majority , whenever it comes to rule , from having everything its own way . The theory on which these contrivances are generally based is that society is divided into classes , and that the natural state of these classes , like that of Hobbes 's men , is one of war ; that the largest class will , if left to work its will , inevitably eat up the others ; that no moral or legal considerations will have the slightest effect in restraining it , if it is once allowed to get hold of power . They therefore propose , before extending the suffrage , to secure for each class under the constitution a certain share of power , which will enable it to hold its own against the other classes . In other words , the minority is to be protected by the constitution , but what is to protect the constitution we have never seen clearly explained . What the majority would do , in what manner and to what extent it would tyrannize , has never , we believe , been clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Lord Macaulay hinted , in his brilliant though not very weighty attack on James Mill and the utilitarians , and more recently declared openly in a letter to a friend in this country , his belief that this tyranny of numbers would take the shape of wholesale robbery of the rich , either by means of simple confiscation or of heavy discriminating taxation . Others , again , seem to confine it to the legal or moral enforcement of certain standards of propriety iii dress , manners , or opinions . Mr. // J. S. Mill 's apprehensions seem to run in this direction , but he at most only anticipates what some of the Tories consider actually begun. * Foremost amongst those who have undertaken the task of fortifying society against the majority stands Mr. Thomas Hare , an English barrister , who has now for some years devoted himself with great energy and enthusiasm to the task of devising a scheme which he thinks would not only deprive democracy of all its terrors , but would bring the representative system out of its present rude condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human nature will permit . The plan has attracted a great deal of attention in other countries as well as in England , and is urged upon public notice by the author himsell with remarkable persistence . It has also secured the cordial approval of many political philosophers of high standing , such as Mr. J. S. Mill , who are certainly not enemies of democracy . Mr. Hare 's scheme , stripped of details , is an arrangement by which all shades of political opinion would be represented in the legislature , instead of , as now , only one or two sets of opinions . He proposes that , the number of the electoral body having been ascertained , members should be apportioned to it , in the same way that representatives are apportioned to population in this country . The total number of the electors having been divided by the number of members , the quotient are to elect a member , without any regard either to his or their place of residence . All territorial divisions , such as districts or counties , and all corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; numbers only , irrespective of place , are represented . For instance , Wendell Phillips can at present represent nobody in Congress or the State Legislature except the inhabitants of the district in which he is domiciled ; and as the majority of * We remember reading an article in the Quarterly Review , in 1861 , on the social condition of the United States , in which the writer , by way of illustrating the kind of rule the rule of the majority is , mentioned , as " a fact " of which he hap. pened to have personal knowledge , the case of a wealthy man in Boston who had put up a very fine lamp over his front door . " The many , " believing this lamp to he an indication of a desire on the part of the owner to exalt himself above his fellows , at once sent a committee to him to request him to remove it , which he immediately did ! // these are not of his way of thinking , there is no chance of his representing anybody at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anybody in any part of the State or Union might vote for him , and if the sum total of the votes he received equalled the quotieiit required for each representative , he would have a seat . The machinery by which the plan is to be made to work is rather complicated , but its leading features are simple enough . Each candidate has to give notice beforehand to the proper officer of his intention to " run , " paying , say $ 250 , as a guaranty of his good faith . The list of candidates thus registered is duly published before the election , and printed copies provided to voters on application . In making out the list , precedence is given to those who have served already . The voter , before depositing his ballot , erases the names of anybody he pleases , and indicates by figures or otherwise the order in which he wishes to vote for the others ; that is to say , if , on coming to count the votes , it is found that the first candidate has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit of the next in order on the ticket ; if lie has received the requisite number , then to the next ; and so on , until one is reached , if any there be , whose quotient is still not made up . In this way every body of persons , however peculiar or unpopular their opinions , who could in the whole community muster in a certain force , would have at least one representative to speak for them in the legislature . If , for instance , - there being one representative apportioned to every one hundred thousand voters , - the Abolitionists , or any other sect , could collect that number of votes anywhere from Maine to California , they would have one voice in the House of Representatives , and their member they might find where they pleased . What would be gained by this is readily seen . The minority under the present system is represented , but not nearly in proportion to its numbers . In most districts the minority is absolutely unrepresented . For instance , if the minority were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send about two fifths of the members ; as it is , they do not send one tenth , and the House of Representatives , consequently , although it represents the majority , does not fairly reflect the popular sentiment . In so far as Mr. Hare 's plan // would make the representative system more symmetrical , make congresses and parliaments more real and complete representatives *f the whole people , and of all varieties of opinion and feeling , it has our hearty approval . That all opinions have a right to legal expression , as far as is practicable , there is no denying . Of course it would not be practicable , or even desirable , to represent the opinions of single individuals , or of small knots of individuals . That all legislatures would be improved by being made , what they are not at present , centres at which all the currents of the national life , all the popular impulses , aspirations , prejudices , and crotchets even , if you will , would meet , originate , mingle , or at least modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority be ever so weak , the majority can not but be the better for hearing what it has to say for itself . There would be instruction even in its own exposition of its follies . And let it be ever so pig-headed , it could hardly fail to have its range of vision widened by being brought into recognized official contact with its opponents in the legislature . But the main question is , after all , not whether Mr. Hare 's plan , or any other , would make the representative system more logical , or give the minority a more conspicuous field in which to fight its battles or tell the story of its wroiigs , but whether such a plan would furnish the minority with any , even an incomplete , protection against what is called " the tyranny of the majority . " What the nature of that tyranny would be which the minority would suffer from it , more than the majority has suffered from the tyranny of the minority in all countries , has , strange as it may seem , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly odious and vexatious may be safely inferred , however , from the character which is given of the majority by its enemies . We propose to show that , if the majority in a popular government is disposed to tyrannize , there is no way of preventing it except by the use of force ; and , moreover , that , in the long run , a majority which has had the courage and ability to gain power without resorting to violence , or by organized violence simply , is no more likely to tyrannize , and does not tyrannize , any more than any other body of men in whose hands the absolute sovereignty of a country // is lodged . The very arguments which Mr. Hare brings forward to show the necessity of his plan , and the dreadful consequences likely to result from the failure to adopt it , or *something like it , proves that , for all practical purposes , it would be in no respect an improvement on the written constitutions of American States . These the majority of Englishmen , we know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not consider , of any value whatever , inasmuch as the majority make them , and can of course unmake them . Mr. Hare 's scheme has no virtue of its own in it . It must rely for all its efficacy , like every other constitutional arrangement , on the virtue and selfrestraint of those possessing the real sovereignty . Mr. Hare , however , labors under the difficulty by which most European writers are beset , of being unable to conceive of a state of society in which there would be no force or authority outside of the popular will , - no point on which to rest the machinery necessary to keep the majority in check . And yet it is only in such a society that his plan would be needed . If there were a power outside the majority strong enough to see that his plan was carried out , and that the rights of the minority to representation were respected , the same power could protect the minority without representation . 111 any country in which the minority are in danger of oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it derives from the sanction of the majority . But according to Mr. Hare and those who agree with him , the sanction of the majority could not be expected for anything which promised to impede the gratification of its passions . If the xiuajority be what Tories and even many Liberals describe it to be , all attempts to keep it within bounds by mechanical arrangements must be as futile as trying to control a Bengal tiger by moral suasion . Supposing the majority to be - what the opponents of universal suffrage insist that it must be - unscrupulous , reckless , unreflectiug , and needy ; supposing Macaulay 's division of society - the only one which he considered permanent and universal - to exist in a democratic country , the poor and the rich , would the poor be restrained from plundering the rich , which they would be sure to want to do , by the presence in the legislative chamber or constitutional convention of a few // wealthy men defending their own interests by denunciation or argument or entreaty ? Would the poor be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove an annoyance or hindrance , to allow them to stay there ? Suppose they drove them out and restored the electoral divisions , to what tribunal would Mr. Hare have his minority apply for redress ? Or suppose another division of society , also a real one , into the ignorant and intelligent , or , more accurately , into the unlettered and the educated , - say , into laborers , mechanics , and small shopkeepers on the one side , and professional and cultivated men on the other . Suppose the former of these classes - of course the larger - to be what Mr. Hare will tell you it is sure to be ,  --  blinded by prejudice , swayed by passion , unrefiectin g and conceited , distrustful of everybody with more knowledge than itself , - would it be likely to be turned from its course by any speeches which Mr. Hare , or Lord Derby , or Mr. Gladstone , or any other representative of the learned minority , would be likely to deliver to it in the legislature ? If the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the majority from hatching schemes hostile to property , or to high civilization , why should it be sufficient to arrest them by speeches to delegates chosen , as they would surely be , for the single purpose of carrying these schemes into effect ? If the learned could exercise any such influence as this in the legislature , they could exercise it on the country ; and , in fact , if the character of the majority were what we are assured it is , the minority would have to confine itself to appeals to posterity , or " eternal justice , " or " eternal truth . " But the majority would be hardly likely to be terrified into submission or retreat by weapons of this sort . The remaining hypothesis which the friends of Mr. Hare 's scheme have to offer , that its representatives , if they got into the legislature , would be able to defend their constituents by regular parliamentary tactics , it is hardly necessary to discuss . A minority which is so nearly equal to its opponents in numbers , and divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line that it can fairly hope to win them over , or , in other words , take their places , and become the majority itself , can hardly be said to be in any danger of oppression , or need much sympathy // from political philosophers . At the last Pennsylvania election , for example , the minority numbered 285,000 , the majority numbered 300,000 . Now would any candid person believe that these 285,000 stood in any danger of oppression from the 300,000 ? that it would he possible for the latter to frame and carry any measure or series of measures into effect having for their object the spoliation or vexation of the 285,000 ? If any such thing were attempted , of course a thousand considerations would arise to carry over 15,000 or 20,000 of the majority to the other side ; or if not , the resisting power of the minority would be so developed by vexation , or fear , or despair , that it would be more than a match for its necessarily less energetic or determined enemy . A large minority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could hope to win in a regular parliamentary fight , does not need any bulwarks for its protection which it does not possess iu abundance already . A small minority , on the other hand , which could not hope for victory in a regular parliamentary contest , might , in our opinion , for all practical purposes , be just as well unrepresented as represented , provided always that the press be free . Suppose it had been determined twenty years ago by the majority in the United States to gag the Abolitionists , - to condemn them to silence under pain of fine and imprisonment , - the latter immbering in all say one million ; would the presence of Mr. Garrison and Mr. Phillips in Congress , and of eight others like them , have offered any material obstacle to the passage of the measure ? They would no doubt have uttered some splendid and stirring protests against such tyranny , and we admit that such protests would not have been utterly thrown away . They would have been fine contributions to the literature of liberty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as much effect out of doors , would have been heard just as widely , and would have produced just as great result . That the immediate result would have been very valuable , we do not assert ; a majority , without conscience or scruples or * it must a in be remembered that we are not talking of a*state of thinbs such as exists in France , where the legislature is the only place in which speech is free , but of a democratic republic , to the existence of which for a single year free speech is an essential condition . // sense of decency , is not likely to be much influenced by the eloquence of its victims . The assertion that , if the press be free , a small minority would , for all practical purposes , be just as well off unrepresented as represented , may at first sight seem a very bold one . But it is , on the showing of those who are most solicitous about the safety of the minority , strictly accurate . For the reasons already given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish anything , or that their speeches would have a weight in congress or parliament which elsewhere they could not have . Legislative debates are becoming every year in every country of less and less consequence . In the English Parliament debating powers are now of very little value compared with what they were fifty years ago . Votes are rarely changed by speeches . This may be said with still greater accuracy of debates in Congress . In the days when meetings were unknown , and when newspapers did not exist , or existed only to record the gossip of taverns and coffee-houses , the legislature was the only place in which a full and fair discussion of the merits of a policy or measure , by the best minds of the nation , could take place . It contained the *lite of the population ; the public behind it was comparatively ill-informed and unrefiecting . But in our day the circumstances are totally changed ; the multitude of books and periodicals is so great , that no question of morals or politics or religion can ever present itself without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every possible light by thousands of writers , whose observations are laid before the whole public within a few hours of their appearance in print , and become the theme of discussion in every household . Everybody has something to say upon them , and says it with a knowledge of the facts and arguments which a century ago only very few could boast . The consequence is , that a measure of importance is rarely introduced into Congress until the principles on which it is based have received a thorough sifting at the hands of the public , and until every member of the legislature has read in his home every argument that can be produced for or against it . His speech in the house is simply a pro forma rehearsal of propositions with which everybody is familiar , and on which nearly // everybody 's mind is made up . The other members are sure to have heard them , and to have come to a decision as to their value . Legislatures in our day are , therefore , rather machines for giving formal expression to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is formed by the country , the legislature simply registers it . The latter performs one other function of great value , no doubt , but still of secondary importance , that of a school in which public men are trained in the transaction of public business , and in which an opportunity is afforded to the country of judging of what stuff they are made . But so far as the formation of public opinion and the fate of measures submitted to the legislature is concerned , the speechmaking on the floor counts for very little . It must be remembered we are not arguing against the probability of Mr. Hare 's scheme improving the character of public men , or diminishing electoral corruption , or increasing the popular interest in politics , or lessening the violence of party feeling . It might do all of this and more , although there is something to us very singular in the simplicity with which , after showing that it is the vices and defects of human nature which render necessary his " perfect " system , as he does not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , on the virtue and selfrestraint of these very sinful mortals that his system must depend for its success . It may be a great help to good government to have members represent unanimous quotients , " rather than discordant territorial divisions ; but the goodness or badness of the member will after all depend on the character of those who compose the quotient . There will , under any system of election , still be parties ; and parties in a free country will always consist of a majority and a minority , no matter in what way the voting may be arranged ; the character of the party will be formed by the character of the individuals of whom it is made up . There are in New York City , for example , one hundred thousand voters . They send , say , twenty members to the municipal government . Suppose these twenty members , instead of being elected by wards , were elected under Mr. Hare 's plan , each by a squad of five hundred unanimous voters . We should then have in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words , a // The Tyrar*ny of the Majority . " perfect " instead of an imperfect representation . According to Mr. Hare and John C. Calhoun , whom he quotes with reverence on almost every page , we should now witness a wonderful state of things . " Each division of the constituents , in order to advance its own peculiar interests , would have to conciliate all the others , by showing a disposition to advance theirs ; and for this purpose , each would select those to represent it whose wisdom , patriotism , and weight of character would command the confidence of the others . Under its influence and with representatives so well qualified to accomplish the object for which they were selected , the prevailing desire would be to promote the common interests of the whole ; and hence the competition would be , not which should yield the least to promote the common good , hut which would yield the most . " - p. 234 . Most people will , on reading this passage , naturally ask on what Mr. Hare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any circumstances in the saintly manner above described . The new system of representation , let it be ever so good in itself , will not change men 's natures ,  --  will not make the corrupt pure , the selfish public-spirited , the foolish wise . Why , therefore , should the majority elect its best and ablest men to the legislature when it comes to vote by quotients , any more than when it votes by districts ? Because , according to Mr. Hare , the minority , being always fully represented , instead of , as now , totally excluded , would offer such a formidable opposition , either by its speeches or its votes , that the majority would be compelled to conciliate it , or , in other words , to " compromise , " in order to carry any of its measures ; and the work of compromise , all would perceive , could be best done by those in whose character friends as well as foes had most confidence . The fallaciousness of this is apparent to anybody who has paid close attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An unscrupulous majority seeks to conciliate a minority only when the minority is so large that there is danger that any abuse of power on the other side may convert it into a majority , or lead to physical resistance , as in the case we have supposed in Pennsylvania ; or when the consent of the miuority is necessary to the passage of certain measures , as when a two-thirds vote is required by our own Constitution . // In both these cases a minority is just as well off under our system as under Mr. Hare 's . In the first , Mr. Hare can add nothing to the defences the minority already possesses ; in the second , the veto possessed by the minority must have originated in the consent of the majority , and must depend for its maintenance on the forbearance of the majority . So that under all circumstances we have to rely , in the last resort , no matter what checks we may devise , on the good sense and good feeling of the greater number . The twelve Councilmen elected under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscrupulous rascals they now are , and would have things their own way as they now have , unless the minority of eight were furnished by the State Legislature , or some other power outside the municipal system , with extra powers of resistance . In so far as it depended on its own moral influence , its failure would be just as signal in the one case as in the other . " In order , " says Mr. Hare , " to complete that constitutional security which depends on a real , and not on a nominal partition of power , the representative body should be composed of every distinct variety and combination of thought , of sentiment , of feeling , of opinion , and of interest which exist in the constituent multitude . All these diversities form so many pillars to support and give unity to the constitutional edifice . If the representative body be the creature of numerical majorities , the constitution will be ultimately drawn into the vortex to which governments by such majorities are exposed . In such a case Mr. Calhoun cautions the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party in possession of the ballot-box and the physical force of the country could be successfully resisted by an appeal to reason , truth , justice , or the obligations imposed by the constitution . " - p. 233 . Here we see it taken as an indisputable fact , that the majority , if it finds itself in possession of power , will abuse it grossly , and that there will in such case be absolutely no remedy for its oppression . It will not only be as bad , but worse , than most despots , - a kind of many-headed Caligula , insensible to " reason , truth , justice , or the obligations imposed by the constitution . " Now how does Mr. Hare propose to meet this difficulty ? Simply by giving the minority a full representation in the legislative body . The measures passed would then be passed by a majority of all , or of two chambers representing // two different classes , or what Mr. Calhoun calls a " concurrent majority . " This simply means , however , that Mr. Hare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights on arguments addressed to men whom he has just pronounced insensible to reason , on the forbearance of men whom he has just declared insensible to justice , and on the respect for constitutional forms of men whom he assures us would , the minute they got hold of power , pay no regard whatever to their constitutional obligations . A majority utterly devoid even of the moral sense would , lie would have us believe , lay aside their most cherished schemes of violence or oppression , until such times as they could get the consent of the minority to their own spoliation . Now a constitution must be framed in the first instance either by a majority or a minority of the population who are to live under it . If framed by the minority , it must be because the minority is in possession of the physical force ; and as long as it can keep possession of the physical force , of course all provisions it may make in the constitution for its own safety are so many superfluous forms , of much the same value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bad character of the majority can of course be best guarded against as they are guarded against iii England , arid have been guarded against in all other countries in the world , by excluding the majority from all share in the government . But if the minority can do this , they can very well dispense with constitutional protection altogether . If it can not do this , it becomes at once dependent for the enjoyment of its rights on the good-will of the majority ; or would , in short , have to trust itself to that reasonableness and love of truth and justice of which Mr. Hare denies the existence . Mr. Hare 's plan , and , we may add , Mr. Calhoun 's plan , for restraining the majority , is very like that of a traveller on a prairie , who , well knowing that his companions were robbers or murderers , should , in order to protect himself against them , frankly communicate to them his opinion of their character , and , having induced them to sign an agreement not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . Shuffle time cards as you may , however , the pack remains the same . // Abolish privilege , disregard tradition , and commit to the people of a country the shaping of their own government , and you must let the majority do pretty much as it pleases . You may deny ever so stoutly that it has any conscience or sense of honor or justice , but to its honor and justice you must in the last resort trust everything . You can not keep from it the secret of its strength ; and once it knows it , you are at its mercy . The most cunningly devised provisions for the protection of the few must , after all , derive their whole force from the willingness of the many to let the few alone . In times of excitement , when great questions are agitated , when the divisions between the two great parties become so deep and wide that argument has ceased to make conversions , and the stronger of the two is tempted either by passion , or confidence in the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , the few undoubtedly very often stand sorely in need of some more effectual protection than appeals to the reason of their opponents . If political philosophers would provide us with some check or restraint which would be operative at such crises , they would confer a great benefit on the world . But they neither do this , nor profess to be able to do it . Mr. Hare and Mr. Calhoun both tell us that at such times nothing can restrain the majority . Not only will it set justice at defiance , but also the constitution ; so that what Mr. Hare offers us is in fact a bit which will keep the animal under perfect control as long as it is pleased to stay under control , but will prove perfectly useless in case it should take it into its head to plunge or run away . We are far from denying that the possession of uncontrolled power is full of temptation for the many , as well as for the few . We share in the general desire felt by all thoughtful and farseeing men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the prevailing creed , whether political or religious or social , the utterers of unpopular speeches , the weak , the poor , the odd and outlandish - complete freedom and imInunity ; but this is tantamount to saying that we long for the reign of pure justice . It will be time enough , however , to reproach democracy with not having established this regime when we witness it under some other form of government . The lamentations of Mr. Calhoun or Mr. Hare , and man // other modern writers , over the tyranny of the majority , would seem much more reasonable , if they were able to point out to us a single country of ancient or modern times in which a minority in power had made a display of those virtues which are so rigidly exacted from the majority . There are three ways of finding out what kind of government the government of the majority is likely to be in any modern nation . One is a priori , by a deduction from principles of huinaii nature ; another is induction from the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . Mr. Calhoun , who is Mr. Hare 's great authority on the tenden*ies of democracy , and nine out of ten English writers on the philosophy of politics , rely almost exclusively on the second of these methods , and the particular portion of history on which they draw most abundantly is , we need hardly say , that of ancient Greece . This is due somewhat to the prominent part played by the Greeks in the production of the ideas on which the polity of all Western nations is based , and in a greater degree to the large share of the literature of antiquity in modern education . But , unfortunately , there are two conclusive reasons why ancient history can not afford us much aid in speculating on the political tendencies of modern society . The one is , that we know very little about the democratic states of antiquity , - enough , perhaps , to whet the curiosity of studious men , but no more . We get from the extant Greek writers but a very shadowy outline of ancient Greek society and government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we knew twice as much as we do of the phenomena of ancient society , it would be difficult , if not impossible , to decide in what proportion the form of government and the state of civilization , the religion , and the influence of su'rrounding communities entered into the production of these phenomena . When a man talks of the follies or excesses of the Athenian democracy as the result of " the rule of the many , " he shows that he has still to master the very rudiments of political science . It seems to be taken for granted by most conservative philosophers , that , whatever effect the advance of civilization , the spread of Christianity , and the growth of sentiments of justice and humanity may have on the few , the many always re // main impervious to these influences . Of the wide interval , moral and intellectual as well as material , which separates the life of republican Athens from that of republican America , they take no account whatever . It is enough for them that the two republics had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ; the thousand points of difference between Athenian and American or English society they treat as if they did not exist . For instance , the experience of very small communities , as everybody knows , is of very little use to a large one . A party in a small community is almost always a faction . The knowledge which every man possesses of his neighbors , and the large part played in politics by particular families , give local differences of opinion the character of regular feuds , and give party spirit a bitterness and an intensity which in a large community would be impossible . Everybody who has studied well the history of the ancient Greek states , or of the states of medieval Italy , or even who has watched the workings of municipal governments in our own day , is very familiar with this effect of mere size on the spirit with which a community carries on its political contests . But one hardly ever sees it noted in conservative speculations upon the probable use a majority would make of its power in countries like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rancor , unscrupulousness , bigotry , and indifference to considerations of justice and humanity , which were so often displayed by the majorities of little states like Athens or Corinth , would be displayed in our own time by republics numbering as many millions as the Greek states numbered thousands of inhabitants . It was not the government of the majority which made the ancient or medieval republics what they were , - which gave tone to their public life , or character to their policy . The civilization of the age did something , the character of the states by which they were surrounded did something , their religion did something , and their antecedents and traditions did something . But who is competent to set down on paper an accurate calculation of the part played by each of these agencies in shaping any one feature in the national life ? Which of us would attempt , even with the far more complete knowledge which we // possess of modern nations , to account accurately for the social and political conditions of any one of them ,  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he is called upon for an analysis of the character or genius of any people , that the elements which enter into the composition of national life are so subtile , so minute , so varied , and so recondite , that neither study nor insight can qualify one to give more than a very partial and incomplete answer , to say with even more than an approach to correctness in what proportions origin , or climate , or government , or laws , or religion , or history , have contributed to the formation of any national trait . And if we understand so little about what lies before our eyes , with what hes*tation should anybody laying claim to the character of a philosopher attempt to draw on ancient sources for aid in predicting modern phenomena ? If we were to argue that , because Xerxes attempted to chain the sea. , or C aligula had himself worshipped as a god , the French or Russian throne would be sure to be occupied before long by bloodthirsty and crazy tyrants , over whom neither religion nor humanity nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at . We should be told that , although the influence of absolute power on human character was still corrupting , modern civilization differed so greatly from the civilization of the ancient world , that no man born under the former could be guilty of the excesses and cruelties and follies which , under the latter , were very common ; that absolutism , like everything else , changes with the ages ; that , to judge what kind of government a monarchy is likely to furnish in any particular country , it is not enough to know that the monarch is absolute , and a man . You have to study the character of his time , the ideas of the people he is to rule , their manners , their education , their religion , and their history . And this one must do , also , who undertakes to discover the tendencies or dangers of modern democracy . That such and such things happened in any other republic , is but a very small , insignificant portion of the data on which a theory may be constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political economists , as well as the political philosophers , have an ideal man , who has the same hopes , fears , and desires , virtues and defects , in all // ages and under every sky , and is supposed to behave with scientific uniformity under all circumstances ; but the actual man is not so adaptable . Macaulay made very merry over Mr. J. S. Mill 's attempt to deduce from this ideal the probable conduct of monarchs and oligarchs , and pointed out with great shrewdness the extent to which the kings and lords of ordinary life were affected by agencies of which the philosophers took no count ; but he did not hesitate himself to reason in just the 0 same way about the majority , which is after all simply a certain number of mcii acting together . Can there be any justification for the Calhoun-Hare theory , deduced from principles of human nature ? We think not . The world has been governed for many ages on the theory that the larger portion of every community was desperately wicked , and only restrained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enlightened few . This theory owed its origin in the desire of class governments , founded on force , to provide a moral reason for their existence . There was not a state in Europe at the close of the last century , except Switzerland and Scandinavia , in which the actual political regime was not based on conquest or brute force ,  --  in which either the monarch or the nobles did not carry their title to power in their scabbards . In the earlier days , superiority of force was an abundant justification for using it . The " good old rule , the simple plan , " was the fundamental law of politics . That a man was able to subdue a country , was taken in a rough way by the community , though perhaps never completely by the Church , as proof of his right to rule it . As the doctrines of abstract morality begami to gain force , and the necessity of showing the justice of one 's acts became more pressing , sovereigns and nobles laid aside the character of conquerors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude . They represented themselves , and most of the publicists of the fifteenth , sixteenth , seventeenth , ar 'd eighteenth centuries backed up their theory , as a kind of framework for society , the destruction or removal of which would lead to instant and complete anarchy . The ignorance and degradation of the people , and the restlessness with which they bore laws which they had no part in making , and which were generally framed , partly at least , with a // view to their spoliation and oppression , lent a certain color of support to the aristocratic description of their character . And joined with this gloomy picture of their moral condition was a still gloomier one of their mental capacity . The poets and orators and historians had difficulty in finding words strong enough to describe their cowardice , meanness , servility , and want of enterprise . Nine tenths of the population of Europe were for ten centuries , in the estimation of the upper classes , " base lackey peasants , " of whom nothing good could be said . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became gradually a synonyme for rascality of the deepest dye . For many ages there was nothing better established in European political philosophy than that , if the king or the country gentlemeii withdrew their protecting hand for a day , the peasants and bourgeoisie would do nothing but plunder , ravage , and slay . And this theory of popular morals lasted long after the " divine right " had been shaken or abandoned . It has lasted in most countries in Europe down to our day , and has colored the speculations of some of the most learned and candid writers of our time . The truth is , however , that , if this were a correct account of the disposition of the majority , civilization would have become extinct long ago in every country in the world , or , to speak more accurately , would never have existed in any country . We owe civilization , not to any one man 's genius or authority , but to what may be called the social and constructive instincts of the race . Society itself- the living together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices-was not invented by anybody in particular : it was the result of a natural impulse felt by all . Of the " natural man " we know nothing , except what we fish out of the romantic portion of the writings of Hobbes . If there ever was a time when the race was torn by anti-social passions , there remains no trace of it in history . However far back we go , we find , not the minority , but the majority of men eager for the society of their fellows , unable to live without it , and cheerfully submitting to all the sacrifices and incurring all the obligations which it imposes . If the great mass of men iii every community were not , and had not been from the earliest times , and in the very worst // times , animated by respect for property and law , society could not have held together . In fact , the history of society , or at least of modern European society , is the history of the efforts of the majority to substitute law for force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and wrong . The enemies of society , that is , of the enjoyment by every man of the fruits of his toil , and of the gratification of his social and domestic affections , and of the development of his faculties , have always been a minority , and a small minority . The curse of the majority , the thing which has blasted its reputation , and which has caused it to play the inferior and eveii ignoble part assigned it in history , has been the difficulty it has always had in organizing or combining , - a difficulty inseparable from its size , and which has always made it an easy prey to the minority . The town communities of the Middle Ages - which were the first examples of equal rights , and of respect of persons and property without regard to the antecedents or station of the individual - furnish a splendid illustration of the way in which the popular instinct , the instinct of accumulation , works . There is no impulse implanted in human nature so strong and constant as the impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's industry for the purpose of procuring future enjoyment . In any country in which it becomes weak , or dies out , barbarism and anarchy instantly follow ; but if there have been any examples of such a calamity , they have been very rare . On the contrary , so powerful and steady a force has this impulse been in nearly all countries , that it has carried civilization steadily forward through every variety of social and political vicissitude , and has enabled society to survive wars , famines , pestilences , - every evil which the cruelty of man or inclemency of nature could inflict on it . Monarchs and oligarchies have in all ages wasted and destroyed ; the many have toiled on , steadily repairing the loss , and increasing the world 's store of good things and valuable experiences , showing by every movement that their very strongest passion was the passion for property , and showing by the whole tendency of modern progress ( which many writers constantly forget is the work of the many ) that the great peculiarity of democracy // is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for excessive individualizing , for over partition of rights , for giving to each man immunities and privileges which have in past ages belonged to classes only . We may safely challenge any candid investigator to declare whether , iii this country , there is not amongst the majority a growing indisposition to use its power , - a growing tendency to leave things to nature , rather than regulate them by comprehensive legislation ; and whether there is not to be witnessed in political life an increasing difficulty in keeping majorities together , and in preventing their dissolution either after the first success or the first defeat . A majority bent on spoliation , and indifferent to reason , justice , generosity , or constitutional obligations , is something , in fact , of which it is as difficult to conceive in our day and generation , as of a conbrcss capable of ordering captive women and children to be put to the sword . That an untried , inexperienced , or ignorant majority may , on suddenly finding itself in possession of power , abuse it grossly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a majority in a large and Christian community is likely to persevere in any such course . In talking of a majority as the depositary of the sovereign power , we of course compare it with either an oligarchy or a monarchy ; and its temporary excesses or mistakes we shall consider proofs of its unfitness to rule , when we are shown the guaranties by which an aristocracy or a king is kept permanently wise and enlightened . To admit that majorities may be guilty of misgovernment , is simply to admit that they are composed of men . What we claim for them is as great sensibility to considerations of justice and humanity and sound policy as any other holders of power . We maintain that they are just as open to conviction , just as easily moved by argument or entreaty , just as full of sympathy for the weaknesses of men , and just as full of tolerance for differences of opinion . People who talk of " the tyranny of the majority " seem to forget that the first government in the modern world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of intolerance called a " state church , " that is , a church of a portion of the community supported by contributions levied on all , and the first to recognize in the fullest extent the absolute // right of individuals in their property , by removing as far as possible all artificial difficulties in the way of a free disposition of it , has been a government of the majority . The three things in which a minority finds itself most exposed to attack are property , religion , and social consideration ; and singular a it may seem , the United States is , of all countries in the civilized world , that in which the law meddles least in a man 's disposal of his possessions , in which religious worship is freest from legislative control or interference , and in which a man 's religious or other opinions , his manners , his calling or mode of life , expose him to least reproach from his neighbors . There is probably nothing more curious in the whole history of speculation , than the persistence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facts , and with which they continue to hold up America as a warning to the minority in their own country , - a minority which treats dissent as a crime , and punishes it by civil and social disability , and makes the most honest callings a ground of social disgrace and discredit . Granted that all this is the result of feudalism ; but what was or is feudalism but an elaborate contrivance for perpetuating the government of the few ? Every artificial restraint on the use of a man 's faculties , every obstacle opposed by law or custom to his filling any position in politics or society for which his natural qualities fit him , or to his buying or selling property of any kind , is in a certain sense oppression , and evinces a disregard of individual rights , or , at all events , the subordination of individual rights or tastes to the prejudices or tastes or interests of the greater number . It is nevertheless true that the most deniocratic countries are those in which fewest of these exist . And although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first conceived and all great reforms first proposed by the few , it is equally true that they could never have accomplished anything for the human race , if the majority had not been what Messrs . Hare and Calhoun deny it to be , - open to conviction , ready to receive the truth , and disposed to admire justice . All great abuses have perished out of the land , not simply because the few denounced them , but because the many were willing to hear and be won over . Take the case of witchcraft , - an cxtreme // and perhaps even grotesque case , we admit , but still sufficiently apt for our purpose . There was a time , and it lasted many ages , when the mass of every conitmunity were disposed to suspect all plain-looking old women of being magicians , and hundreds of them expiated every year their fancied guilt at the stake and on the scaffold . On Mr. Hare 's theory , the only hope for this unfortunate class would have lain in their being represented in the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end from the growth of the majority in knowledge and humanity . Witches ceased to be burned or hanged when the majority , by becoming more enlightened , ceased to believe in witchcraft . IReligious toleration , the improvement in the condition of prisoners , the mitigation of the horrors of war , and a hundred other reforms , have been brought about , not by the direct agency of a few reformers , but by the success of reformers in persuading the majority into their way of thinking . The cases are very few indeed where a righteous cause has been won by a courageous and enlightened few in open hostility to a malevolent , ignorant , or bigoted majority . The greatest individual benefactors of mankind have been those who gave expression to a popular opinion , or showed the majority the way to the goal it already longed to reach . Some of the results of the prevalent tendency of the " intellectual aristocracy " to worship the minority would be painful , if they were not ludicrous . Even such minds as that of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , are liable to be thrown into the most lamentable confusion by the traditional faith in the weakness and ignorance of the majority of one 's fellow-creatures or countrymen . Mr. Maurice , in his late work on " The Workingman and the Franchise , " is betrayed by this prejudice into an apparent forgetfulness of the distinction between right and wrong , and gives way to his feelings in the extraordinary asseveration , " that , so help him God , he does not mean to follow the will of the majority ; that he hopes never to foilow it , always to set it at naught " ; * - which means simply that , right or wrong , he will stick to the minority . In other words , that he will be guilty of the very same species of humorality // which is constantly imputed to the worshippers of mere numbers . A superstitious and unreasoning obedience to the minority is of course just as great an offence against God and society as a superstitious and unreasoning obedience to the majority ; and that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very remarkable illustration of the power of tradition . We see traces of the influence of the dogma that minorities are always right , or at least far more likely to be right than majorities , even amongst ourselves , where the majority lies under some of the discredit which attaches to it in Europe . A great many tolerably sensible men flatter themselves that the mere fact of their holding opinions different from those of the majority of their neighbors creates a strong presumption that they must be nearer the truth ; but it creates nothing of the kind . The number of people who hold an opinion proves nothing whatever as to its truth or falsehood . Even in a calculation of probabilities , based on the facts of history , we fear the minority would gain not a whit more credit for wisdom than the multitude . There have no doubt been many shining examples of the discovery of truths by the few before the many were prepared for them ; but in calculating probabilities , we have also to take count of the delusions hatched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets and coteries , who in their day and generation conceived themselves the sole depositaries of the priceless gem , but whose creeds and keys have all passed into the same oblivion with themselves . " To be one with God " is often spoken of amongst us as a very fine thing ; but being alone in our opinions renders us no more likely to be with God , than having thousands of our fellows at our back . To agree with a million may call for less courage than to agree with two ; but God is just as likely to be with the million as with the two . There is nothing in history more curious than the attempts of lecturers and philosophers and " scholars " and " gentlemen " and statesmen to save the human race from itself . For ages back a learned minority has constantly and solemnly been announcing that society was going to the dogs , that the " demos " was going to devour itself alive , and that the end was near . In the Middle Ages " the end " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it means " the reign of anarchy , " an equal division of goods , closing with the retreat of the whole civilized world to the almshouse . In the United States the last hope of government and society used to lie in the South . If the Northern numerical majority ever got the upper hand , civilization itself was to disappear . The numerical majority has got the upper hand , and life is still sacred as ever ; the laborer still enjoys the fruits of his toil ; the schoolhouses and churches are still crowded , and society remains a firmly welded together as of old . In England , the terrible moment when the majority are to get hold of power is apparently at hand , and " the few " are in great alarm about property and civilization . The press teems with devices for taming the coming monster or driving him away . The Church dignitaries are all preaching against him , and the dinnertables are all talking against him , and the House of Commons rings with accounts of his beastly tastes and propensities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the many . " Mr. Maurice , as he says in the work from which we have already quoted , may not understand " what is meant by the greatest happiness of the greatest number " ; but " the greatest number , " having pursued that happiness in the teeth of every obstacle for countless generations , and having founded society and civilization for the purpose of aiding it , is not likely now to give up the quest in despair . It is filled with the idea that the possession of the government in all countries is necessary to the completion of its work . It may be mistaken , but the experiment will assuredly be tried ; and we confess , for our part , we think the world , having watched the blundering and brutality of the minority for two thousand years , can very well afford to stand by and see what the majority can do . There could hardly be a finer illustration of the strength and trustworthiness of the social instinct of the race , than the way in which the multitude has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule wisely , refrained from ruling at all . The desire of every ignorant or uncivilized people is not for the government of the greatest number , but of a leader or leaders . The clansman follows after his chief , the serf after the Czar the half-feudal and half-commercial nations worship the king . // When a community deliberately desires power to be lodged in the hands of the majority of its own members , it will generally be found to have reached that stage of knowledge and civilization in which the government of the many is possible . The reaction which followed 1793 and 1848 in France was simply the sorrowful confession of the people that their political and moral education was not yet sufficiently advanced for a democratic republic . The efforts that some European politicians make , therefore , to stem the democratic tide , in the interest of society , remind us of those opponents of emancipation in this country who justified slaveholding on the ground that it helped the Almighty to fulfil his curse on the children of Ham . God may be safely left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has not , we may be sure , committed society or civilization to the care either of church , or king , or the Universities , or the House of Commons , or any of the hundred little " leagues " and " associations " of sages which are constantly set on foot here and in England for the salvation of the deluded majority . We may say of democracy , as was once said of a still mightier movement , " If this counsel or work be of men , it will come to naught ; but if it be of God , ye can not overthrow it .
