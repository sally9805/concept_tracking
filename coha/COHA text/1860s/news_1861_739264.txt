txt . It is stated by the Memphis Bulletin that the low- estimate put upon Tennessee bonds in the Stock market , " is a mere ruse of Northern capitalists to crippleTennessee during the war , " that " they will command as much at boat as the bonds of any other State , North or South , and are really worth as much , " and that " the $5,000,000 voted by the Legislature will be taken at home at par . " The Bulletin is unversed in matters of finance . Though a combination of brokers , for speculative purposes , may , for a day or two , control in a slight degree the price of a given security , yet the inevitable law of supply and demand will soon place it where it belongs in the financial scale . Tennessee bonds can not sell for par at home and rate at 35 in New-York ; and it is presuming a little too much upon the patriotism or the verdancy of Tennessee capitalists to suppose that they would buy a new issue of the bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which the faith of the State is pledged , can be bought in New-York for 35 .

In anticipation of it , it seems that Gen. Pieeow has assumed the responsibility of levying a tax on the counties . He recently sent one of his officers to Haywood County to collect $50,000 of its citizens as the share of that county in the whole amount . - He was vested with a discretion to apportion the sum among the citizens as he liked , and the amount subscribed by each citizen was to be credited to him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , It would seem that ? t was no remarkable alacrity on the part tirthe Tenness.eeans to Invest . " Gentlemen , " said he , " if you do not meet the demand , I will , with three clicks of the telegraph , summon a regiment here , and it shall be quartered upon you till you pay . " Haywood County is situated near the Mississippi River , where , it is said , the people were almost unanimous in their desire to join in the secession dance . They do not seem to be equally unanimous hi their desire to pay the fiddler .
